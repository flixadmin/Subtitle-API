1
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,480
in this harbor town

2
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,600
layin' whiskey down

3
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,040
fetch another round"

4
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
them whiskey and wine

5
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,360
"Brandy, you're a fine girl"

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
wife you would be"

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,320
EGO: Come on!
MEREDITH:
 Slow down!

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
This way, my river lily!
Come on!

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
Look. Look!

12
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, it's beautiful!

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,240
EGO: I was afraid
it wouldn't take
to the soil...

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
but it rooted quickly.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,480
And soon,
it'll be everywhere.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,680
All across the universe.

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,800
but I like the way
you say it.

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
My heart is yours...

20
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,480
Meredith Quill.

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,880
I can't believe
I fell in love
with a spaceman.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,480
(MUSIC FADING UP,
"BRANDY (YOU'RE A FINE GIRL")

23
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Showtime, a-holes!

24
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,560
It will be here any minute.

25
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,520
Which will be its loss.

26
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,240
I thought your thing
was a sword?

27
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,560
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
from feeding on
those batteries,

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,200
and I'm gonna stop it
with a sword?

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
It's just,
swords were your thing
and guns were mine.

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,360
But I guess we're
both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,880
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

33
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
It hurts.

34
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
It hurts?

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,760
I have sensitive nipples.

36
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,680
"My nipples hurt!
Oh, goodness me!"

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,560
What about him?
What's he doing?

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,040
I'm finishing
this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,520
How is that
a priority?

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,080
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,760
No, I actually agree
with Drax on this.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
That's hardly
important right now.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,760
Oh, okay.
Sure, Quill.

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,800
No, seriously,
I side with Drax.

45
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,280
No, I understand that.
You're being very
serious right now.

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
I can clearly
see you winking.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,200
Damn it.
I'm using my left eye?

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,360
I am Groot.

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,800
They were not
looking at you funny.

50
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,120
Well, that's intense.

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Groot!

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,040
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

53
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Hi.

54
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,920
No! Spit it out!

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
Come on!

56
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,680
Disgusting!

57
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,240
The beast's hide
is too thick to be
pierced from the outside.

58
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,520
I must cut through it
from the inside.

59
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,720
Huh?

60
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,240
No, no!
Drax, wait a minute!

61
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Drax!

62
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
What is he doing?

63
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,400
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from
the outside, so he...

64
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
That doesn't make any sense!
I tried telling him that!

65
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,680
Skin is the same
level of thickness

66
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,040
from the inside
as from the outside!

67
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,760
I realize that.

68
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,520
There is a cut
on its neck.

69
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,920
Rocket, get it to look up.

70
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey!
Up here!

71
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,200
Watch it, Quill!

72
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
Yes!
I have single-handedly...

73
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,440
vanquished the beast!

74
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
What?

75
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,960
What are they called again?

76
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,880
Anulax batteries.

77
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,240
Harbulary batteries.

78
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,720
That's nothing
like what I just said.

79
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,680
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

80
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

81
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
Careful what you say
around these folks.
They're easily offended.

82
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
The cost of
transgression
is death.

83
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,640
AYESHA:
We thank you, Guardians,

84
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,680
for putting your
lives on the line.

85
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,840
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

86
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,560
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed
by the community.

87
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.

88
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,320
We control the DNA
of our progeny...

89
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,720
germinating them
in birthing pods.

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,360
I guess
I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.

91
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,080
Perhaps someday,
you could give me
a history lesson...

92
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,720
in the archaic ways
of our ancestors.

93
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,000
For academic purposes.

94
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
I would be honored, yes.

95
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
In the name of research...

96
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,840
I think that could be
pretty, uh...

97
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,240
repulsive.

98
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,520
I'm not into that
kind of casual...

99
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,720
Oh, please.

100
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,200
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

101
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,680
Bring it...

102
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
and we shall
gladly be on our way.

103
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,800
Family reunion. Yay.

104
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
I understand
she is your sister.

105
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,880
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due
for her on Xandar.

106
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,440
Our soldiers apprehended
her attempting to steal
the batteries.

107
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,400
Do with her
as you please.

108
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,680
We thank you,
High Priestess Ayesha.

109
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
What is your heritage,
Mr. Quill?

110
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,400
My mother is from Earth.

111
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,480
And your father?

112
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

113
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,600
I see it within you.

114
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
An unorthodox genealogy.

115
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
A hybrid that
seems particularly...

116
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,240
reckless.

117
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
You know,
they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

118
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
but that isn't
true at all.

119
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
ROCKET: Oh, shit.

120
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,200
I'm using my
wrong eye again,
aren't I?

121
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm sorry.
That was meant to be
behind your back.

122
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,400
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

123
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,280
You're telling me.

124
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,520
You wanna buy some batteries?

125
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,800
ROCKET: All right,
let's get baldy to Xandar

126
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
and collect that bounty.

127
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
That stuff
about my father...

128
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Who does she think
she is?

129
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
I know you're
sensitive about that.

130
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

131
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with
the High Priestess.

132
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,160
I wasn't.

133
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,400
I don't care
if you were.

134
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,360
Well, I feel like you do care.

135
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,920
That's why I'm apologizing.
So, sorry!

136
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,280
Gamora is not
the one for you, Quill.

137
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,200
Damn shadow.

138
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,520
There are two types of beings
in the universe...

139
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
those who dance,
and those who do not.

140
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440
Mmm-hmm.

141
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,640
I first met my beloved
at a war rally.

142
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh, God.

143
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,840
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

144
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,560
Except one woman.

145
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
My Ovette.

146
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,240
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

147
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,040
The most melodic
song in the world
could be playing.

148
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,760
She wouldn't
even tap her foot.

149
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,720
Wouldn't move a muscle.

150
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
One might assume
she was dead.

151
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,240
That does sound
pretty hot.

152
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,400
It would make
my nether regions engorge.

153
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,440
Okay. I get it, yes.

154
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm a dancer,
Gamora is not.

155
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,240
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

156
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Mmm.

157
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,520
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of
that yaro root.

158
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,120
No. It's not ripe yet...

159
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
and I hate you.

160
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
You hate me?

161
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,560
You left me there
while you stole that
stone for yourself.

162
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,880
And yet here
you stand, a hero.

163
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,440
I will be free
of these shackles

164
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,880
soon enough,
and I will kill you.

165
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,560
I swear.

166
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,800
No.

167
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,800
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

168
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,400
in a prison on Xandar...

169
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,000
wishing you could.

170
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
QUILL: This is weird.

171
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,840
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

172
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
GAMORA:
Why would they do that?

173
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,680
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

174
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Dude!

175
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Right.

176
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
He didn't steal some of those.

177
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
I don't know why
they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

178
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,360
What were you thinking?

179
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
Dude, they were
really easy to steal!

180
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,480
That's your defense?
Come on!

181
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,000
You saw how
that High Priestess
talked down to us.

182
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,720
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

183
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,120
Oh, I didn't realize
your motivation was
altruism.

184
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,480
It's really a shame

185
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,720
the Sovereign have mistaken
your intentions...

186
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,560
and they're trying to kill us.
Exactly!

187
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,440
I was being sarcastic!

188
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,640
Oh, no!

189
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,040
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!

190
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Now I look foolish!

191
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
Can we put
the bickering on hold...

192
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,920
until after we survive
this massive space battle?

193
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
QUILL: More incoming!
ROCKET: Good!

194
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,360
I wanna kill some guys!

195
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
GAMORA:
You're not killing anyone.

196
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,480
All those ships
are remotely piloted.

197
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Damn it!

198
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,360
What is the delay,
Admiral?

199
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,640
High Priestess,
the batteries, they are
exceptionally combustible...

200
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,040
and could destroy
the entire fleet.

201
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,840
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

202
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,680
We hired them and
they steal from us.

203
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
It is heresy of
the highest order.

204
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,160
All command modules...

205
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,880
fire with the intent to kill.

206
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
What's the nearest
habitable planet?

207
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,440
It's called Berhert.

208
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,360
How many jumps?
Only one.

209
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,520
But the access point
is 47 clicks away.

210
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,520
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

211
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
Quill, to make it
through that...

212
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,000
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

213
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Lucky for us, I...

214
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,800
I am.

215
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
ROCKET:
What are you doing?

216
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,600
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

217
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,720
I was
cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

218
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,520
You were
cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

219
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Stop it.

220
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Later on tonight,
you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...

221
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,120
and there's gonna
be something squishy
in your pillow case.

222
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,560
And you're gonna be like,
"What's this?"

223
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

224
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,400
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

225
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
Oh, it won't be my turd.

226
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,560
It will be Drax's.

227
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,960
I have famously huge turds.

228
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
We're about to die,
and this is what
we're discussing?

229
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,200
ROCKET: Son of a...

230
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
QUILL: Dude! Seriously!

231
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
ROCKET: Hey! Let me...

232
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,200
Idiots!

233
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,680
Well, that's what you get

234
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,040
when Quill flies.

235
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,480
Ow!

236
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,000
We still have
a Sovereign craft
behind us.

237
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,680
Our weapons are down.

238
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,920
20 clicks to the jump!

239
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Hold on.

240
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
It's not ripe.

241
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
Come on, Zylak.
You can do this.

242
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
Yes!

243
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,880
15 clicks to the jump!

244
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,400
ALL: Come on!

245
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,800
Keep going!

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,240
10 clicks!

247
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,560
Die, spaceship!

248
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
You suck, Zylak.

249
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,800
Typical.

250
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Five clicks!

251
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,880
Son of a...

252
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,200
They went around the field!

253
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,800
Someone destroyed
all our ships!

254
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
What?

255
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,880
Who?

256
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,280
GAMORA: One click!

257
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,160
What is that?
Who cares?

258
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,760
That's the jump point!
Go!

259
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,160
It's a guy.

260
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Oh, my God.

261
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
He's still out there?

262
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,000
QUILL:
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

263
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,160
Prepare for
a really bad landing!

264
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
That was awesome!

265
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Yes!

266
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
GAMORA: Look at this!

267
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,920
Where is the other
half of our ship?

268
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
QUILL: My ship.

269
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,040
GAMORA:
Either one of you
could have gotten us

270
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
through that field...

271
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,360
had you flown with
what's between your ears

272
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
instead of what's
between your legs!

273
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,400
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

274
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,760
I guarantee
I could have landed
this ship with it.

275
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

276
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,240
More like because
he stole...

277
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
the Anulax batteries!

278
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,920
They're called
Harbulary batteries.

279
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,600
No, they're not!

280
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,720
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?

281
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm not gonna
answer to "Star-Munch."

282
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,800
I did it because I wanted to!

283
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Dick.

284
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,760
What are we even
talking about this for?

285
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,600
We just had
a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

286
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
How little?

287
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,840
Well, I don't know, like this?

288
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,640
A little
one-inch man saved us?

289
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,120
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be
much larger.

290
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,480
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

291
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,080
Don't call me a raccoon!

292
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,880
I'm sorry.
I took it too far.

293
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,040
I meant trash panda.

294
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
Is that better?

295
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
I don't know.

296
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,120
It's worse.
It's so much worse.

297
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,320
You son of a...

298
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Hey!

299
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,040
ROCKET: I've had it with you!
QUILL: No! Back up!

300
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,920
NEBULA: Someone followed you
through the jump point.

301
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,120
Set me free,
you'll need my help.

302
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,440
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

303
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
You are a fool if
you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

304
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,880
You'll attack me
the moment I let you go.

305
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,040
No, I won't.

306
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,640
You'd think
an evil supervillain

307
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,280
would learn how
to properly lie.

308
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
I bet it's the
one-inch man.

309
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,240
After all these years,
I've found you.

310
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,680
And who the hell
are you?

311
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,680
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

312
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,080
My name is Ego...

313
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,000
and I'm your dad, Peter.

314
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,840
You know what they say...

315
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,040
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

316
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,120
TULLK: Yondu!

317
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Come on down!

318
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,680
STAKAR: After going around
years in circles...

319
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,680
with this woman
I end up marrying.

320
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,520
I said,
"Aleta, I love you, girl...

321
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
"but you're losing your mind!"

322
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Then again,
she's always been that way.

323
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,160
I could never trust her.
You know?

324
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,440
Stakar.

325
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,400
It's been some time.

326
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
It seems like
this establishment

327
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,440
is the wrong kind
of disreputable.

328
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,560
Sir!
Stakar!

329
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,960
STAKAR: There's a hundred
Ravager factions.

330
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,160
You lost the business
of 99 of them by serving one.

331
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,880
Please, sir. Please!

332
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,400
Get away from me.

333
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,520
You can go to hell then!

334
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,960
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

335
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,080
So what are you
following us for?

336
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,680
Because you're gonna listen
to what I gotta say!

337
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
I don't gotta
listen to nothing!

338
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,560
You betrayed the code!

339
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,560
Ravagers don't deal
in kids.

340
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,640
I told you before!
I didn't know
what was going on!

341
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
You didn't know because

342
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.

343
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
I demand a seat
at the table!

344
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,880
I wear these flames,
same as you.

345
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,040
You may dress like us...

346
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,400
but you'll never hear
the Horns of Freedom

347
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,680
when you die, Yondu.

348
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,720
And the Colors of Ogord...

349
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,320
will never flash
over your grave.

350
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,880
If you think...

351
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,240
I take pleasure
in exiling you...

352
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
you're wrong.

353
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,840
You broke all our hearts.

354
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,760
Ah, pathetic.

355
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,920
First, Quill betrays us...

356
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,360
and Yondu just
lets him go scot-free.

357
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
We followed him
because he was the one...

358
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,320
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed
to be done.

359
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,840
Seems he's goin' soft.

360
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,800
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

361
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,200
You know I'm right,
Kraglin.

362
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,760
You best be very careful
what you say
about our captain.

363
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,480
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?

364
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,240
Yondu Udonta...

365
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,080
I have a proposition for you.

366
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,720
EGO: I hired Yondu
to pick you up...

367
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,920
when your mother passed away.

368
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,920
But instead of
returning you...

369
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,840
Yondu kept you.

370
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,720
I have no clue as to why.

371
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
Well, I'll tell you why.

372
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,760
Because I was
a skinny little kid

373
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,480
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.

374
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,040
It made it
easier for thievin'.

375
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,480
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

376
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,600
DRAX: I thought
Yondu was your father.

377
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,960
What? We've been together
this whole time...

378
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,800
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

379
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,280
You look exactly alike.

380
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,000
One's blue!

381
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,400
No, he's not my father!

382
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,920
Yondu was the guy
who abducted me...

383
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,960
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

384
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,080
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

385
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,640
Eat you?
Yeah.

386
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,800
Oh, that son of a bitch.

387
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
How'd you locate us now?

388
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,200
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge
of what's known...

389
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,800
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.

390
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,200
What say we head
out there right now?

391
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Your associates are welcome.

392
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,640
Even that triangle-faced
monkey there.

393
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
I promise you...

394
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.

395
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,560
And there...

396
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,840
I can explain your
very special heritage.

397
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,880
Finally get to be...

398
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,760
the father I've
always wanted to be.

399
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,720
Excuse me.

400
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,600
I've gotta take a whiz.

401
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm not buying it.

402
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,400
Let's go take a walk.

403
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,640
I am Mantis.

404
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,920
What are you doing?

405
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,480
Smiling.

406
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,880
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

407
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
Not if you do it
like that.

408
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,200
Oh...

409
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,200
I was raised alone
on Ego's planet.

410
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,120
I do not understand
the intricacies of
social interaction.

411
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,040
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.

412
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,920
Yes.

413
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,000
That is called
a practical joke!

414
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,240
I liked it very much!

415
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,080
I just made it up!

416
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
QUILL: Give me a break!

417
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
After all this time,

418
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,240
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...

419
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,160
you wanna be my dad?
GAMORA: I hear you.

420
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,440
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.

421
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,120
The Kree purists,
the Ravagers...

422
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,960
they all want us dead.
I know, but...

423
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,080
But what?

424
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,720
What was that
story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

425
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Who?

426
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,200
He owned a magic boat?

427
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,360
David Hasselhoff?

428
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Right.

429
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,720
Not a magic boat.
A talking car.

430
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,800
Why did he talk again?

431
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,440
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

432
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,200
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

433
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,160
and you would tell
all the other children...

434
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,440
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

435
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,160
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with
his band in Germany.

436
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
I told you that
when I was drunk.

437
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
Why are you
bringing that up now?

438
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,840
I love that story.

439
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,960
I hate that story.

440
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
It's so sad!

441
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,560
As a kid, I used to
see all the other kids

442
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,760
off playing catch
with their dad.

443
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,600
And I wanted that,
more than anything
in the world!

444
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,000
That's my point, Peter.

445
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,760
What if this man
is your Hasselhoff?

446
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,680
If he ends up
being evil...

447
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,720
we will just kill him.

448
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,280
You're leaving me
with that fox?

449
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,640
GAMORA: He's not a fox.

450
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,640
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

451
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,000
Or if you feel like it.

452
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,200
ROCKET: Okay.

453
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,800
It'll be just
a couple of days.

454
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,760
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished
fixing the ship.

455
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
DRAX:
What if the Sovereign come?

456
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,160
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

457
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm uncertain
about parting ways.

458
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
God, you're like
an old woman.

459
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,480
Because I'm wise?

460
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,360
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?

461
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,680
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

462
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,440
I hope Daddy
isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.

463
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,240
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?

464
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,120
Because it's working.

465
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,760
You will never love me again

466
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,040
never break the chain

467
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,680
never break the chain

468
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,720
break the chain

469
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,520
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

470
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Oh...

471
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,800
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

472
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,720
Your antennae,
what are they for?

473
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,440
Their purpose?

474
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,440
Yes. Quill and I
have a bet.

475
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,720
Dude. You're not
supposed to say that!

476
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,760
I say...

477
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,360
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

478
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,280
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from
being decapitated.

479
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,600
QUILL: Right. And if it's
anything other than...

480
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,200
you specifically
not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.

481
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,800
They are not for
feeling doorways.

482
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,760
I think...

483
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,680
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

484
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
What are those?

485
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,920
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

486
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,720
You read minds?
No.

487
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,080
Telepaths know thoughts.

488
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,760
Empaths feel feelings.

489
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Emotions.

490
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,680
May I?

491
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,320
All right.

492
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,040
You feel love.

493
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,120
Yeah. I guess
I feel a general,

494
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,680
unselfish love for
just about everybody.

495
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,920
No!

496
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Romantic, sexual love.

497
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
No, I don't.

498
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,400
For her!
No!

499
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
QUILL: Okay.

500
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,080
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

501
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,560
Dude, I think you're
overreacting a little bit!

502
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,160
You must be so embarrassed!

503
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,840
Do me! Do me!

504
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,120
I have never felt
such humor!

505
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,680
So unbelievably uncool.

506
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Oh, Quill.

507
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,800
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel
is a broken jaw.

508
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,840
I can also alter
emotions to some extent.

509
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,000
QUILL: Yeah, like what?

510
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
If I touch someone
who is sad...

511
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,800
I can ease them
into contentment
for a short while.

512
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,760
I can make
a stubborn person compliant.

513
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,000
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.

514
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,040
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

515
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
Do one of those on me.

516
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,640
Sleep.

517
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,960
ROCKET: I love this song.

518
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,720
Huh?

519
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,080
There!

520
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Ah...

521
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,920
Ain't so tough now
without all your toys...

522
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,320
RETCH: Move!

523
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,280
Crap.

524
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,160
Hey there, rat!

525
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,800
How's it going,
you blue idiot?

526
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,280
Not so bad.

527
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,800
We got ourselves
a pretty good
little gig here.

528
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,800
This golden gal
with quite a high
opinion of herself...

529
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,880
has offered us
a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...

530
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
because she wants

531
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,760
to kill y'all.

532
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,040
Your friend...

533
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,800
There's too many of them.

534
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,200
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

535
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,160
you need to get me
out of these bonds.

536
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,560
They are going to kill him!

537
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,840
YONDU: I tell you,
it was pretty
easy to find you.

538
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

539
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,520
during the war over Xandar.

540
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,400
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...

541
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

542
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,720
Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.

543
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,480
Otherwise,
I'd actually hand you over.

544
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
Otherwise, you'd what?

545
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,480
We'll take them batteries.

546
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,240
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on
the open market?

547
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,760
That Priestess
offered us a million.

548
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,600
A quarter is only
one third of that!

549
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
A quarter ain't a third.

550
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,880
A quarter is 25.

551
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,080
No.

552
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,600
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.

553
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
YONDU: Enough!

554
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,240
The point is,
we ain't stupid enough

555
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,680
to help kill
the Guardians of the Galaxy!

556
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,560
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

557
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,680
KRAGLIN: That ain't right!

558
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,520
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

559
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,960
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

560
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,960
you protect him
like none of the
rest of us much matter!

561
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,200
ALL: Yeah!

562
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm the one what
sticks up for you!

563
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,920
Take it easy, Kraglin.

564
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,600
Damn straight, lad.
He's gone soft.

565
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,880
Suppose it's time
for a change in leadership.

566
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,160
Put your damn guns down!

567
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,560
Whoa! Whoa!

568
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,240
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this,
fellas.

569
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,240
Or even a violent one
where I'm standing over there.

570
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,960
Well, hello, boys.

571
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,360
It's not ripe.

572
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,440
Welcome, everyone,
to my world.

573
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,080
QUILL: Wow.
You have your own planet?

574
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,960
Come on.
No larger than
your Earth's Moon.

575
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,640
Humility.

576
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,200
I like it.

577
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,040
I, too,
am extraordinarily humble.

578
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,440
You own a planet
and can destroy

579
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
two dozen spaceships
without a suit.

580
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,000
What are you exactly?

581
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm what's called
a Celestial, sweetheart.

582
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,320
A Celestial, like a god?

583
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,880
Mmm, small "g," son.

584
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,880
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

585
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
QUILL: Whoa!

586
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,720
I don't know where
I came from exactly.

587
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,920
First thing I remember
is flickering...

588
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,360
adrift in
the cosmos utterly...

589
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,880
and entirely alone.

590
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,800
Over millions of years...

591
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,520
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

592
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,040
I grew smarter and stronger.

593
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,920
And I continued
building from there...

594
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,200
layer by layer...

595
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,960
the very planet
you walk on now.

596
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,440
Whoa.

597
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,320
But I wanted more.

598
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,080
I desired...

599
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,760
meaning.

600
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,880
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

601
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,800
"besides just me," I thought.

602
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And so, I set myself
the task of finding it.

603
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,760
I created...

604
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,600
what I imagined
biological life
to be like...

605
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,480
down to the most
minute detail.

606
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,040
Did you make a penis?

607
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,320
Dude!

608
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,680
What is wrong with you?

609
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
If he is a planet,

610
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,040
how could he make a baby
with your mother?

611
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
He would smush her!

612
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,480
I don't need to hear
how my parents...

613
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
Why?

614
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,160
My father would tell the story

615
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,200
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

616
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,640
That's disgusting.

617
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,320
It was beautiful.

618
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,320
You Earthers have hang-ups.

619
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,800
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

620
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,600
Ha! Thank you!

621
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,960
It's not half bad.

622
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,560
Oh.
Ugh.

623
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,280
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

624
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,240
and all the accompanying junk.

625
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,320
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant
to be human...

626
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,520
as I set out
amongst the stars...

627
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,320
until I found...

628
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,160
what I sought.

629
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,920
Life.

630
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,080
I was not alone in
the universe after all.

631
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,640
When did you
meet my mother?

632
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,520
Not long after.

633
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,880
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

634
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,960
I called her my river lily.

635
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,840
And from that love,
Peter...

636
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,560
you.

637
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,400
I have searched
for you for so long.

638
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
And when I heard of
a man from Earth...

639
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,560
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

640
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,400
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

641
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,320
If you loved her,
why did you leave her?

642
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,280
TULLK: This is mutiny!

643
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,360
This is mutiny!

644
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,120
This is mutiny!

645
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,280
TULLK: You're scum!

646
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,200
RAVAGERS: Oh!

647
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
Captain!

648
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,600
Help me! Please!

649
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,320
Captain!

650
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,360
You're the one
what killed those men...

651
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,680
by leading them
down the wrong path.

652
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,320
Because you're weak.

653
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,280
And stupid!

654
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,360
It's time for the Ravagers...

655
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,280
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

656
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,680
Taserface!

657
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,040
I'm sorry.
Your name is...

658
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,880
It's Taserface?

659
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,640
That's right.

660
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,360
Do you shoot
tasers out of your face?

661
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,880
It's metaphorical!

662
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,040
ALL: Yeah!

663
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
For what?

664
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,520
For it is a name
what strikes fear...

665
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,400
into the hearts of
anyone what hears it.

666
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,320
Okay.

667
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,080
ROCKET: Okay...

668
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,520
whatever you say.

669
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,240
You shut up.

670
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,720
You're next.

671
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,080
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

672
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
What?

673
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,280
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry!

674
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,440
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning,
sir...

675
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
looking in the mirror

676
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,760
and then in all seriousness
saying to yourself...

677
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,360
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

678
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,840
That's how
I hear you in my head!

679
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,480
What was your second choice?

680
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,760
Scrotum Hat?

681
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,440
New plan.
We're killing you first.

682
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,400
Well, dying
is certainly better

683
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,040
than having to
live an entire life...

684
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,040
as a moronic
shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

685
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,120
That's enough
killing for today.

686
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,720
RAVAGER:
She's the daughter of Thanos.

687
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,200
TASERFACE: I thought
you were the biggest
sadist in the galaxy.

688
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,120
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

689
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,880
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

690
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,000
And he has
bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

691
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,080
I assure you...

692
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,040
I am not as easy
a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

693
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,120
or a talking
woodland beast.

694
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,400
I want 10% of the take...

695
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,760
and a couple more things.

696
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,200
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...

697
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,320
if that one
don't work out.
It is fine.

698
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,720
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

699
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,000
The Kree consider
themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

700
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,600
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

701
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,520
Location of Ego's
planet in the nav.

702
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,880
We'll wire you
the 10% once we's paid.

703
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,240
What are you gonna
do with your share?

704
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,440
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

705
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,360
battle one another
in training.

706
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,400
Every time my
sister prevailed...

707
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,880
my father would
replace a piece of me
with machinery...

708
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,720
claiming he wanted
me to be her equal.

709
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,680
But she won...

710
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,680
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

711
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,680
So after I murder my sister...

712
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,960
I will buy a warship

713
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

714
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
I will hunt
my father like a dog,

715
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,840
and I will tear him
apart slowly...

716
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,560
piece by piece...

717
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,080
until he knows some semblance
of the profound
and unceasing pain...

718
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,360
I know every single day.

719
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,480
Yeah.

720
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,760
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

721
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,440
Or a nice hat.

722
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,440
Something to make
the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

723
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,480
Anyways, happy trails.

724
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,880
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

725
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,120
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought
she was delusional.

726
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,280
Peter...

727
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,240
Listen, I'd love to
believe all of this,
I really would.

728
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,760
But you left...

729
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,720
the most
wonderful woman ever...

730
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,440
to die alone.

731
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,920
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

732
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,360
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

733
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,800
and the light within it...

734
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,600
this form will
wither and perish.

735
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,800
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

736
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,880
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

737
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,200
I loved your mother,
Peter!

738
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,680
I couldn't stand
to set foot on an Earth...

739
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,120
where she wasn't living!

740
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,760
You can't imagine
what that's like!

741
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,280
I know exactly
what that feels like!

742
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,160
I had to watch her die!

743
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,760
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

744
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,320
I've made many mistakes,
Peter.

745
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,440
But you're not one of them.

746
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,960
Please give me the chance
to be the father

747
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,960
she would want me to be.

748
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,000
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

749
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,840
and the light within.

750
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,400
They are a part of you,
Peter.

751
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,960
What do you mean?

752
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,640
Give me your hands, son.

753
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,720
Here.

754
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,480
Hold them like that.

755
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,240
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

756
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,480
Take your brain
to the center
of this planet.

757
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,360
Yes!

758
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Yes!

759
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,280
Whoa!

760
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,840
Yes! It's okay.

761
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,200
Just relax.
Concentrate.

762
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,440
You can do it.
Bring it back.

763
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,040
Yes!

764
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,400
Yes, now shape it.

765
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,480
Feel that energy.

766
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,680
Yes.

767
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,320
You're home.

768
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,960
Peter...

769
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,400
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

770
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,880
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.

771
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,560
Orphaned on my homeworld.

772
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,120
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

773
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,960
So you're a pet?

774
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,480
I suppose.

775
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,400
People usually
want cute pets.

776
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,800
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

777
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,280
I am hideous?

778
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,680
You are horrifying
to look at. Yes.

779
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,960
But that's a good thing.

780
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,080
Oh?

781
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,120
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

782
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,720
you know they love
you for who you are.

783
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,440
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

784
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,280
Well, then I'm
certainly grateful to be ugly.

785
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,880
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...

786
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,640
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten
lakes of my homeworld.

787
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,120
She was like you.

788
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,040
Disgusting?

789
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,240
Innocent.

790
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,520
Drax?

791
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,800
There's something
I must tell you.

792
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,360
What's going on?

793
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,360
This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

794
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

795
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,920
You're not ugly.
Drax!

796
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,320
What are you
talking about?

797
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,640
GAMORA: Mantis...

798
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,240
can you show us
where we'll be staying?

799
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,520
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

800
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,760
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.

801
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,200
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

802
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,200
And you're not a flea?

803
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,680
I'm a flea with a purpose.

804
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,920
I help him sleep.

805
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,280
What were you
about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

806
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,440
Nothing.

807
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,240
Your quarters
are this way.

808
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,360
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.

809
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,800
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

810
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,440
Okay, Taserface.

811
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,200
Hey, tell
the other guys we said...

812
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,840
"Hi," Taserface!

813
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,760
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

814
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,280
No, Gef.

815
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,040
It's too adorable to kill.

816
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,080
Take it to the tailor.

817
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,960
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

818
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,120
I was a Kree battle
slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

819
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,320
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

820
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,960
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

821
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,880
But I was young...

822
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,280
and greedy, and stupid.

823
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,400
Like you stealing
those batteries.

824
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,120
That was mostly Drax.

825
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,040
Me and Stakar and
the other captains...

826
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,400
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

827
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,240
The only family
I ever had.

828
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,320
When I broke the code...

829
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,240
they exiled me.

830
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,040
This is what I deserve.

831
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,000
Slow down, drama queen.

832
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,800
You might deserve this,
but I don't.

833
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,640
We gotta get outta here.

834
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,320
Where's Quill?

835
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,120
He went off
with his old man.

836
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,320
Ego?
Yeah.

837
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,640
It's a day for
dumbass names.

838
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,160
You're smiling.
And for a second,
I got a warm feeling.

839
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,000
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.

840
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,480
You like a professional
asshole or what?

841
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,680
Pretty much a pro.

842
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,560
Why didn't you
deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

843
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,840
He was skinny.

844
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,400
Could fit into
places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.

845
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,840
Uh-huh.

846
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,520
I got an idea on
how to get outta here.

847
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,920
But we're gonna need
your little friend.

848
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,520
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

849
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,880
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

850
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,720
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

851
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,720
He's goddang precious!

852
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
YONDU: Psst!

853
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,520
Hey, twig!

854
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,280
Come here.

855
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,920
Come on.

856
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,560
Aw, man...

857
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,200
what did they do to you?

858
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,760
Hey, you wanna help us
get outta here?

859
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,720
There's something
I need you to get,
and bring back to me.

860
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,000
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

861
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,760
the thing I wore on my head.

862
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,560
There's a drawer
next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

863
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,000
You got it?

864
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,160
That's my underwears.

865
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,480
Yeah, I was pretty
sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.

866
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,640
You have to explain it
more careful.

867
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,600
It's a prototype fin.

868
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,840
That's an orloni.
It's a fin, Groot.

869
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,680
You explain it this time.

870
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,320
All right.

871
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,960
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.

872
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,200
He takes it out
when he sleeps.

873
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,640
Go. Look again.

874
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,160
But leave the eye here.

875
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,760
Why?

876
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,320
He's gonna wake up
tomorrow...

877
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,680
and he's not
gonna know...

878
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,160
where his eye is!

879
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,880
That's a desk.

880
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,880
We told you
it was this big.

881
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,040
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

882
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,840
with a bunch of
severed human toes.

883
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,720
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

884
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,520
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

885
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,040
Okay?

886
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,440
What? No!

887
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,880
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

888
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,320
That's not what I said!

889
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
I am Groot.

890
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,600
He's relieved you
don't want him to.

891
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,120
I am Groot.
He hates hats.

892
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,240
I am Groot.

893
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,360
On anyone, not just himself.

894
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,440
I am Groot.

895
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,440
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

896
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,560
the next minute
it's just because

897
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,000
you realize part of
that head is the hat.

898
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,760
That's why you
don't like hats?

899
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,240
This is an important
conversation right now?

900
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,000
KRAGLIN: That ain't it.

901
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,280
I didn't mean
to do a mutiny.

902
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,120
They killed all my friends.

903
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,760
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

904
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,320
One more thing.

905
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,640
You got any clones of Quill's
old music on the ship?

906
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,040
Ah.

907
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,400
He's got it!

908
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,080
Yondu's got the fin!

909
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Go!

910
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Down there!

911
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,840
You maniac.

912
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,040
The whole ship's gonna blow.

913
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,480
Not the whole ship.

914
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,560
Who is this?

915
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,040
I am sending you
the coordinates
for Yondu's ship.

916
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,240
Release the quadrant!
Aye, Captain!

917
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,920
I only ask one thing.

918
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,080
That your High Priestess...

919
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,840
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

920
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,840
Taserface!

921
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,520
Where to, Captain?

922
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,720
Ego.

923
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,520
No, boy!

924
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,480
It ain't healthy
for a mammalian body

925
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,800
to hop more than
50 jumps at a time.

926
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,000
I know that.

927
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,600
We are about to do 700!

928
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,560
QUILL: So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

929
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,440
Rocket?
Rocket, are you there?

930
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,280
What are you doing, Peter?

931
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,960
Dance with me.

932
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,600
I'm not going to
dance with you.

933
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,520
This is Sam Cooke...

934
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,160
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

935
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,360
Drax thinks
you're not a dancer.

936
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,040
If you ever tell
anyone about this...

937
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,640
I will kill you.

938
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,200
When are we gonna
do something about this
unspoken thing between us?

939
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,320
What unspoken thing?

940
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,400
This...

941
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,400
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

942
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,240
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...

943
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,680
but never say it
because if they do,

944
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,920
the ratings would go down...

945
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,160
sort of thing.

946
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,680
There's no unspoken thing.

947
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,640
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

948
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,000
then it would be spoken...

949
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,840
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

950
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,080
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

951
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,200
No, that's not what I...

952
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,600
What we should be
discussing right now
is something about this place.

953
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,560
It doesn't feel right.

954
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,120
What are you talking about?

955
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,680
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!

956
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,960
That girl Mantis...

957
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,360
she's afraid of something.

958
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,840
Why are you
trying to take this
away from me?

959
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,200
I'm not trying...

960
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,160
He's my father. He's blood.

961
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,280
You have blood on Earth
and you never
wanted to return there.

962
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,360
Again, you made me come here!

963
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,440
And Earth is the place
where my mother
died in front of me.

964
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,240
No, it's because
that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.

965
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,160
This is real!
I'm only half human,
remember?

966
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,640
That's the half
I'm worried about.

967
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,920
Oh, I get it.
You're jealous...

968
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,480
because I'm part-god,
and you like
when I'm the weak one.

969
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,160
You were
insufferable to begin with.

970
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,360
I haven't been
able to reach Rocket.

971
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,000
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try
and get a signal.

972
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,000
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

973
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,000
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

974
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,920
to open themselves
up to new possibility,

975
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,720
and the other person
is a jerk...

976
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,640
who doesn't trust anybody!

977
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,480
It's a show
that doesn't exist.

978
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,120
That's why
it would get zero ratings!

979
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,560
I don't know what Cheers is!

980
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,920
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

981
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,680
I thought you already had.

982
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,480
Damn it.

983
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,720
Psychopath!

984
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,880
Are you kidding me?

985
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,160
I win.

986
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,000
I win.
I bested you in combat.

987
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,040
No. I saved your life.

988
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,160
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.

989
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,240
You let me live!

990
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,160
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

991
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,680
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe

992
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,040
just because I wanted to win.

993
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,760
Do not tell me what I want.

994
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,320
I don't need to
tell you what you want!

995
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,520
It's obvious!

996
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,680
You were the one
who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

997
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,960
You were all I had.

998
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,160
But you were the one
who needed to win.

999
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,520
Thanos pulled
my eye from my head...

1000
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,280
and my brain
from my skull...

1001
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,360
and my arm from my body...

1002
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,240
because of you.

1003
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,200
You all right, son?

1004
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,280
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier
in quite a huff.

1005
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,040
It's fortuitous...

1006
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,440
you listening
to this song.

1007
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,240
You know...
Brandy?

1008
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,800
By Looking Glass?

1009
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,960
A favorite of your mom's.

1010
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,320
Yeah, it was.

1011
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,480
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

1012
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,680
Perhaps its very greatest.

1013
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,840
Yes!

1014
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,160
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.

1015
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,160
from far away

1016
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,640
Like the child
I put in your mother...

1017
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,840
or the freedom
you brought Gamora.

1018
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,840
you would be

1019
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,000
The sea
calls the sailor back.

1020
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,720
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.

1021
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,520
The sea calls upon him
as history calls
upon great men.

1022
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:07,200
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1023
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,840
Well, you may not
be mortal, but me...

1024
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,280
No, Peter...

1025
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,360
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...

1026
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,880
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

1027
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,000
I'm immortal?

1028
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,560
Mmm-hmm.

1029
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,200
Really?

1030
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,200
Yes!
As long as the light exists.

1031
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,520
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1032
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,000
like how you made
this whole planet?

1033
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,520
It might take you
a few million
years of practice...

1034
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,880
before you get
really good at it.
But, yes!

1035
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,080
What!

1036
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,880
Get ready for
an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1037
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,160
and Heather Locklear.

1038
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,400
You can do
anything you want.

1039
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,960
I'm gonna make
some weird shit.

1040
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,240
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous
responsibility.

1041
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,880
Only we can
remake the universe.

1042
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,600
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...

1043
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,520
and lead it to
where it needs to go.

1044
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,720
How?

1045
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,720
Come with me.

1046
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,200
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1047
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,240
Drax! We need to talk.

1048
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,120
I'm sorry.

1049
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,600
But I like a woman
with some meat
on her bones.

1050
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,760
What?

1051
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,160
I tried to let you down
easily by telling you
I found you disgusting.

1052
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,760
No, that's not what I...

1053
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,720
What are you doing?

1054
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,800
I'm imagining being
with you physically.

1055
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,120
Drax...

1056
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,960
I don't like you like that.

1057
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,960
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.

1058
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,960
Hey! There's no need
to get personal.

1059
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,640
Listen! Ego's gotten
exactly what he wanted.

1060
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,640
I should have
told you earlier.

1061
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,920
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1062
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,640
What is that?

1063
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,640
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1064
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,920
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1065
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,520
Everything is temporary.

1066
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,640
We are forever.

1067
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,240
Doesn't eternity
get boring?

1068
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,680
Not if you have a purpose,
Peter...

1069
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,840
which is why you're here.

1070
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,240
I told you how
all those years ago...

1071
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,440
I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

1072
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,680
But what I did not
tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...

1073
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,680
it was all so...

1074
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,000
disappointing.

1075
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,840
And that is when I came...

1076
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,680
to a profound realization.

1077
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,160
My innate desire
to seek out other life...

1078
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,840
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1079
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,320
Peter...

1080
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,480
I have found meaning.

1081
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,720
I see it.

1082
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,000
Eternity!

1083
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,840
Oh, my God.

1084
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,520
We need to
get off this planet.

1085
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,480
Oh, man.

1086
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,080
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1087
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,080
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

1088
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,200
What the hell
you doing, boy?

1089
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,320
I could tell
by how you
talked about him...

1090
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,800
this Ego is bad news.

1091
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,600
We're here to save Quill.

1092
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,960
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?

1093
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,960
No. I don't care
about those things.

1094
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,480
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove
I'm better than him!

1095
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,400
I can lord this
over him forever.

1096
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,960
What are you
laughing at me for?

1097
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,320
You can fool yourself
and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

1098
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,760
I know who you are.

1099
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,160
You don't know anything
about me, loser.

1100
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,520
I know everything about you.

1101
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,520
I know you play like
you're the meanest
and the hardest...

1102
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,040
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.

1103
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,160
Shut up!

1104
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,480
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1105
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,320
and you push away
anyone who's willing
to put up with you...

1106
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,800
because just
a little bit of love...

1107
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,200
reminds you how big
and empty that hole
inside you actually is.

1108
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,840
I said shut up!

1109
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,680
I know them scientists
what made you,

1110
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,440
never gave
a rat's ass about you.

1111
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,920
I'm serious, dude!

1112
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,520
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...

1113
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,800
their own little baby,
into slavery.

1114
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,600
I know who you are, boy.

1115
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,680
Because you're me.

1116
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,320
What kind of a pair are we?

1117
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,640
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

1118
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,960
All right, okay!
Good. Wait.

1119
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,800
Fight a what?

1120
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,240
Who are you people?

1121
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,320
What is this place?

1122
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,400
Gamora, let her go!

1123
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,760
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

1124
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,200
You are scared.

1125
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,560
I call it the Expansion.

1126
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,920
It is my purpose...

1127
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,600
and now it is yours as well.

1128
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,040
It's beautiful.

1129
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,520
Over thousands of years...

1130
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,760
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...

1131
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,680
on thousands of worlds.

1132
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,600
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...

1133
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,760
To grow and spread...

1134
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,960
covering all that exists...

1135
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:43,280
until everything is...

1136
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,600
Me!

1137
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,640
What did she do to me?

1138
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,560
She already
told me everything.

1139
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,120
I only had one problem.

1140
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,880
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power

1141
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,920
for such an enterprise.

1142
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,200
But two Celestials...

1143
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,640
Well, now,
that just might do.

1144
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,760
The bodies...

1145
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,920
are his children.

1146
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,640
EGO: Out of all my labors...

1147
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,960
the most beguiling was...

1148
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,560
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1149
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,720
I hoped the result
of such a coupling
would be enough...

1150
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,760
to power the Expansion.

1151
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,320
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1152
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,960
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated
him generously...

1153
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,760
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1154
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,560
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1155
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,920
But one after the other,
they failed me.

1156
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,920
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1157
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,320
Until you, Peter.

1158
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,160
Out of all my spawn...

1159
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:55,400
only you carried
the connection to the light.

1160
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,640
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1161
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,320
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1162
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,800
Then we just go.
No!

1163
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,000
He's our friend.

1164
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,160
All any of you do...

1165
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,480
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1166
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,080
You're right.

1167
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,760
We're family.

1168
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,160
We leave no one behind.

1169
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,960
Except maybe you.

1170
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,960
Oh, my God.

1171
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,680
For the first time
in my existence...

1172
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,920
I am truly not alone!

1173
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,640
What is it, son?

1174
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,160
My friends.

1175
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,440
You see,
that's the mortal
in you, Peter.

1176
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,880
Yes.

1177
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,120
We are beyond
such things.

1178
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,280
Yes.

1179
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,920
Now...
But my mother...

1180
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,120
You said you loved my mother.

1181
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,800
And that I did.

1182
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,400
My river lily
who knew all the words

1183
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,880
to every song that
came over the radio.

1184
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,400
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1185
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,080
And I knew if I
returned a fourth...

1186
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,800
I'd never leave.

1187
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,480
The Expansion...

1188
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,320
the reason for
my very existence,
would be over.

1189
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,400
So, I did what I had to do.

1190
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,760
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor
in her head.

1191
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,160
What?

1192
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,760
Now, all right...

1193
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,720
I know that sounds bad.

1194
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,120
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

1195
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,960
You killed my mother!

1196
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,120
I tried...

1197
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,040
so hard...

1198
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,640
to find the form...

1199
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,200
that best suited you...

1200
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,680
and this
is the thanks I get?

1201
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,960
You really need to grow up.

1202
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,280
I wanted to do
this together...

1203
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,400
but I suppose
you'll have to learn

1204
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,960
by spending
the next thousand years
as a battery!

1205
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,320
Finally! Rocket?

1206
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,200
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1207
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,640
We're in an old piece
of construction equipment
Yondu once used...

1208
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,000
to slice open
the Bank of A'askavaria.

1209
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,120
Ego's unhinged.

1210
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,720
ROCKET: I know. Get ready.

1211
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,240
Drop her, Kraglin.

1212
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:57,960
No.

1213
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,920
EGO:

1214
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,520
Peter...

1215
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,640
this is the sea.

1216
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,800
Oh...

1217
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,440
Hey, there, jackass!

1218
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,240
MAN: What is that thing?

1219
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,720
Out of the way,
dumber, smaller Groot!

1220
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,080
I told you
something didn't feel right.

1221
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,680
"I told you so."
Just what I need
to hear right now.

1222
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,440
Well, I came back,
didn't I?

1223
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,480
Because there's
an unspoken thing.

1224
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,600
There is no unspoken thing.

1225
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,440
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1226
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,640
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

1227
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,000
We had it under control.

1228
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,600
We did not.
That is only an extension...

1229
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,800
of his true self.
He will be back soon.

1230
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,320
What's Smurfette
doing here?

1231
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,320
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

1232
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,760
She tried to murder me!

1233
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,600
I saved you,
you stupid fox!

1234
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,240
He's not a fox.

1235
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,400
I am Groot.

1236
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,520
I'm not a raboon, either.

1237
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,640
I am Groot.

1238
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,280
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1239
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,160
How do we kill a Celestial?

1240
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,640
There's a center to him.

1241
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,960
His brain, his soul,
whatever it is...

1242
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,320
Some sort of
protective shell.

1243
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,680
It's in the caverns...

1244
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,960
below the surface.

1245
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,280
Yondu?

1246
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,000
Thrusters are out.

1247
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,360
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1248
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,360
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

1249
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,640
You still reckon
that's the reason

1250
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,960
I kept you around,
you idiot?

1251
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,480
That's what you told me,
you old doofus.

1252
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,320
Once I figured out
what happened to
them other kids...

1253
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,080
I wasn't just
gonna hand you over.

1254
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,800
You said you
were gonna eat me.

1255
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,360
That was being funny!

1256
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,360
Not to me!

1257
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,800
You people have issues.

1258
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,720
Of course I have issues.

1259
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,400
That's my freakin' father!

1260
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,160
Thrusters are back up.

1261
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,920
We should be going up!
QUILL: We can't!

1262
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,720
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

1263
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,000
We have to kill him.

1264
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,040
Rocket!

1265
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,160
Got it!

1266
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,920
QUILL: Whoo-hoo!

1267
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,880
So, we're saving
the galaxy again?

1268
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,080
I guess.

1269
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,400
Awesome!

1270
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,680
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...

1271
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,440
if we're
two-time galaxy savers.

1272
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,080
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1273
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,120
It was just
a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.

1274
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,560
Of course,
I care about the planets,
and the buildings...

1275
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,440
and all
the animals on the planets.

1276
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,880
And the people.

1277
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,040
Meh.

1278
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,800
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1279
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,480
AYESHA: Pilots...

1280
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,000
release envoy units.

1281
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,120
Our sensors
detect the batteries

1282
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:50,280
are below
the surface of the planet.

1283
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,120
Dive!

1284
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,600
Um... Captain?

1285
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,760
Captain?

1286
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,480
Tell me why Ego
wants you here?

1287
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,640
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...

1288
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,960
to help destroy the universe.

1289
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,320
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1290
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,680
So, could you?

1291
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,000
A little.

1292
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,320
I made a ball.

1293
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,480
A ball?

1294
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,320
I thought as hard as I could.

1295
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,160
It was all that
I could come up with.

1296
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,520
You "thought"?

1297
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,680
You think when I
make this arrow fly...

1298
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
I use my head?

1299
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,520
Whoa.

1300
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,360
There.

1301
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,520
That's Ego's core.

1302
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,520
GAMORA:
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1303
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,320
I got it covered.

1304
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,040
We must hurry.

1305
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,320
It will not take
Ego long to find us.

1306
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,720
Keep it steady.

1307
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,360
We drill into the center,
we kill him!

1308
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,080
KRAGLIN: Captain?

1309
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,480
What is it, Kraglin?

1310
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,600
Hey,
remember that Ayesha chick?

1311
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,960
Yeah, why?
Uh...

1312
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,240
Oh, hell!

1313
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,760
Why aren't you
firing the lasers?

1314
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,800
They blew out the generator.

1315
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,760
I think I packed
a small detonator.

1316
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,600
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1317
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,280
Well, we got these.

1318
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,960
Is that thing strong
enough to kill Ego?

1319
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,000
If it is, it'll
cause a chain reaction...

1320
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,800
throughout his
entire nervous system.

1321
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,840
Meaning what?

1322
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,680
The entire
planet will explode.

1323
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,240
We'll have to get
out of here fast.

1324
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,920
I rigged a timer.

1325
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,080
QUILL: Go!

1326
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,960
He's coming.

1327
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,160
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?

1328
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,960
When he wants.
He's too powerful.

1329
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,520
I can't!

1330
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,800
You don't have to
believe in yourself...

1331
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,640
because I believe in you.

1332
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,680
Sleep!

1333
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,040
I never thought
she'd be able to do it...

1334
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,360
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1335
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,360
I don't know how
long I can hold him.

1336
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,200
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.

1337
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,360
For the bomb to work,

1338
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,760
we'd actually need to place it
on Ego's core.

1339
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,200
And our fat butts
ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

1340
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,920
QUILL: Well...

1341
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,360
That's a terrible idea.

1342
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,920
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.

1343
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,320
Unbelievable.

1344
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,840
"Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that."

1345
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,760
What a day.

1346
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,880
All right,
first you flick this switch,
then this switch.

1347
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,280
That activates it.

1348
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,280
Then you push this button...

1349
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,520
which will give
you five minutes
to get out of there.

1350
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,040
Now, whatever you do...

1351
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:24,040
don't push this button...

1352
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,240
because that will set off
the bomb immediately

1353
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,720
and we'll all be dead.

1354
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,360
Now, repeat back
what I just said.

1355
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,280
I am Groot.
Uh-huh.

1356
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,400
I am Groot.
That's right.

1357
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,800
I am Groot.
No!

1358
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,520
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1359
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,720
Try again.

1360
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,040
Hmm...

1361
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,560
I am Groot.
Mmm-hmm.

1362
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,760
I am Groot.
Uh-huh.

1363
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:47,920
I am Groot.

1364
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,920
No! That's exactly
what you just said!

1365
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,600
How is that even possible?

1366
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,920
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1367
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,280
Point to it.

1368
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,440
No!

1369
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,560
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!

1370
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,400
Shut up
and get me some tape!

1371
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,000
Does anybody have
any tape out there?

1372
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,760
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1373
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,840
I don't have any tape.
Let me check.

1374
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,680
Yo, Yondu... Ow!

1375
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,000
Do you have any tape?

1376
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:17,320
Gamora?
Do you have any tape?

1377
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,560
Tape!

1378
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,120
Never mind. Ow!

1379
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,640
Drax, do you have any tape?

1380
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:27,320
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1381
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,640
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1382
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,680
if you don't have any?

1383
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,440
Nobody has any tape!

1384
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,000
Not a single person
has tape?

1385
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,440
Nope!

1386
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,760
Did you ask Nebula?

1387
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,320
Yes!

1388
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,680
Are you sure?

1389
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,160
I asked Yondu...

1390
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,480
and she was
sitting next to him.

1391
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,520
I knew you were lying!

1392
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,760
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic
bomb in your bag.

1393
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,360
If anybody's gonna
have tape, it's you!

1394
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,080
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1395
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,640
You are wasting
a lot of time here!

1396
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,120
Whee!

1397
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
We're all gonna die.

1398
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,840
YONDU:
Rear thrusters are out again!

1399
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
We're done for
without that generator!

1400
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,320
Guardians...

1401
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,720
perhaps it will
provide you solace...

1402
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,560
that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1403
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,720
They will serve
as a warning...

1404
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,200
to all of those
tempted with betraying us.

1405
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:38,520
Don't screw
with the Sovereign.

1406
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,400
This is gonna hurt.

1407
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,160
Promises, promises.

1408
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,320
Hey!

1409
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:09,120
No!

1410
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,840
No! No! No!

1411
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,280
QUILL: We're gonna blow!

1412
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,600
Peter! No!

1413
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,440
What?

1414
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,760
You look like Mary Poppins.

1415
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,320
Is he cool?

1416
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,800
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1417
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,440
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1418
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,840
Mantis, look out!

1419
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,600
She's just unconscious.

1420
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,160
How long until
the bomb goes off?

1421
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,720
In the unlikely event
that Groot
doesn't kill us all...

1422
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,000
about six minutes.

1423
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,600
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1424
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,760
T-minus five minutes.

1425
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,000
Aye, Captain.

1426
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,800
Somebody's gotta be up top
when Kraglin arrives.

1427
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,560
Drax, take Mantis.

1428
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,840
Ow! My nipples!

1429
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,240
Gamora!

1430
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,040
Peter!

1431
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,680
Get over it.

1432
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,920
Come now, Peter.
I know this
isn't what you want.

1433
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:16,400
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1434
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:51,600
EGO: Soon, Peter,
we will be all there is.

1435
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:55,440
So stop pissing me off!

1436
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,200
We have to get up
to the extraction point!

1437
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,640
Go!

1438
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,320
I told you...

1439
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:31,440
I don't want to do this alone.

1440
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,640
You cannot deny...

1441
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:40,120
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1442
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,000
OFFICER: Everyone,
I need you to stay back!

1443
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:52,240
What is that?

1444
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,200
EGO: It doesn't need to
be like this, Peter.

1445
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,360
Why are you
destroying our chance?

1446
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,160
Stop pretending you aren't
what you are.

1447
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,040
One in billions.

1448
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,640
Trillions. Even more.

1449
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:34,560
What greater meaning
can life
possibly have to offer?

1450
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,200
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1451
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:43,520
I use my heart...

1452
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,560
You shouldn't
have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

1453
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:36,000
never break the chain

1454
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,760
never break the chain

1455
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,160
break the chain

1456
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,720
Groot?
If you can hear me, hurry up!

1457
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,040
I'm not sure how long
Quill can keep him distracted!

1458
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,040
Groot, hurry!

1459
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,000
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1460
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,680
Get to the ship!

1461
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,880
Not without Quill!

1462
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,160
You need to
take care of the twig!

1463
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,240
Not without you!

1464
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,680
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1465
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,320
You need to give me this.

1466
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,440
Uh...

1467
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,040
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1468
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,360
I only have one of each.

1469
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:56,280
I am Groot.

1470
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,120
What's that?

1471
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:03,960
He says,
"Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

1472
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,880
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1473
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,240
Bye, twig.

1474
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:19,800
We're gonna need to have
a real discussion
about your language.

1475
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,440
Where's Peter?

1476
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,160
Rocket, where is he?

1477
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,960
Rocket.

1478
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,640
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

1479
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:25,240
Mmm...

1480
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,440
No. I'm not leaving
without him.

1481
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,360
I'm sorry.

1482
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:42,040
I can only afford to lose
one friend today.

1483
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:43,600
Kraglin, go!

1484
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,440
Wait...

1485
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,760
Is Quill back?

1486
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,840
Rocket, where's Quill?

1487
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:56,280
Rocket, where's Quill?

1488
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,480
Rocket!

1489
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,560
Where's Quill?

1490
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:04,640
Where's Quill?

1491
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,040
No, we need to stop it.

1492
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,240
Stop.

1493
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,680
Stop. Listen to me!

1494
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,400
You are a god.

1495
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,200
If you kill me...

1496
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:31,000
you'll be just
like everybody else.

1497
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:33,680
What's so wrong with that?

1498
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:34,840
No!

1499
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,600
He may have been
your father, boy,

1500
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:29,200
but he wasn't your daddy.

1501
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,880
I'm sorry I didn't do
none of it right.

1502
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:39,280
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1503
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,320
What?

1504
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:57,360
Yondu, what are you doing?

1505
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,640
You can't.

1506
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,000
Yondu!

1507
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,240
No!

1508
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:13,720
No!

1509
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,760
Oh! Aww...

1510
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,640
No! No!

1511
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,280
Oh, no!

1512
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,600
QUILL: I told Gamora...

1513
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,600
how when I was a kid
I used to pretend

1514
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,520
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1515
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:28,040
He's a singer and
actor from Earth,
really famous guy.

1516
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,440
Earlier, it struck me...

1517
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,680
Yondu didn't have
a talking car,

1518
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,800
but he did have
a flying arrow.

1519
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,640
He didn't have
the beautiful
voice of an angel...

1520
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:42,000
but he did have
the whistle of one.

1521
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,720
Both Yondu and
David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1522
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:48,360
and hooked up
with hot women...

1523
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,520
and fought robots.

1524
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:57,200
I guess David Hasselhoff
did kind of end up
being my dad after all.

1525
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,560
Only it was you, Yondu.

1526
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,000
I had a pretty cool dad.

1527
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,720
What I'm trying
to say here is...

1528
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:18,320
sometimes that thing
you're searching
for your whole life...

1529
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:23,040
it's right there
by your side all along.

1530
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:25,000
You don't even know it.

1531
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,520
I am Groot.

1532
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,680
He did call you twig.

1533
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:45,440
Nebula...

1534
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,360
I was a child like you.

1535
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:57,360
I was concerned
with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1536
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:00,520
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

1537
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:02,480
I'm trying
to make it right.

1538
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:04,120
There are little
girls like you...

1539
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:07,000
across the universe
who are in danger.

1540
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:11,280
You can stay with us
and help them.

1541
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,240
I will help them
by killing Thanos.

1542
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,440
I don't know
if that's possible.

1543
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,440
You will always be my sister.

1544
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:18,640
KRAGLIN: Pete!

1545
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:24,320
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.

1546
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,200
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

1547
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,160
What is it?

1548
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,280
It's called a Zune.

1549
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,480
It's what
everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.

1550
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:34,960
It's got 300 songs on it.

1551
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,360
300 songs?

1552
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,600
Wait.

1553
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,600
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1554
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:54,120
I think Yondu would
want you to have it.

1555
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,920
Thanks...

1556
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:02,040
Captain.

1557
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:43,840
to make a change

1558
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:52,440
that's your fault

1559
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:55,520
much you have to know

1560
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:08,800
I am old, but I'm happy

1561
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,400
They came.

1562
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:24,880
What is it?

1563
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:28,120
I sent word to
Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1564
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,680
and told them what he did.

1565
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:35,120
It's a Ravager funeral.

1566
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,440
Yeah!

1567
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,560
Yeah!

1568
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:04,840
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

1569
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,560
No, he did not, son.

1570
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,000
He did not.

1571
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:20,080
Fare thee well, old friend.

1572
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:27,120
Yondu Udonta,
I will see you in the stars.

1573
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:33,160
He didn't chase them away.

1574
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,400
No.

1575
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:37,560
Even though
he yelled at them.

1576
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,320
And was always mean.

1577
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,960
And he stole batteries
he didn't need.

1578
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,120
Well, of course not.

1579
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,520
What?

1580
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:18,320
It's just...

1581
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,720
some unspoken thing.

1582
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,880
It's beautiful.

1583
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:37,560
It is.

1584
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:41,280
And so are you.

1585
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,440
On the inside.

1586
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:57,240
I have to go away

1587
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:41,720
You know, it's a shame...

1588
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:43,960
that it took the tragedy
of losing Yondu

1589
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:46,160
to bring us all
together again.

1590
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:49,520
But I think he'd
be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1591
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:51,240
I'm in.

1592
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,400
Dope.

1593
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,520
I miss you guys so much!

1594
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,960
Hell, yes.

1595
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
What say we steal some shit?

1596
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:22,040
High Priestess,
the Council is waiting.

1597
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:26,400
They are perturbed
I've wasted our resources.

1598
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,960
When they see
what I have created here...

1599
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:36,200
their wrath will dissipate.

1600
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:40,400
It's a new type of
birthing pod, ma'am?

1601
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,000
That, my child...

1602
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,120
is the next step
in our evolution.

1603
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:48,320
More powerful,
more beautiful...

1604
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:52,640
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1605
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:57,800
I think I shall call him...

1606
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:01,080
Adam.

1608
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,400
Ugh, dude.

1609
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,880
Seriously?

1610
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,040
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1611
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,600
I am Groot.

1612
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:12,720
I am not boring.
You're boring.

1613
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:13,760
You know what's boring?

1614
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:16,920
Sitting there,
playing that
mind-numbing game.

1615
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:20,800
What's boring is
me tripping over
your vines every day!

1616
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:22,440
I'm not boring!

1617
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:23,760
I am Groot.

1618
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,840
And now I know
how Yondu felt.

HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...

1620
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,080
just remember...

1621
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:13,680
We. Are. Groot.

1622
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,160
Hey, fellas.

1623
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:20,000
Wait, where are you going?

1624
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,560
You were supposed
to be my lift home.

1625
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:24,360
How will I get out of here?

1626
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:25,880
Hey! Aw, gee...

1627
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:28,680
I've got so many
more stories to tell.

1628
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:30,080
Aw, guys.

1629
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:32,640
Oh, gee...
