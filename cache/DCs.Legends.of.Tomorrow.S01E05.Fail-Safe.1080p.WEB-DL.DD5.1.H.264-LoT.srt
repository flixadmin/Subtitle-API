<i>Conquered the world</i>

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,275

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,196

your human side.

<i>- And what if that side of me</i>
<i>is gone?</i>

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,433
What if she
doesn't exist anymore?

15
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,368
- No, this is a dictatorship.
You get to call all the shots,

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,303
<i>And I get to take</i>
<i>all the shots.</i>

17

00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,515
About this project of mine.

23
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,050
- You're hanging us
out to dry, rip!

24
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>I need backup!</i>

25
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,219
<i>- Half the team is gone.</i>

26
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,754
- I'm gonna remember that,
comrade.

27
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,091
- You and dr. Vostok have much
work to do in the morning.

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,827
- Incredible.

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,829
This is the exact formula

30
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,765
For the thermocore that's needed
to build a new firestorm.

31
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,967
How did you manage to arrive
at something

32
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,602
That took decades to produce?

33
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,504
- But here's what
I don't understand.

34
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,473
The firestorm matrix
is unstable.

35
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,442
The thermocore reacts
exponentially

36
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,610
To the rate of fission
in the host body.

37
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:23,315
- Well, fortunately, dr. Wells
developed the quantum splicer

38
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:27,553
To address that very problem.

39
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,756
I-I'm so happy to see
that you're taking an interest

40
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,957
In my work.

41
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,258
- What can I say, sir?

42
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,394
Nuclear physics is my passion.

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,465
- "sir"?

44
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:44,036
The cisco I know never dwelled
on formality.

45
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,238
What's more,
your hair is different,

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,676
Your wardrobe neat,
your comportment gentlemanly.

47
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,811
- Oh, yeah, you like?

48
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,780
I just subscribed to "gq."

49
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,216
- Huh.

50
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,685
A snide attempt at humor...

51
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,653
Almost cisco-like.

52
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,188
Almost.

53
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,324
- What are you implying?

54
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,394
- What I am stating
unequivocally, sir...

55
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,630
Is that you are not cisco,

56
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:16,368
Which means I am not
in s.T.A.R. Labs.

57
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,270
Furthermore, I will never,

58
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,740
Never give you the formula.

63
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,126
What cocktail of hallucinogens
have you given me, doctor?

64
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,828
- Don't worry.

65
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,431
I would never dream of damaging
that beautiful mind of yours.

66
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,500
I simply want to open it.

67
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,704
Finish the formula, and these
little games of ours can stop.

68
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,073
- You'll never trick me
into giving up my research.

69
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,409
And since you also
cannot kill me

70
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,879
And destroy any hope of creating
a soviet firestorm,

71
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,981
I would like a hot shower

72
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,185
And a change of clothes.

73
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:09,354
- And I thought I gave
a good speech.

74
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,659
- I'm sorry.
Have we met?

75
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,928
- 11 years ago,

76
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,464
You bought a nuclear warhead
off me in norway.

77
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,234
And then you and your
time-traveling friends

78
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,702
Tried to kill me.

79
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,006
Just like me,
you haven't aged a day.

80
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,708
- I have a good hairdresser.

81
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,611
- [chuckles]

82
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,713
In my long life,
I have met some

83
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,749
Of the most skilled
interrogators in history, but--

84
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,751
But since we are
in the soviet union,

85
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,889
Let me tell you a story
about a friend of mine--

86
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,757
Joseph stalin.

87
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,461
He became quite skilled
at breaking a man--

88
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:54,266
Carefully aimed strikes
to the bridge of the nose,

89
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,134
Along the shoulder blades,

90
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,304
And right underneath the chin.

91
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,677
Stalin gave me this
as a gift.

92
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,181
- So it's
to be torture, then?

93
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,650
Get on with it.

94
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,218
- No.

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,722
Nothing so prosaic
for you, professor.

96
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:20,425
There are infinite ways
to break a man,

97
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,328
And I have
an infinite amount of time.

98
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,466
- Firestorm
is my life's work.

99
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,635
I will never allow you
to pervert it

100
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,137

I haven't been able to sleep

He's scared to death.
I-I can feel it.

He's trying to be strong, but--

138
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,799
Savage knows
that stein created firestorm,

Criminals usually do feel

00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,013
Runs a secret operation
out of it--

176
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,549
A prison within a prison,
if you will.

177
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,084
- I've heard of this savage.

178
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,553
He has no respect

179
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,522
For my country's
rich criminal traditions.

180
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,157
- So you'll help us?

181
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,726
- You men have no tattoos.

182
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,397
And a man who has no life story
cannot be trusted.

183
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,166
Igor!
Andrei!

184
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:56,174
<i>â™ª</i>

185
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,143
- Don't all volunteer at once.

<i>[grunting and blows landing</i>
<i>in distance]</i>

187
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,082
- Igor and andrei
seem to be a bit preoccupied.

188
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,118
Now, about that gulag...

189
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,421
- No matter.

190
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:13,158
In this life,
a man fights for himself.

191
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,193
[neck cracks]

192
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,028
- Perhaps you'd like this one.

193
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,798
- He's all yours.

194
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
- [yells]

195
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,951
- So you like
having vandal savage

196
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,587
Run his evil empire
from your country?

197
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,560
- As much as a pig enjoys
being christmas dinner.

198
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,202
- Help us, and we will destroy
his entire operation.

199
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,341
[knock at door]

200
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,444
- I just took out six men.
You guys couldn't handle one?

201
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,513
- You killed my men?

202
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,148
- They're not dead yet.

203
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,252
And neither are you,
assuming you help us.

204
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,956
- My organization runs
black-market goods into koshmar.

205
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,326
- Three of our, uh,
well, comrades

206
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,094
Are being held there
by savage.

207
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,164
- Koshmar is not a hotel
for petty criminals.

208
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,633
If your friends are there,

209
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,604
They must be insane,
ruthless animals.

210
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,308
- Hey. Howdy.

211
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,476
How you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

212
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,512
- Just being friendly.

213
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,380
This must be where they keep
the vips.

214
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,983
- This is prison, jackass.
There are no vips.

215
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,985
- Some of these guys
have been here for a while.

216
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,720
Hey, maybe this guy knows
where stein is.

217
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,457
- [speaking russian]

218
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,192
- The only thing you should be
worrying about, pretty,

219
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,493
Is lasting the night.

220
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,729
- Stein needs help.
He's in real trouble.

221
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,198
- Newsflash, so are we.

222
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,135
- [speaking russian]

223
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,742
- Think they'll
bring us blankets later?

224
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,547
- Now, according to yuri,

225
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,515
This is where his men
have access.

226
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,717
Got it?

227
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,218
- This isn't my first
prison break.

228
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,487
- We got it covered.
- So how can we help?

229
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,822
- By staying on the ship.

230
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,290
We don't need
any more casualties.

231
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,459
Besides, mr. Snart and sara
have got it covered.

232
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,760
- Whoa, man.
Why does it feel like

233
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,462
We're on the jv team
all of a sudden?

234
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,064
- What you are is one half
of everything savage needs

235
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,733
To change the face
of the cold war.

236
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,402
And you are the only person
who can kill him.

237
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,803
- Yeah, so you can't just--

238
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,271
- I am not going to gift-wrap
the two people

239
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,340
In the world that savage wants
the most.

240
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,776
- We should get going.

241
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,711
- Oh, ms. Lance,
could I borrow you for a moment?

242
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,881
I have something that might
help you out with the mission.

243
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,590
- So what did you really want
to talk to me about?

244
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:02,093
- Gideon, will you please show
ms. Lance the projection of 2016

245
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,562
Should our rescue mission fail?

246
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,831
<i>- I'd be happy to, captain.</i>

247
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,769
- So this is what will happen
to russia

248
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,504
If we don't get stein back?

249
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,839
- Not russia.

250
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,875
This is star city.

251
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,177
The rest of world
doesn't look much better.

252
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,480
- That's impossible.

253
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,016
- Not if stein creates a stable
firestorm for the soviets.

254
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,718
Here in 1986,
they're already perilously close

255
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,286
To creating a prototype.

256
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,288
Listen to me, sara. Everything--
everything we've tried

257
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,190
To achieve so far
could be lost.

258
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,826
And not only will my family die
150 years from now,

259
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,296
But your family,
your city...

260
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,766
Your entire 21st-century world
will suffer.

261
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,236
<i>â™ª</i> â™ª

262
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,739
- That's why we're gonna
get stein back

263
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,474
Before vostok can break him.

264
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:54,312
- Well, I-I hope so,
but we need a contingency plan.

265
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,047
- What are you saying?

266
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,249
- I'm saying that if at any
point throughout the operation

267
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,020
It becomes clear
that martin is...

268
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,356
Beyond our reach...

269
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,258
- You want me to kill stein?

270
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,296
<i>â™ª</i>

271
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,839
- Impressive how many weapons
you can fit in that outfit...

272
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,578
And how much stupidity raymond
can squeeze into this one.

273
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,414
- The plan is to save him too,
not just stein and your partner.

274
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,750
- Oh, I'm gonna save raymond,
all right,

275
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,252
So I can beat some sense
into him.

276
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,388
And what about you?
- What about me?

277
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,892
- Clearly I'm not the only one
with a side mission.

278
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,862
What did rip keep you
after class to talk about?

279
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:47,198
- He just wanted to go over
a few details of the plan.

280
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,034
- He wants you to take out
the old man, doesn't he?

281
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,703
It's the obvious play.

282
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,505
It's also heartless.

283
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,174
- The plan is to save stein.

284
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,444
And if, for whatever reason,
we can't,

285
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,281
Rip showed me what will happen
to my home in 2016,

286
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,983
To our families.

287
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,219
If stein breaks,
the damage is irreversible.

288
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,689
- Been on a lot of heists,
and even when things got rough,

289
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,858
I never took out one
of my own.

290
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,827
- Well, this isn't
a bank heist.

291
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,096
- First, he left my partner
twisting in the wind.

292
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,032
Now he's gonna have you ice
old silver-top.

293
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,401
We're all just pawns, sara.

294
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,937
Come on, I'm the crook,
you're the assassin--

295
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,772
- He's not just asking me
to kill.

296
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,374
He's asking me to save
the future.

297
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,043
And if, for whatever reason,
we can't save stein,

298
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:36,147
Then I'm gonna do
what needs to be done.

299
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,285
- Huh.
It's just like scout camp.

300
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,053
[chuckles]
man, the food was terrible.

301
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,988
There was one time they gave us
salisbury steak--

302
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,824
- You ever stop talking?

303
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,095
- What I wouldn't give for
a little salisbury steak now.

304
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,770
Hey.
Ray palmer.

305
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,305
- Put your hand down.

306
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,373
- He might know where vostok
is keeping the professor.

307
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,709
- Shut up and eat.

308
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,044
- Do you know if there's
any other place

309
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,245
Where they keep prisoners here?

310
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,681
We're looking for a friend.

311
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,249
- There is a place.

312
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,384
They send you there,
you never come back.

313
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,187
You can hear the screams
all night.

314
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,791
- This place, where is it?

315
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:23,728
- Who said you could eat?

316
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,798
- Hey, he's not hurting
anybody.

317
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,868
- Who is this american
with the pretty teeth?

Must be a comedian, <i>da?</i>

- If this is a bribe,
I politely decline.

326

so proud...

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,272
So american.

328
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,773
- You've already built
a thermocore,

329
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,041
So just build another one.

330
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,311
It'll only take you
eight to ten years.

00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,346
- You thought that, what,
your friends stealing

332
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:19,751
The thermocore
would save the west?

All I need to learn now is how
to stabilize the thermocore,

00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,406
And my dream of creating
a nuclear man will be achieved.

- To what end?

341
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,442
If you launch
a soviet firestorm,

00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,778
The United States will have
no choice but to retaliate.

343
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,212
Both countries
will be annihilated.

00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,282
- And out of the ashes,
we will rise stronger...

345
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,551

526
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,671
- The formula for stabilizing
firestorm, professor.

527
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,541
- This may surprise you,
but in my youth,

528
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,777
I longed to visit russia.

529
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,348
I was obsessed
by your culture--

530
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,384
Rachmaninoff,
dostoyevsky, tolstoy.

531
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,286
- Stop stalling.

532
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:26,357
- It's a shame I-I never got
to see it before the collapse.

533
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,161
- What sort of nonsense
are you talking about?

534
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:36,800
- In 1991, your economy fails,
and your empire crumbles.

535
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,270
But the truth is the world
is better off.

536
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,806
In my time, crooks and thieves
rule your country,

537
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,543
Desperate to hang on to power
and the riches

538
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,812
They divide
amongst their cronies.

539
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:52,316
My country
is by no means perfect,

540
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:56,220
But at least we are free
to criticize our government,

541
00:25:56,222 --> 00:26:01,191
Vote in fair elections,
and love whom we choose.

542
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:05,629
I, uh, hate to break this
to you, dr. Vostok.

543

You are on the wrong side

544

545
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:19,944
But you will help us
change history.

546
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,812
Proceed.

547
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,213

548

<i>His pulse is still strong.</i>

553

554

I know you think
you can't risk losing us,

555
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,432
But that's assuming
we'd fail.

556
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,534

557
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,603

558

To be a part of this team.

561

to risk anyone else.

562
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,613
Ever since--
- carter?

563

His death wasn't your fault.
- I know.

564
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,417
But stein's will be.

565
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,952
- All I got to do
is touch him,

566
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,721
And we can fly
out of there.

567
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,255
- Yeah, once you've scaled
a 50-foot fence

568
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,124
Topped with razor wire,
gotten past eight sharpshooters,

569
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,226
And entered a gulag full
of the most dangerous criminals

570
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,561
In the u.S.S.R.

571
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:13,631
- Okay, so you create
a distraction,

572
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:17,134
And I'll fly jax in,
and no one will see us.

573
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,535
- Listen...

574
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:22,873
You're playing chess without
all your pieces on the board.

575
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,809
- Maybe you're right.

576
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,711
- So that's a "yes"?

577
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,984
- You call that a flame?

578
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,220
- Ah.
Nice costume.

579
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:39,123
- Got one for you too.

580
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,591
Wakey, wakey.

581
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:42,960
Time to shrink...
Or not.

582
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,795
Let's go.
- What about him?

583
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,230
We can't ditch him.
He won't survive.

584
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,266
- Two guards walking
out of here--not suspicious.

585
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,669
Two guards carrying him out--
suspicious.

586
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,203
- He took a beating for me.

587
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,873
- Raymond would take a beating
for a total stranger.

588
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,442
Mick, if our time in the can
taught us anything,

589
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,010
It's we look
after each other.

590
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,413
It's you and me, right?

591
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,818
- So, if we enter here,
we can cut the circuit breaker.

592
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,353
- Shutting off all the power.

593
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,455
- Distracting the guards and
giving us time to save our team.

594
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,490
<i>- The probability of this plan</i>
<i>being successful--</i>

595
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,192
- There is a 15-second window

596
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,827
Where the sharpshooters
on the tower

597
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,429
Aren't covering the breaker.

598
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,231
- Which means that somebody
would have to run 120 yards

599
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,800
In less than 12 seconds.

600
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,602
<i>- Given mr. Jackson tore his</i>
<i>anterior cruciate ligament--</i>

601
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:29,606
- Have a little faith,
gideon.

602
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,408
You can do this.

603
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,511
I know you can.

604
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,013
- It's done.

605
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,583
- You know, I've never seen
a theorem so simple,

606
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,151
So poetic before.

607
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,488
With this, I can decelerate
the subject's rate of fission

608
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,725
And decrease
core body temperature.

609
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,461
Yet something's missing.

610
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,030
- I'm telling you,
that is the equation--

611
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:56,734
Everything you need to build
a quantum splicer.

612
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,303
[both grunt]

613
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,605

Explain.

615
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,175
- I cut myself.
- Impossible.

616
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,444
You've been monitored
ever since your arrival here.

617
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,413
So, unless some--

618
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:16,153
So, unless someone else was cut,
yet it appears on your body...

619
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,122
- That's preposterous.
- No, no, no.

620
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,724
You are somehow connected
to the burning man.

621
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,159
That's how you were able
to absorb

622

The nuclear energy
at luskavic.

623
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,095
- You are mistaken.

624
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,830
- No, you didn't only create
firestorm.

625
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,799
You are one half

626

627
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,569

628
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,806
And to think, all this time..,

629
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,441
You were the missing link.
- Listen to me.

630
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,911
It is extremely rare to find
two people who are compatible,

631
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,546

632
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,581

Gideon, camouflage the ship.

873
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,000
This doesn't look like
the type of place

874
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,303
We want to linger out
in the open.

876
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,942
- That looks a lot like
a palmer tech building,

877
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:22,779
But why does it have
a smoak logo on it?

878
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,781
- Wait.
This is star city.

879
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,050
I thought you said
the time line was safe.

880
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:30,854
- Yeah, star city was intact
in 2016.

881
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,689
This...

882
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,124
This is 2046.

883
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,392
- Don't move!

884
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:39,128
[gun clicks]
- oh, thank god.

885
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,231
- I said don't move.

00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,967
- It's me.

888
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,635
It's sara.

889
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,837
- Hey, oliver, look,

890
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,640
I-I know it's been a long time,
but don't you remember

891
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:53,209
That rip hunter recruited us
to become legends?

892
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,545

893
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:58,848
- I never heard
of any legends.
