1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,680
You lost, miss?

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,400
This is Wayne Manor?

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,840
Yeah, but not sure
you should be here.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,280
I'll point you back to the road
if you're lost.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,480
No, thanks.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,160
I am where I need to be.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,320
Open him.

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,440
Keep it tight here.

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,440
Better?

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
Better.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
If you wanna test yourself,

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,960
you should come with me
to the Midtown Bridge.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,000
- You've climbed it?
- Yeah, to the top.

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,920
Kids go up there to make out
all the time.

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I could take you if you want?

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,520
Okay. I'd like that.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
Let me ask you a question.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,560
What's up with all the weird homework
about your mom and dad?

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm trying to understand
why it happened.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,040
There's no why.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,080
Bad stuff happens.
You... you gotta get over it.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
Maybe you're right.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,640
Of course, I'm right.

24
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,000
You wanna kiss me?

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
No, thank you.

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,840
No?

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,720
I would like to, but I can't help
feeling you have an ulterior motive.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,040
I don't imagine you consider me
a suitable romantic partner.

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,200
So, why would you wanna kiss me?
I don't know.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
You think too much, kid.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm just trying to be nice.

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,280
No offense,
you don't strike me as a nice person.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
What do you mean? I'm nice.

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,440
I don't mean
you're not a good person,

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,160
but you're not nice.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,360
You don't care much for other people.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,520
Screw you, orphan.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,880
Climb the damn bridge on your own.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Yes, hello, miss. How can I help?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,960
- Oh, dear.
- My car, it went off the road.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,200
- Please.
- Please, come in.

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Come in, at once.

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,680
- If you could call an ambulance.
- Where exactly are you hurt?

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,000
Alfred.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Is everything all right?

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,280
No, Master Bruce. This lady's
been involved in a car accident.

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Run. Run!

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This better be a way out.

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
The old servant's hallway,
it's through the closet.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
- We need to help Alfred...
- There's no time.

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
Bruce, come on.

52
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
Alfred might be hurt.
I can't leave him.

53
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,720
He told you to run.

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
Fine.

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,280
Stay, but I'm out.

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,480
Bruce!

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,440
{\an5}Local P.D. is searching the woods.
So far, no sign of Bruce or Selina.

58
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,760
{\an5}What can you tell me
about this woman?

59
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,920
{\an5}She was in her early 30's.

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,840
{\an5}Pretty tasty fighter, actually.

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,680
Mate, it's just a scratch.

62
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,840
{\an5}Shove off, will you? Got stuff to do.

63
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,720
{\an5}Look, we got 50 police in the woods,
even more on the roads.

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
{\an5}We need to focus on this woman
and her people.

65
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
{\an5}- What can you tell me?
- They were trying to kill us.

66
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,480
And your bloody little girl
brought them here.

67
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
We don't know that yet.

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,920
Jim.

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,800
{\an5}You must be Alfred Pennyworth.

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,680
{\an5}- Nice job out there.
- Yeah, well, not nice enough, eh?

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,880
This was taken off the dead guy.
Nothing else. No keys, no ID, nada.

72
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,440
Now, I know this girl.

73
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,920
She was grabbed
by the child snatchers.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
And now she's getting attacked by
assassins at Wayne freaking Manor?

75
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,080
{\an5}What the hell is going on, compadre?

76
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
{\an5}- What, you hadn't told him?
- Told me what?

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,600
{\an5}Selina Kyle was in the alley
the night the Waynes were murdered.

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,720
{\an5}She saw the killer's face.

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,280
{\an5}For Pete's sake,
don't do this to me.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,680
{\an5}Harvey Dent in the DA's office
is investigating Dick Lovecraft.

81
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,200
He thinks Lovecraft is connected
to the Wayne killings.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,920
{\an5}So, he leaked that we had a witness.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,760
{\an5}He thought he could spook Lovecraft.
Get him to reveal himself.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,160
{\an5}Why, that's a hell of a plan.
How did it work out? Bravo.

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,520
{\an5}Thought she was safe.
No one knew she was here.

86
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,720
{\an5}Well, you were wrong, weren't you,
you plank?

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
{\an5}How did they know?

88
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
{\an5}Why didn't you tell me
about this foolishness?

89
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
Because you would've tried
to stop me.

90
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,080
{\an5}Of course, I would've, you putz.

91
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
What the hell are you thinking?

92
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
The Wayne case is closed.
It is closed!

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,760
- You know damn well it's not!
- Don't tell me what I know!

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Would you shut up? The pair of you!

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,600
You can argue later.

96
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,480
Right now,
we need to find Master Bruce.

97
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,360
{\an5}All right.

98
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,120
{\an5}If they don't come back soon,
they would've gone to Gotham.

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,560
{\an5}Selina feels safe there.

100
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
Good luck trying to find her
in the city. Street kid like that?

101
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,520
But you will help us find her, right?

102
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,960
{\an5}Yeah. Of course I will,
because I have to be crazy.

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
Thank you.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,400
{\an5}All right, I'll focus on Lovecraft.
I'll find him.

105
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
{\an5}If he's behind this,

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
{\an5}I'll get him to call off
the contract.

107
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
How you gonna do that?

108
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,920
I don't know I'll think of something.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
{\an5}Run the streets, huh?
Focus on your contacts.

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
- Go to work.
- I'm coming with you.

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,920
{\an5}All right.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
{\an5}You're pretty handy for a valet.

113
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,640
{\an5}Butler, mate.

114
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,560
I'm a butler.

115
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,120
- We need to call Alfred.
- You see any phones?

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
{\an5}No.

117
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,240
{\an5}Perhaps we should go back
to my house.

118
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
{\an5}If the police are there,
we'll know it's safe.

119
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,840
{\an5}Yeah, right.

120
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
{\an5}The police will make it safe?

121
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,880
We have to contact the police
at some point.

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,480
Someone tried to kill you.

123
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,960
Me?

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,520
Nobody knew I was there.

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,400
It's your house.
Someone wants to kill you.

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,960
Why would anyone wanna kill me?

127
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,440
Must be all that lame detective work
you're doing.

128
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,800
Paid off good, huh?

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Cheer up.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,720
We're cool.

131
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
We lost them.

132
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,840
- I'm worried about Alfred.
- Relax.

133
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,840
Once I got you safely hidden
in the city, I'll find you a phone.

134
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Thank you.

135
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,560
- I appreciate your help.
- Hey.

136
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,400
Just trying to be nice.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,120
How did Maroni know
where my money was?

138
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,440
Well, that's a very good question.

139
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,840
Not to criticize,
but you could've just called me.

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm going to ask you once more.

141
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,920
How did Maroni know
where I kept my money? No one knew.

142
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,920
The robbery at the armory...

143
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,400
that wasn't Maroni.

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,120
I thought we were friends.

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,840
We had an understanding.

146
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,320
You tell me every move Maroni makes.

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,920
What happened?

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,720
When did you turn on me?

149
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,880
Never, Don Falcone.

150
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,520
I swear. Never.

151
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Maroni had nothing to do
with the armory job.

152
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,480
I... I would know.
I would've told you.

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
Who was it if not Maroni?

154
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,200
And how did they know about my
money?

155
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,600
Thank you, Liza. Won't be long.

156
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,760
I'll come back.

157
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
I asked you a question.

158
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,440
Oh, you have a mole, obviously.

159
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,000
Which is not Maroni's forte, is it?

160
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
This is someone else.

161
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,240
Someone artful.

162
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,280
Someone close to you.

163
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,920
I know who you're going to name.

164
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,440
But your hatred of Fish makes me
doubt anything you say against her.

165
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,880
With respect...

166
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,320
I don't understand
why you still tolerate her existence.

167
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
She has proved her disloyalty
a hundred times.

168
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,520
She wants your head.

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,360
Like half the people who work for me.

170
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,920
Fish makes me a lot of money.

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,360
I can handle Fish Mooney or whatever
son of a bitch did this to me.

172
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Tell me how to find the mole.

173
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,720
You leave that to me, Don Falcone.

174
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,040
Dirty work.
I'll find your mole for you.

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,520
Trust me...

176
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,280
he'll belong to Fish.

177
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
Bring me proof.

178
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,680
- I don't get it.
- You, Gabe, not get it?

179
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,840
<i>Quelle suprise.</i>

180
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,400
What, pray, don't you get?

181
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,560
Why not just tell Falcone the truth?

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,920
It was that Liza girl
that betrayed him.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,120
Timing, Gabriel.

184
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Timing is everything.

185
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,280
And Liza is a time bomb.

186
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,080
Just wait a while.

187
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,040
Then watch and learn.

188
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
Stay there in case he shows.

189
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Lovecraft's not home.

190
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,400
Housekeeper hasn't seen him
since yesterday.

191
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,840
Allen says he didn't come in
to his office.

192
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,000
He and Montoya are watching.

193
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,760
How'd the killers find my witness?

194
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,520
Let's keep calm here. It's a win.

195
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,640
We made Lovecraft panic.
This is a panic move.

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,760
A win?
There's two children out there

197
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,720
with professional assassins
coming after them.

198
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Bruce and Selina could end up dead.

199
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll get Lovecraft to call them off.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
How did they know?

201
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
I never told you her name,
let alone where she was hiding.

202
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,480
- So you couldn't have...
- I should say not.

203
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,720
And you never mentioned my name
to anyone, right?

204
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,240
No, we agreed.
I didn't mention any names out loud.

205
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
No names out loud?

206
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,120
What about whispering?

207
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't hold out on me. I'll know.

208
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
For deep background,

209
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,400
I leaked your name
to a couple select sources.

210
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,680
I had to for credibility.
You're the Wayne murders cop.

211
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,920
Damn it. That's how they got to her.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm surprised it took them this long
to find her.

213
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
This is on you, Dent.

214
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,320
I'll stipulate <i>mea culpa</i>.
Kick my ass, be my guest.

215
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,720
But let's find Lovecraft first
and get him to call off the killers.

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,280
He's not at home. Not at his office.
He could've left Gotham.

217
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Someone could be hiding him.

218
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,600
Lovecraft has got a couple of condos

219
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,160
that he keeps under his mistress's
name.

220
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,760
One up in Stevensburgh
and one uptown.

221
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,200
I'll take the one uptown.

222
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,960
If anything's happened
to these kids...

223
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,200
We know you ran with a girl called
Cat.

224
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,600
She's in serious danger.

225
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Who isn't, right? Crazy world.

226
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,840
How much?

227
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,360
There's 100.

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
All right, listen.

229
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,240
I don't know where Cat lives,
all right?

230
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,600
She's private about stuff like that.

231
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,560
But I heard that she got a new fence
because her old one got popped.

232
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
- He'd know where to find her.
- Who's the fence?

233
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,320
I don't know.

234
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,800
- But I know who would know.
- Oh, yeah? Who's that?

235
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,600
Damn it. Save your cheese.

236
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,400
I'll beat the truth out of this kid
with a roll of quarters.

237
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
Yo, ask Fish Mooney.

238
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,920
She runs all the fences.

239
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,200
Forgive me for shocking you.

240
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,520
But let me give you some context
here.

241
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,680
I love Bannion. We came up together.

242
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
But he was supposed to guard
the armory, and he didn't.

243
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,720
And maybe, just maybe,
he looked the other way.

244
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,720
I don't know.

245
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
So, what do I do?

246
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,800
- Let it lie?
- Boss, we understand.

247
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
Whoever else was involved
will very soon

248
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,040
wish they could die quickly
like Bannion.

249
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,080
In the meantime, all of us must do
what's right for the family.

250
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,440
Each of your tariffs
will increase 25 percent

251
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,560
until we've built the reserves again.

252
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
No disrespect, that's high.

253
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
A little bit.

254
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,680
What do you think, Fish?
Am I being fair?

255
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,360
We're family.
We sink or swim together.

256
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,320
You could all learn from Fish.
She trusts me.

257
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,760
Trust me and I'll trust you,
it goes both ways.

258
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,920
Let's eat.

259
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
There's a phone. Come on.

260
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,920
I don't, I don't carry coins.
Do you have any coins?

261
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,520
Nope, not a dime.

262
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Why does Alfred matter so much?
He's just your butler.

263
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,160
He's my family.

264
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,560
Good luck, kid. See you around maybe.

265
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,360
What? Wait.

266
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,240
Look, those bad guys were there
for me.

267
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,080
Not you.

268
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,280
You have nothing to worry about.
Go home.

269
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,000
- But you said...
- I was just trying to freak you out.

270
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,720
- I was playing with you.
- You were playing with me?

271
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,000
- That's kind of cruel, isn't it?
- Yeah.

272
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
No, look. You're right about me.

273
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,960
I'm not nice.

274
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,160
Not like you.

275
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,840
- You got a nice way about you.
- A nice way?

276
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
Yeah. That's why I said
you were the target,

277
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,240
so you know, we could hang out
a while longer.

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I see.

279
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,680
It's very convoluted reasoning.

280
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,120
Whatever.

281
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,120
Anyhow, it's been cool.
I'm gonna disappear.

282
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,840
- You can't do that.
- I wasn't asking.

283
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,720
You can't disappear.
You have to come home with me.

284
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,320
When Detective Gordon finds a man
who killed my parents,

285
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
you have to testify.

286
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,040
You really think
that was ever going to happen?

287
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,920
Grow up, B.

288
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
No, don't. You won't make it.

289
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,920
Help.

290
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
You're crazy.

291
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,320
Please don't run off again.
I'm out of breath.

292
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,880
Okay, kiddo.

293
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,760
You earned it.

294
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,400
You wanna hang with me? That's cool.
But my world, my rules.

295
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
You do what I say.

296
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,360
Yes, ma'am.

297
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,160
Why can't I call Alfred
or Detective Gordon to say I'm okay?

298
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,360
Because we're disappearing.

299
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
You gotta be like smoke.

300
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,480
Smoke doesn't make phone calls.

301
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,160
- What is this place?
- The Flea.

302
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,600
It's like the mall for street kids
without the crappy music.

303
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,240
We'll be safe here until dark.

304
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,080
Falcone's making me nervous.

305
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,880
If he suspects it was us
who blew up his money,

306
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,360
why hasn't he made a move?

307
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
Because he can't be sure.

308
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,640
There are ten other people
who could've done this.

309
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,640
- So, what now?
- You're going to stick to the plan.

310
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,600
You're gonna reach out
to Saviano and Turski.

311
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,680
They are both very angry
their taxes have been raised.

312
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,560
And they're worried
about ending up like Bannion.

313
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,000
They're ready.

314
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,480
The old man is herding
his sheep toward me.

315
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,520
- You got it, boss.
- All right.

316
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,240
Hello, gentlemen.

317
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,480
Busy day, Harvey.

318
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,600
Come back next year.

319
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,720
Hand to God, Butch, I'll be quicker
than a sailor on shore leave.

320
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,880
Thief we're tracking down.
Look familiar? Goes by Cat.

321
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,320
- Nope.
- Maybe Fish knows her.

322
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,880
Fish knows everyone. Fish is busy.

323
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
She works with one of your fences,
a new guy.

324
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
What's a fence?

325
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
Come on, Butch, be nice.

326
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,040
This is important.

327
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,680
- Where's Fish?
- I told you, she's busy.

328
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,440
I once knew a fella called Butch.

329
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,240
Yeah, he was a Whitechapel lad.

330
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,840
Now, we called him Butch, you see,
because he wasn't.

331
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,680
It was a wind-up.
It was like a joke name.

332
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,280
In fact, he was a horrible
little toerag.

333
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,480
Wait. I can't tell. Are you...?

334
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Are you threatening me?
Is he threatening me?

335
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,960
Yeah? You gotta...

336
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Now, where is this Fish?

337
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,240
Right here.

338
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,160
So, what's the fuss?

339
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,800
They're just fooling around.

340
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,880
We're looking for this girl.

341
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,120
Street thief, goes by Cat.

342
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,520
Works with one of your fences.

343
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,880
Looks familiar.

344
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
What's the urgency?

345
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
Professional killers
are looking for her.

346
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Professionals?

347
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,560
This wouldn't be the Lovecraft
witness, would it?

348
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,240
- How'd you know?
- Streets talk.

349
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,360
Using her to scare Lovecraft.

350
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,160
She saw the Waynes' killer,
supposedly.

351
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Yeah.

352
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,200
And you're here because you want me
to help you find her, don't you?

353
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,240
Yes.

354
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Harvey.

355
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,680
Why in the world would I help you
find her of all people?

356
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,640
She has Bruce Wayne with her, miss.

357
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,160
Really?

358
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,520
Yes, miss.

359
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm Alfred Pennyworth,
the boy's legal guardian.

360
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,080
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

361
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,560
Miss Mooney, we need your help.

362
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,760
Well, you see, Alfred,
I would love to help you.

363
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,000
But it would infringe
upon my personal interests.

364
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
And why would I do that?

365
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,280
You have a very eloquent gaze,
if I may say so, Miss Mooney.

366
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,720
And I can see that you're not a woman

367
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,560
that would let petty
self-interest outweigh...

368
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,840
honor...

369
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
and compassion.

370
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll make some calls.

371
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,120
But remember this kindness.

372
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,600
Much better.

373
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,080
Really?

374
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,200
- I'm not sure.
- You look bad ass.

375
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,520
No lie.

376
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Hey, Cat.

377
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,000
Ivy, what are you doing here?

378
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,560
What've you been up to? I thought...?

379
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah, juvie caught me.

380
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,720
- I got adopted upstate.
- Didn't take?

381
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,080
Good people, but they wanted me
to cut my hair, dress nice...

382
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I know you.

383
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,880
- You're Mario Pepper's daughter.
- Yes. Who are you?

384
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm Bruce Wayne.

385
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,200
Yes, you are.
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

386
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,760
- Stay cool now, Ivy.
- I am cool.

387
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,000
Why are you telling me that?
Why are you telling me what to do?

388
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm not, I'm just saying I don't want
you to get mad at him, he's a friend.

389
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,920
Why would I get mad at him?
It's not his fault, is it?

390
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,040
Did you kill my father?

391
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,680
Did you make my mother cut
her wrists?

392
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,640
- No.
- Somebody did.

393
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,240
Somebody did, but not him.

394
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,720
- How are you doing? You doing okay?
- I'm okay.

395
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,520
- And you?
- I'm doing great. How do I look?

396
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,800
You look good.

397
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
Have you seen Clyde the fence around?

398
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah. He's working out of the factory
on the Narrows.

399
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,960
- He's cute, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

400
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,600
Thanks, Ivy. Good to see you.

401
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,360
- Oh, we gotta go run and see Clyde.
- Okay, fine.

402
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
Bye then.

403
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,080
Keep moving.

404
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,560
She's just a little girl.

405
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,160
- Why are you so scared of her?
- Because she's scary.

406
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,560
Don't look back.

407
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
GCPD.

408
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Drop it.

409
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,720
Kick it over.

410
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,880
You're under arrest.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

411
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,440
Murder? Me, murder?

412
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,800
- What are you talking about?
- You put a hit out on Selina Kyle.

413
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,440
No, not me.

414
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,560
Same people that came after her
came after me too.

415
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,320
They attacked me on the street.
Why do you think I'm hiding in here?

416
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,960
- Why would they come after you?
- Why do they ever?

417
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,200
Because I know too much.

418
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,600
Cut the crap.
Who are you so scared of?

419
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,640
You have no idea, do you?

420
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,200
You think I'm the big wheel.

421
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,640
When it comes to the crunch, kid,
I'm nobody. Just like you.

422
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
And... and the people who really,
truly run this city,

423
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
they're watching you huff and puff
and run around crusading.

424
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
And they are laughing at you.

425
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
You're so deep in the maze,
you can't see over the wall.

426
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,280
- Tell me something I don't know.
- My briefcase.

427
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
- Under the bed. Files.
- Go.

428
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,560
Right before the Waynes got killed...

429
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,080
there was a run
on Wayne Enterprises' stock

430
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
like somebody knew
something bad would happen.

431
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
So I figured, I deserved a cut.

432
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,480
So, I started digging.

433
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
I have come for that man.

434
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,640
You need not get hurt.

435
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,240
That was nice.

436
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Let's do it again sometime.

437
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
- Yeah?
- Fish got a lead on the kids.

438
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,560
Place in the Narrows called
The Factory.

439
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,760
<i>Word is Cat used a fence
named Clyde. He hangs there.</i>

440
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,880
<i>We're on our way now.</i>

441
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
Alfred, let's go.

442
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,320
Fish, thank you.

443
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,640
You owe me.

444
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,120
Who don't I owe?

445
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,440
Mr. Lovecraft?

446
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,480
No, no, no.

447
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
This is Detective Gordon.

448
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,600
Badge number 231611.
Reporting a body at 1257 Antioch.

449
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
Cat.

450
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,440
My baby.

451
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,000
Hey, Clyde.

452
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,640
Well, what have you got for me?

453
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Hey.

454
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,040
Sweet swag.

455
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,560
- Not your usual junk.
- I'm moving on up.

456
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,600
- Where'd you get this?
- You want a story or the swag?

457
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,520
- How much?
- A thousand bucks.

458
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,120
- Please, give me a break.
- That's rock bottom, you know it is.

459
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,520
- Fifty bucks.
- Fifty?

460
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,160
This pen is real gold.
That's an antique jade netsuke.

461
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,120
It's worth $2,000 on its own.

462
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,800
And who is this well-spoken little
dude?

463
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,160
Never mind who he is.
Look, 500 is rock bottom.

464
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,200
- Why are you wasting my time?
- Relax.

465
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm sure we can make a deal.

466
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,600
No, thanks. We'll go elsewhere.

467
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,080
Cool down, Cat.

468
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,680
Or we'll poke your little friend's
eyes out. That's it.

469
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,760
Relax.

470
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,440
I've got some friends coming over
who would just love to meet you.

471
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,440
It's all there.

472
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,880
Don't look so anxious.

473
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,040
Yeah, well...

474
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,160
you guys are kind of sporty.

475
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,640
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

476
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,040
She better be.

477
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,200
Find me something heavy.

478
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,680
Am I the only one in this damn town
who waits for backup?

479
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
Bruce!

480
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Follow!

481
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,320
- Where's Alfred?
- He's in there.

482
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,600
Go.

483
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Down!

484
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,600
Where's your girlfriend?

485
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,760
- I have no idea.
- Don't make me hurt you.

486
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,240
You're not on the contract.

487
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
She's gone.

488
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,760
Some advice, kid.

489
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,040
Don't ever mistake bravery
for good sense.

490
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Alfred.

491
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,320
Fancy seeing you here.

492
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,240
You all right?

493
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I'm fine.

494
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
How are you?

495
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,320
You really scared me, Master Bruce.

496
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,960
If you die...

497
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,760
who employs butlers anymore?

498
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh, thank God.

499
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,040
Lovecraft was a beloved pillar
of this community.

500
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,800
A dedicated servant of Gotham.

501
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,560
So, what do I tell the media, huh?

502
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Any ideas?

503
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,200
He was a crook.

504
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,200
We nearly had him, and he was killed
by whoever he would've implicated

505
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,480
if he had lived to testify. Say that.

506
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,640
Forgive me if I can't get behind
your approach.

507
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,800
It was your gun.

508
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I didn't kill him.

509
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,280
On balance, I believe you.
On balance.

510
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,960
- Suicide is cleaner...
- It wasn't suicide, it was murder.

511
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,080
It was suicide.

512
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,960
He went mad
under your relentless questioning

513
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,840
overpowered you and killed himself
with your gun.

514
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
And don't tell me otherwise.

515
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,240
What do you say, counselor?

516
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,880
I'm at your disposal, Mayor James.

517
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,480
I'm sorry if we've caused you
any disquiet.

518
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,040
Disquiet.

519
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
You arrogant clowns.

520
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,280
You're hacking away
at the very foundations of this city.

521
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,320
Trying to take me down.

522
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,680
Should have the both of you stuffed
in a sack and thrown in the river.

523
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,360
But I can't do that.

524
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,040
Two scapegoats would look like panic.

525
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
But one of you is going down,
mark my words.

526
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,480
Sir, that's not right.

527
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Hush.

528
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,440
It's not you, Dent.

529
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,600
Obviously, it's Mr. Gordon.

530
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
Sir, I protest.

531
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,720
But not too much.

532
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,320
You see, Counselor Dent
knows how to walk the line.

533
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,640
He knows where the edge is.

534
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,960
You, Mr. Gordon,
do not know where the edge is.

535
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,720
Mayor James...

536
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,920
kiss my ass.

537
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,400
Dick Lovecraft's suicide
is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

538
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,680
Fighting the trumped-up charges
of an overzealous police officer...

539
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,960
was too much for him.

540
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,400
You have my word, Dick.

541
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,840
This officer is being dealt with.

542
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,640
Arkham Asylum?

543
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,360
- A security guard for nutjobs?
- Criminal nutjobs, yeah.

544
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,680
- Are you taking the assignment?
- It's that or quit.

545
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,000
So quit.

546
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,720
That's what they want me to do.

547
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Damn, Jim.

548
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,560
Whoever your next partner is,

549
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
he or she will be a lot easier
than me.

550
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
- Ed?
- Detective Gordon.

551
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,120
I hear you've been thrown out
in disgrace. Is this true?

552
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,040
Yeah, it is.

553
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm gonna write a letter to the boss.

554
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,400
You do that.

555
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,240
Which boss should I write to?

556
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,560
Forget it, Ed.

557
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,200
That's the breaks, huh?

558
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
You take care.

559
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,240
Maybe you should take him with you.

560
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,880
- You'd miss him if he was gone.
- No, I wouldn't.

561
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,120
Let me buy you a drink sometime.

562
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,040
Soon.

563
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,640
Your security still sucks.

564
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,680
No one's hunting for me.

565
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,520
I didn't expect to see you again.

566
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,080
Never said goodbye.

567
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,440
No, we didn't.

568
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,760
Didn't want to be rude.

569
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,600
- It... it's... it's good to see you.
- Here.

570
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,200
Thank you, but you could keep this.

571
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,080
- You need it more than I do.
- No.

572
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,960
Let's keep things honest between us.

573
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,720
I'm keeping this one anyway.

574
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,560
Having a little chat, Master Bruce?

575
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,680
Thinking out loud.

576
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,520
Right.

577
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,920
Right. Of course you are.

578
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,040
Shall I take that for you?

579
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,200
The old house seems very quiet
without her, doesn't it?

580
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,600
Yes, it does.
