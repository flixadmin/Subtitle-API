1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:06,909
I've decided that my life is better
without mentally ill people around me.

2
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:12,396
Then I'll ask you: What happens
after I've rescued you?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
He's manic!

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,820
That's what's happening!

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,317
So can you please just stay away?

6
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:23,307
What about asking Even how he feels?

7
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:27,446
He isn't brain dead just because
he had a maniac episode.

8
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,738
Just talk to him when he has calmed down.

9
00:01:49,794 --> 00:02:01,294
Hi Sonja. I just wanted to tell you that
Even is with me if his parents are worried.

10
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:15,344
And I am sorry if it's because
of me that he is not doing well.

11
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,031
SATURDAY 10:15

12
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,599
Hi!

13
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,949
Hi!

14
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,876
I don't have...

15
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:45,558
The telephone number of his parents so...

16
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:46,487
Yeah.

17
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
But they know that he is with you.

18
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,505
He has sent them a text.

19
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,289
Okay.

20
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,382
I just called to say

21
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,766
that I am sorry for the last time.

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,733
It's okay.

23
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:10,626
No, but I didn't mean
to get angry with you.

24
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,031
It wasn't your fault.

25
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,108
At all.

26
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:16,654
Yeah, but...

27
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,919
Well you...

28
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:22,346
You were worried. So I understand.

29
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,322
Hmm.

30
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:29,857
And it's not your fault
that Even is depressed.

31
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,375
He is bipolar and...

32
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,748
Well, it's not your fault.

33
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:37,906
Okay?

34
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,620
Yeah.

35
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,554
Okay.

36
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:43,915
Good.

37
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:45,621
But...

38
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,009
Should I get him to his
parents or something?

39
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:56,312
I actually think it's good
for him to be with you.

40
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:02,698
Okay.

41
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,850
I don't know. Is there anything I can do?

42
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,269
For him?

43
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:10,957
No, not really.

44
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,422
You just need to...

45
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,032
Be there for him.

46
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,941
And when everything seems
hopeless, you just

47
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,659
Take one day at a time.

48
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:30,181
And if one day becomes too much,
then just take one hour at a time.

49
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,979
And if one hour becomes too much,
then just take one minute at a time.

50
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,109
Hi.

51
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:52,003
Hi.

52
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,453
Hungry?

53
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:12,976
What time is it?

54
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,355
Around...

55
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,166
Ten thirty or something.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
I should leave.

57
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,272
Why?

58
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:30,505
Because I don't want you to lie here and
feel like you have to take care of me.

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,140
I don't feel like I am looking after you.

60
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:38,452
And why?

61
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:40,414
Why is that wrong?

62
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,462
There's nothing wrong with it.

63
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,213
I just can't stand that
you lie here all sad.

64
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,118
I am not sad.

65
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,807
I just know that this
isn't going to work out.

66
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,130
Why do you say that?

67
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,092
Because it's true.

68
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,952
I'm just going...

69
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:34,936
to hurt you.

70
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,010
And then you'll hate me.

71
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,660
No.

72
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:56,987
You don't know shit about
how this is going to end.

73
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,386
We might get a nuclear bomb dropped
on our heads tomorrow and...

74
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,916
and then discusing this is
just a waste of time, so

75
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:09,216
I suggest that you just stop
talking about the future.

76
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,830
And then the two of us will just
take this thing completely chill.

77
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,201
Let's play a game.

78
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,543
It goes like this...

79
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,882
It's called

80
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,690
Isak and Even: Minute a minute.

81
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,210
It's about...

82
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:45,245
The only thing we have to worry about

83
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,651
is the next minute.

84
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:57,918
Are you up for it?

85
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,182
Okay.

86
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,638
What should we do this minute then?

87
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,232
This minute we'll kiss.

88
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,119
That's chill.

89
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:18,217
That's chill.

90
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,133
MONDAY 10:36

91
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,339
But Eskild, if he is asleep
just let him sleep, you know?

92
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:53,265
Shouldn't I wake him up and
ask him how he is doing?

93
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,258
No. Why would you do that?

94
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,526
I don't know. It was you who
said to take care of him.

95
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,822
Yeah, I asked you to keep an eye
on him because he is depressed,

96
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,830
not to look after him as he was a baby.
Just let him sleep.

97
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,861
Okay. I think he just woke up.

98
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,919
Yeah, okay. Talk to you later.

99
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,370
Hi, Isak!

100
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:13,788
Hi, Vilde!

101
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:17,147
Have you seen the message I
posted on the kose group?

102
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,683
Kose group?

103
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,618
No, no. I haven't seen it.

104
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,504
Why are you laughing?

105
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,031
Nothing, I just...

106
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:30,784
Had almost forgotten that the
kose group even existed.

107
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:33,041
Are you still in it?

108
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,880
This is when the revue starts.

109
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:38,418
You can't just be part of the
partying and not do any work.

110
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:41,981
No, of couse I'm still in
the kose group, Vilde.

111
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,224
Who do you think I am?

112
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,216
Okay, because all the groups have
this Christmas get-together.

113
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:50,026
And it went so well the last time we
had the pre-game at your place.

114
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:52,366
That I was wondering if we
could have it at yours?

115
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,059
Yeah!

116
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:56,793
Yeah?

117
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,772
Is it okay with your roomies?

118
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,919
I am sure it is. Jesus Christ, yeah!

119
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Okay. I'll send out the invites then!

120
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:03,989
Go ahead!

121
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:26,781
Hello.

122
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,583
Hi.

123
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:32,978
There's this asshole in second year.

124
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:37,153
Who will be hosting this Christmas
get-together with the kose group.

125
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,695
On Friday?

126
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:42,595
So, he was wondering
if you wanted to come?

127
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:45,531
Because he thinks that
would be really nice.

128
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:52,536
I have switched to the PR-Group. So...

129
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:55,395
But...

130
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:56,917
You...

131
00:10:57,217 --> 00:11:04,250
Should tell the asshole that
I am very glad he asked.

132
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:07,652
I'll tell the asshole, yeah.
He'll appreciate that.

133
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:09,036
Do that.

134
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,719
Yes. Bye.

135
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:11,819
Bye.

136
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:19,498
WEDNESDAY. 16:01

137
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,666
Linn, that way.

138
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:23,866
I was going to kick!

139
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:25,737
No, no, no.

140
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:26,772
Back to him?

141
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:27,668
Yeah!

142
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:28,722
Do you want him to score?

143
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,005
No! No, no, no, no!

144
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:32,427
Come on!!! Fucking spanish fucker!!!

145
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,047
Hello.

146
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,446
Hello.

147
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:41,113
Nice, you are at home. I
am fucking exhausted!

148
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,069
Sore loser?

149
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,496
I'm going to sleep!

150
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:49,127
Cool hanging out with you, Linn!

151
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:53,873
Hello.

152
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:54,792
Hello.

153
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,270
Everything okay?

154
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,194
Did you ask all of your
roomies to look after me?

155
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:14,771
Hm? No.

156
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,352
Holy fuck! You are such a bad liar!

157
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,091
Uh? Am I a bad liar?

158
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:23,298
Yeah!

159
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:24,491
I am a bad liar?

160
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,712
I am the fucking master liar. There's
no a better liar than me!

161
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,326
I mean, you have no idea what
I've gotten away with.

162
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:32,628
Tell me! What have you gotten away with?

163
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,483
No, I mean, you don't want to know.

164
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:44,723
I like seeing you laugh.

165
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:50,884
Holy fuck, Vilde...

166
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,547
Nagging me so fucking much
about that kose group stuff.

167
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:55,697
The kose group?!?

168
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,150
I had completely forgotten about it!

169
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,727
Yeah. Don't tell her that
because she'll get pissed.

170
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:07,029
She was terrified people just joined
for the revue parties or something.

171
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,490
Well, I was there to meet you.

172
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,733
Seriously?!

173
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,333
Yeah. Did you think I
was there to have fun?

174
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:24,601
Had you seen me before
that first kose meeting?

175
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,390
Yeah.

176
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:30,150
I saw you the first day of school.

177
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,626
Wow!

178
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,816
Fuck!

179
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:42,415
Hi, Vilde!

180
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:47,441
No, we don't have a Christmas tree here.

181
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:50,941
No.

182
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:53,965
Yeah, but...

183
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:58,665
If you are so fucking keen on a Christmas
tree you'll have to buy one yourself.

184
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,883
Well, you can buy a Christmas
tree anywhere, Vilde!

185
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:07,184
In Kiellands plass! There's...

186
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,915
Yeah. Okay, cool.

187
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,931
Bye!

188
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,451
Christmas tree?

189
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,181
Yeah!

190
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:18,595
I haven't told you...

191
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:22,397
Speaking of the Kose group. I'll be hosting
a Christmas get-together here on Friday.

192
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:23,398
Here?

193
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,919
Friday?

194
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,136
Do you wanna come?

195
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:43,191
I have actually promised my mom that...

196
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:45,865
I talked to her today.

197
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:49,617
And she really wanted
me to stop by at home.

198
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:52,922
To eat and stuff.

199
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:58,136
I don't know. I was thinking maybe
I'll just stay there for a while.

200
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,500
Just take it one day at a time.

201
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,175
THURSDAY. 13:55

202
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:33,504
Hey, boys!

203
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:34,508
Hey, Isak.

204
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:35,742
What's up?

205
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:36,846
All good! All good!

206
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,390
Peace!

207
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,017
How is it going with Evak?

208
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:44,238
Good, I guess. We are taking it
day by day, minute by minute.

209
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,400
Minute by minute. Oh holy shit! Listen!

210
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,005
Even and Isak, minute by minute.

211
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,507
That's the kind of shit
you can sell to NRK.

212
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:52,675
People would dig it, man!
I'd watch it myself!

213
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,513
That's kind of fucked up to think about.

214
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:56,095
Why? If you like, banged on TV.

215
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:58,905
You don't think I can handle
watching to guys bang?

216
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:01,608
No, it's more me it's fucked up for.
That you'd be watching us bang.

217
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,664
Because that would be a real turn off.

218
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:05,068
You think I am a turn off?

219
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,854
You are definitely not a turn on.

220
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,730
Bullshit! You'd so bang me if
you had the chance. I know!

221
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:12,781
No!

222
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:16,969
Okay, bullshit. Who would you bang first?
Out of all of us?

223
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:17,978
Mahdi, Jonas or me?

224
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,353
Jonas!

225
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,399
Right! That's what I thought!

226
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,521
Okay, between me and Mahdi, then?

227
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:24,558
Oh! That would be you...

228
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:25,569
Mahdi!

229
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:26,890
Second place, bro!!

230
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:29,532
What the fuck? Why doesn't
anyone want to bang me?

231
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:31,876
You are just desperate.
It's just how it is!

232
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,392
I'm not desperate. I'm super chill.

233
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:37,321
Oh shit, bro! There
are the dance chicks!

234
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:14,428
Hi! You are Isak, right?

235
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,502
Yeah!

236
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:21,546
We just heard that you have a
thing with Even in third year.

237
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:23,891
And so we just wanted
to say that we dig it.

238
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:26,839
It's insanely cute two
guys being together.

239
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,264
Not big deal.

240
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,565
And the dance-group will have a
Christmas meeting this Friday.

241
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,615
You can join, if you want to.

242
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:42,947
I don't think I can because I am going to
the kose group Christmas get-together.

243
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:51,045
- That's too bad.
- We'll see you around.

244
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:54,543
Bye.

245
00:17:58,004 --> 00:17:59,504
- What the fuck?
- Bro?!?

246
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:01,731
What?

247
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:04,713
Christmas get-together
with the kose group?

248
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:08,526
Yeah. I'll be there, you
are welcome to join, guys.

249
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:11,135
And like I'm hosting, you are
more than welcome to come!

250
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:14,360
The gate to paradise was wide open

251
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:17,266
and you are talking about a
get-together with the kose group. Man?

252
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:27,321
Guys, you need to start
getting chicks yourselves.

253
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:34,143
Fucking hell! The world is so unfair!

254
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,673
Fucking hell!

255
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,873
What did he say?

256
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:40,773
Should we ditch him and
go to the other one?

257
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:44,216
@Ledgerina

258
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,199
- Now it is straight.
- No, it is loopsided.

259
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,583
- Now it is loopsided.
- No, it is straight.

260
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,766
- Oh, now it is loopsided.
- No, it's straight.

261
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,412
- Yeah.
- Maybe you are loopsided, Linn?

262
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,532
- No.
- Yes.

263
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:54,914
- I did it!
- I can help you.

264
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:56,732
Where's that from?

265
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:57,961
Drummer boy!

266
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,640
Justin Bieber.

267
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,655
What? He sang that one?

268
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,264
Yeah! He is the one who sings it!

269
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,936
Did the exams go all right for you guys?

270
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:10,224
No. I got a message that I am
failing German and English.

271
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,050
I didn't know there was
a 10% absence limit!

272
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,131
How could you not known about that?

273
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,790
I have told you the entire school year!

274
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,577
Yeah, but I thought
you said that because

275
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,279
you were jealous that I was
hanging out with Kasper a lot.

276
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,759
Why would I be jealous?

277
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,008
Because you are not getting
any dick yourself!

278
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:33,072
I get plenty of dick!

279
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:41,703
Chris...

280
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:45,691
Well, she can have this one.

281
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:46,692
And this one!

282
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:48,785
That one is beautiful!

283
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:50,869
It might be more fitting.

284
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,016
Is it used?

285
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,371
Is it from Eskild?

286
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:57,767
Is it from Eskild?

287
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:00,349
Where is it from, Noora?

288
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:01,994
Oh! Holy fuck!

289
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:03,622
Where is it from?

290
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:05,555
Take it away! Take it
away from the table!

291
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,858
I don't know! I don't know!

292
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,399
- Oh my God!
- Smell it then!

293
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
No? Smell it?!?

294
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:10,980
God! What is your problem?

295
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:13,092
Smell it to see if it smells like dick!

296
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,342
You smell it then! Oh my God!

297
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,871
But Eskild is your friend.

298
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,883
Yeah! That's pretty obvious!

299
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:20,927
You can do it!

300
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,083
Hey!

301
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:24,955
- Is it a fight?
- You are on, you are on.

302
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,951
Exactly! Now you've got the attitude.

303
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:29,543
You are not going to hit Vilde that hard

304
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:30,747
or anything like that but...

305
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,950
What should I do then?

306
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:34,962
You are a predator and she is your prey.
Do you get what I mean?

307
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:36,215
She is what?

308
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:39,115
She is your prey. You are a predator.
You are a lion and she is...

309
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:40,391
Oohhhh! Okay! Okay!

310
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:41,765
Yeah? You know?

311
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:45,065
But you can't make a big deal of it
because then the prey will flee.

312
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,594
Seriously, I am really nervous.

313
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,821
You shouldn't be... Are
you in love or what?

314
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:50,984
I don't know. Maybe.

315
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:51,988
- Oh.
- No!!

316
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,190
Yes, I think so.

317
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:56,259
What if she doesn't say yes?

318
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:58,654
- That's life.
- What is the hint, then?

319
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,803
It's not the end of the
world if it doesn't work.

320
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:03,306
Just think that it is a positive
thing if it works so...

321
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,129
It's fucking awkward if I
stand there and she says no.

322
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:09,782
Yeah, but you don't ask her right
away: "Hey, should we hook up?"

323
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:12,384
- Straighten back, smile a little.
- Should I touch her?

324
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:13,400
If it's appropiate.

325
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:14,602
Do I look good?

326
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Yeah! Nice!

327
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,691
It's a little pumped. I see it.

328
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:19,698
This sweater... I bought
it a size too big.

329
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,978
I have to drink more. Where is the beer?

330
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,530
- Hello.
- Hey.

331
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,427
Be cool, you know?

332
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:26,773
What's up?

333
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,330
We are helping Magnus to bang Vilde.

334
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,224
Wow!

335
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,557
How is it going?

336
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:37,291
He shouldn't be so desperate.
Then I think he's got it!

337
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,567
It's fucking impossible
not to be desperate

338
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,969
when I don't get what it
means to be desperate!

339
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,853
Just imagine... Who do you think
of as a really cool, laid-back guy?

340
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,059
Pretend to be like him.

341
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,960
Try to be that person.

342
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:50,628
- James Bond, then?
- Yeah, sure.

343
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,719
You know what, Magnus?

344
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,828
I think you should go
all in and be yourself.

345
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,930
Take desperate to a whole new level.

346
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:58,948
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:00,697
He's into something.

348
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,759
What do you mean?

349
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:05,972
Show her how desperate
you really are, then!

350
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:07,826
Let it all out!

351
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,441
Take desperate to a new level.

352
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:12,651
Fuck! I am going to do it!

353
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,652
Bye. Talk to you later.

354
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:15,076
I gotta see this.

355
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,811
- Hello.
- Hello.

356
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,446
How is it going?

357
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:23,831
I'm fine.

358
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,781
I have just talked to my mum.

359
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:29,557
And...

360
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,705
The reason she is anoyed is because
she really wants to meet you.

361
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,519
Okay.

362
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:37,302
So...

363
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,486
What do you say if we drop by tomorrow?

364
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:42,551
Yeah.

365
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,262
Yeah?

366
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:44,169
Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:46,985
You don't think this is weird?

368
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,920
No. I don't find anything weird anymore.

369
00:23:49,924 --> 00:23:50,724
Okay.

370
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,845
As long as you are smiling and...

371
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:56,849
I can do that.

372
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,850
Wearing clothes, then...

373
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,514
Then life is chill.

374
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,132
I promise that I will wear clothes.

375
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:14,859
Hello.

376
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:15,934
Sana!

377
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:16,606
Hi.

378
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:18,183
- You have met each other, right?
- The Kose group.

379
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:19,438
Yeah.

380
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:20,872
My biology partner.

381
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:21,988
And friend.

382
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:25,421
Yeah, how is Isak really
doing in biology?

383
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:28,071
He is useful.

384
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:28,783
Huh?!?

385
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:29,806
I guess...

386
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,620
Sana, that's such bullshit!

387
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:35,797
I helped you towards a fucking 5 while
I have been on that 6 the whole year!

388
00:24:35,894 --> 00:24:37,394
I have a Christmas present for you.

389
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
For me?!?

390
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:41,314
What is it?

391
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,459
Open it!

392
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:44,563
Okay. I will open it.

393
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,148
10%!

394
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:54,153
Thank you!

395
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:55,657
What a cool biology partner!

396
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,664
It wasn't of any use for you after all?

397
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,842
I used it right now, didn't I?

398
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:02,377
True!

399
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,364
You are not getting any of this!

400
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,188
It's not good for you.

401
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:17,587
Then it's not good for you either!

402
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,880
It's completely fine for
me, but not for you.

403
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,902
Are you going to be the one who
tells me if it is good or not?

404
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:24,854
Of course I am!

405
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:25,855
That's my job!

406
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,900
- You've got a job?
- Yeah, it's literally my job.

407
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,946
That's why I am doing all this, you know?

408
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,336
I found this poster on Løkka that said

409
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:37,962
"Even Bech Næsheim needs a
support person and boyfriend".

410
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,288
And then you applied?

411
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:40,733
Yeah.

412
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,734
I thought, "Holy fuck, he is so hot!"

413
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,900
That was nice.

414
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:48,617
Yeah.

415
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,627
You are so nice.

416
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:50,954
I could have done it for free

417
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:52,355
but it's nice I'm getting...

418
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,490
Are you getting paid?!?

419
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,867
Yeah, your mom pays me 500 a week.

420
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
What?

421
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:57,723
Yeah!

422
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,228
- No wonder...
- Are you kidding me?

423
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,238
There's no wonder why
she wants to meet me.

424
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:02,376
Holy fuck!!!

425
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:04,050
I'm getting some of that money.

426
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:05,078
- No.
- Yes.

427
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,718
It's my money! You are not getting any.

428
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:17,601
- Yes! Come one!
- No.

429
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:28,225
Hello.

430
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:29,758
Hi.

431
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:39,579
Do you like cats?

432
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,020
Yeah, a lot.

433
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:47,864
I do too.

434
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:56,228
Meow.

435
00:26:58,863 --> 00:26:59,863
What was that?

436
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,445
Nothing.

437
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:05,997
Yes, do it again.

438
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,095
Meow.

439
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,019
I have never had sex before and
I really want to have sex.

440
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:28,654
You are welcome to fuck me.

441
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,533
Thanks.

442
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:49,277
Hi!

443
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:50,304
Hello there!

444
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:51,907
- May I sit down?
- Yeah, absolutely.

445
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:54,853
I'm sitting here with my angel.

446
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:55,519
Yeah.

447
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:58,092
- Does it look nice?
- Very nice.

448
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,288
How are you doing?

449
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:02,700
It's been a long time
since last time we spoke.

450
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:05,334
Yeah! It's been a fucking long
time since we last spoke.

451
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:07,644
It's a little weird. I've
been thinking about it. We...

452
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,145
We used to hang out all the
time, but now it's like...

453
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,650
We only see each other at school.

454
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:12,251
Yeah.

455
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,760
And then it's just "hi" and...

456
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:14,782
We should hang out more.

457
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,810
- Absolutely.
- We should.

458
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:19,344
We really should do something because...

459
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:21,489
I honestly miss the time when we...

460
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:23,522
When we used to hang out more.

461
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:24,914
First upper school
secondary school and...

462
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:25,223
Yeah.

463
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:27,307
The summer vacation before...

464
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:29,326
Before Nissen when it just...

465
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,729
was a lot of drama and
all that stuff, but...

466
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:34,414
But, hey! You've gotten a boyfriend!

467
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,400
Yes. I have.

468
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,618
He is really handsome.

469
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:42,902
He is.

470
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:44,334
You, lucky pig!

471
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:45,729
You better watch out for me!

472
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:47,647
I might steal him.

473
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:53,998
I have...

474
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:57,621
I have been thinking about something.

475
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,946
What's that?

476
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:00,544
Nah, just...

477
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:08,516
I actually wanted to say sorry
for that stuff last year.

478
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,742
When I was...

479
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,842
When I was ruining it for you
and Jonas and all that stuff.

480
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,690
It's not okay.

481
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:15,196
What I did.

482
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,297
I've been thinking about that.

483
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,736
You didn't fuck it up
between Jonas and me.

484
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:22,399
It was Jonas and I who
fucked it up between us.

485
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:25,748
Might be, but...

486
00:29:25,752 --> 00:29:27,685
I still feel like I tricked you.

487
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,690
And..

488
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:33,456
When I told you that I had feelings
for you. That wasn't truth.

489
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:36,893
Hey, I figured that out.

490
00:29:36,912 --> 00:29:38,012
- Yeah?
- Yes.

491
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,156
I'm over it.

492
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:43,798
And you should be too.

493
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:44,979
Seriously.

494
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:48,704
Can't we talk about
your boyfriend instead?

495
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:51,632
Is he "the man of your life"?

496
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:53,581
I don't know that.

497
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,126
No?

498
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,129
Is it important?

499
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:00,458
No...

500
00:30:01,912 --> 00:30:03,012
But...

501
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,217
Is it okay between the two of you?

502
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:06,225
Yeah, yeah!

503
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:08,678
I mean, right now it's amazing

504
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,824
but a week ago it was very bad so

505
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,570
it's a bit up and down.

506
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:16,105
Stressful.

507
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:17,644
Yeah, or...

508
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,221
Anyway.

509
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:24,269
The fact that it is so good when it's
good it's also kind of the reason of

510
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,670
why it is so bad when it's bad.
Does that make any sense?

511
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,625
And...

512
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,265
It can all suddenly
be over tomorrow but

513
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:35,982
I'm still insanely happy
that I have met him.

514
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,315
Because...

515
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,938
That's when you were certain
that you like boys?

516
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:45,755
Yeah.

517
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:47,182
I mean, no.

518
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:48,770
More because...

519
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:51,268
I was fake before.

520
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,018
I mean...

521
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,399
I...

522
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:02,482
I was only lying at home watching
Narcos or gaming or stuff.

523
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:07,405
And I'm over that. Now I
want my life to be real.

524
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:11,145
Even if that means it will be
absolutely awful at times,

525
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,150
it's still way better than

526
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:15,620
to be fake and boring for everything.

527
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:20,258
Well said.

528
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:23,976
It's a little bit cliché but...

529
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:27,105
You never know who will die tomorrow.

530
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:28,107
You know?

531
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:29,758
And...

532
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:33,344
Wheter you believe in
Allah, or Jesus or...

533
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,893
The theory of Evolution, or...

534
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:39,103
Parallel universes.

535
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,770
There's only one thing
we all now for certain.

536
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:53,707
What's that?

537
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,147
That life is...

538
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,400
NOW.

539
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:10,508
EVERYTHING IS LOVE.
