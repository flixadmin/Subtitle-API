1
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:20,986
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,695
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,532
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,662
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:29,916
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,539
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:34,376
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,007
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:40,886
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:49,060
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,937
Thank you.

12
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:53,641
Any change?

13
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,519
No.

14
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:01,407
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,197
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,535
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,870
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:14,208
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,465
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,919
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,259
Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:30,678
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:34,061
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,565
Please, for me.

25
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:48,787
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:50,949
What?

27
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,827
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:57,917
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:01,425
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,432
The big <i>bupkes. Nada.</i>
He's not in there.

31
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,817
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

32
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:23,527
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,324
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:31,121
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,450
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,744
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:38,787
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:42,083
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

39
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,631
Operator.

40
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,388
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:52,801
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,278
Good morning.

43
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:12,038
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:16,292
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,458
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,670
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:32,764
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:36,225
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,358
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:45,071
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,574
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:52,658
or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:11,886
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:14,851
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,104
is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:21,350
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:28,357
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,409
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:35,162
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:38,242
- but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:43,380
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,922
What choice?

63
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:48,218
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:53,303
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:57,310
knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,062
I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:04,522
because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:08,567
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:13,447
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,952
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:22,665
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:26,002
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:29,634
then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,967
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,972
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:39,679
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:44,433
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:48,357
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,022
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,867
Please, follow me.

81
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,499
Oracle...

82
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,877
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:07,791
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:12,587
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,505
I don't.

86
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,345
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:21,808
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:27,397
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,984
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:34,070
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,576
No.

92
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:39,659
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,830
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,754
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:49,415
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,924
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:01,893
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:06,774
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:08,939
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,737
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:16,363
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:20,621
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,282
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,375
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:31,123
It's okay.

106
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,958
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:36,675
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,639
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:44,137
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,517
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:50,651
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,687
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,825
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:01,237
that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:03,030
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:07,167
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:09,920
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,127
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,589
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,507
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:26,478
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:30,186
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,068
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,900
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:39,450
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,284
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,209
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

128
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,746
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,877
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:56,053 --> 00:10:00,423
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,844
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:10,398
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:11,899
Anything.

134
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,060
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,527
is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:27,160
That's him.

137
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,165
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,251
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

139
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,009
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

140
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,470
Oh, no!

141
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,442
Damn it!

142
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,492
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

143
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,876
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

144
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,497
You think it has something
to do with me?

145
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:58,005
I cannot say.

146
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,009
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

147
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,046
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

148
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,972
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

149
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,680
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

150
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,845
Goodbye?

151
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,685
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

152
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:18,898
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

153
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,531
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

154
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,738
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

155
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,121
Karma is a word, like love.

156
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,077
A way of saying:

157
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,500
"What I am here to do."

158
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,289
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

159
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,924
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

160
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,213
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

161
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,267
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

162
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,226
Can I carry that for you?

163
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,434
All right.

164
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,157
Hurry it up, I'm late!

165
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,537
Who are you?

166
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,490
- He is a friend.
- Rama!

167
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,078
I know you.

168
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,965
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

169
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,502
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- Oh.

170
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,137
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

171
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,010
Oh, no, no, no.

172
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,096
You'll stay right here until
the Merovingian says different.

173
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,761
If I know him...

174
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,431
you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

175
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,694
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

176
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,446
I built this place.

177
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,951
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

178
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,455
Down here, I'm God.

179
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,625
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

180
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,401
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

181
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,313
No. We know what has to be done.

182
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,416
Shit.

183
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,161
You gotta be kidding.

184
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,367
Holy shit, it's wingless.

185
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,702
I get it.

186
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,710
You must be ready to die.

187
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,537
I need to speak with him.

188
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:27,380
Only way you're getting through
this door is over my big, dead ass.

189
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,510
So be it.

190
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,158
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

191
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,744
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

192
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,126
and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

193
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,454
And if we're unlucky?

194
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,497
There will be many men.

195
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,003
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.

196
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:35,231
What in the hell?

197
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:39,826
I don't believe this.

198
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:48,665
Hey! Hey!

199
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,417
The prodigal child returns.

200
00:18:57,013 --> 00:19:00,677
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

201
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,595
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

202
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:08,936
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

203
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,942
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

204
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:17,482
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

205
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,859
I'll tell you what I will do.

206
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,996
Put down the guns, and I will promise
you a safe passage out of here.

207
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:26,787
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

208
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,709
Of course.

209
00:19:55,738 --> 00:20:01,484
Who could have guessed we'd see each
other so soon after our last meeting?

210
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:04,741
The Fates are too kind, eh?

211
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:08,407
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

212
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:13,420
I can only surmise the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

213
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,832
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

214
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,503
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

215
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,014
and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

216
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:29,270
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

217
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,274
You know why we are here?

218
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,024
Come now, what kind of question
is this? Of course I know.

219
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,279
It is my business to know.

220
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:41,692
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

221
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,411
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

222
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,701
- Do you know?
- No.

223
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,619
No?

224
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:54,958
I did not think so.

225
00:20:55,132 --> 00:20:58,045
But it is always best to ask, huh?

226
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:00,301
We want to make a deal.

227
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:06,266
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

228
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:10,770
Okay. I have something you want.

229
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,896
To make a deal...

230
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:18,608
you must have something
I want, yes?

231
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:23,066
And it so happens
there is something I want.

232
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:27,613
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

233
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:30,574
It is said they cannot be taken...

234
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,334
they can only be given.

235
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:34,836
What?

236
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:39,833
The eyes of the Oracle.

237
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:47,178
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

238
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,094
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

239
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,934
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

240
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:56,395
Where others see chance...

241
00:21:56,568 --> 00:22:00,107
I see cost.

242
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:05,571
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

243
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:09,037
and I will give you back your savior.

244
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:13,955
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

245
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,043
Yes? No?

246
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,214
I don't have time for this shit.

247
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,703
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

248
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:58,958
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

249
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,836
Interesting deal.

250
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:09,848
You are really ready to die
for this man?

251
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:13,602
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

252
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:16,981
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

253
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,641
She's in love.

254
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:24,860
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

255
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,649
Time's up.

256
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,362
What's it gonna be, Merv?

257
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:36,868
Okay. You got yourself in here...

258
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,628
you can get yourself out.

259
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:28,635
Are you ready for us?

260
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:31,764
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

261
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,095
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

262
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:37,182
No, sir. We were reading something,
but I couldn't tell what.

263
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:43,267
I can't leave yet.

264
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,614
I have to see her.

265
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,526
Now?

266
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,031
It's my last chance.

267
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,999
That's it. That's the secret.

268
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:01,330
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

269
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:04,455
Cookies need love like everything does.

270
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,716
Neo!

271
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:12,964
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

272
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:17,096
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

273
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:20,263
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

274
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,557
Okay.

275
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:25,684
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

276
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:32,942
So do you recognize me?

277
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,328
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

278
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:39,331
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

279
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,335
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

280
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:46,834
but I still love candy.

281
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:50,676
No, thank you.

282
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:54,010
Remember what you were like
when you first walked through my door?

283
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:59,269
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

284
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:02,681
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

285
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:06,146
You gave me a few surprises too.

286
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,607
I hope I helped.

287
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:12,195
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

288
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:14,158
Where is this going?

289
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,866
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

290
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:20,532
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

291
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:26,038
no one can see beyond a choice they
don't understand, and I mean no one.

292
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:30,542
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

293
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,211
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

294
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:36,382
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

295
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:37,799
Of course not.

296
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,184
Then why didn't you tell me
about the Architect?

297
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:44,564
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

298
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:49,395
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

299
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:52,480
You know who.

300
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:01,414
I did.

301
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:05,251
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

302
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,162
So do I.

303
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:11,250
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

304
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:14,170
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

305
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:18,424
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

306
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:24,100
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

307
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,812
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

308
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:30,227
- Where?
- The source.

309
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:35,069
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

310
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:41,197
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

311
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,959
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

312
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:47,960
Zion would be destroyed tonight.

313
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,465
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

314
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:55,377
but that man can't see
past any choice.

315
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:59,632
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

316
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:02,471
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

317
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:06,684
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

318
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:10,567
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

319
00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:13,103
What's your purpose?

320
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,317
To unbalance it.

321
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:17,574
Why? What do you want?

322
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,653
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

323
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,743
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

324
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,742
The end of the war.

325
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:29,794
Is it going to end?

326
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,672
One way or another.

327
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:36,627
Can Zion be saved?

328
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:41,849
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

329
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:47,555
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

330
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:50,437
- Where?
- You know where.

331
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:55,521
And if you can't find the answer...

332
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:59,191
then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

333
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,533
What does that mean?

334
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:11,163
Everything that has a beginning...

335
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,797
has an end.

336
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:16,880
I see the end coming.

337
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:19,966
I see the darkness spreading.

338
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:21,550
I see death.

339
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:25,847
And you are all that stands in his way.

340
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,352
Smith.

341
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:32,649
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

342
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,562
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

343
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:38,822
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

344
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:40,486
What is he?

345
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,572
He is you.

346
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:45,203
Your opposite, your negative.

347
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:48,957
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

348
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:53,166
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

349
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:57,212
this war is going to end.

350
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:02,255
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

351
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:04,219
or in his.

352
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:23,359
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

353
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,793
I need time.

354
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:41,051
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

355
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,553
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

356
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,885
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

357
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,812
Mm!

358
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:55,895
I love that smell.

359
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:59,982
I sure am going to miss it.

360
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:03,695
- Oracle.
- I know.

361
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,196
I know.

362
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,074
Sati, honey.

363
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:11,498
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

364
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,456
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

365
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:17,998
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

366
00:31:20,427 --> 00:31:23,170
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

367
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:47,201
I'm scared, Seraph.

368
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:50,743
Come.

369
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:36,622
He's following us.

370
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,588
Well, well, it's been a long time.

371
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:49,134
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

372
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:51,257
I have beaten you before.

373
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:57,231
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

374
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,143
And you must be the last exile.

375
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,318
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

376
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,398
What did she say about me?

377
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,526
That you were a bad man.

378
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:14,532
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

379
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:47,739
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

380
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:54,989
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

381
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:57,578
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

382
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:00,916
How can she be? She knows everything.

383
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:05,796
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

384
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:08,006
Why wouldn't she leave?

385
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,010
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

386
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,771
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

387
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,648
deliberately, purposefully...

388
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:25,858
which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

389
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,731
What did you do with Sati?

390
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,036
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

391
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,531
You are a bastard.

392
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,701
You would know, Mom.

393
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,875
Do what you're here to do.

394
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,377
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:38,597
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

396
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,185
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

397
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,393
Yeah, definitely.

398
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,857
You're right about that, sir.

399
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:53,699
They look like they
might be self-inflicted.

400
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:58,112
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

401
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:03,125
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

402
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:07,959
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

403
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,839
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

404
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:20,722
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

405
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:24,229
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

406
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:28,234
with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

407
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:33,234
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

408
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,012
Sir, we found her.

409
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,513
- The <i>Logos</i>?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,766
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

411
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:32,875
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

412
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:35,548
No, sir. Nothing yet.

413
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:39,340
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's intact.

414
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:42,554
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:56,819
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

416
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:15,925
Careful, sir.

417
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:20,589
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

418
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,123
What was that?

419
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,288
You can put that shit away,
boys. All she needs is a jump.

420
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:57,960
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

421
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:04,307
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

422
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,310
We didn't know what happened after...

423
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:12,266
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

424
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:14,479
I'm happy to see you too.

425
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,232
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

426
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:19,568
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

427
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:22,324
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

428
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:26,994
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

429
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,997
Exactly what I needed to hear.

430
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,498
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

431
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:40,177
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside...

432
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:43,009
the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

433
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:45,175
Thus, our primary objective must be...

434
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:48,810
to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

435
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,190
If we can do that, perhaps we can
prevent them from reaching the city.

436
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,523
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

437
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:58,858
will be at the entrance of the temple.

438
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:01,775
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

439
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:05,035
allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

440
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:08,409
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

441
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:11,075
- That is correct.
- Precisely what size force...

442
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:14,495
are you planning to commit
to the primary dock objective?

443
00:40:14,672 --> 00:40:18,211
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

444
00:40:18,384 --> 00:40:21,377
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

445
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:24,843
I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

446
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,882
and march them into that dock.

447
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,803
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

448
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:31,971
Time will tell, councillor.

449
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:34,895
Commander, just one more question.

450
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:37,355
Has there been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>?

451
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:40,987
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

452
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,149
Perhaps.

453
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:44,737
But we can hope.

454
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,328
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

455
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:03,177
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

456
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:06,009
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

457
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:08,515
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

458
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:12,182
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

459
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:18,267
Kids, you stay here.

460
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:22,609
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

461
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:24,774
- I have to.
- Why?

462
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:27,113
Because I love him.

463
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:30,154
I love him the same as he loves me.

464
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:33,665
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

465
00:41:34,544 --> 00:41:38,128
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

466
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:43,463
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

467
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:47,505
and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

468
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:49,799
what would you do?

469
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:56,851
Make shells.

470
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,487
What the shit is going on over here?

471
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:14,203
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

472
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:16,493
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

473
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,957
A unit volunteer, sir.

474
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,334
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

475
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:27,504
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

476
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,966
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

477
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:34,261
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

478
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,853
Okay, I'm 16.

479
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:39,607
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

480
00:42:39,777 --> 00:42:44,613
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

481
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,106
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

482
00:42:47,618 --> 00:42:50,907
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

483
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:52,988
You do...

484
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:56,791
and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

485
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:12,386
Okay, charge the igniter.

486
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:20,431
She lives again.

487
00:43:20,776 --> 00:43:23,894
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

488
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:27,405
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

489
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,829
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

490
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:37,741
Looking good, except, uh...

491
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:41,623
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

492
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:45,006
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

493
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:48,668
<i>- What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

494
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,672
The machines have taken Junction 21.

495
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,717
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

496
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:58,511
intersect 153, we might surprise them.

497
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:03,274
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

498
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:07,438
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

499
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:13,785
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

500
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,445
No, it's not.

501
00:44:15,622 --> 00:44:18,706
There's another way. A support line.

502
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:22,620
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

503
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:26,835
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

504
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,422
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

505
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:31,632
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

506
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,797
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

507
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:37,217
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

508
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:42,014
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

509
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:46,101
Hi.

510
00:44:47,738 --> 00:44:52,325
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

511
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:56,283
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

512
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:58,573
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

513
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,993
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

514
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,833
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

515
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:06,747
To go where?

516
00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:09,041
To the machine city.

517
00:45:13,765 --> 00:45:15,848
I know it's difficult to understand.

518
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:18,555
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

519
00:45:18,853 --> 00:45:20,185
I still have to go.

520
00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:23,564
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

521
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:26,438
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

522
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:29,604
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

523
00:45:30,281 --> 00:45:33,115
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

524
00:45:33,284 --> 00:45:35,367
but do it without
wasting our ships.

525
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,496
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

526
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:41,874
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

527
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:45,878
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

528
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:53,545
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

529
00:45:54,556 --> 00:45:57,515
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

530
00:45:57,684 --> 00:45:59,971
with my ship
after that little speech.

531
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:04,559
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

532
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:08,727
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

533
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:11,441
That's as good a plan as any.

534
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:15,358
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

535
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:24,079
Two ships, two directions.

536
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:27,416
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

537
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:31,253
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

538
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:33,133
Then why are you doing this?

539
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:36,337
I believe in him.

540
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:40,178
Thank you.

541
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:48,099
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

542
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:51,110
To make it easier for you to remember.

543
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:53,941
What if I don't want to remember?

544
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:57,032
Why would you want that?

545
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,285
What if I blew that EMP?

546
00:47:01,372 --> 00:47:03,284
What if I did destroy those ships...

547
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:08,249
and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

548
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:13,291
If I did that...

549
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:17,212
it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

550
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:31,310
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

551
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:41,323
I'm ready.

552
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:44,406
Trinity...

553
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:47,997
there's something I have to say.

554
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,924
Something you need to understand.

555
00:47:55,094 --> 00:47:57,962
I know I'm supposed to go.

556
00:47:58,138 --> 00:48:00,425
But beyond that...

557
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:03,846
I don't know. I...

558
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:07,933
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

559
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:14,562
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

560
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:17,401
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

561
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:19,941
that I was coming with you.

562
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,786
I'm scared, Trin.

563
00:48:24,123 --> 00:48:26,080
So am I.

564
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:30,539
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

565
00:48:31,547 --> 00:48:33,630
But I'll tell you something.

566
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:36,712
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

567
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:39,878
I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

568
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:45,008
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

569
00:48:45,185 --> 00:48:46,721
No.

570
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:48,603
Nothing.

571
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:04,281
<i>- Finished loading ammunition?</i>
- Just about.

572
00:49:04,496 --> 00:49:06,783
Let's move it. We are out of time.

573
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:09,241
You're not leaving them anything?

574
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:11,580
He said he didn't need it.

575
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:18,921
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

576
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:21,176
Thank you.

577
00:49:26,018 --> 00:49:28,931
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

578
00:49:29,104 --> 00:49:30,515
Me too.

579
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,271
It was an honor, sir.

580
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:42,615
No, the honor is still mine.

581
00:49:56,465 --> 00:49:59,549
<i>- We're ready, sir.</i>
- About damn time.

582
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:04,345
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

583
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,972
Bye, baby.

584
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:11,977
Take good care of them.

585
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:35,582
Ready?

586
00:50:43,346 --> 00:50:45,383
Engine's still firing.

587
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:48,181
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

588
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:04,482
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

589
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:05,991
Bane.

590
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,278
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

591
00:51:09,455 --> 00:51:11,447
Every time, I thought it was the last.

592
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:15,459
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

593
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:20,214
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

594
00:51:20,884 --> 00:51:23,547
What are you talking about?

595
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,966
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

596
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:48,075
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

597
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,495
You're gonna pay for that.

598
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:55,578
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
<i>- We got an emergency.</i>

599
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:58,244
- What is it, AK?
<i>- It's Maggie, sir.</i>

600
00:51:58,421 --> 00:52:00,629
<i>She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.</i>

601
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:03,290
Goddamn it.

602
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,633
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

603
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:10,593
He fired that EMP.

604
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:14,431
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

605
00:52:14,604 --> 00:52:17,517
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

606
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:21,525
- I know where he is.
- The <i>Logos.</i>

607
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:24,937
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

608
00:52:25,114 --> 00:52:28,027
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

609
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:30,113
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

610
00:52:30,286 --> 00:52:31,868
he'll control another EMP.

611
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:37,208
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

612
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:40,457
Mr. Anderson.

613
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:45,299
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

614
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,296
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

615
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,429
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

616
00:52:50,598 --> 00:52:53,466
that appearances can be deceiving.

617
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:57,479
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

618
00:52:57,648 --> 00:53:00,891
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

619
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:03,151
Don't do it.

620
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,530
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

621
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,984
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

622
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,164
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

623
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:19,326
- He can't.
- Do it.

624
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:30,341
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

625
00:53:37,354 --> 00:53:38,686
Let her go.

626
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:54,907
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

627
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,245
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

628
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:03,037
I do. I think of nothing else.

629
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:10,711
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

630
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:16,384
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

631
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:22,898
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

632
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:26,981
Disgusting.

633
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:32,900
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

634
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:41,582
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

635
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:49,041
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

636
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:51,175
Look past the flesh.

637
00:54:51,345 --> 00:54:56,682
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

638
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:01,762
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

639
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:05,060
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

640
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:08,102
There is nowhere I won't find you.

641
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:12,363
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

642
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,441
Inevitable.

643
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:18,278
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

644
00:55:18,455 --> 00:55:20,117
This is it. It's gotta be.

645
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,831
Oh, no.

646
00:56:25,023 --> 00:56:28,937
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

647
00:56:33,364 --> 00:56:35,606
Blind messiah.

648
00:56:39,871 --> 00:56:43,205
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

649
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:48,206
Helpless.

650
00:56:50,548 --> 00:56:52,756
Pathetic.

651
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:59,972
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

652
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:06,728
I can see you.

653
00:57:15,573 --> 00:57:18,407
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

654
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:20,488
It's not over.

655
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:37,297
- Trinity!
- Neo.

656
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,303
Neo.

657
00:57:43,268 --> 00:57:46,432
Oh, no. Your eyes.

658
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:48,766
I'll be okay.

659
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:52,270
It's all right, Trin.

660
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:56,941
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

661
00:58:03,538 --> 00:58:06,656
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

662
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:10,497
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

663
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:15,335
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

664
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,041
Yes, sir.

665
00:58:46,874 --> 00:58:49,582
Come on, move.

666
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,362
All right!

667
00:59:23,535 --> 00:59:25,367
This is it.

668
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:30,623
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

669
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:35,212
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

670
00:59:35,381 --> 00:59:40,877
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

671
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:43,887
we give them hell before we do!

672
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:46,051
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

673
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:03,732
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

674
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:06,325
But I'll make you a deal.

675
01:00:06,995 --> 01:00:10,033
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

676
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:14,163
Deal.

677
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:26,588
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

678
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:29,970
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

679
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:34,850
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

680
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:38,767
- Full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

681
01:00:48,787 --> 01:00:52,121
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

682
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:57,334
If we can just get close enough...

683
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:03,209
Six hundred meters.

684
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:05,966
There.

685
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:15,137
Shit!

686
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:19,897
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

687
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:22,857
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

688
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:26,741
Ghost, you're the best gunner we have,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

689
01:01:44,052 --> 01:01:46,510
I'm coming, baby.

690
01:01:55,355 --> 01:01:57,347
Here they come.

691
01:02:01,653 --> 01:02:05,772
<i>- Slow down, this ain't the</i> Logos.
- Hang on to your lunch, here we go.

692
01:02:14,457 --> 01:02:17,575
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

693
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:10,965
Breach! The dock is breached!

694
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,943
Knuckle up!

695
01:03:47,217 --> 01:03:48,879
For Zion!

696
01:05:57,014 --> 01:05:58,755
Shit.

697
01:06:03,562 --> 01:06:05,724
Come on, let's go.

698
01:06:11,445 --> 01:06:12,856
Knuckle up!

699
01:06:27,962 --> 01:06:29,328
Reload!

700
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:32,961
Reload nine!

701
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:40,973
Go, go! Move, move!

702
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:54,983
Watch your left!

703
01:06:56,074 --> 01:06:58,316
Don't let them through!

704
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:02,865
Zuka!

705
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:41,613
Oh, my God.

706
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:58,797
Where the hell's my infantry? I want
that goddamn machine taken down!

707
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:34,086
Dig this!

708
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:39,591
Oh, shit!

709
01:08:59,322 --> 01:09:01,188
- Yeah!
- Bogey two at the breach point!

710
01:09:01,366 --> 01:09:02,607
Goddamn it!

711
01:09:28,644 --> 01:09:30,806
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

712
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:43,573
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

713
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:18,104
- Captain, you see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

714
01:10:25,909 --> 01:10:27,195
Damn it!

715
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:53,518
Yeah.

716
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,106
Grab my belt.

717
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:19,001
Just give me one clean shot.

718
01:11:25,844 --> 01:11:27,585
Damn it!

719
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:51,367
Charra!

720
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:59,000
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

721
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:01,628
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

722
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,005
I think it's one of ours, sir.

723
01:12:04,175 --> 01:12:07,134
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

724
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:09,044
Contact them.
I want access codes.

725
01:12:09,222 --> 01:12:11,760
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

726
01:12:13,101 --> 01:12:15,809
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

727
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:19,814
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

728
01:12:30,076 --> 01:12:33,319
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

729
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:39,416
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

730
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:45,248
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

731
01:13:05,195 --> 01:13:07,938
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the <i>Hammer</i>, sir.

732
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:09,780
How can that be?

733
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:11,941
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

734
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:14,906
At present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

735
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:17,446
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

736
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:21,705
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

737
01:13:21,878 --> 01:13:24,120
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

738
01:13:24,714 --> 01:13:26,580
Sir, we already lost the dock.

739
01:13:30,762 --> 01:13:32,094
Open the gate.

740
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:38,134
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

741
01:13:38,311 --> 01:13:40,553
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

742
01:13:50,323 --> 01:13:51,655
There's the exit.

743
01:13:51,824 --> 01:13:55,283
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

744
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,532
Full power...

745
01:13:57,789 --> 01:13:59,121
ninety degrees.

746
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:06,753
Now!

747
01:14:14,222 --> 01:14:16,259
Hold on, baby.

748
01:14:20,937 --> 01:14:22,769
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

749
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:24,931
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

750
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:29,059
Sentinels are inside the dock.

751
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:31,732
Are we too late?

752
01:15:01,312 --> 01:15:04,055
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

753
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:06,223
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

754
01:15:34,595 --> 01:15:35,881
Reload!

755
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:37,382
He's pissing metal.

756
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:42,387
Go!

757
01:15:56,909 --> 01:15:58,241
Go!

758
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,927
Heads up! They're coming around!

759
01:16:34,905 --> 01:16:36,487
Behind you!

760
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:51,869
It's jammed!

761
01:16:57,594 --> 01:17:00,337
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

762
01:17:01,432 --> 01:17:03,094
Got it!

763
01:17:31,629 --> 01:17:33,461
Captain Mifune.

764
01:17:36,593 --> 01:17:38,505
Oh, no.

765
01:17:39,012 --> 01:17:40,344
They're coming.

766
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,302
They're coming.

767
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,892
The <i>Hammer.</i>

768
01:17:47,437 --> 01:17:48,803
What?

769
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:52,018
You have to open that gate.

770
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:54,482
Cut the counterweights.

771
01:17:56,654 --> 01:17:57,986
You can do it.

772
01:17:58,823 --> 01:18:01,531
Hurry. There's no time.

773
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:04,326
Captain...

774
01:18:04,496 --> 01:18:06,863
I didn't finish the training program.

775
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:11,867
Neither did I.

776
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:36,354
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

777
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,896
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

778
01:18:40,073 --> 01:18:43,191
Come on, someone, please.

779
01:18:57,924 --> 01:18:59,790
Keep the weight forward.

780
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,544
Light as a feather.
Light as a feather.

781
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:11,928
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's
APU is up and moving to Gate Three.

782
01:19:17,944 --> 01:19:20,027
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

783
01:19:30,748 --> 01:19:32,740
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

784
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:35,705
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

785
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:40,210
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

786
01:19:40,383 --> 01:19:41,840
Mifune...

787
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,626
this is Lock.

788
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,713
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

789
01:19:46,889 --> 01:19:49,222
<i>the</i> Hammer<i>'s two minutes away.</i>

790
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:53,977
<i>You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.</i>

791
01:19:55,607 --> 01:19:57,018
Link.

792
01:19:57,525 --> 01:19:59,768
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

793
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,060
Do it, kid.

794
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:44,984
Neo. I believe.

795
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:56,078
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

796
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,502
We ain't come this far.

797
01:21:11,684 --> 01:21:13,926
Almost home, almost home.

798
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:34,954
Burn it, Link!

799
01:21:59,106 --> 01:22:02,065
- You did it.
- No.

800
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:04,063
We did it.

801
01:22:05,112 --> 01:22:06,478
You're a hell of a pilot.

802
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:12,405
Some things in this world never change.

803
01:22:12,703 --> 01:22:14,114
But some things do?

804
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:17,371
Luckily...

805
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:19,495
some things do.

806
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:32,428
Link!

807
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:34,756
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

808
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:44,609
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

809
01:22:45,278 --> 01:22:47,270
I made a promise.

810
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,446
You did wear it.

811
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:02,789
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

812
01:23:12,472 --> 01:23:14,509
Three captains, one ship.

813
01:23:14,682 --> 01:23:18,676
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

814
01:23:18,853 --> 01:23:20,469
Good to see you too, Jason.

815
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:22,980
The Council's waiting to hear
your explanation.

816
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:27,314
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

817
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:30,654
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

818
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:32,656
That's the problem with you people.

819
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:35,409
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

820
01:23:35,703 --> 01:23:39,287
That EMP knocked out almost every
piece of hardware and every APU.

821
01:23:39,457 --> 01:23:42,416
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

822
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:46,329
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

823
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:54,087
Come on, get it cut.

824
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:57,014
The bridge is clear.

825
01:23:59,602 --> 01:24:01,514
Do you hear that?

826
01:24:03,857 --> 01:24:05,393
Get that cable run!

827
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:09,397
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

828
01:24:10,697 --> 01:24:13,064
Order everyone to fall back.

829
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:15,949
Seal the shaft. Now.

830
01:24:16,703 --> 01:24:18,365
Move it!

831
01:24:21,749 --> 01:24:23,365
Oh, my God.

832
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:33,713
- All clear.
- Do it.

833
01:24:33,887 --> 01:24:36,049
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

834
01:24:52,363 --> 01:24:53,945
Your move.

835
01:24:55,074 --> 01:24:56,781
So you gave them your ship?

836
01:24:57,243 --> 01:25:01,408
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

837
01:25:03,082 --> 01:25:04,914
The Oracle said nothing of this?

838
01:25:05,919 --> 01:25:10,414
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

839
01:25:10,798 --> 01:25:15,259
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

840
01:25:15,428 --> 01:25:18,637
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

841
01:25:18,806 --> 01:25:23,096
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

842
01:25:23,269 --> 01:25:26,104
No, he wasn't.

843
01:25:27,942 --> 01:25:30,605
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

844
01:25:31,987 --> 01:25:35,230
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

845
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:38,024
if he'll reach the machine city.

846
01:25:38,202 --> 01:25:41,445
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

847
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:47,501
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

848
01:25:48,963 --> 01:25:51,000
he will not give up.

849
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:53,790
And neither can we.

850
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:01,631
Temperature's dropping.

851
01:26:05,145 --> 01:26:06,477
Here we go.

852
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,761
We're over the fields, aren't we?

853
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:50,521
How do you know that?

854
01:26:51,275 --> 01:26:53,141
I can feel them.

855
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,526
Over there.

856
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:08,206
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

857
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,707
Power lines.

858
01:27:10,711 --> 01:27:12,452
Follow them.

859
01:27:29,396 --> 01:27:31,262
What are they doing?

860
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,147
I don't know.

861
01:27:34,068 --> 01:27:35,934
Lieutenant?

862
01:27:51,085 --> 01:27:52,417
Goddamn it.

863
01:27:52,753 --> 01:27:54,085
What do we do now?

864
01:27:58,759 --> 01:28:00,876
It is now a matter of time.

865
01:28:01,637 --> 01:28:04,129
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

866
01:28:05,474 --> 01:28:09,936
I recommend that the Council join the
non-military personnel inside the temple.

867
01:28:10,605 --> 01:28:11,971
How long do we have?

868
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:15,148
Two hours. Maybe less.

869
01:28:16,903 --> 01:28:21,113
My men have fortified the entrance with
enough artillery to make our last stand.

870
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:25,484
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

871
01:28:25,995 --> 01:28:29,454
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

872
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,625
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

873
01:28:34,796 --> 01:28:36,128
I would ask him.

874
01:28:37,006 --> 01:28:40,670
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

875
01:28:47,934 --> 01:28:50,472
There. Those mountains.

876
01:28:51,396 --> 01:28:53,228
That's it.

877
01:28:56,568 --> 01:28:58,480
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

878
01:28:58,987 --> 01:29:01,650
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

879
01:29:01,823 --> 01:29:03,485
We'll make it.

880
01:29:06,494 --> 01:29:08,201
We have to.

881
01:30:21,486 --> 01:30:23,193
Sentinels.

882
01:30:34,582 --> 01:30:35,914
There's too many!

883
01:30:52,601 --> 01:30:53,933
Gotcha!

884
01:30:54,645 --> 01:30:56,807
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

885
01:30:57,022 --> 01:30:59,435
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

886
01:30:59,692 --> 01:31:02,685
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

887
01:31:04,655 --> 01:31:06,396
Then up we go.

888
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:43,482
Beautiful.

889
01:32:05,382 --> 01:32:07,999
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

890
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:17,892
Again. Slowly.

891
01:32:20,856 --> 01:32:22,347
Now!

892
01:32:47,883 --> 01:32:49,374
Trin?

893
01:32:51,428 --> 01:32:53,215
Trinity?

894
01:32:54,306 --> 01:32:55,968
Trinity?

895
01:32:57,142 --> 01:32:59,225
- I'm here.
- Where?

896
01:32:59,395 --> 01:33:00,727
Here.

897
01:33:11,073 --> 01:33:12,405
We made it.

898
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,991
You said we would.

899
01:33:18,288 --> 01:33:20,746
It's unbelievable, Trin.

900
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,412
Light everywhere.

901
01:33:23,752 --> 01:33:26,586
Like the whole thing was built of light.

902
01:33:27,256 --> 01:33:29,418
I wish you could see what I see.

903
01:33:31,094 --> 01:33:33,086
You've already shown me so much.

904
01:33:35,348 --> 01:33:38,682
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

905
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:42,553
I can't go with you, Neo.

906
01:33:44,232 --> 01:33:46,019
I've gone as far as I can.

907
01:33:46,317 --> 01:33:47,683
What?

908
01:33:50,613 --> 01:33:52,104
Oh, no.

909
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:54,690
Oh, no. No, no.

910
01:33:55,452 --> 01:33:57,114
It's all right.

911
01:33:58,496 --> 01:34:00,112
It's time.

912
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:04,200
I've done all that I could do.

913
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,787
Now you have to do the rest.

914
01:34:08,548 --> 01:34:10,631
You have to finish it.

915
01:34:10,967 --> 01:34:13,129
You have to save Zion.

916
01:34:13,636 --> 01:34:15,298
I can't.

917
01:34:15,763 --> 01:34:19,097
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

918
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:21,304
You will.

919
01:34:22,353 --> 01:34:25,471
I believe it. I always have.

920
01:34:27,984 --> 01:34:29,600
Trinity.

921
01:34:31,863 --> 01:34:35,322
Trinity, you can't die.

922
01:34:37,368 --> 01:34:39,451
You can't.

923
01:34:39,746 --> 01:34:41,328
You can't.

924
01:34:41,498 --> 01:34:43,660
Yes, I can.

925
01:34:46,836 --> 01:34:49,249
You brought me back once.

926
01:34:51,466 --> 01:34:53,549
But not this time.

927
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:01,344
Do you remember...

928
01:35:03,144 --> 01:35:06,057
on that roof, after you caught me...

929
01:35:07,649 --> 01:35:09,436
the last thing I said to you?

930
01:35:12,195 --> 01:35:13,686
You said, "I'm sorry."

931
01:35:15,031 --> 01:35:17,148
I wish I hadn't.

932
01:35:20,203 --> 01:35:22,490
That was my last thought.

933
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:27,704
I wished I had one more chance...

934
01:35:28,628 --> 01:35:30,870
to say what really mattered.

935
01:35:33,466 --> 01:35:36,300
To say how much I loved you.

936
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:42,048
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

937
01:35:44,894 --> 01:35:49,810
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

938
01:35:55,863 --> 01:35:58,401
But you brought me back.

939
01:36:01,327 --> 01:36:03,569
You gave me my wish.

940
01:36:06,874 --> 01:36:10,914
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

941
01:36:15,593 --> 01:36:17,459
Kiss me.

942
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:22,218
Once more...

943
01:36:23,934 --> 01:36:25,345
kiss me.

944
01:36:52,713 --> 01:36:54,796
Get that ammunition where it belongs!

945
01:36:54,965 --> 01:36:56,797
You got one chance to get this right.

946
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,300
Get that damn thing mounted!

947
01:37:04,308 --> 01:37:06,891
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

948
01:37:21,742 --> 01:37:23,108
Neo...

949
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:25,823
if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

950
01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:36,709
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

951
01:39:36,878 --> 01:39:40,713
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

952
01:39:44,844 --> 01:39:46,176
Speak.

953
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,889
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

954
01:39:50,058 --> 01:39:53,472
Soon he will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

955
01:39:53,645 --> 01:39:54,977
You cannot stop him.

956
01:39:57,065 --> 01:39:59,398
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

957
01:40:00,401 --> 01:40:02,734
We need nothing!

958
01:40:03,822 --> 01:40:07,736
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

959
01:40:12,831 --> 01:40:14,697
What do you want?

960
01:40:16,084 --> 01:40:17,370
Peace.

961
01:40:43,194 --> 01:40:45,106
What are they doing?

962
01:40:50,702 --> 01:40:52,694
What are you doing?

963
01:40:55,874 --> 01:40:57,786
Morpheus!

964
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,142
And if you fail?

965
01:41:26,404 --> 01:41:28,396
I won't.

966
01:41:49,845 --> 01:41:51,427
Neo.

967
01:41:51,597 --> 01:41:53,213
He fights for us.

968
01:42:34,974 --> 01:42:37,887
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

969
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,222
We missed you.

970
01:42:44,316 --> 01:42:47,229
You like what I've done with the place?

971
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,527
It ends tonight.

972
01:42:50,489 --> 01:42:53,482
I know it does. I've seen it.

973
01:42:53,659 --> 01:42:57,403
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

974
01:42:57,579 --> 01:43:01,243
because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

975
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:56,443
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

976
01:44:56,616 --> 01:44:59,029
closing in on you?

977
01:44:59,202 --> 01:45:01,364
Oh, I can.

978
01:45:02,705 --> 01:45:06,824
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

979
01:45:07,001 --> 01:45:10,620
that taught me the purpose of all life.

980
01:45:11,047 --> 01:45:14,540
The purpose of life is to end.

981
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:52,346
Why, Mr. Anderson?

982
01:48:52,519 --> 01:48:56,354
Why, why, why?

983
01:48:56,523 --> 01:48:57,855
Why do you do it?

984
01:48:58,609 --> 01:49:00,601
Why? Why get up?

985
01:49:00,778 --> 01:49:02,610
Why keep fighting?

986
01:49:04,114 --> 01:49:06,606
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

987
01:49:06,784 --> 01:49:09,447
For more than your survival?

988
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,909
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

989
01:49:16,377 --> 01:49:18,118
Is it freedom or truth?

990
01:49:18,295 --> 01:49:20,662
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

991
01:49:20,839 --> 01:49:24,207
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

992
01:49:24,635 --> 01:49:27,719
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

993
01:49:27,888 --> 01:49:30,505
trying desperately
to justify an existence...

994
01:49:30,682 --> 01:49:32,765
that is without meaning or purpose!

995
01:49:32,935 --> 01:49:36,349
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

996
01:49:36,522 --> 01:49:42,644
although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

997
01:49:45,156 --> 01:49:47,273
You must be able to see it,
Mr. Anderson.

998
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:51,990
You must know it by now. You can't
win. It's pointless to keep fighting.

999
01:49:54,749 --> 01:49:57,992
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

1000
01:50:01,256 --> 01:50:03,498
Because I choose to.

1001
01:51:08,448 --> 01:51:11,532
This is my world! My world!

1002
01:51:36,184 --> 01:51:37,925
Wait.

1003
01:51:38,102 --> 01:51:40,264
I've seen this.

1004
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:43,772
This is it. This is the end.

1005
01:51:45,443 --> 01:51:49,357
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

1006
01:51:49,531 --> 01:51:51,864
And I... I...

1007
01:51:52,033 --> 01:51:57,870
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

1008
01:51:59,874 --> 01:52:03,367
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

1009
01:52:12,136 --> 01:52:15,880
What? What did I just say?

1010
01:52:21,229 --> 01:52:25,064
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1011
01:52:32,575 --> 01:52:34,237
Get away from me!

1012
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:35,821
What are you afraid of?

1013
01:52:36,579 --> 01:52:37,911
It's a trick.

1014
01:52:38,581 --> 01:52:40,823
You were right, Smith.

1015
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,582
You were always right.

1016
01:52:46,922 --> 01:52:48,584
It was inevitable.

1017
01:53:20,372 --> 01:53:21,954
Is it over?

1018
01:53:52,988 --> 01:53:55,355
Oh, no, no, no.

1019
01:53:55,532 --> 01:53:57,068
No, it's not fair.

1020
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:53,713
It is done.

1021
01:55:25,665 --> 01:55:27,998
It doesn't make sense.

1022
01:55:31,921 --> 01:55:33,583
He did it.

1023
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:36,582
He saved us.

1024
01:55:36,843 --> 01:55:39,005
He saved us.

1025
01:55:39,596 --> 01:55:42,839
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1026
01:55:43,099 --> 01:55:44,431
He did it! It's over!

1027
01:55:44,601 --> 01:55:47,093
It's over! He did it! He did it!

1028
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:50,763
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

1029
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:52,431
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1030
01:55:52,609 --> 01:55:54,521
The machines, they're gone.

1031
01:55:54,694 --> 01:55:58,028
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

1032
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:03,030
Zion! Zion!

1033
01:56:03,203 --> 01:56:04,944
Zion, it's over!

1034
01:56:05,288 --> 01:56:06,779
It's over!

1035
01:56:06,956 --> 01:56:09,619
The war is over!

1036
01:56:09,793 --> 01:56:12,627
The war is over!

1037
01:56:12,796 --> 01:56:15,288
Whoo!

1038
01:56:33,983 --> 01:56:36,896
I have imagined this moment...

1039
01:56:37,403 --> 01:56:39,690
for so long.

1040
01:56:43,576 --> 01:56:45,363
Is this real?

1041
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:57,004
Neo, wherever you are...

1042
01:56:58,007 --> 01:57:00,090
thank you.

1043
01:57:43,887 --> 01:57:45,219
Good morning.

1044
01:58:06,493 --> 01:58:10,407
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1045
01:58:10,831 --> 01:58:12,993
You played a very dangerous game.

1046
01:58:13,167 --> 01:58:15,409
Change always is.

1047
01:58:16,003 --> 01:58:19,337
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1048
01:58:20,674 --> 01:58:22,916
As long as it can.

1049
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:28,172
What about the others?

1050
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:31,261
What others?

1051
01:58:31,435 --> 01:58:33,097
The ones that want out.

1052
01:58:33,854 --> 01:58:35,937
Obviously, they will be freed.

1053
01:58:36,523 --> 01:58:38,185
I have your word?

1054
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:42,103
What do you think I am? Human?

1055
01:58:56,126 --> 01:58:57,708
Oracle!

1056
01:59:04,551 --> 01:59:06,713
We were afraid we might not find you.

1057
01:59:06,887 --> 01:59:09,550
Everything's okay now.

1058
01:59:10,057 --> 01:59:11,798
Look, look.

1059
01:59:12,393 --> 01:59:14,806
Just look at that.

1060
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:18,142
Beautiful.

1061
01:59:19,066 --> 01:59:21,479
Did you do that?

1062
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:23,981
For Neo.

1063
01:59:24,321 --> 01:59:26,313
That's nice.

1064
01:59:26,490 --> 01:59:28,152
I know he'd love it.

1065
01:59:28,826 --> 01:59:30,818
Will we ever see him again?

1066
01:59:31,412 --> 01:59:34,155
I suspect so.

1067
01:59:34,331 --> 01:59:36,038
Someday.

1068
01:59:40,838 --> 01:59:42,625
Did you always know?

1069
01:59:42,798 --> 01:59:46,087
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1070
01:59:46,593 --> 01:59:49,176
But I believed.

1071
01:59:50,097 --> 01:59:52,510
I believed.
