158

...the "Heart of
the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

wanted to take the call.

my attention, Rose.

the woman in the picture is?

163

Oh, yes. The woman
in the picture is me.

164
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,417

Some nutcase seeking
money or publicity.

165

died on the Titanic

168
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,598
when she was 17, right?

169
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,851
BROCK: That's right.

170
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,352
If she had lived,
she'd be over 100 by now.

171
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,855
101 next month.

172
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,025
Okay, so she's a very
old goddamn liar.

173
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,444
Look, I've already done the
background on this woman...

174
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,529
...all the way
back to the 20s,

175
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,531
when she was working
as an actress.

176
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,701
An actress.
There's your first
clue, Sherlock.

177
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,078
Her name was
Rose Dawson back then.

178
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,331
Then she marries
this guy named Calvert.

179
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,876
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out
a couple of kids.

180
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,379
Now Calvert's dead
and, from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

181
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,714
And everybody
who knows about

182
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,965

supposed to be dead...

183
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
...or on this boat,
but she knows.

184

I would like to
see my drawing.

208
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,429
BROCK: Louis XVI wore
a fabulous stone that was...

209
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,222
...called the Blue Diamond
of the Crown...

210
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,183
...which disappeared
in 1792...

211
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,104
...about the same time
old Louis lost everything
from the neck up.

212
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,191
The theory goes that
the crown diamond
was chopped, too.

213
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,694
Recut into a heart-like shape
that became known as...

214

...the Heart of the Ocean.

215
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,782
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

216
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,201
(SCOFFS) It was a dreadful,

settled under terms
of absolute secrecy.

223

Can you tell me who the
claimant was, Rose?

224
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,642
I should imagine someone
named Hockley.

225
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,686

227

bought his fiancée.

230

A week before he
sailed on Titanic.

231
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,742
And it was filed right
after the sinking.

232
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,662
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

233
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,248
You see the date?

234
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,752
April 14, 1912.

235

Which means if
your grandmother
is who she says she is...

BODINE: Okay, here we go.

248
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,521
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

249
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,605
She kind of bumps along...

250
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,940
...punching holes like
morse code...

251
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,483
...dit-dit-dit...
along the side...

252
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,442
...below the water line.

253
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,321
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

254
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,698
Now, as the water
level rises...

255
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,700
...it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

256
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,578
...which, unfortunately,
don't go any
higher than E deck.

257
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,413
So now as the
bow goes down...

258
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,165
...the stern rises up,
slow at first...

259
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,834
...then faster and faster...

260
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,336
...until finally,
she's got her whole ass
sticking up in the air.

261
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,213
And that's a big ass.

262
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,341
We're talking
20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

263
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,677
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

264
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,470
So, what happens?

265
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,639
(CLICKING TONGUE)
She splits, right
down to the keel.

266
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,640
And the stern...

267
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,434
...falls back level.

268
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,269
Then as the bow sinks...

269
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,229
...it pulls
the stern vertical...

270
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,607
...and then finally detaches.

271
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,692
Now the stern section
just kind of bobs there

272

a couple of minutes...

the size of Titanic.

Now, I want them
to marvel at her speed.

We must give them
something new to print.

to your final crossing...

just talk about it.

Well, Jack...

981

...are you of
the Boston Dawsons?

He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

And where exactly
do you live, Mr. Dawson?

1010

Well, right now, my address
is the RMS. Titanic.

After that,
I'm on God's good humor.

the mail hold is worse.

1590
01:44:27,908 --> 01:44:29,368
She's all buckled in
in the forward hull.

1591
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,245
Can you shore up?
Not unless
the pumps get ahead.

1592
01:44:31,537 --> 01:44:32,913
Have you seen
the damage in mail hold?

1593
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,706
HUTCHINSON: No,
she's already underwater.

1594
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:36,917
This is bad.

1595
01:44:39,294 --> 01:44:40,879
We should tell
Mother and Cal.

1596
01:44:41,964 --> 01:44:44,007
I think
they're very good, sir.

1597
01:44:46,885 --> 01:44:49,847
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire
room photographed.

1598
01:44:50,055 --> 01:44:51,765
Just keep hold of my hand.

1599
01:44:54,893 --> 01:44:56,645
We've been looking
for you, miss.

1600
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:02,943
ROSE: Here we go.

1601
01:45:08,907 --> 01:45:10,284
Something serious
has happened.

1602
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:13,370
Yes, it has.

1603
01:45:14,913 --> 01:45:18,292
Indeed. Two things dear
to me have disappeared
this evening.

1604
01:45:18,584 --> 01:45:19,751
Now that one is back...

1605
01:45:19,877 --> 01:45:21,587
...I have a pretty good idea
where to find the other.

1606
01:45:21,837 --> 01:45:22,796
Search him.

1607
01:45:23,422 --> 01:45:24,715
Take your coat off, son.
Now what?

1608
01:45:24,882 --> 01:45:25,841
Come on.

1609
01:45:26,008 --> 01:45:28,635
Cal, what are you doing?
We're in the middle...

1610
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,220
...of an emergency.
What's going on?

1611
01:45:30,429 --> 01:45:32,306
Is this it?
That's it.

1612
01:45:32,931 --> 01:45:34,725
This is horseshit!

1613
01:45:36,101 --> 01:45:37,394
Don't you believe it,
Rose. Don't.

1614
01:45:37,769 --> 01:45:38,896
He couldn't have.

1615
01:45:39,062 --> 01:45:41,106
Of course he could.
It's easy enough
for a professional.

1616
01:45:41,356 --> 01:45:42,482
But I was with him
the whole time.

1617
01:45:42,608 --> 01:45:43,525
This is absurd.

1618
01:45:44,109 --> 01:45:45,485
Perhaps he did it
while you were

1619
01:45:45,694 --> 01:45:47,070
putting your clothes
back on, dear.

1620
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:50,824
Real slick, Cal. Rose,
they put it in my pocket.

1621
01:45:51,283 --> 01:45:51,867
Shut up.

1622
01:45:52,034 --> 01:45:54,119
LOVEJOY: It isn't
even your pocket, is it, son?

1623
01:45:54,369 --> 01:45:55,829
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1624
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:01,668
That was reported
stolen today.

1625
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:02,586
I just borrowed it.

1626
01:46:02,794 --> 01:46:03,629
I was going to return it.

1627
01:46:03,795 --> 01:46:04,379
Oh, an honest thief.

1628
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:06,131
We have an honest
thief here, do we?

1629
01:46:06,465 --> 01:46:07,966
You know I didn't
do this, Rose.

1630
01:46:08,133 --> 01:46:08,634
You know it.

1631
01:46:09,468 --> 01:46:10,802
Don't you believe
them, Rose.

1632
01:46:10,969 --> 01:46:11,470
You know it.

1633
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,679
You know I didn't do it.
Come on, let's go.

1634
01:46:12,971 --> 01:46:14,473
You know I didn't
do it, Rose!

1635
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:14,973
Rose!

1636
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,183
Come on.
There's a good lad.

1637
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:16,975
Come on son.

1638
01:46:18,477 --> 01:46:20,771
You know I didn't do it!
You know me!

1639

ISMAY: This is most
unfortunate, Captain.

1640
01:46:28,487 --> 01:46:31,865
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes...

1641
01:46:32,157 --> 01:46:35,452
...in the forepeak,
in all 3 holds and
in boiler room 6.

1642
01:46:35,744 --> 01:46:36,703
That's right, sir.

1643
01:46:36,995 --> 01:46:38,288
When can we get
underway, damnit?

1644
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,540
That's 5 compartments.

1645
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:44,378
She can stay afloat
with the first 4

1646
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:46,463
compartments breached,
but not 5.

1647
01:46:46,797 --> 01:46:48,298
Not 5.

1648
01:46:48,966 --> 01:46:50,842
As she goes down by the head,
the water will spill...

1649
01:46:51,093 --> 01:46:53,053
...over the tops
of the bulkheads

1650
01:46:53,261 --> 01:46:55,222
at E deck,
from one to the next...

1651
01:46:55,514 --> 01:46:58,141
...back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1652
01:46:58,517 --> 01:46:59,726
The pumps.
If we open the doors.

1653
01:47:00,018 --> 01:47:03,146
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1654
01:47:03,855 --> 01:47:06,066
From this moment,
no matter what we do...

1655
01:47:07,025 --> 01:47:09,152
...Titanic will founder.

1656
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:12,823
But this ship can't sink.

1657
01:47:13,115 --> 01:47:15,909
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can.

1658
01:47:16,535 --> 01:47:17,494
And she will.

1659
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:20,414
It is
a mathematical certainty.

1660
01:47:24,876 --> 01:47:26,336
How much time?

1661
01:47:33,885 --> 01:47:34,553
An hour.

1662
01:47:35,387 --> 01:47:36,221
Two, at most.

1663
01:47:42,394 --> 01:47:44,438
And how many aboard,
Mr. Murdoch?

1664
01:47:44,896 --> 01:47:47,691
2,200 souls on board, sir.

get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

Not now. We're busy.

Sir, I've been told
to ask you to please...

1673
01:48:25,418 --> 01:48:26,836
...put on your lifebelts and
come up to the boat deck.

1674

I said, not now.

I'm sorry to
inconvenience you...

...Mr. Hockley,
but it's Captain's orders.

1677
01:48:31,674 --> 01:48:33,259
Now please, dress warmly.

1678

It's quite cold out tonight.

1679

Now, may I suggest
topcoats and hats?

1680
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:40,934
This is ridiculous.

1681
01:48:41,643 --> 01:48:45,271
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure
it's just a precaution.

Everybody up and put
your lifebelts on!

What's the ruckus?

01:48:53,905 --> 01:48:55,198
