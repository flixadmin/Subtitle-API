Get out. You're done.

35
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,845
There's one person you will never,
ever defeat.

00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:20,930
Good luck without me.

The answer to all our prayers.

- A virus that kills Supes.
<i>- To make the virus</i>

39
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:27,397
strong enough to kill Homelander
would evolve it

40
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:29,229
<i>into something super lethal.</i>

41
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:31,231
Global fucking pandemic.

42
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:34,777
I am you, which is why
when I tell you you want to do this,

43
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,781
I am literally telling you that
you fucking want to do this.

44
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:41,408
Kimiko!

00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,677
<i>Frenchie, that virus...</i>

46
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,286
it ain't gonna cook itself, brother.

<i>We ain't
turning Ryan into an asset.</i>

48
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,540
- He ain't ready.
- Either we figure out how to train him

49
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,167
or we figure out how to kill him.

50
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,336
Stop, stop! Just stop.

51
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,963
<i>Your family isn't your enemy.</i>

52
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:56,674
<i>- My mom wouldn't want any of this.
- And that</i>

53
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,550
is why I got faith in the kid.

54
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,596
<i>Once he's in office,</i>

55
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,160
we need to invoke the 25th amendment.

56
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:06,016
- Who's handling all this?
- Me.

57
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,935
- I fucking am.
<i>- When Homelander</i>

58
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,829
chucks all the Starlighters
into internment camps,

59
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,021
you're cool with that?

60
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,021
You didn't know about the camps.

61
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:13,900
<i>You just focus
on the shooter.</i>

62
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,651
Make sure he's good to go on the 6th.

63
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,736
- Are you okay?
- It's like a furnace in there.

64
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:22,491
- Stop!
<i>- Fucking Supe shapeshifters.</i>

65
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:23,993
<i>Got to hand it to Sage, though.</i>

66
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,828
<i>Perfect choice for the job.</i>

67
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:31,500
{\an8}Good morning, patriots.

68
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,462
{\an8}It's January 6, and this is <i>VNN Today.</i>

69
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,023
{\an8} <i>Stunning news out of Vought Studios,</i>

70
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:40,634
{\an8}<i>who are canceling
the eagerly anticipated film</i>

71
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:43,554
{\an8}Training A-Train,
<i>though it's completely finished.</i>

72
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,639
{\an8}We just realized we'd make more
from the write-off.

73
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:49,184
{\an8}We go behind the scenes
of a powerful new Vought PSA.

74
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:51,478
I take responsibility.

75
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,817
I take responsibility for racism.

76
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,570
{\an8}Finally, Congress counts
electoral votes today

77
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,864
{\an8}to certify the incoming president.

78
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:06,285
{\an8}<i>Usually a formality, Dakota Bob's
extreme anti-Supe agenda</i>

79
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,287
{\an8} <i>has made it anything but.</i>

80
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,915
{\an8}We will count the certificates
in an orderly fashion,

81
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,751
{\an8} <i>with no debate.</i>

82
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,419
{\an8} <i>Is that understood?</i>

83
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,920
<i>Now, as I was saying,</i>

84
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,715
<i>after ascertaining
the certificates are authentic...</i>

85
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:21,693
Where's
the fucking virus, Frenchie?

86
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:24,011
I'm close.

87
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:26,072
You know, once they bang that gavel,

88
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:29,058
Neuman's one goddamn head pop away
from the Oval Office.

89
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:32,019
- How close?
- Close-ish.

90
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,023
Fuck.

91
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,740
<i>...counting the certificate of the vote
of the state of Alabama?</i>

92
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:48,035
<i>Hearing none. The chair advises members of Congress...</i>

93
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,037
No, I told you Vicky locked it all down.

94
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,955
Please lower your voice.

95
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,668
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,588
Hey.

97
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,632
He-Hey. What...

98
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,593
What the hell are you wearing?

99
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:05,761
You don't like it?

100
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:08,013
No, I mean, I... I love it.

101
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:10,808
It's just, I-is now really the time,
with the whole country

102
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,810
barreling towards <i>1984?</i>

103
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,063
The night before my great-grandfather
shipped out,

104
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:18,941
he put on his dress uniform,

105
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:23,779
barged into dinner
at my great-grandmother's house,

106
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:26,240
and got down on one knee.

107
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,660
Okay.

108
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,703
Stand up. Please.

109
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,416
Hughie Campbell...

110
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,590
...will you marry me?

111
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:45,676
Ha! Uh...

112
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,720
You need to stay right here, okay?
Just don't move.

113
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:50,264
- Okay.
- Do not move.

114
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,773
Hey.

115
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,444
Uh, I guess I'm-I'm doing this.

116
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:06,297
Okay, then me, too,
'cause I'm the one proposing.

117
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:07,698
Annie January,

118
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,493
I am terrified of what's gonna happen.

119
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,495
But I feel so...

120
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,124
...so lucky...

121
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,751
that I get to face it all with you.

122
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,512
Okay, all right.

123
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:35,642
So, uh, yeah, all in all...

124
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,311
hard yes, let's get married.

125
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:38,812
Aah!

126
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,898
Mm...

127
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,074
Wow, that was... that was great.

128
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,036
Two fingers was a lot, but...

129
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,330
Sorry, I was just trying to level up.

130
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:59,708
Oh, no, it's... it's fine. It's great.

131
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:11,803
Um...

132
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,223
Where you going?

133
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,935
We need some champs to... celebrate.

134
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,144
And...

135
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,188
not that Kirkland shit

136
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:23,440
that's in the fridge.

137
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,026
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

138
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,790
{\an8}The certificate from Kansas,
the parliamentarians advised me,

139
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,251
{\an8}<i>is the only certificate of vote
from the state,</i>

140
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:45,587
{\an8}<i>and has annexed to it
a certificate from an authority...</i>

141
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,339
You're 90 over 60.

142
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:48,882
That's low.

143
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,843
You don't fucking say?

144
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,604
You know, if you need any help...

145
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,483
I don't need your help.

146
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,567
Really?

147
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:10,070
Seems to me you are shitting in a bedpan

148
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,531
and days away from being planted.

149
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:15,409
And what do you have to show for it?

150
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,911
I mean, Singer... he's as good as dead.

151
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:20,664
Homelander... he won.

152
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,166
And you... you gave away the virus.

153
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,295
The one fucking weapon
that could've stopped him.

154
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:29,256
But we are gonna turn that frown

155
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,591
upside down, my friend.

156
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,760
You know why?

157
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,637
'Cause you still have me.

158
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,182
You ain't even fucking real.

159
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,906
<i>Well, now, that's
an interesting philosophical question.</i>

160
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,187
<i>See, what is real are the fucking</i>

161
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:48,191
V'd up tumors that are mushrooming
inside your guts and noggin.

162
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,860
Super cancer.

163
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,613
What is real

164
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,615
is that piece of you

165
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,828
that wants to burn
every fucking Supe on Earth.

166
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:03,957
How is it you think you ripped Ezekiel
into fun-sized little chunks?

167
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,627
I'm the one that gave you the juice
that you needed.

168
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,671
And I can do it again.

169
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,007
All you have to do

170
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,509
is hold up your end of the bargain.

171
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:16,345
Bargain?

172
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:17,929
What fucking bargain?

173
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,639
We go all the way.

174
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,099
I mean, come on, champ,

175
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:23,977
what's a little genocide between friends?

176
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:28,273
Just fuck off and let me
die in peace, would you?

177
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:29,608
Wish I could.

178
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,077
Since you're here...

179
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,663
...be a doll and fetch us a pint,
would you?

180
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,459
Come on, don't be a cunt.
I'm fucking dying here.

181
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,295
Your dying's been pretty high
on my wish list lately.

182
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,674
I appreciate what
you're doing here for me.

183
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,718
Not one bit of this is for you.

184
00:07:57,803 --> 00:07:59,805
All right, then.

185
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,934
Give us me phone.
We got work to do.

186
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,305
Disgusting.

187
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,230
God damn it, Ryan.

188
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,159
Come here.

189
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,079
Come here. That's an order.

190
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:59,007
I'm your father.

191
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,219
Not him.

192
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:06,056
And I always will be.

193
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,064
Come here.

194
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,232
Now.

195
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:19,777
Ryan.

196
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,697
Ryan!

197
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,419
Hey.

198
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,255
You know,

199
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,965
I'd be careful with those...

200
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:45,595
...those Lean Lad Diet Lunches?

201
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,764
They cause kidney stones

202
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,849
the size of jawbreakers.

203
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,477
There's a whole class action lawsuit
against them.

204
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,062
- Come here.
- Don't!

205
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:55,647
Don't-don't fucking touch me.

206
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,940
Hey, chill, okay?

207
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,692
I just need a little recharge.

208
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,029
Oh.

209
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,240
Why the fuck would I kill your mother?

210
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:07,826
That requires going to Sedona,

211
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,287
and no one should have to go to Sedona.

212
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,539
Get out of my head.

213
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,377
Oh, this?

214
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:20,856
I proposed to Hughie this morning.

215
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:24,426
I even told him the story
about your great-grandparents.

216
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,721
And then we fucked to celebrate.

217
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:29,264
And we did butt stuff.

218
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:30,807
He was so into it.

219
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,684
Oh, Christ.

220
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,228
It's like a fucking furnace in here.

221
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,897
- Why?
- Don't you just love proposals?

222
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,734
I mean, the joy on the other person's face

223
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,278
when they finally
get their happily ever after.

224
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,529
You're a psychopath.

225
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,656
Sociopath!

226
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,286
Which is to be expected, really.
I mean,

227
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:53,079
barely remember what I look like.

228
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,958
I do remember
the first time I shifted, though.

229
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,210
One minute I was me

230
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:02,172
and the next I was Ms. Jamison,

231
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,007
my preschool teacher.

232
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,886
And I could see every memory
she'd ever had.

233
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,804
Fucking her husband's best friend,

234
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,432
shoplifting lip gloss, hitting a student.

235
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:14,517
But you know what the funny part is?

236
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,854
She felt justified

237
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,981
in doing all those shitty things.

238
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:21,733
You all do it.

239
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,070
You all think

240
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:27,781
you're the heroes of your own story.

241
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,491
I mean, look at you.

242
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,702
You're more moral and good

243
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,747
and honest than the rest of us

244
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,793
just wallowing down in the shit.

245
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,676
- I don't think that.
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

246
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,713
Mind reader, remember?

247
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,548
"Wasn't my fault

248
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,051
that I was a total cunt at the pageants,
that was Mommy.

249
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,804
Or that I had to suck cock

250
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:54,557
like a fucking popsicle
to stay in The Seven. No.

251
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,767
No, no, no, no, no.

252
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,062
I'm Annie January and it's not my fault."

253
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,265
Come on, say it with me now.

254
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,148
I'm Annie January and it's not my...

255
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,942
Fuck you!

256
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:07,821
You don't know anything
about me or my life.

257
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,407
No? Then why aren't your powers working?

258
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,870
I mean,

259
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:18,289
you weren't even
the original choice to kill Singer,

260
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:22,085
but you're just such a fucking hot mess,

261
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,379
you made it undeniable.

262
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,173
Hey.

263
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,718
You'll have a couple of...

264
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,761
non-consecutive life sentences

265
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,155
to work through your identity issues.

266
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,056
- Please...
- Aw.

267
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,808
Poor Annie.

268
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,647
- Please.
- "Oh, God, I'm Annie January

269
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,399
and I'm the only good one."

270
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,613
Oh. Here.

271
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,409
To wash down those Lean Lad Lunches.

272
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,125
Okay.

273
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,585
Ah.

274
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,764
- Oi oi.
<i>- I've called you, like,</i>

275
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,724
15 times. I was worried. I thought...

276
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,476
I don't know, I thought maybe you were...

277
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,853
Yeah, you and me both.

278
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,414
<i>Look, we're kind of up against it
right now.</i>

279
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,666
<i>They're only a few hours away
from certifying the election</i>

280
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,277
<i>and then, you know, after that happens
they're-they're coming for Singer.</i>

281
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,904
<i>We need your help.</i>

282
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,783
<i>Butcher?</i>

283
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,535
When I was a lad,

284
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,413
I heard about this place in Nevada.

285
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:43,082
A steakhouse.

286
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,337
Where the birds get their baps out
when they're bringing your ribeye.

287
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,757
<i>Cool.</i>

288
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,635
Lenny nearly pissed himself
when I told him.

289
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,388
Thought it was
the funniest thing he ever heard.

290
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,645
We was gonna go there someday.

291
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,235
Well...

292
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:14,489
Funny what you think about
when your time's up, innit?

293
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:18,159
<i>Butcher, where are you?
I-I can come to you.</i>

294
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:20,286
<i>You know, we can figure this out.</i>

295
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,413
Do us a favor, would you, Hughie?

296
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:28,962
Go there.

297
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,757
For me and Len, would you?

298
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,051
<i>You can't fucking give up.</i>

299
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,136
<i>You can still fight.</i>

300
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,264
Hughie, I asked you something.

301
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,393
<i>Fine. I'll-I'll, um...</i>

302
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,562
<i>I'll go to the topless steakhouse for you.</i>

303
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:48,356
Magic.

304
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:52,610
And, uh...

305
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,575
...tell the Boys I'm sorry, would you?

306
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,955
Tell the Boys I'm sorry

307
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,415
for, uh...

308
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,838
Just tell them I'm sorry.

309
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,051
Goodbye, Hughie.

310
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:30,607
Oh, hey, um,

311
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,152
have Negin get me a caramel pretzel
s'more frappe from Jitter Bean.

312
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:37,071
Double whip.
I'm just like molasses in winter today.

313
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:40,533
Ugh, God, that's enough, Amber. Thank you.

314
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,664
Good morning.

315
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:48,291
How are you doing this mor...

316
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,792
Oh, God.

317
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,711
Excuse me.

318
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,938
Can we just make this quick, please?

319
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,315
I have slightly more important things
to do today.

320
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,925
- Yes ma'am, of course.
- Hey.

321
00:16:57,008 --> 00:17:00,136
Stand by.
Going in five, four,

322
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,804
three...

323
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,534
{\an8}Welcome to the show, folks.

324
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,977
{\an8}We got a real happy surprise
for y'all today.

325
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,314
{\an8}Homelander and vice president-elect

326
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,399
{\an8}Victoria Neuman.

327
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,402
{\an8}Bless both your hearts
for being here.

328
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:19,489
{\an8}I'm more than happy to find time
for my friend Homelander.

329
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,115
{\an8}Yeah, let's cut the BS.

330
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,285
{\an8}Dakota Bob says he's gonna pass
nutbag anti-Supe laws

331
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,828
{\an8}in his first hundred days.

332
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,389
As his VP...

333
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,523
...staunch ally of the super-abled community,

334
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:38,275
I really think that it's important to...

335
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,385
{\an8}Ally, Victoria, really?

336
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,931
We're here to tell the truth.

337
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:48,101
So just... tell the truth.

338
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:53,606
The truth is that

339
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,490
the real issue here
is lack of representation.

340
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:57,419
- And I want to make sure that you...
- Fine, you don't want to do it?

341
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,444
I'll do it.

342
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:59,862
Uh...

343
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,157
{\an8}Victoria here is a superhero.

344
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,953
{\an8}Thanks for the compliment.

345
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:10,039
{\an8}But, like, I think the truth
is we all want to be heroes,

346
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,709
{\an8}but, um, I'm not literally a su...

347
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:16,587
Oh, fuck.

348
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:18,798
It's all true.

349
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:22,885
<i>Ms. Neuman here has been operating as</i>

350
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,304
a secret dagger
in the heart of the deep state,

351
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,557
standing up to the forces of darkness
that want to

352
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,393
<i>sodomize our democracy and our toddlers,</i>

353
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,271
<i>but it is time for the great awakening.</i>

354
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:36,232
Where we go one, we go Vought, y'all.

355
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,376
<i>We're gonna take a quick break...</i>

356
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,402
Cunt's out of the bag, innit?

357
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,071
Now it gets interesting.

358
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,574
All right. Great show, guys.

359
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,995
Hey. Hey!

360
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:54,584
- Ma'am...
- Fuck off! Hey.

361
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,627
I worked my whole life
to keep that secret.

362
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,921
Well, secrets rot your soul.

363
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,299
- You're unburdened. You should thank me.
- Sage said...

364
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,010
Fuck Sage. She's long gone. Listen to me.

365
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,386
Listen to me.

366
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,014
We are gonna change the world,

367
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,892
Vicky, for our kids and their kids.

368
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,479
The first super-abled president.

369
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:17,273
Hmm? And you're a gal.

370
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,525
I'll be impeached.

371
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,169
- Why would we care?
- Because I have to

372
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,446
- get re-elected in four years.
- Says who?

373
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,769
Article II of the Constitution.

374
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:26,157
New world, new rules.

375
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,201
Now shut the fuck up and listen.

376
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,203
Our fates are connected now.

377
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:33,539
Singer's as good as dead, and I am
the only fucking friend you've got left.

378
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:37,210
The train has left the station,
gorgeous, and you're on it.

379
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:41,672
You'll have to arrest half your company.
Half the country.

380
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,190
Wait, you think I didn't think of that?
Of course I thought of that.

381
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,890
Fuck.

382
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,894
- Ashley, on me now.
- Um, the response on socials has been mixed.

383
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,396
I need you to make a list
of anyone within the company

384
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,942
that has damaging information on me
or The Seven...

385
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,401
but mostly me...

386
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,129
anyone with any fucking
leverage whatsoever.

387
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:06,239
- Yes.
- I need this fucking list yesterday.

388
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:07,323
Yes, sir.

389
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,699
You're a good girl.

390
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:11,994
Um...

391
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,206
- that doesn't sound good, Ashley.
- Oh, yeah, no shit, Ashley.

392
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,457
Sorry, Ashley.

393
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,084
{\an8}Order!

394
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:21,754
{\an8}The purpose of the joint session
having concluded,

395
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:25,967
{\an8}pursuant to Senate Concurrent
Resolution 1, 118th congress,

396
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,262
{\an8}the chair declares
the joint session resolved.

397
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,515
{\an8}...certified the election
despite the shocking news

398
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,644
{\an8}that vice president-elect
Victoria Neuman is super-abled.

399
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,063
{\an8} <i>Protests have erupted all over the country</i>

400
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,827
{\an8} <i>- as Starlighters...</i>
- That's the ballgame.

401
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,359
Open season on Singer now.
Frenchie, tell me you got something.

402
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,820
You want to try this instead of me?

403
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:47,947
I'm working as fast as I can.

404
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,740
Not fast enough.

405
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,701
<i>Multiple protestors have been injured...</i>

406
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,953
You seeing this?

407
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,931
Get all the dirt on Neuman ready
in case we need to go nuclear.

408
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,432
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What happened to the virus?

409
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,125
There is no fucking virus.

410
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,335
What? Fuck.

411
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:04,297
Okay, well, you know she's gonna
kill us if we leak this, right?

412
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,108
If I had another fucking choice,
trust me, I'd take it.

413
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,484
<i>All right, here goes fucking nothing.</i>

414
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,552
Hi.

415
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,306
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. Fuck!

416
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:14,932
- What? What happened?
- It's all gone.

417
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:16,577
Everything we have on Neuman...
the murders,

418
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,704
<i>- her ties to Stan Edgar, everything.</i>
- Okay, okay, wait a second.

419
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,123
You got backups, right... another computer
or the motherfucking cloud?

420
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,232
You're not hearing me. It's all gone.
The originals,

421
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,692
the backups, we've got nothing.

422
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:28,154
Ain't nothing stopping her then.

423
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,906
Only one thing left to do.

424
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:33,701
Frenchie, you stay here,
work fucking faster.

425
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:35,161
Kimiko, you're with me.

426
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,181
Listen, Hughie, I'm sending you
coordinates. You and Annie,

427
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:38,873
<i>- meet there ASAP.</i>
- What's the plan?

428
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:42,710
We fucked up our chance at offense.
All we got now is defense.

429
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,964
I am as shocked as you are

430
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:49,926
by this profound betrayal of trust.

431
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,845
In America, you tell people who you are

432
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:55,181
before you ask for their vote.

433
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,935
<i>That's why I'm calling
for a new, free and fair election.</i>

434
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,062
<i>Mark my words,</i>

435
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,439
<i>if Victoria Neuman becomes vice president,</i>

436
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,150
<i>it will be over my dead body</i>

437
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:08,110
<i>because she had me assassinated.</i>

438
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,490
Wow. Guess you got to go
take a bullet for the geezer, don't you?

439
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,533
I think it's more important
that I stay here.

440
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,786
Your visitor's here.

441
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,996
Send him in.

442
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:30,925
Man, this is never gonna work.

443
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,844
You got my text.

444
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:35,554
I'm glad you came.

445
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:38,891
You're almost taller than me now.

446
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:41,560
There's no saving the kid.
He can't escape his own blood.

447
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:42,871
What are they feeding you?

448
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,831
And tell me there's vegetables
involved somewhere.

449
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:46,524
There's lettuce on the burgers.

450
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,317
I've missed you, kiddo.

451
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,822
Listen, Ryan,

452
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,700
we, uh, need to have
a bit of a serious chin wag.

453
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:58,327
You look... really sick.

454
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,870
Don't I know it.

455
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:04,333
Mate, I've wished myself dead more times

456
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,960
than I can count.

457
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,090
And now here I am,

458
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:12,425
and I want some more time.

459
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,885
But I don't have it,

460
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,846
and I don't have time
to ease you into this.

461
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,639
You're gonna have to kill him, Billy.

462
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:20,725
You can't go back to the tower.

463
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,311
- You need to go with Aunt Grace.
- What?

464
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:25,271
- Like when?
- Now.

465
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,440
- Right now.
- No, I-I can't.

466
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:29,942
- My dad would find me.
- Not this time, kiddo.

467
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,487
Well...

468
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:35,114
I'm not sure I want to leave.

469
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:38,367
I kind of like it there.
Well, parts of it.

470
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,971
You see? You got to stab him with
the virus and you got to do it today.

471
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:43,247
Ryan, no.

472
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:45,499
- Your Dad is a...
- Grace.

473
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:49,128
Look...

474
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:52,465
when your mom died...
which weren't your fault...

475
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,468
...you heard what she said.

476
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:58,846
She had me promise to keep you safe,
and that's all I'm trying to do here.

477
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,474
Now, if you're telling me,

478
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,559
I mean, seriously telling me,

479
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,437
that the place you feel safest

480
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,022
is with Homelander...

481
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,903
...then I ain't gonna stop you.

482
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,334
Do you want to play?

483
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:34,548
All right, then. Come on.

484
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,874
- Have you seen Ryan?
- No, but I can send a PA

485
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,527
- to go look, if you need.
- No. No. Boys need their space.

486
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,904
- List?
- Oh, yeah. Um... Sorry.

487
00:24:56,987 --> 00:24:57,905
Thank you.

488
00:24:57,988 --> 00:24:59,824
I highlighted
anyone who's contract

489
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,784
we'd have to pay out if they're...

490
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,870
...let go.

491
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:06,997
Great. Thank you. Good job.

492
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:08,666
You're excused.

493
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:17,049
You know, no problem. I can get it.

494
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,102
Cilantro.

495
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:31,522
Gentlemen.

496
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:34,817
The Seven is a circle of trust.

497
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:41,323
What we're gonna tell you
is extremely sensitive.

498
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,075
- Got it?
- O Captain, my Captain.

499
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:47,288
Robert Singer will be dead

500
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,081
by end of business.

501
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:50,708
Neuman will be sworn in.

502
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,127
People will panic. There will be rioting,

503
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,754
bloodshed, et cetera, et cetera.

504
00:25:55,838 --> 00:26:00,134
Someone will have to swoop in
and restore order.

505
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,929
We will put out the call
to every Vought hero,

506
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:06,557
every fucking one,
to surround the Capitol,

507
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,851
the White House, and the Pentagon.

508
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,687
Defending the rightful President Neuman.

509
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,898
Now, what I need you two...

510
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,568
Fuck's sakes, get a Ricola.

511
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:22,239
Sorry, sir. I'm-I'm so sorry.
I'm just... the meds, you know.

512
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:24,825
You know, the... the meds.

513
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:28,597
They're just, they're causing a little

514
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,749
heart palpitation and a high fever,
but it ain't no big thing.

515
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,560
Okay, well, you're coughing all over me,
and it's fucking disgusting.

516
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,585
Go further down.

517
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,129
Scoot.

518
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:52,770
Further.

519
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,199
As I was saying...

520
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:08,369
...everyone on this list

521
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:11,705
needs to be removed.

522
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,458
Permanently, by the end of the day.

523
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,129
Hey, if we're thinking about
who's got the most dirt on us,

524
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,715
wouldn't Ashley's name be
at the top of the list?

525
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,553
Yeah. Sure. Good idea.

526
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,434
Does anybody know Ashley's last name?

527
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,569
What the...?

528
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:42,272
You seriously
telling us

529
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:43,607
the Shifter can get through that?

530
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:45,942
Look, for all I fucking know,
they could be in here already.

531
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:49,261
So, from now on,
everybody moves with a partner,

532
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:51,930
and you check in
every five minutes on the dot.

533
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:54,308
Stay sharp and follow
motherfucking orders.

534
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,268
Come on, let's get to it.

535
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:57,936
Sir, you're gonna be all right.

536
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,938
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

537
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:02,149
we wouldn't be stuck
four stories underground

538
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:04,443
playing pocket pool, idiot.

539
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,073
Balls.

540
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:11,909
Kimiko, stay on Singer.

541
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,708
Do you really think
the Shifter is in here?

542
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:22,878
I hope not, for Christ's sake,
but it could be anyone,

543
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,630
so eyes on everyone.

544
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,256
Okay. You got it.

545
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,011
Jesus.

546
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,890
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

547
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,686
I'm just... warm.

548
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:40,104
It's like a furnace in here.

549
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:43,440
It's like a furnace in there.

550
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,241
Y-You should go find some water.

551
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:55,202
Yeah. Okay. Do you want one?

552
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:56,995
I would love one.

553
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,956
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

554
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,257
Holy fucking shit.

555
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,159
Balls.

556
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:38,454
Hey. Hey, man. Hey, just... sorry.
Just something... stupid.

557
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,223
Real quick, just don't look at me,
look right into the room.

558
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,708
- Huh?
- Don't look at me, just look forward.

559
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,019
- Don't look at me, just look forward.
- All right, all right, okay.

560
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,379
Stay cool.

561
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:49,506
- It's Annie.
- What's Annie?

562
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,425
- The Shifter, it's Annie.
- What?

563
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:52,902
She's the Shifter.
Don't look at me, just look forward.

564
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:53,969
How do you know?

565
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,573
Just trust me, I don't know how
or when they switched, but that is

566
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:59,224
- 100% percent not Annie.
- Okay, okay, okay, listen.

567
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:02,468
The fate of the country relies on us
keeping our shit together, so just chill...

568
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,855
- Hey.
- Hey. - Hey.

569
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:05,981
Water?

570
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,459
- Thanks.
- There you go.

571
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,109
- Yeah, great.
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,487
Mmm.

573
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:15,491
Mmm. Mmm.

574
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:19,495
What are you looking at?

575
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,332
- Uh...
- I know.

576
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:29,671
Oh. Wow... you...

577
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:33,008
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

578
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,131
Yep. We did that.

579
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,261
That is a thing...

580
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:37,989
- that we did.
- For the record,

581
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:41,767
I proposed.
'Cause peg the patriarchy, right?

582
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,020
Yeah, peg the patriarchy.
You got to peg it...

583
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,480
peg it in all its holes.

584
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:47,707
Listen, getting hitched,

585
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,083
best decision I ever made in my life,

586
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,943
so congratulations to you both.

587
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:53,403
But, uh, you know,
Mother Nature's calling,

588
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:55,155
so I'm about to go hit the head, and...

589
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,342
- y'all just hold down the fort...
- Yes, motherfucker.

590
00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,969
- Sir, get down.
- Sir, come with me.

591
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,036
Aah!

592
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,704
Sir, this way.

593
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:05,082
Oh, shit.

594
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,972
Oh, goddamn it.

595
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,577
Go.

596
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,538
Come on.

597
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:27,807
How many fucking numbers are there?

598
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,708
Oh, God.

599
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,096
Take Singer. Go.

600
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
Now.

601
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:47,517
- Let's go.
- Go.

602
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,519
Hughie, go.

603
00:33:56,568 --> 00:34:00,739
You really think
your broke-down ass can take me?

604
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:04,451
You couldn't even blast
yourself out, could you?

605
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,188
You're right.

606
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,816
I don't know if I'm a hero.

607
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:40,529
I don't know who the fuck I am.

608
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,785
But I do know
that I'm the bitch beating your ass.

609
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,445
Victoria.

610
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:23,196
Singer's alive. Your assassin failed.

611
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,049
<i>- What do you mean failed?</i>
- Now the CIA's gonna find

612
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,616
<i>an even deeper hole to hide him in.</i>

613
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,410
Well, there's nothing on the news.

614
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,662
Because he's gonna
hit me back quietly, and I'm fairly

615
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,330
fucking sure he has the means to do it.

616
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:33,707
<i>Where is Sage?</i>

617
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,644
<i>Maybe she can find a way out
of this idiotic mess you've dropped us in.</i>

618
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:40,630
We have not failed.
I will end Singer myself if I have to.

619
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:43,300
<i>You will be president, and you will</i>

620
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:45,677
go along with every word I say

621
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:49,765
as if my hand was jammed up
your tight, puckered little asshole,

622
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,242
like the puppet you've always been.

623
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:55,937
<i>And, Victoria, if you stray
even an inch off that path,</i>

624
00:35:56,021 --> 00:36:00,275
I will make sure Zoe knows nothing
but pain for the rest of her life,

625
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,403
<i>and I will send you
a piece of her every year</i>

626
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:05,447
for the fucking rest of yours.

627
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,158
<i>There is no fail.</i>

628
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,420
Well, guess who has two thumbs

629
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:24,174
and is the motherfucking genius
of all fucking geniuses.

630
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:25,675
The virus is...

631
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:28,637
What happened to you guys?

632
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,293
Hello, hello.

633
00:37:00,377 --> 00:37:03,130
Um, you okay?

634
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:04,673
I'm great.

635
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,716
Thank God you showed up.

636
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:10,262
- How'd you find us, anyway?
- Find Your Phone.

637
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:15,517
- I actually also found your fiancée.
- Oh...

638
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,036
- Congratulations.
- No, she's not...

639
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,103
She wasn't my fiancée.

640
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:19,312
No, you're...

641
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:22,774
You put the ring on her finger, Hughie.

642
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:26,695
- Mm.
- I know because I pried it off her fucking dead hand!

643
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,631
Look, I thought I was
getting engaged to you, all right?

644
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:31,700
She looked just like you, you know,
right down to that freckle you have

645
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,035
- down...
- So you did fuck her.

646
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,245
I...

647
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:36,454
I mean, you know...

648
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:37,831
How many times?

649
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:39,207
Had to be less than...

650
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,710
...20.

651
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,961
Oh, my fucking God.

652
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,671
- I was gone for ten days.
- She almost

653
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:47,154
always initiated, and, again,
I cannot overstate this enough,

654
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:48,800
I thought it was you.

655
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:51,487
Yeah, and as long as you were
getting laid, you didn't look too close.

656
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,013
That's the Annie you want.

657
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,973
Down to go down whenever.
The perfect girl.

658
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:59,186
Not someone who is depressed or fucked-up

659
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:00,979
or comes with any complications.

660
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:05,078
You want to know how I knew it wasn't you?

661
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:10,739
In the apartment
she wore some designer dress,

662
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,301
and you always ditch your bra
for sweats as soon as you get home.

663
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,993
She, she found your car keys

664
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:18,580
on the first try, and you have never, ever
found your car keys in under 15 minutes.

665
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,664
But the final clue:

666
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:22,667
in the bunker she was sweating,

667
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:27,297
and you have always been
and always will be 90% pashmina.

668
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,174
I love that about you.

669
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,967
All your weird, amazing

670
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:33,345
fucked-up-ness, that's what makes you you.

671
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,889
Annie, please.

672
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:40,018
I can't.

673
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:47,859
Fuck.

674
00:38:58,745 --> 00:38:59,913
Vicky?

675
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:01,248
I want out.

676
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,084
<i>Sorry, is-is this a joke?</i>

677
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:06,127
No.

678
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,380
It's gone too far.

679
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,524
No. No, you're just saying that
'cause the assassination failed.

680
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,548
<i>No, I'm saying it
'cause it'll never fucking end.</i>

681
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:15,971
Homelander's unhinged,
he's not even listening to Sage anymore.

682
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,014
If I become president,
I'm just gonna be a puppet,

683
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,641
and if I fight back, he'll...

684
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,562
I'll resign without a fight.

685
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,083
<i>You just need to get the CIA off my ass
and get me and Zoe out.</i>

686
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:28,483
Okay, fuck all the way off.

687
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,277
<i>You're like the asshole who cried wolf.</i>

688
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,487
- I mean, the shit that you have done...
<i>- Oh, what?</i>

689
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,799
Like how you got Sameer to cook up
some more of the virus to kill me?

690
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:36,408
Oh, and, yeah, cut off his fucking leg!

691
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:37,993
Ah.

692
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,161
Glad you two connected. Okay.

693
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,746
<i>So the leg thing wasn't me,</i>

694
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,849
and you didn't exactly leave us
with a ton of options.

695
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:46,543
<i>Look, the point is,
you hit me, I hit you back,</i>

696
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,044
<i>and it never fucking ends.</i>

697
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:49,462
<i>WarGames,</i> Hughie.

698
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,133
The only way to win is not to play.

699
00:39:58,513 --> 00:39:59,764
I thought I wanted this.

700
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:01,933
<i>Not for Zoe or...</i>

701
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:04,477
Edgar but for me.

702
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:08,273
<i>You know, I just...
I wanted to feel safe, and not like</i>

703
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:10,567
that scared fucking kid at Red River.

704
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,489
But I don't feel safe,
and I'm really fucking scared.

705
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:21,077
And I'm not getting Zoe killed over this.

706
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:26,708
This is the only way.

707
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,272
Vicky, I don't know how to trust you.

708
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,005
I'll tell you where Zoe is.

709
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:34,758
Is she okay?

710
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:37,677
<i>Yeah, but if I get her,
it'll draw too much attention.</i>

711
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,363
And that's how you know you can trust me,

712
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:42,015
because I am trusting
my daughter with you.

713
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:46,186
<i>Please, Hughie.</i>

714
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:49,898
You're literally the only person on Earth
I can turn to right now.

715
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:03,203
Enough fucking running.

716
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,133
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

717
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:19,219
Sorry, bro, you're on the list.

718
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:21,638
Don't kill me. I can pay you.

719
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:22,889
You're a writer.

720
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:24,283
- You don't get paid shit.
- Please...

721
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:25,558
I-I'll do anything.

722
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:29,604
Anything?

723
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,775
Tell me I'm the smartest
superhero in The Seven.

724
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,655
You are, by far,
the smartest superhero in The Seven.

725
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:40,281
You're brilliant, a genius.

726
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,410
And that you respect me the most.
Besides Homelander, of course.

727
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:45,495
Of course. Of course I respect you.

728
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:48,039
You-You're amazing.

729
00:41:48,123 --> 00:41:50,667
You're just saying that
'cause you're scared, aren't you?

730
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,001
No, I'm not.

731
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:54,587
- I swear.
- Yeah, you are.

732
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,632
But you know what, bro?

733
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,260
That's good enough for me.

734
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,860
Yo, have you seen Ashley?

735
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:18,653
This is Ashley.

736
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:22,407
No, bro.

737
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,409
The other Ashley.

738
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,805
- This Ashley's not even on the list.
- Well, I don't know.

739
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:29,539
Everyone here's named fucking Ashley.

740
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,625
Bro.

741
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,719
Murder boner.

742
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:44,613
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Look,

743
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:46,764
if we can flip Neuman,
as powerful as she is,

744
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:48,933
with everything
that she has on Vought, I mean,

745
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:50,768
if there's even a five percent chance.

746
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:53,396
<i>Alors,</i> what, just forget
that Neuman is a monster?

747
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,315
I'm not saying that. I'm saying...

748
00:42:55,398 --> 00:42:57,192
Look, we've all done bad shit.

749
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,819
What if she's just fucked-up
like the rest of us,

750
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:01,571
just trying to do right by her kid?

751
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:04,616
It's insane
that we're even discussing this.

752
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:07,285
What's insane is
that our solution to every problem

753
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:08,453
is murder.

754
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:11,122
I used to freak out whenever I saw blood.

755
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:12,790
Now I barely blink at it.

756
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,502
It shouldn't be that way.

757
00:43:15,585 --> 00:43:17,712
This isn't some fucking Vought movie.

758
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,422
Violence isn't brave.

759
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:21,841
Neither is hating my mom

760
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:23,801
or A-Train or...

761
00:43:23,885 --> 00:43:25,011
anyone.

762
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:26,721
But forgiveness,

763
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:27,889
letting go,

764
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,390
a little fucking mercy...

765
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,184
that's brave.

766
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:33,853
It's crazy.

767
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:35,855
But it's brave.

768
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,662
It's about the last thing my dad
ever taught me, and I just think...

769
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,547
...if we're ever gonna win
against monsters,

770
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:45,615
I think we need to start acting human.

771
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,081
Fuck it.

772
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,044
Really? Just... fuck it?

773
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:00,046
Annie, we're probably dead either way.

774
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:02,882
Might as well go out
with our heads held high.

775
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:04,384
So...

776
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:05,969
- fuck it.
- Oh.

777
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:07,095
Great.

778
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08,596
Look,

779
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,181
taking a chance with A-Train,

780
00:44:10,265 --> 00:44:12,267
that shit was crazy.

781
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,935
But look at how it turned out.

782
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,731
Shit.

783
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,151
Fuck it.

784
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:23,611
<i>Petit</i> Hughie,

785
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:24,696
if you're wrong...

786
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,155
Trust but verify.

787
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,742
But, Frenchie, can you get that virus
into Neuman's system?

788
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:31,869
With a carbon metamaterial tip

789
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:33,663
to a dart gun

790
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:36,332
and I aim for soft tissue...

791
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:38,626
...perhaps.

792
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,770
Then do it.

793
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:42,630
'Cause if this is a trap,
at least we ain't walking in blind.

794
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:46,342
And, Hughie, if Neuman even blinks funny,

795
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:48,177
Frenchie's dropping her.

796
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:50,221
Fair. Got it.

797
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,224
Look, Annie...

798
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:54,642
Shut up.

799
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:59,564
You are getting tested
for every single disease known to mankind.

800
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:01,190
Okay?

801
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:02,942
I'm not getting Shifter syphilis.

802
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:11,951
Fuck yeah, Hughie. Fuck yeah.

803
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:19,042
You really think this is wise?

804
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,962
What if Hughie's right?

805
00:45:23,796 --> 00:45:29,177
What if forgiveness is the best we can do?

806
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:31,387
Even to Neuman?

807
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:33,598
To Neuman.

808
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:35,933
To ourselves.

809
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,564
Neuman is easy compared to us.

810
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:45,401
How?

811
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:51,908
We try a little every day, I guess.

812
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:04,921
You know how I said
you should be with Colin?

813
00:46:05,004 --> 00:46:06,422
<i>Oui.</i>

814
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:11,094
I lied.

815
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:15,807
I just thought you deserved
to be with someone...

816
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:23,940
Better than me.

817
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:26,901
<i>Mon coeur...</i>

818
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,364
...there is no one...

819
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:34,075
...better than you.

820
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:14,991
You know I can hear you.

821
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,579
"Marvin said there was an attempt
on Singer's life.

822
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:21,414
- He survived."
- We know.

823
00:47:21,497 --> 00:47:24,333
There's just some things you don't got
to worry about. That's all.

824
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,311
They're gonna try again,
and that virus

825
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:27,837
is a Hail Mary at best.

826
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,423
We are out of time
and out of better options.

827
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:32,049
Ryan needs to know the truth.

828
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:33,468
And we'll get there.

829
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,052
What truth?

830
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:38,806
The assassination attempt,

831
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,892
it was on your father's orders.

832
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:43,186
What?

833
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,605
And Flight 37...

834
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:49,025
Homelander killed every soul on board.

835
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:50,109
Grace.

836
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:51,194
You're lying.

837
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:52,278
We have it on video.

838
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:54,071
And he's murdered countless more.

839
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:56,008
- Your father isn't who you think he is.
- Just stop.

840
00:47:56,032 --> 00:47:58,313
- And he wasn't having an affair with your mother.
- Grace.

841
00:47:58,367 --> 00:47:59,452
He raped her.

842
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:12,298
I'm sorry, son.

843
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:14,634
And?

844
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,220
Your heart's pounding.

845
00:48:17,303 --> 00:48:19,764
There's something you're not telling me.

846
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,766
And you're the only one who can stop him.

847
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:23,935
S-Stop him?

848
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:25,937
Like, kill him?

849
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,438
No. No, I can't.

850
00:48:27,522 --> 00:48:28,815
Don't ask me to.

851
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:30,107
Ryan, you're strong.

852
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:31,818
- He's stronger.
- We'll train you.

853
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:34,004
- Get you ready.
- So this is why you want me to go with you?

854
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:36,697
So you can teach me how to kill my dad?

855
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,241
I have to go.

856
00:48:38,324 --> 00:48:39,784
No, just stay.

857
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:41,953
- We'll talk it out together.
- I don't want to talk.

858
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:43,746
I'll be back, I just need to think.

859
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,016
Listen, Ryan, there ain't gonna be
another time for you and me.

860
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,726
All right? Let's just take a breather.
Yeah?

861
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,252
You can't leave.

862
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:56,592
Wait.

863
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:58,803
These walls are six feet thick.

864
00:48:58,886 --> 00:49:00,805
This is the CIA's Hazlet safe house.

865
00:49:00,888 --> 00:49:02,431
Designed to hold people like you.

866
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:05,142
I could seal us in here,
flood the room with halothane.

867
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:07,353
And we all take a nice, long nap.

868
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:09,939
- But I don't want to do that, kiddo.
- You planned this.

869
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:12,275
All along.
You, you brought me here to trap me.

870
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:14,193
No, no. We brought you here to help you.

871
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:16,779
You're locking me in a cage
unless I agree to be your weapon.

872
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:18,406
Just like they did to my dad.

873
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,533
That ain't the way it is, honest.

874
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:23,870
- Let me go.
- Ryan.

875
00:49:23,953 --> 00:49:26,038
When I lost my grandkids, it left

876
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:29,208
this big empty black hole inside me.

877
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,169
Then the greatest miracle came along.

878
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:34,005
You.

879
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,218
I love you, kiddo.

880
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:40,845
Please.

881
00:49:40,928 --> 00:49:44,015
Aunt Grace... I want to leave.

882
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:45,850
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of my way.

883
00:49:45,933 --> 00:49:47,727
Grace.

884
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:48,644
I'm sorry.

885
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:50,730
No!

886
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:55,002
What?

887
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,133
Hello, hello.

888
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,847
You took your braces off,
since last time we saw you.

889
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,100
- Let's not do that.
- Uh-huh.

890
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,060
How's this gonna work, Neuman?

891
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:12,603
Simple.

892
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:14,438
You help me get clear of Homelander,

893
00:51:14,522 --> 00:51:16,691
and Singer's people at the CIA.

894
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,944
- And I go quietly.
- Mm.

895
00:51:20,027 --> 00:51:23,447
- And you'll owe us one.
- A lot more than one.

896
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:28,452
I will owe you many.

897
00:51:28,536 --> 00:51:31,497
Great. So you're gonna help us

898
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,082
take down Vought

899
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:34,834
and Homelander.

900
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:39,755
Oi.

901
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:47,263
Butcher?

902
00:51:49,098 --> 00:51:50,808
No deals.

903
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,104
I can explain, all right?
It's all good. I know

904
00:51:55,187 --> 00:51:57,708
what this looks like, but with everything
that we've been through together,

905
00:51:57,732 --> 00:52:01,610
I've never once asked you to trust me.
I am asking now.

906
00:52:01,694 --> 00:52:04,113
Like the way you used to trust Lenny.

907
00:52:06,532 --> 00:52:08,951
Please, Butcher.

908
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:43,486
Stop!

909
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:48,199
No, no, no, no.

910
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:23,859
Stop. Stop.

911
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,905
It's suicide.

912
00:53:30,491 --> 00:53:32,993
I'll be taking that virus now,
thanks, Frenchie.

913
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,495
Ain't no fucking way.

914
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,414
You took V?

915
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:40,167
It will work on you, too.

916
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,350
If I were you lot,

917
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,018
I wouldn't hang about.

918
00:54:02,648 --> 00:54:04,900
Oh, by the way.

919
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,031
You're all fucking welcome.

920
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,719
{\an8}<i>We are interrupting our regular reporting
with a breaking news story,</i>

921
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:34,054
{\an8} <i>that at... I'm sorry, I'm just</i>

922
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:37,016
{\an8}<i>looking to my producers here.
Is this confirmed?</i>

923
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:39,935
<i>They're, they're,
they're telling me it has been.</i>

924
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:43,564
<i>The Vice President-Elect,
Victoria Neuman, is dead.</i>

925
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,816
<i>Assassinated today only hours</i>

926
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,111
<i>after revealing to the world
that she is super-abled...</i>

927
00:54:49,195 --> 00:54:51,280
Where's Ryan?

928
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:54,158
This was all for him after all, right?

929
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:56,368
What are you doing here?

930
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:58,204
Celebrating.

931
00:54:58,287 --> 00:54:59,997
We won. Here.

932
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:03,792
Everything's turned to shit.

933
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:05,127
Plan's dead.

934
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:07,171
This is the plan.

935
00:55:07,254 --> 00:55:10,090
I mean, sure, a few curveballs,

936
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:13,010
but, uh, we got here.

937
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:15,012
Just had to keep a few bits to myself.

938
00:55:15,095 --> 00:55:16,889
You know, the bits you'd fuck up by...

939
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:20,267
...you know, being you.

940
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,977
Neuman would have been a shit patsy.

941
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:23,479
Stubborn, too many ideas.

942
00:55:23,562 --> 00:55:25,606
So I went another way.

943
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,234
<i>...Bob Singer himself
ordering the assassination.</i>

944
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:30,819
<i>If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,</i>

945
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:34,156
<i>we wouldn't be stuck four stories
underground playing pocket pool.</i>

946
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,658
<i>And now we go live.</i>

947
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:37,868
{\an8} <i>Okay, that's President-Elect Robert Singer</i>

948
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:40,079
{\an8} <i>taken into custody by federal agents...</i>

949
00:55:40,162 --> 00:55:41,455
{\an8} <i>She tried to kill me first.</i>

950
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,625
{\an8}<i>...in an unprecedented turn
of events that is</i>

951
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,587
{\an8}<i>certain to go down
as one of the darkest days...</i>

952
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,090
Oh.

953
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:53,300
It's for you.

954
00:55:55,844 --> 00:55:57,096
Who is it?

955
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:59,181
Oh, Speaker of the House Calhoun.

956
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:01,016
Once they invoke the 25th,

957
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,643
he's next in line to be president.

958
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,937
He'd like to pledge his allegiance to you.

959
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,820
To me?

960
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:15,322
Just like I promised.

961
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:16,657
We had a deal.

962
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,075
Yeah, well, I broke the deal.

963
00:56:18,158 --> 00:56:19,827
I didn't.

964
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,287
I told you,

965
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,539
you could trust me, boo.

966
00:56:23,622 --> 00:56:25,624
I got your back.

967
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,886
I-I threw you out like...

968
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:40,306
...like garbage.

969
00:56:42,308 --> 00:56:43,559
Why would you do this?

970
00:56:45,853 --> 00:56:47,855
To see if I could.

971
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:52,109
Thank you.

972
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:54,445
This was so much fun.

973
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:56,447
Whoo.

974
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,033
Just, you know, next time,

975
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,160
listen to me.

976
00:57:04,371 --> 00:57:05,914
Next time?

977
00:57:05,998 --> 00:57:08,000
Oh, hells yeah, blond ambition.

978
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,046
Buckle up for phase two.

979
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:28,771
Homelander speaking.

980
00:57:28,854 --> 00:57:32,024
And that is why, as my first official act,

981
00:57:32,107 --> 00:57:35,194
under Article One,
Section Nine of the Constitution,

982
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:37,780
I'm declaring martial law

983
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:42,284
and deputizing hundreds
of superheroes nationwide,

984
00:57:42,368 --> 00:57:44,244
who will report directly

985
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:47,498
to Homelander himself.

986
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,375
- To keep...
- Thank you, Mr. President.

987
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:57,299
Victoria Neuman, she was a great American.

988
00:57:57,383 --> 00:57:59,009
And a dear, dear friend.

989
00:57:59,093 --> 00:58:00,636
Murdered

990
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,931
<i>in cold blood by deep-state Starlighters</i>

991
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,350
<i>embedded in our own government.</i>

992
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:09,395
<i>Now that we have full legal authority,</i>

993
00:58:09,478 --> 00:58:12,606
a veritable army of superheroes
will be called upon

994
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:16,735
<i>to rout these traitors from our government
and from our streets.</i>

995
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:19,947
America will be safe again.

996
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,573
<i>And to the Starlighters,</i>

997
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:23,784
<i>whatever rock you're hiding under,</i>

998
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,703
<i>we're coming for you.</i>

999
00:58:26,787 --> 00:58:28,497
I'm coming for you.

1000
00:58:29,957 --> 00:58:32,251
Because today...

1001
00:58:33,585 --> 00:58:36,547
...a new age of superheroes begins.

1002
00:59:14,877 --> 00:59:17,212
We wake up to a new world.

1003
00:59:17,296 --> 00:59:19,673
Where hope, purity

1004
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,843
and Jesus's love shine down upon us all.

1005
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:27,473
<i>Where children can sleep peacefully
in their mothers' arms,</i>

1006
00:59:27,556 --> 00:59:31,894
<i>knowing Starlight's pedo agenda
has been thwarted.</i>

1007
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:40,736
Kimiko!

1008
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,138
<i>Where America
finally sees the woke mob</i>

1009
01:00:08,222 --> 01:00:11,016
<i>for what it is:
monsters who want to destroy</i>

1010
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:14,394
<i>our heritage, traffic our children,</i>

1011
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,563
<i>and feminize our men.</i>

1012
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:21,318
Where, with Homelander's guidance...

1013
01:00:24,863 --> 01:00:27,449
...we will all come together in unity.

1014
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:34,081
No.

1015
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,792
No. No!

1016
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:39,628
No!

1017
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,090
No!

1018
01:00:57,896 --> 01:01:00,440
<i>We will make America</i>

1019
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:03,151
<i>strong again.</i>

1020
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:05,404
<i>Proud again.</i>

1021
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,035
<i>And most of all,</i>

1022
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:15,080
<i>we will make America super again.</i>

1023
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:47,070
How long have you known?

1024
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:49,615
Only since this morning's
classified briefing.

1025
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:54,661
You were my first call.

1026
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:57,456
Hand to God.

1027
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:06,340
You got to be fucking kidding me.

1028
01:02:08,008 --> 01:02:09,801
This whole time.
