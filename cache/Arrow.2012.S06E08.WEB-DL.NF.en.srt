Oh, my God...

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,469
Oh, my God what? Who is that?

3
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,558
That's Tommy Merlyn.

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
He died over four years ago.

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,188
Oliver, who's Tommy Merlyn?

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,861
Thea's other brother.

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,116
And my best friend.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,295
We're gonna need a moment alone.

9
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,509
[Mick] He's a crony.

10
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,595
-Anachronism.
-That's what I said.

11
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,638
Lately, we've been dealing
with Anachronisms.

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,391
It's people and things
displaced throughout time.

13
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,020
Okay, but why would Nazis from 1945
want to crash my wedding?

14
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,689
Crab legs. They were delicious.

15
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,483
Well, Iris has a point though.

16
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,401
If they're out of time,
they would have targeted

17
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,153
the military or law enforcement.

18
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,947
Tommy was plucked from five years ago
and put in the Prometheus wardrobe.

19
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,157
That doesn't make any sense.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,409
It does if we're not dealing
with an Anachronism.

21
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,994
Visitors from another Earth?

22
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,287
What, there are more than one?

23
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,247
There are 52, actually.

24
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,876
Though I'm hard-pressed to think
of one where Nazis are ascendant.

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,960
I can.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,963
There's a 53rd Earth.

27
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,299
And it's called Earth-X.

28
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,516
[people cheering]

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,270
It doesn't have a designation

30
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,524
because it's a place so awful,
so horrific,

31
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,693
no sane person would ever travel there.

32
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,695
It's basically our Earth,

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,031
same history, same timeline with...

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,034
one crucial and critical difference.

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,494
[Professor Stein] Let me hypothesize.

36
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,498
The Nazis developed the atomic bomb
before the United States did

37
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,958
and they were more than happy to use it?

38
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,127
Yes. The Nazis won the war.

39
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,588
And New York, London, Paris
and Moscow were all obliterated.

40
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,008
The SS set up outposts not only
all throughout Europe,

41
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,885
but also all throughout the Americas,

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,930
and Hitler continued his brutal reign,

43
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,684
aided by prime ministers
and presidents sympathetic to him,

44
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,144
until his death

45
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,854
in 1994.

46
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,565
Now they're not happy ruling
just one Earth.

47
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,735
God, this is making me physically ill.

48
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,487
Yeah, line starts behind me.

49
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,865
We have to find them.

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,160
I mean, do you think they're using
the breach to hop between worlds?

51
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,245
That, or they're operating
from a staging area,

52
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,205
somewhere in Central City or close by.

53
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,125
Well, good thing we have a metric ton
of smart people in this building.

54
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,459
And Rory.

55
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,628
Let's get to work on finding
our new friends from Earth-X.

56
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,798
-[Oliver] Earth-X.
-That's right.

57
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,012
And I'm dead on this Earth?

58
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,264
That's right.

59
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,182
I'd almost prefer that.

60
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,437
I was born into the Reich.

61
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,106
The whole world is the Fatherland.

62
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,443
We don't have elementary schools
and summer camps.

63
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,154
We have youth groups

64
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,239
and military training.

65
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,868
We all grow up without choice.

66
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,703
You have a choice now.

67
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,749
You can tell me where to find
the others from Earth-X.

68
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,086
On my Earth, you are my best friend.

69
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,466
I would die for you.

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,928
I would have died for you.

71
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,181
-"Would have"?
-You beat me to it.

72
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,100
I lost you. It was like...

73
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,187
It was like losing a limb and...

74
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,775
You weren't just my best friend.

75
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,736
Tommy, you were my brother

76
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,448
and you sacrificed yourself
for a woman that we both loved

77
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,992
and I was there and I had you right here.

78
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:11,084
You were a good man here.

79
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,463
And I believe that you still can be.

80
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,174
No, you don't understand. If I talk...

81
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,345
If I break,
the Führer will kill my father.

82
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,847
He'll kill my mother.
Everyone that I love...

83
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,099
I will not let that happen.

84
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,269
I will stop him.

85
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,981
Do you think you can do that?

86
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,483
I promise you that I can do that.

87
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,027
[sighs]

88
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,621
Then you really are
a special kind of idiot.

89
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,167
Your naivete would be charming

90
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,797
if your weakness wasn't so pathetic.

91
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,883
Is this how it is on your planet?

92
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,137
Everybody's swayed by sentiment?

93

Is everyone here really so weak?

94
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,103
The Reich will change that.

95
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,105
The weak will be eliminated.

96
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,734
Your entire world will be enslaved.
But you, you...

You won't be around to witness it.

00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,630
{\an8}Vibrations.

162
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,134
{\an8}I told Curtis to do the same thing
with quantum field analysis.

163
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,306
{\an8}-I'm sorry about Tommy.
-That wasn't Tommy.

164
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,560
{\an8}He said that they are trying
to mount some sort of invasion.

165
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,270
{\an8}I guess the silver lining to Black Siren

166
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,647
{\an8}is that we have experience
with doppelgangers.

167
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,112
{\an8}So, if it's not Tommy I'm reading
on your face, what's up?

168
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,614
{\an8}You know what it is.

169
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,118
{\an8}Well, maybe we should wait
until we repel invaders

170
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,621
{\an8}from another Earth
to have this conversation.

171
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,915
{\an8}Remember when we got back from Ivy Town?
Do you remember Ivy Town?

172
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,250
{\an8}Mmm. So fondly.

173
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,670
{\an8}When we got back,
you said that we could do this

174
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,923
{\an8}and we could still have our lives.

175
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,342
{\an8}[Felicity] Hmm.

176
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,052
{\an8}-That was you.
-Yeah.

177
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,554
{\an8}So, um...

178
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,932
{\an8}This impending invasion notwithstanding,

179
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,604
{\an8}may we take two minutes
and talk about this?

180
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,482
Yeah.

181
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,991
So maybe what wasn't fair was me
saying I didn't want to marry you.

182
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,326
I mean, not the way I did.

183
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,286
Not with the most terrible timing
in the world.

184
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,704
Well, was it how I said it?

185
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,749
Because I know that it was really...
I mean, it was spontaneous.

186
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,250
It was so lovely.

187
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,461
It was so sweet.

188
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,755
I love you.

189
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,343
I just don't
want to be married. I don't...

190
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,970
Want to be married to anyone.

191
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,556
You didn't feel that way when we got
engaged two years ago.

192
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,643
Right, and then 10 minutes later,
I got shot and paralyzed.

193
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,562
Barry and Iris have a wedding
and Nazis crash it.

194
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,647
You didn't know that was going to happen

195
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,065
when you said you didn't want to marry me.

196
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,025
-My point is...
-[sighs]

197
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,778
We have something so good.

198
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,823
We have something so great going.

199
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,327
Let's not change that.
Let's just stand pat

200
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,578
with the cards that we're holding.

201
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,205
I want to move forward.

202
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,707
Felicity, I love you

203
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,169
and I want to marry you.

204
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,630
I love you.

205
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,342
I love you. I will always,

206
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,429
always, always love you.

207
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,975
Please respect me on this.

208
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,608
Okay.

209
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,777
Thank you.

210
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,744
Felicity's got her friend working

211
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,330
on Palmer Technologies'
spectrometry satellites.

212
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,582
Okay, but what about the <i>Waverider?</i>

213
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,500
I mean, a time traveling space ship
must have some sort of

214
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,043
tracking technology that we can use.

215
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,464
Yeah, not exactly. It's in the Stone Age.

216
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,467
Like, literally in the Stone Age.

217
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,846
Okay, well, Parallel Earth jumping
is kind of Cisco's specialty.

218
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,765
Well, since he's so busy being
unconscious right now, I guess,

219
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,058
we're on our own.

220
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,852
Oh, perfect timing, man.

221
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,937
We're trying to find the guys from Earth-X

222
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,564
and we're coming up with nothing.

223
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,484
I'm sorry. Would you excuse us
for a moment?

224
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,403
Happily.

225
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,030
We don't wanna step on whatever...

226
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,074
-Come on, Harry. It's not about you.
-...awkward thing that is.

227
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,328
Grey, we got Nazis
from a parallel Earth running around.

228
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,205
-We don't have time...
-Which is precisely why

229
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,416
we cannot afford to be at odds
with each other right now.

230
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,753
I hardly need a psychic connection
to know that you're upset with me.

231
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,130
-But I could stand to know why.
-Just forget about it, man.

232
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,467
It would make some sense if my
decision to be with my family

233
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,677
forced you to leave the <i>Waverider.</i>

234
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,306
But I accounted for that variable
and yet you're still upset.

235
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,600
-You just don't get it.
-No, I don't get it.

236
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,687
My retirement requires you
to give up nothing.

237
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,607
It requires me to give up you, Grey.

238
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,277
Look, I thought I made my peace with it.

239
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,822
I thought, okay, fine,
I'll stay on the <i>Waverider.</i>

240
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,909
Maybe I can't be Firestorm,
but I can still be a Legend.

241
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,078
But then it hit me.

242
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,832
I still can't be Firestorm,
and I can't be a Legend with you.

243
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,379
I never knew my father.

244
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,172
But I got to know you.

245
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,425
You're the closest thing
I've got to a dad, and...

246
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,594
Now you're leaving.

247
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,691
Hey.

248
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,026
-Hey.
-How are you?

249
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,820
Um, well, punching Nazis.

250
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,865
That was definitely as satisfying
as I imagined it would be.

251
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,576
You okay?

252
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,787
Yeah. Oh, me? [stutters] No, I'm okay.

253
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,289
I'm completely okay.

254
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,708
-I'm okay, okay. Okay.
-Okay.

255
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,834
Okay.

256
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,755
This isn't going to be a thing, right?

257
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,383
Yeah, no, no, no. I'm okay, I'm, uh, good.

258
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,137
Hey, I was looking for you.

259
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,055
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

260
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,599
Why is everybody asking me that question?

261
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:56,061
Uh, well, you sort of look like
you just killed someone's puppy.

262
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,982
Uh, no. I'm fine.

263
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,235
It's just this whole thing with Sara.

264
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,862
God, it was a mistake.

265
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,363
A mistake? But...

266
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,491
You came here to have fun
at a wedding and...

267
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,495
Okay, Nazi invaders aside,
you had a good time, right?

268
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,583
No. I mean, this was all kinds of wrong.

269
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,211
Waking up with a strange woman
in a strange bed?

270
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,548
I have never had a one night stand before.

271
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,051
And this whole thing is just...

272
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,928
It's got me spinning.

273
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,554
Kara, I mean, what...

274
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,681
What if I made a huge mistake?

275
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,600
-No...
-Okay, no, no, no. I mean, look,

276
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,061
I know, I wanna have kids.

277
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,023
But Maggie was real.

278
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,484
I mean, what we had, that was real.

279
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,529
And now, with everything, I just...

280
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,076
I chose to let her go. I chose that.

281
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,161
I mean, what was I thinking?

282
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,330
Alex, Maggie was amazing.

283
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,500
And you two were amazing together,
but the best part about her

284
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,878
was that she showed you
how to be true to yourself.

285
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,173
You want kids. She doesn't.

286
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,803
You just had to do what was right for you.

287
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,305
What if I was wrong?

288
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,650
How long till you brainiacs
find these Nazis?

289
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,612
Oh, my answer hasn't changed in the two
minutes since you last asked me.

290
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,322
Sorry.

291
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,575
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

292
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,162
Dealing with some Oliver stuff.

293
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:43,293
Not "Nazis ruined the happiest day
of our life" stuff, but... stuff.

294
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,631
Stuff like,
"You don't want to marry him," stuff?

295
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,844
You might've said it a little loudly
at the rehearsal dinner.

296
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,886
Huh...

297
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,222
What happened? I thought at the salon,
you said you guys were good.

298
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,391
We are good. We're great. We're just as...

299
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,436
We're just as good as we were
the last time we got engaged,

300
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,729
and I got shot.

301
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,109
That was the beginning of the end for us.

302
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,032
I don't want to tempt fate again.
You know?

303
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,288
Break-in at Dayton Optical Systems.

304
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,789
Ugh, I know this sounds terrible,

305
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,332
but maybe we should
let the police handle it.

306
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,960
I mean, we need our peeps
to focus on the Nazis.

307
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,879
-This is Nazis.
-How do you know?

308
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,799
I'll go get Barry.

309
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,384
Yeah, okay.

310
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,816
-[whistling]
-[motorbike approaching]

311
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,490
[tires screeching]

312
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,327
Just a quick reminder.

313
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,745
Super-speed.

314
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,455
I don't have it.

315
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,499
Noted.

316
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,710
So, what do we know about this place?

317
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,796
Why are the Earth-Xers targeting it?

318
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,380
[Dark Arrow] Because...

319
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,469
They had something we need.

320
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,140
Whatever you stole...

321
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,433
We're gonna want it back.

322
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,977
[Dark Arrow]
Your confidence is predictable.

323
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,064
You've faced some of the greatest
evils known to man.

324
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,690
And you've defeated them.

325
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,609
But if you think so highly of yourselves,

326
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,319
that you can defeat any threat

327
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,363
-that comes your way...
-[device beeps]

328
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,541
How do you feel about us?

329
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,258
This is sick.

330
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,678
To be looking at your reflection
and seeing only weakness?

331
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,721
I agree.

332
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,976
-Thawne.
-Direct from Earth-1.

333
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,103
Do you like my face?

334
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,022
It's the face you were wearing
when I became the Flash.

335
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,315
I thought I'd put it on again.

336
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,653
You know, for old times' sake.
Plus, handsome.

337
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,989
-I watched you die.
-Or did you?

338
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,116
It's time travel, Barry.

339
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,871
So very confusing. I always seem
to be saying that to you, don't I?

340
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,998
Tommy killed himself.

341
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,958
I heard your Tommy died years ago.

342
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,835
That's what this Earth does.

343
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,337
Makes people soft.

344
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,882
We've been watching you.

345
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,842
We've been watching all of you.

346
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,387
And how you've squandered
the potential of two worlds.

347
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,558
On our Earth,
we've developed a meritocracy.

348
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,935
We've accomplished greatness.

349
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,478
You're perverse.

350
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,939
No, Kara, you're the perversion.

351
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,443
The most powerful being on the planet

352
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,404
rendered weak by saccharine Americana.

353
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,867
My pod was blessed to crash
in the Fatherland.

354
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,035
Then go back there.

355
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,162
This is not your Earth.

356
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,872
Leave.

357
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,582
I don't answer to the likes of you.

358
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,378
My allegiance is to the Fatherland
and to my wife.

359
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,673
His wife? Gross.

360
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,800
No offense.

361
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,136
Last chance.

362
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,013
Go home.

363
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,306
And stay there.

364
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,515
All of you.

365
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,106
And what do you think that's going to do?

366
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,150
Bullets bounce off of me.

367
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,361
No, this arrow won't.

368
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,710
Is that a Kryptonite arrow?

369
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,879
Why do you have a Kryptonite arrow?

370
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,298
In case an evil you ever showed up.

371
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
[grunts]

372
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,305
[glass crashing]

373
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,558
[grunts]

374
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,395
Get the Prism out of here.

375
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,106
-Are you all right?
-I'm pissed.

376
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,024
[grunts]

377
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,609
Take it out on that.

378
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,410
[men yelling]

379
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,578
[distant rumbling]

380
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,499
[grunts]

381
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,003
It's gonna fall.

382
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,462
All right, get me over there.

383
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,602
Get the workers to safety!

384
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,116
[creaking]

385
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,660
We need to stabilize the building.

386
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,939
-Site's clear.
-And stabilized.

387
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,484
-Nice work.
-Let's not celebrate just yet.

388
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,986
We gave those doppelgangers
the window they needed to escape.

389
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,196
[Supergirl] Escape with what?

390
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,822
Dayton Optical Systems
calls it "the Prism."

391
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,742
What on Earth do they need
a sub-light generator for?

392
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,202
It's basically a spectral emitter...

393
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,037
[both] Which uses quantum entanglement.

394
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,748
They could also use it to create
a stable fusion reaction.

395
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,084
Okay, which all means what?

396
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,923
No, guys, really, I'd like to know
what you're talking about.

397
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,257
You got this.

398
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,012
Well, basically the device they stole
can be converted into a neutron bomb.

399
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,097
Boom...

400
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,390
I take it back. [sighs]

401
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,435
The bottom line is that we have to catch
these parallel Earth goose-steppers.

402
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,937
This might help.

403
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,397
Is that a Kryptonite arrow?

404
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,690
-Yup.
-I know I shouldn't have to ask

405
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,942
this question,
but I have to ask this question.

406
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,152
-Oliver didn't shoot Kara, did he?
-Sort of.

407
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:29,241
The other archer and flying woman
are Oliver and Kara of Earth-X.

408
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,661
When you said that Earth-X was "horrible,"
you might've under-sold it.

409
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,080
Wait a minute.
How could there be another Kara?

410
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,623
[Harrison] There are 53 Karas.

411
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,626
Just like there's 53 Kryptons
and 53 Earths.

412
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,170
And the Thawne from our Earth
is working with them.

413
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,797
He's an idiot.

414
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,299
If that arrow has
Not-So-Supergirl's blood on it...

415
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,052
We could track it using quantum analysis.

416
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,178
-We could.
-[Alex] Hey, guys.

417
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,013
I think I might have a quicker way.

418
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,228
These red blood cells are suffused
with short-wave radiation.

419
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,313
-Solar radiation?
-Yeah. Incredibly high amounts.

420
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,690
Like nothing I've ever seen.

421
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,983
Can you track it?

422
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,111
Well, I once caught a deranged serial
killer off his face cream, so...

423
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,239
-No joke.
-Let's just do it. Fast.

424
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,490
Okay.

425
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,663
Will it work?

426
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,999
It will.

427
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,042
With a few adjustments.

428
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,795
And a significant power source.

429
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,214
My husband's on his way
to handle that as we speak.

430
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,801
Your husband has a choice to make.

431
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,386
Me or the Reich?

432
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,929
That's right.

433
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,599
Because we have two goals.

434
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,642
And my worry is,

435
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,771
if we can't accomplish them both,
he's gonna choose you

436
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,816
over a second Earth flying
under our banner.

437
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,194
Oliver will not abandon our mission.

438
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,530
I've seen this before in 1945.

439
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,825
Hitler and his men
were equally short-sighted.

440
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,579
Hitler was driven by passion
and childish need.

441
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,081
Oliver is 10 times
the man Hitler ever was.

442
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,834
Not when he's blinded by his love for you.

443
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,258
If it comes to Oliver choosing
between me and the Reich,

444
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,428
I'll make sure he chooses the Fatherland.

445
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,639
-How?
-If it comes to it,

446
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,392
by taking the choice out of his hands.

447
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,898
Maybe tracking her off of face cream
would have been easier.

448
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,566
[Harrison] Supergirl-X's blood

449
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,736
is filled with solar radiation,
more than it should be.

450
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,698
But if I can try to get that to act
as a kind of beacon...

451
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,367
Hey, um... [clears throat]

452
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,996
-How do you do it?
-Do what, Rory?

453
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,666
Bring the other you out of you.

454
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,752
-You don't wanna know.
-Sure I do.

455
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,257
It happens when I'm scared or angry.

456
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,217
Oh...

457
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,970
So, if I were to, um... Boo!

458
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,598
Nice try.

459
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,517
-[Harrison bangs table]
-[Harrison] Boom.

460
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,227
Whatever's going on with Kara-X's blood,

461
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,854
-it's intensifying.
-Worse for her is better for us.

462
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,439
Better for us for tracking her, at least.

463
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,983
We should have her location any minute.

464
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,325
I can't believe he's back.

465
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,912
I don't know if I'll ever be rid of him.

466
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,414
I know.

467
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,083
I know how much you're hurting.

468
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,335
I just keep looking for closure,

469
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,296
but every time I see him, all I see is...

470
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,672
Your mother dying.

471
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,178
You're going to stop him.

472
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,724
-How do you know?
-Because you always do.

473
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,559
[door opens]

474
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,769
And because we're not going
to let you do it alone.

475
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,897
Getting close on a location.

476
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,277
Look, guys. I'm sorry. This is not
how this week was supposed to go.

477
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,820
We can't think about that right now.

478
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:58,325
You should. We fight to protect
the people that we love,

479
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,535
so you guys recognize what you have.

480
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,414
Recognize it and cherish it
and let it make you stronger.

481
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,333
'Cause if you do that,

482
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,419
you'll always find
your way back to one another.

483
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,673
It's the same for you and Felicity, man.

484
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,467
I don't know, Barry. I...

485
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,137
She told me
she doesn't believe in marriage.

486
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,766
I'm not feeling
sorry for myself, I just...

487
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,643
I think that if she loved me
the way I loved her,

488
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,853
she would wanna marry me.

489
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,897
Oliver, I've known Felicity
for five years.

490
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,441
And I'm here to tell you,
as sure as I'm standing here,

491
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,318
-she loves you.
-Felicity...

492
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,653
-I appreciate that, guys.
-Just turn.

493
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,572
-She's right there.
-[Felicity clears throat]

494
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,949
We got 'em.

495
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,868
They're at a shipping depot
outside Danville.

496
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,162
All right.
We'll get the band back together.

497
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,413
Yeah.

498
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,125
-Oliver...
-It's okay.

499
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,503
We can talk when I'm back.

500
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,005
Right now
I need to have my head in the game.

501
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,508
Get your head in the game.

502
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,026
Supergirl and Firestorm
are sweeping the perimeter.

503
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,487
It's done.
It's wall-to-wall Nazis in there.

504
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,158
Alex and I will take up breach
positions on the northwest corner.

505
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,701
If that's okay with you?

506
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,579
S.T.A.R. Labs thinks they converted
the sub-light generator,

507
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,873
the Prism that they've stolen,
into some kind of super-weapon.

508
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,751
Speaking of "super,"
theirs is our biggest threat.

509
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,544
Agreed. Let's take her out first.

510
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,926
Hey.

511
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,637
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

512
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,222
Yeah.

513
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,349
No.

514
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,060
-You know?
-Yeah.

515
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,398
It's gonna be okay.

516
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:44,741
Mustard. You people have breaches
but no mustard.

517
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,493
Um, what are you even doing here?

518
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,036
Yeah, why didn't you go with them?

519
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,371
Go where?

520
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,460
[men talking indistinctly]

521
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,171

[men grunting]

523
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,887
Couldn't have left one for me?

524
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,847
I'm saving Nazi you for you.

525
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
There's no sign of the Prism.

526
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,184
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.

527
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,977
We got incoming.

528
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,022
Stay where you are!

Where's their Arrow?

[grunting]

539
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,704
It was in the fridge.

540
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,790
-Did you check the fridge?
-Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

541
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,709
Any word from the team?

542
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,420
No, they're at the shipping depot,
but it's just radio silence.

543
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,763
Oh, God.

544
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,640
There is no God.

What about Caitlin?

551
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,031
It's gonna get a lot colder in here.

No.

I'm afraid of nothing.

Bet you're pretty angry
and scared right now!

I told you. I don't fear anything.

[Killer Frost] Actually...

He was talking about me.

Didn't think this through, did you?

570
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,230
Just you. Against us.

571
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,737
I don't need to think to kill you.

This is fun for me.

Not so much for you.

All the times you've killed me,
and now here,

00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,482
all I have to do is kill you once.

597
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,400
[Overgirl] Enough, Eobard.

598
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,152
Enough.

599

Hey, you might wanna listen to her.

600
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,240
We know that if you wanted to kill us

601
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,533
you wouldn't have put
these dog collars on us first.

it feels like to hate myself.

It's all right. It's all right.

You're gonna be all right
because we found her.

Now, very soon,
this nightmare will be over,

00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,007
Are they alive?

620
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,551
Yes. Yes, for now.

621
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,971
We need your Kara's cooperation.

622
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,765
Well, we don't need it.
It would be preferable.

623
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,144
But for the time being,
you're more valuable as leverage.

624
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,480
-What do you want my sister for?
-To save my life.

625
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,735
That's your little
mission statement, isn't it?

626
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,155
Help people, save lives.

627
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,991
Well, now's your chance.

628
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,619
The General is dying.

629
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,790
Her blood. She's been exposed
to too much solar radiation.

630
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:59,003
Yes. Like Icarus,
I flew too close to the sun.

631
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,505
But we can save her.

632
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,591
We're going to save her.

633
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,926
All we need is a new heart. And luckily,

634
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,805
on this planet we found the perfect donor.

635
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,352
You stay the hell away from my sister.

636
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,728
Hmm.

637
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,356
Such loyalty. [chuckles]

638
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,483
My sister tried to kill me.

639
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,401
That's why you stole the Prism?

640
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,278
So you can duplicate a red sun,

641
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,696
weaken Kara and cut into her?

642
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,282
You can't make an omelette
with invulnerable eggs.

643
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,784
[Arrow] Hey...

644
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,661
I'm going to kill you.

645
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,790
No, you won't.

646
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,250
You're weak.

647
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,796
And all of you choose the high road.

648
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,340
You're heroes.

649
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,593
[thudding]

650
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,984
[Iris] I thought we were gonna die.

651
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,779
If I had a dime for every time
I thought that...

652
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,114
I'd have two dollars and forty cents.

653
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,824
I really thought I'd have more than that.

654
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,118
It was Oliver. But it wasn't Oliver.

655
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,745
-Is Oliver in the High Castle?
-I just mean...

656
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,956
There's so much out there
for us to be afraid of.

657
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,041
Multiple Earths. Aliens.

658
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,585
Doppelgangers from the Third Reich.
I mean, what else is coming?

659
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,879
And that thought wakes me up at night.

660
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,381
How do you ever get back to sleep?

661
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,924
[creaking]

662
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,300
-Barry's by my side.
-Shut up.

663
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,386
-I'm sorry, I know you and Oliver...
-No.

664
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,888
Shut up.

665
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,560
[gasps]

666
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,853
We're not alone.

667
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,082
Stalag S.T.A.R. Labs.

668
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,793
What are we gonna do?

669
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,756
[man talking indistinctly over PA]

670
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,471
[Alex] Kara... Where's Kara?

671
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,431
They're going to kill her.

672
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,891
It's okay. We're gonna get her back.

673
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,893
We need to figure out where we are first.

674
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,978
Yeah. About that...

675
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,732
This is somewhat disconcerting.

676
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,528
I don't think this is our Earth.

677
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,868
We're on Earth-X.
