<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother</i>

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,009
<i>- Killed by something impossible.</i>
- Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,978
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,949
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,651
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,754
<i>but secretly, I use my speed</i>

9
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,256
<i>To fight crime
and find others like me.</i>

10
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,825
<i>And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...</i>

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,194
<i>- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.</i>

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,464
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

13
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,299
Previously on<i> the Flash...</i>

14
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,602
You killed my mother. Why?

15
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:40,873
If you want to know that,
you're gonna have to catch me.

16
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,142
Not fast enough, flash.

17
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,510
I love you, Iris.

18
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,478
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,313
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,453
My name is Barry Allen.

21
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,256
I am not the fastest man alive.

22
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,125
That title belongs to the man
who killed my mother.

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,267
But not for long.

24
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,702
That was too close.

25
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,337
He told me to make it hard.

26
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,006
Pretty sure he didn't tell you
to make him dead.

27
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,707
Remember,
this is just supposed to be

28
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,877
A training exercise
to improve Barry's speed.

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,348
Cisco, you gonna bring it
or what?

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,184
Bring it.

31
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:48,073
Why isn't he running away?

32
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,741
Barry, run away.

33
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,672
Very impressive, Mr. Allen.

34
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,074
Your reaction to stimuli

35
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,476
At super-speed
continues to improve.

36
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,146
- It's still not enough.
- It will be.

37
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,114
You keep working like you are,
you stay focused like you are,

38
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,349
and you will be ready
the next time

39
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,417
your man
in the yellow suit comes around.

40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,888
I think
you mean the Reverse-Flash.

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,824
What? He said it, not me.

42
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,592
And he's right.

43
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,428
Yellow suit, red lightning,
and evil...

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,330
The reverse of Barry.

45
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,266
- Meh.
- Actually, I kind of like it.

46
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,934
All right, I'm still ready
for another round.

47
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,302
How many more drones
do you have left?

48
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,770
Two.

49
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,440
And they've got lasers.

50
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,109
No.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,704
Told you it would break.

52
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,540
And the shrink says I'm crazy.

53
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,975
What is this place?

54
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,144
Customs warehouse.

55
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:36,582
Imported cars from Europe,
all worth a fortune.

56
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,983
Question.

57
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,218
How do you suggest you and I

58
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,119
Drive all these cars
out of here?

59
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,322
We're not.

60
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,357
We're not stealing anything.

61
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,793
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:51,964
Our entrance set off
the silent alarms.

63
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:57,970
The cops will be arriving
in 2 minutes and 14 seconds.

64
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,671
Bring them.

65
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,813
That's not for the cops,
as we discussed.

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,619
He'll be here.

67
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,930
You do hear that, right?

68
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:29,301
He's not coming.

69
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,702
We're leaving.

70
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,738
This better make sense
real fast, buddy.

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,706
It will. Let's go.

72
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,747
You promised me I'd get
to do my thing.

73
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,882
I always keep my promises.

74
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,150
Seat belt.

75
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,297
Are you sure
nothing's missing?

76
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,099
That's what the supervisor
said.

77
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,801
I can check again.

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,874
Bar.

79
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,442
Hey.

80
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,646
Well, the breakage
indicates that the door somehow

81
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,549
Had zero viscoelasticity
when it hit the ground.

82
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,184
What does that mean
to normal people?

83
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,019
Sorry. Uh...

84
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,622
The steel shattered like glass.

85
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,768
It was frozen, Joe.

86
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,270
Snart.

87
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,805
He's back.

88
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,341
I thought Snart
was some world-class thief.

89
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:46,311
All these expensive cars...
He didn't take any of them?

90
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,546
It doesn't make sense.

91
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,815
Eddie, put out an APB
on Snart.

92
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:53,118
Got it.

93
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,755
Snart wasn't here
to steal anything.

94
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,457
- He was setting a trap.
- For me.

95
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,926
- And by me, I mean...
- Yeah, I know who you meant.

96
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,236
God, you're beautiful.

97
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,872
Mick.

98
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,674
This is a joke.

99
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,410
How do you know this flash
didn't skip town, hmm?

100
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,278
Maybe that's
why he didn't show up.

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,680
Or maybe he's dead.

102
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,782
Or maybe someone
smarter than you iced him.

103
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,017
He's not dead,
and he didn't leave town.

104
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,353
You will tell me
what we're stealing this time.

105
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,021
We are partners, after all.

106
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:33,658
This is what we came for.

107
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,197
That's worth money?

108
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,934
It's called fire & ice, an
abstract modern-day masterpiece

109
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,237
Said to represent
the dichotomy of being.

110
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,772
It represents to me

111
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,442
That people with lots
of money buy dumb stuff.

112
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,877
Osgood and Rachel Rathaway,

113
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,712
One of the richest couples
in Central City,

114
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:57,783
Paid 25 million for it in Paris.

115
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,918
They're flying home with it
today.

116
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,788
Mm.

117
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,122
Captain Cold is back?

118
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,557
For a non-metahuman,

119
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,793
Leonard Snart is proving
to be quite the nemesis.

120
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,161
He still has the cold gun,

121
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:11,830
The one he stole from us,
the one I built.

122
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,332
Well,
what does he want this time?

123
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,001
The flash.

124
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,936
If Snart wants a fight
with the Flash,

125
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,070
Then I'll give him one.

126
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,605
Well...

127
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,240
You don't think I should?

128
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,342
I didn't say that.
But, Barry,

129
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,779
As fast as you are, you
cannot be everywhere at once.

130
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,748
And it becomes then a question
of priorities.

131
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,983
Now, in the last month,

132
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,519
You have made a commitment
to increasing your speed,

133
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,721
Enhancing your reflexes,
and it's working.

134
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,957
You're finally getting faster.

135
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,928
Okay, but what am I supposed
to do, just ignore Snart?

136
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,066
The last time you had a fight
with Snart, a train derailed.

137
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,836
You were lucky to get
all those people to safety.

138
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,571
And if you don't give
him that fight...

139
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,775
He may just back off,
and there'll be no casualties.

140
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,511
Look, Barry, Cisco
and I will work with Joe

141
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:03,548
And the police
and devise a way to catch Cold.

142
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,083
Yes, I said it, Cisco.

143
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,651
As soon as it came
out of my mouth, I heard it.

144
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,086
Yeah, we can definitely
come up with ways

145
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,221
To neutralize Snart.

146
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,889
Listen, Barry.

147
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,960
Whether or not you go
after Snart, that's your choice.

148
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:18,029
We here, we will do
whatever we can to support you.

149
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,367
But after this past Christmas,

150
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,170
After the events
with the Reverse-Flash...

151
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,742
I just think he poses
a greater threat to all of us.

152
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,313
Okay.

153
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,152
T-minus three days
and counting...

154
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,554
Till the big move in.

155
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,389
You know,
I've never had a roommate.

156
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,892
But it did occur to me
that if we ever get in a fight,

157
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,027
I can't just storm away
and go home,

158
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,496
Because home will be with you.

159
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,565
Are you predicting
many arguments?

160
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,734
Have you met me?

161
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,869
I remember the night we met.

162
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,705
I stopped a mugger
who stole your bag.

163
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,607
My hero.

164
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,947
Hey.

165
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,382
Hey.

166
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,117
Eddie, you know where Joe is?

167
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,719
Uh... I think he's upstairs
in your lab.

168
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,588
Okay, thanks.

169
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:27,732
No second thoughts
about moving in together?

170
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,900
None.

171
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,605
Joe, hey.

172
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,540
Hey. I'm glad you're back.

173
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,375
I've been going
over Snart's file.

174
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:41,046
Thanks. Yeah, I need to talk to you.

175
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,482
As CSI, my work
on this case is done.

176
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,052
And as the Flash,

177
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,255
I don't think
I can focus on Snart right now.

178
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,092
You mind telling me
what brought about this change

179
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,894
Of heart?

180
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:59,030
This man in yellow,
the man that killed my mom,

181
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,932
Is still out there.

182
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,233
I have to be ready
to face him,

183
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,903
Which means amping up my speed.

184
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,939
- It's a question of priorities.
- Your mom's killer

185
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,975
isn't the only reason
you've been doing this.

186
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,577
You told me that if you
could use your powers

187
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,447
To save someone from a burning
building, you would.

188
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,783
Look, Dr. Wells and S.T.A.R.
Labs are gonna work with you.

189
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,452
Cisco thinks he has a way

190
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,320
to protect the police
against Snart's cold gun.

191
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,022
Barry, I can understand
if you're scared.

192
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,192
- We talked about this.
- Of course I'm scared, Joe.

193
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,793
This guy could run
into the precinct

194
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,795
And kill everyone
in here in seconds.

195
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,731
He threatened Iris.

196
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,432
I won't let him hurt
the most important people

197
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,767
In my life again.

198
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,236
If that means devoting
every second

199
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,405
I have outside this place
to getting faster

200
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,707
And to stopping him,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

201
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,809
I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

202
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,162
Aw. McSnurtle the turtle.

203
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,530
How you been?

204
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,766
When did you stop
sleeping with this?

205
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,501
- It was your favorite.
- He was.

206
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,336
But if I remember correctly,

207
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,040
You took him away from me after
I broke your<i> Duke Ellington:</i>

208
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,941
<i>Live at the blue note</i> vinyl.

209
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,343
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

210
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,381
- You can have him back now.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

211
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,952
Oh, dad.

212
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,189
I'm going to miss you, baby.

213
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,024
Dad, I'm only
ten minutes away.

214
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,127
I know.
Don't you worry about me.

215
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,096
I'll be fine, just like always.

216
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,966
- Hey.
- Hey.

217
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,668
You came to help her pack?

218
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,270
Oh, no. No, no, no.

219
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,807
Iris said that she had
something for me.

220
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,875
Oh, um...

221
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,545
I found this in my closet.

222
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,383
I haven't seen this in years.

223
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,854
Well, the nerd survival kit
is still intact.

224
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,557
Wow.

225
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,992
I thought
those might be worth something.

226
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,667
I am so late for work.

227
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:23,541
I promise I will clean this
up when I get back, okay?

228
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,077
- Bye.
- Bye, yeah.

229
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,615
Okay.

230
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:34,853
You mind telling me what's
going on with you and Iris?

231
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,788
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

232
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,557
That's funny, because I have
these two things called eyes,

233
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,727
And it doesn't look like you
two are fine.

234
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,896
I told Iris.

235
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,265
You told Iris
you're the Flash?

236
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,567
No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,069
No.

238
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:57,175
I told her
how I felt about her.

239
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,910
- Oh, god.
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,879
What did she say?

241
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:04,949
Well, I mean, she's still
moving in with Eddie, isn't she?

242
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,253
I just want to pretend
like it never even happened.

243
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,688
I mean, that's what
we're both doing, so...

244
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,425
Well, not saying how you feel
is what got you in this mess

245
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,494
In the first place.

246
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,396
Speaking of which,

247
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,833
We both know she's not gonna
clean this mess up anytime soon.

248
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,568
Nope.

249
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,906
Sure.

250
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,852
Uh, excuse me.

251
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,922
If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

252
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:47,425
You have our attention,
Mr. Ramon.

253
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,494
Okay, check it.

254
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,262
So Dr. Wells and I,

255
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,631
We took your ballistic shields
and...

256
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,137
And we lined them with a pretty
sweet compacted heating ribbon

257
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,573
Designed to repel
temperature attacks,

258
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,175
Especially
those reaching absolute zero,

259
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,211
Like Captain Cold's gun.

260
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,912
And that's supposed
to keep us from getting

261
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,747
- turned into popsicles?
- Um, yeah.

262
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,683
Yeah, they will.

263
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,852
How are we supposed to trust
anything from S.T.A.R. Labs

264
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,887
After you nuked the city?

265
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,326
You're right.

266
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,162
You're right,
you shouldn't trust us.

267
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:28,132
What happened a year ago...
that was our fault.

268
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:33,037
And we can't change the past,
as much as we wish we could.

269
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,640
But tomorrow
is a different story.

270
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,343
Tomorrow's a different thing.

271
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,846
We just want the chance
to make things better.

272
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,681
Observe.

273
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,447
Dummies are one thing.

274
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,549
My officers are another.

275
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,424
You seem pleased
with yourself, doctor.

276
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,427
Well, I'm just happy to help
the police catch Snart, Joe.

277
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,362
Barry might be able
to help too.

278
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,933
I think Cisco's heat shields
are more than up to the task.

279
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,268
And, Joe, if Barry
feels he's gonna endanger lives

280
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,037
By taking on Snart
and, conversely, feels

281
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,738
He's gonna
save lives by training

282
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,609
To take on the man in yellow...

283
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,544
That's ultimately his call.

284
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,781
You know what makes
Barry so special?

285
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:53,751
He wants to help everyone
he can, however he can.

286
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,486
Always has.

287
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,255
Until now.

288
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,391
I guess it's just a question
of priorities then.

289
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:05,363
You know, Barry
said the exact same thing to me.

290
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,266
And I thought,
"doesn't sound like him."

291
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,935
I guess because
it sounds like you.

292
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,313
Hey.

293
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,349
Sorry,
didn't mean to scare you.

294
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,517
No, it's okay.
I was just kind of focused.

295
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,286
Gotcha.

296
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,855
- What's firestorm?
- It's one of the last things

297
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,825
Ronnie said to me before he...
Flew away.

298
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,494
My dead fiance can fly.

299
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,496
I haven't broke that
to my parents yet.

300
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,099
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

301
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,434
No, I just...

302
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,938
I told Iris
how I felt about her.

303
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,539
Bold choice.

304
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,476
I knew where we stood before.
We were best friends.

305
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,811
And... I don't know.
Now I just don't know

306
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,847
What's normal for us anymore.

307
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,216
Before I met Ronnie,

308
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,853
I knew exactly what was going
to happen every day of my life.

309
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,288
It was predictable.
I like predictable.

310
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,025
But when Ronnie
and I started dating,

311
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,560
Everything started to change.

312
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:15,099
He made me try Indian food
and scuba diving.

313
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,503
At first it was scary.

314
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,839
But then it was better.

315
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,909
Things weren't really normal
with you pining after Iris

316
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,512
And her being totally unaware.

317
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,882
Whatever happens next,
it will be better.

318
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,456
Wait, Caitlin.

319
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,891
Scuba.

320
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,426
What about it?

321
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,528
Self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus,

322
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,396
It's an acronym.

323
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,365
What if firestorm
isn't a word?

324
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,773
Fusion ignition research
experiment and science

325
00:17:55,775 --> 00:18:01,846
Of transmutation originating RNA
and molecular structures.

326
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,482
It's 800 pages.

327
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,728
There's a lot
of stuff in there,

328
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,764
But it mostly
focuses on transmutation,

329
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,933
Which is the process of altering
the structure of an element

330
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,568
By unzipping the atoms...

331
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,672
And rebuilding it to create
an entirely new element.

332
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,807
Well, the article
was co-written by Jason Rush,

333
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,009
Who's a grad student
here at Hudson university.

334
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,011
So if anybody knows
what happened to Ronnie...

335
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,480
Maybe he does.

336
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,482
- Maybe.
- Thanks.

337
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,958
Pleasant flight,
Mrs. Rathaway?

338
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,326
Yes, quite.
Thank you.

339
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,597
Careful, please.
It's worth a fortune.

340
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,764
Welcome home, Mr. Rathaway.

341
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,500
Thank you, Ethan.

342
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,141
Sir, your son Hartley...
he called again.

343
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,209
We don't have a son anymore.

344
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,350
Someone better call 911.

345
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,364
Move.
Move!

346
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,832
Snart, freeze.

347
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,643
- Mick!
- Gaaaah!

348
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,044
What the hell?

349
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,747
Why do they call you people
the heat?

350
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,082
<i>I'm the heat!</i>

351
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,022
Forget them, Mick.
Get ready for him.

352
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,758
It's beautiful.

353
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,660
Mick.

354
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,495
Mick.

355
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,496
<i>Mick!</i>

356
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,669
We go, now!

357
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,884
Is he all right?

358
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,921
Okay.

359
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,090
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

360
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,491
I'll call you back.

361
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,694
I'm fine.

362
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,329
Snart's new partner,

363
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,732
He's got this
handheld flamethrower.

364
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,368
Almost everyone was treated
on the scene, but...

365
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,303
We got two in the burn unit,
though.

366
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,305
I'm sorry.
I should've listened to you.

367
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,873
It's all good.
But...

368
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,410
The next time Snart
and his pyro pal show up,

369
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,648
You make them sorry
they ever messed with you.

370
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,383
I got to call the hospital.

371
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:01,092
The cop's bullet ruptured the
secondary internal fuel chamber.

372
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,760
It could've been worse.

373
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,962
You were right to get me
to learn every part and circuit

374
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,598
Of this thing.
Repairing it was...

375
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,866
A snap.

376
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,301
Give me one reason

377
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,136
I don't kill you right now.

378
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,738
It's gonna be hard to find

379
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,373
Someone else to listen
to your winning speeches.

380
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,708
You lost it out there,
just like the last job.

381
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,877
You lost focus, became obsessed.

382
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,213
I'm obsessed?
What about you?

383
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,315
You're usually counting
the seconds, got the whole thing

384
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:28,052
Planned out,
dotting "t"s, crossing "i"s.

385
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,421
But all you care about now
is the Flash.

386
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,256
- We have to put him down.
- Why?

387
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,891
We got the finger painting.

388
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,293
It's worth millions.
It's ours.

389
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,594
We're rich. Job done.

390
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,095
And what about the next job,
Mick?

391
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,764
And the job after that?

392
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,365
With weapons like these,

393
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,302
No one can stand against us,
no one except the Flash.

394
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,578
If you want out,
take the painting and go.

395
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,616
But if you want Central City
to be our home where we can do

396
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:02,219
And take whatever we want...

397
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,955
This is our chance...

398
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,857
Your chance.

399
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,694
Mm.

400
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,501
Very motivational.

401
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,437
How do we get him?

402
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:23,007
The flash
isn't so different from us.

403
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,109
He's got partners too.

404
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,452
Jason Rush?

405
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,354
Yes. Dr. Snow?

406
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,457
Please, call me Caitlin.
Thank you for meeting me.

407
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,791
Oh, happy to.

408
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,526
Although,
to be totally up front,

409
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,995
If this is about the resume
I mailed in to S.T.A.R. Labs,

410
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,998
I've already accepted a position
at mercury labs.

411
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,802
No, actually, I wanted to talk
to you about F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M.

412
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,875
I'm sorry. This was a mistake.
I have to go.

413
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,944
No, look, someone
I care about is in trouble,

414
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:05,015
And you're the only clue
I have to help him.

415
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,117
Please.

416
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,889
What's the line?

417
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,559
I never got paranoid till they
started plotting against me?

418
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,895
Why would they be
plotting against you?

419
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,431
Because of our work,
because of F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M.

420
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,066
Transmutation,

421
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,868
The ability to alter matter
on a molecular level.

422
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,603
We had some rudimentary
success

423
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,739
With our stage one testing,
working with sand grains.

424
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,541
But Professor Stein
said that we should...

425
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,743
Sorry, Professor Martin Stein?

426
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,712
He was the co-author
of the paper?

427
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,114
Yeah, he was our team leader.

428
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,518
He didn't believe in baby steps,
so we skipped to stage three.

429
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,020
Which was?

430
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,756
We melted a concrete wall.

431
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,725
But the university
threatened to shut us down.

432
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,293
So Professor Stein

433
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,495
Published his paper
without them giving permission,

434
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,197
And they went nuts.

435
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,732
So he went to talk
to a friend of his

436
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,867
- to secure private backing.
- And who was that?

437
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,670
He didn't say.
He just said he'd call me later.

438
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:03,908
And no one has seen or heard
from Professor Stein since.

439
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,243
What do you think
happened to him?

440
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,913
All I know is that the army
showed up the next day

441
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,749
And confiscated
all of our research.

442
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:16,120
So tell me, Dr. Snow, do you
think I'm being too paranoid,

443
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,789
Or not paranoid enough?

444
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,116
Car trouble?

445
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,521
Aah! Aah!

446
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,973
I hope we're not enemies.

447
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:12,576
What? No, of course not.

448
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,213
I thought you might blame me

449
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,182
For pushing you
to pursue your training

450
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,518
Rather than help the police.

451
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,987
Look, I'm an adult.

452
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,890
I make my own choices,
my own mistakes.

453
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,028
And I'm glad
you push me to be better.

454
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,964
It's so weird.

455
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,633
There was a time in my life

456
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:39,637
That I would've paid money
for your autograph.

457
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,305
And now we're...

458
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,340
Partners.

459
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:50,481
I was gonna say friends.

460
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:56,487
In case you doubt it,
you push me to be better too.

461
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,757
Guys, you have to come
look at this.

462
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,592
When the heat gun was fired,

463
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:03,961
It increased the surrounding
temperature of the air

464
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:07,765
Dramatically, sort of like
an extreme heat wave.

465
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,466
- Heat wave.
- Stop doing that.

466
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,602
Okay. I measured
the temperature output

467
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,904
Of both the cold
and heat guns, right?

468
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,607
And while the cold gun
achieves absolute zero,

469
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,610
The heat gun successfully
reaches absolute hot,

470
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,478
Or the hottest temperature
an object can reach.

471
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,715
- Planck temperature.
- So potentially,

472
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,917
These two guns
could cancel each other out.

473
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,554
Yeah, but to do that, you'd
have to make them cross streams.

474
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,323
You mean like<i> Ghostbusters</i> ?

475
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,592
That film is surprisingly
scientifically accurate.

476
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,528
And really quite funny.

477
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,363
Hey, Joe. What's up?

478
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,212
Joe, anything?

479
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,615
There's no sign of Caitlin.

480
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,750
Oh, my god.

481
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,322
We're getting her back.
We have to find Snart.

482
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,624
Damn right we do.

483
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,460
Come on, let's go.

484
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,798
Joe, Joe.

485
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,368
We got a hit,
a second pair of prints.

486
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,136
They belong to a Mick Rory.

487
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,971
- Who is he?
- Big-time arsonist.

488
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,607
He and Snart worked a job
last year that went bad.

489
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,342
Half of Rory's body
was burned in a fire

490
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,177
That got out of control.

491
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,146
He escaped from an ambulance
on the way to the hospital,

492
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,315
Hasn't been seen since.

493
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,484
Why would they kidnap
someone like Caitlin?

494
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,819
Joe, Thawne,
it's on every station.

495
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,190
Greetings, citizens
of Central City.

496
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,693
I am Leonard Snart.

497
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,095
But you can call me Cold.

498
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:48,165
I'm gonna make this very simple
for everyone.

499
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,201
That red streak you've been
hearing whispers about,

500
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:55,706
The one mysteriously saving
people these past few months?

501
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,976
Well, surprise, he's real.

502
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:04,214
He calls himself the Flash.

503
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:08,786
Porter and main, tonight,
sundown.

504
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,755
Come out, come out,
wherever you are, flash.

505
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,391
Show the whole world
you're real.

506
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,495
Or this woman dies.

507
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,498
No, don't come for me.
Stay away!

508
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,577
You're a friend of his, huh?

509
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,846
He's fast...

510
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,015
Like fire.

511
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,884
Fire, it's undefinable.

512
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,722
Heat, light, energy.

513
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,924
It's an evolution
when things burn.

514
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,593
You're sick.

515
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,830
Maybe you're the sick ones.
You ever think about that?

516
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,264
Not really.

517
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,400
Mm.

518
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,869
You've got third-degree burns.

519
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,772
Why didn't you get skin grafts?

520
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,108
The fire revealed
my true self,

521
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,243
Showed me who I really am.

522
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,512
I wonder what your flash
will reveal

523
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,515
When I burn his suit
and skin off.

524
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:15,486
Do whatever you want to me,
but leave him alone.

525
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:18,989
Oh, okay.

526
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,291
You and this flash must be
really close

527
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,694
If you're willing
to die for him, hmm?

528
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,931
You want me to show you
who you really are?

529
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,834
That'd be fun.

530
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:34,772
Show you who you...
Really are.

531
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,974
Mick.

532
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,609
Time to go.

533
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,180
You better pray
the next people

534
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:46,650
That come
through this door is us.

535
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,765
- Hey.
- Okay, you're on.

536
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,167
Good luck, son.

537
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,334
Thanks.

538
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,403
Barry, after tonight,

539
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:08,672
Everyone's gonna know
that the Flash exists.

540
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,274
Are you ready for that?

541
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,244
I'll see you soon.

542
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,178
Did... did you see that?

543
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,914
That was him.
That was the Flash.

544
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,349
I don't believe it.

545
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,690
Believe it.

546
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,559
The scarlet speedster.

547
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,863
Any preference
on how you'd like to die?

548
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:09,566
The flame or the frost?

549
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,203
Not in the mood for chitchat.
Gotcha.

550
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,005
Ready when you are.

551
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,155
Cover me!

552
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,327
Run on this.

553
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,538
Barry.
Barry, are you okay?

554
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,806
You know what you have to do.

555
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,009
Yeah, get them
to cross their beams

556
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,577
And cancel their guns out.
I know.

557
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,878
Mick!

558
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,849
Ah!
Gotcha!

559
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,792
Yeah, not as easy
as it sounds.

560
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,431
Eddie, Eddie!

561
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,700
- Iris, what are you doing here?
- They evacuated jitters.

562
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,402
- I saw your car.
- No, you can't be here.

563
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,636
It's not safe.

564
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,079
Are you sure Caitlin's here,
Cisco?

565
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,747
Starting from Caitlin's car,

566
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,416
I pieced together surveillance
footage that led us

567
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,984
to his general area.

568
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,986
But there's over a dozen
warehouses here.

569
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,454
Yeah, but only one of them

570
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,623
has had the heat on
the last three nights.

571
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,892
And I'm betting
Mick Rory likes it hot.

572
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:43,760
Okay.

573
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,729
Stay behind me.

574
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,239
- Caitlin.
- Hmm!

575
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,608
- Caitlin, is that you?
- Mm-mm.

576
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,546
- Caitlin.
- No!

577
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:04,147
We're gonna get you
out of here.

578
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,782
Cisco!

579
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,284
Cisco, down!

580
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,330
The fight is spreading
beyond the evac area.

581
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,332
We need to expand the perimeter.

582
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,170
We can't.
We can't let this spread.

583
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,849
Oh, my god!

584
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,317
Thawne, where are you going?

585
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,618
- Eddie, Eddie.
- Thawne!

586
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,665
I thought I was gonna die.

587
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,468
Not while I'm around.

588
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,804
Or him.

589
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,020
Hold on!

590
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:20,390
I got him!
Look out, look out, look out!

591
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,032
I can't get them
to cross streams.

592
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,234
Speed isn't getting it done.

593
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,003
You're right.

594
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:36,373
Maybe the way to do this
is not by going faster.

595
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,008
It's going slower.

596
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,709
Yes.

597
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,445
Okay.

598
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,519
Thanks for playing, kid.

599
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,056
Ha ha ha ha ha!

600
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,824
I didn't see that coming.

601
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,260
I guess you win this time.

602
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:33,330
There won't be a next time.

603
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,102
Thank you, detective.

604
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,815
Aah!
I'm gonna burn

605
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,184
Every last one of you pigs!

606
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,019
Get your hands off me!

607
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,654
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

608
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,324
Yaaaaah!

609
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,564
- Partner's a real hothead.
- That's funny.

610
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,299
You know what's hilarious,
Snart?

611
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,500
We got you.

612
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,068
Congratulations.

613
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,137
Get him out of here.

614
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,310
Nice work, Eddie.

615
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,179
It wasn't me.

616
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,148
It was the Flash.

617
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,884
We're not gonna
be needing these for the trial.

618
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,220
You'll make sure...
they'll never hurt anyone

619
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,655
Ever again.

620
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,429
Mr. Ramon.

621
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,365
Thank you.

622
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,206
He was like a lightning bolt,
zipping through the streets.

623
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,508
Took them both out
singlehandedly.

624
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,244
- That's amazing.
- I wonder who he is.

625
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:57,347
If you ask me, he's a hero.

626
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,553
- Okay, all right.
- I think that's it.

627
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,656
This better be it.

628
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,592
Well, like you said,

629
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,627
You're ten minutes away,
so if you forget something...

630
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:11,628
Okay.

631
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,934
Dad.

632
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,870
I can't say it enough.

633
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,806
I'll miss you.

634
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,211
You know you can come
around anytime, Joe.

635
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,047
Just give us a heads-up.

636
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,616
Or not.

637
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,651
Come around whenever.

638
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,920
You want a key?

639
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,791
I'm gonna go.

640
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,561
I'll wait... In the truck.

641
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,274
Why don't I give
you two a minute?

642
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,883
Well...
Look, I know things have been

643
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,052
Really weird
between us recently.

644
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,322
Yeah, they have.

645
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,862
Well, did you know
that I can see into the future?

646
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:19,963
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

647
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,364
Did I forget to tell you that?

648
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,199
You did not mention it, no.

649
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,969
Wow.

650
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,971
So what do you see?

651
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:36,479
I see you and Eddie
being really happy together.

652
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,149
And things aren't weird
between us anymore.

653
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:44,220
It took a little time,
but everything's back to normal,

654
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:48,291
And we're still best friends.

655
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:51,328
The future
doesn't sound so bad.

656
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,796
No.

657
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:57,100
And it'll be here faster
than you think.

658
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:03,673
Dad, is it okay if I...

659
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,841
Yeah.

660
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,619
My baby girl.

661
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,563
See you.

662
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,071
Pffft. Well...

663
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,246
You okay?

664
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,215
Mm-hmm.

665
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,883
How about you?

666
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,619
It was bound
to happen sometime, right?

667
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,187
Mm-hmm.

668
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,623
Want to order some pizza
and watch the ball game?

669
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,025
Make it pizzas and you're on.

670
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,362
You know, if you ever
need somebody

671
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,030
to come and eat your food,
I'm there.

672
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,699
Besides, the laundry machines
in my building

673
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,601
have been broken for,
like, a month, so...

674
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,269
I don't know why you

675
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,104
moved into that deathtrap
in the first place,

676
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,440
since you still got
a perfectly good room here.

677
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,075
You said you were turning it
into a gym.

678
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,545
We both know I'm not
turning it into a gym.

679
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,180
- Yeah.
- Besides,

680
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:21,084
you got me running around enough
as it is.

681
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,353
You know, it is getting hard
to hide the blasting

682
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:26,256
in and out of my apartment
at all hours of the night

683
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,458
from my neighbors.

684
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,796
I suppose it would make sense
for me to move back in.

685
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,799
I mean, I am a millennial.
That is what we do.

686
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:38,835
Well, don't do it
on my account.

687
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,437
I'll be fine on my own.

688
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,905
Oh, yeah, me too.

689
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:45,175
Sure.

690
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,181
All right, roomie.
You order the pizzas.

691
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,515
I'll unpack.

692
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,018
No way.

693
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,386
I want to help you.

694
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:59,522
I want to enjoy this.

695
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:01,658
All right.

696
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,330
You know this does nothing
to me.

697
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,032
- Just drink it.
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,674
I should've burned
the entire city block down.

699
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,577
But instead, I listened to you.

700
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,278
We had the painting.
We had the guns.

701
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,014
We could've had everything.

702
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,750
But you had your stupid plan.

703
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,920
How is that stupid plan
working out for us now?

704
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:34,090
Everyone's seen the Flash now.

705
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:37,760
This changes things, again.

706
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,300
What the...

707
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:45,835
Snart!

708
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,837
Relax, Mick.

709
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,074
What's going on?

710
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,442
The plan.

711
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,015
Hey, sis.

712
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,352
Nice.
