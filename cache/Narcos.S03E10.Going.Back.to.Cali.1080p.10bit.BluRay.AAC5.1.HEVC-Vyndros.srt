00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,064
Hey!

2
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:10,112
Hey, ladies.
Are you looking for something?

3
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,491
We're just taking a ride.
Can't we pass?

4
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,118
No, sweetheart. You have to go back.

5
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:28,339
Listen... Do you want to hang out
later back in town?

6
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,800
- What?
- I said...

7
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,880
No, no, no!

8
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,869
- Julio.
- Pacho, you motherfucker.

9
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,620
Motherfucking dog!

10
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:49,253
Let me go!

11
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,302
Let go of me!

12
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,181
Let me go! Let go...

13
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,892
You.

14
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,562
Mrs. Salazar.

15
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,317
Do you know
what makes me happy, Pacho?

16
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,402
Makes me very happy?

17
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,823
That my sons didn't kill
your brother Alvaro.

18
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:23,495
Because he's going to live
the rest of his life as half a man.

19
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,706
Half man, half...

20
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,983
Help!

21
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,320
Help!

Good, brother.
Grateful that we're all together.

45

49
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,768
Of course you would.

50
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,479
Fucking Chepe.

51
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,065
Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.

52
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,028
You all know this wasn't what I wanted.

53
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:11,992
So it's very hard for me to admit
that I know this is for the best.

54
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,245
And thanks to you, we're on
the verge of... How do you call it?

55
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,372
"A great victory."

56
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,961
We believe in you.

57
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,007
To my brother, Gilberto.

Don't worry about it.

61
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,379
Agent Peña.

62
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,674
Hello.

63
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,218
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Give me a second.

64
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,095
Go with your mum.

65
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,099
I checked with the embassy. They're
finishing up paperwork this afternoon.

66
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,142
You're on a flight tomorrow. First thing.

67
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,855
Guillermo Pallomari...

68
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,569
- Any idea where we can find him?
- No. Why do you need him?

69
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,196
Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez
gave six million dollars

70
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,365
to Samper's presidential campaign.

71
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,578
So unless we get Pallomari in the States
testifying on the cartel,

72
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,413
generating new indictments...

73
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,918
- What are you telling me?
- The godfathers won't stay locked up.

74
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:52,259
What'll happen to my family if these men
keep all their money and all their power?

75
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,679
Witness Protection Services will provide
security for as long as you need.

76
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,814
Pallomari's wife's having an affair.

77
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,026
- With who?
- Some guy at her office. Fredy Moya.

78
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,778
The phones in the cartel safe house,
they're tapped.

79
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,990
I overheard a conversation between them.
It didn't sound like business.

80
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:24,458
- And he can keep them in prison?
- We find Pallomari or the godfathers walk.

81
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,463
You're not gonna find him without me.

82
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,550
You're right.

83
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,265
Go ahead, sir.

84
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,184
Director.

85
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,312
Don Miguel.
Please, go ahead.

92
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:14,841

as an opportunity. Keep a low profile.

93
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,137
Sure, don't worry.

'How come you don't know?
Make sure she's taken care of.'

96
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,398
It's very important
that you handle Pallomari.

97
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:34,528
That motherfucker could ruin everything.
Call me when it's done.

98
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,089
- Guillermo?
- I need your help, Gonzalo.

99
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,633
You know I can't get involved.

100
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,137
Nothing is going to happen to you.
When has anything ever happened to you?

101
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,222
I'm asking you for legal advice,
and quickly.

102
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,436
I've decided that the best way
to get out of this situation

103
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,646
is to turn myself in to the authorities.

104
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,732
Yes, normally that would be
the case. Yes.

105
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,068
But the problem is you already
have a warrant out for your arrest.

106
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,695
An arrest warrant?

107
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,198
The police won't protect you.
In fact, they'll probably kill you.

108
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,326
I'm the head accountant.

109
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,579
And every dollar in this organisation,
and every secret,

110
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,622
has been through this head.
It's all in here.

111
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,708
So tell whoever needs to know
that I'm willing to negotiate.

112
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,755
Guillermo, my advice to you
is to get your family and leave Cali.

113
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,799
My wife's very attached to her work.

114
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,344
- What? I don't understand.
- You know her, she's stubborn.

115
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,307
She built her business
from the ground up.

116
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,480
I can't leave without her.

117
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:57,360
Look, Guillermo... this is not
my legal advice, but as your friend.

118
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:02,157
Talk some sense into your wife.
Immediately.

119
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,497
Can you get me a gun?

120
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,336
We'll have to look out for ourselves
for the rest of our lives,

121
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:19,090
but if I help them, maybe one day
we can come back to Colombia.

122
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,927
Are you insane? They almost killed us.

123
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,890
They almost killed us, and now you're
telling me you want to go back? To Cali?

124
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,309
Do you really think
we can come back to Colombia?

125
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,855
The moment we come back to Colombia,
they'll kill our daughters.

126
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,609
Are you doing this to make up
for the last four years of your life?

127
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,658
I'm a good man.

128
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,082
I was a good man.

129
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:56,086
I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.
I'm not waiting for you.

130
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,934
Wait for me, okay? Thanks.

131
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,616
That way.

132
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,043
Keep looking for him.
No more fucking excuses.

133
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,796
Okay.

134
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,846
Yeah?

135
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,434
Have you heard from your father?

136
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,603
Yes.

137
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,694
David, I've been wondering about
the arrangement I had for my son and...

138
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,070
Arrangement?

139
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,741
I thought it was true love.

140
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,913
Your father knows I care about him.

141
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,335
That's beautiful. Seriously.

142
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,004
But here's the thing...

143
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,215
You don't mean anything to me.

144
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,885
You're not my mother.

145
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,429
You're not my fucking problem.

146
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,556
- David...
- What?

147
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,809
What the fuck do I owe you?

148
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,399
María...

149
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,612
Open your legs for someone else.
You're good at that.

150
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,449
Okay?

151
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,176
Once we step off this plane,
whatever goes down is on me.

152
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,262
We are way off the well-lit path.

153
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,143
Jorge...

154
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,271
Good afternoon, Mr. Salcedo.

155
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,275
Mr. Espinosa's still at lunch.
He should be back soon.

156
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,694
- We'll wait for him inside.
- Okay, sir.

157
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,240
Another drink?

158
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,828
I need to go. See you next week.

159
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,967
Excuse me.
How are the girls here?

160
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,719
The best of Cali.

161
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,097
Open it!

162
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,267
Get in.

163
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,021
Get in, motherfucker!

164
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,029
Okay...

165
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,118
ACCESS RESTRICTED
PASSWORD REQUIRED

166
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,541
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

167
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,335
- I'm looking for Fredy Moya.
- Yes.

168
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,004
- The one wearing purple.
- Thanks.

169
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,635
Don't pull my chain.
I'm looking at the numbers.

170
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,888
Excuse me.
You work with Patricia Pallomari?

171
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,393
Javier Peña, DEA.

172
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,895
I'll call you back.

173
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,525
I'm afraid Patricia has
taken a temporary leave of absence.

174
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,985
That so?

175
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,781
- You have any idea where I can find her?
- I wouldn't know.

176
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,910
- She in trouble?
- No, but her husband is.

177
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:25,373
There's a warrant out for his arrest
and a pretty substantial reward.

178
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,458
Any information is helpful.

179
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,832
- 'Hello?'
- It's me.

180
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,294
Baby, I can't talk right now.
Call me back later.

181
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,255
'No. Wait, I can't call you back.
Wait.'

182
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,632
Yes.

183
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,803
Yes, I'd have to check
my records in the office.

184
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,891
I can't talk. Wait...

185
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:29,854
Patricia, the DEA was just here.
The DEA. Asking questions.

186
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,357
- 'What did you tell them?'
- 'To go fuck themselves.

187
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,110
- 'They want Guillermo, not you.'
- 'I can't talk now. We'll discuss it later.'

188
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,364
- That's her.
- 'Patricia, they talked about a reward.'

189
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,661
So, she used the line

190
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,956
in an apartment
in the north part of the city.

191
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,208
We need to take advantage.

192
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,003
I need to use the bathroom.

193
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,731
- Work again?
- Yes.

194
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,275
Excuse me.

195
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,026
Excuse me.

196
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,153
Open the window this time.

197
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,553
This way.

198
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:03,614
I'd offer a drink,
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.

199
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,454
Have a seat.

200
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,423
Don Orlando,
I'm here to ask for your protection.

201
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:25,470
Why? You don't feel safe?

202
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,853
I did what I had to do
after my husband died.

203
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,067
Now I'm in your home...
ready to do what I have to do once again.

204
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,824
So what is it you're offering me?

205
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,336
In here.
How was the drive?

206
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,546
It was easy.

207
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,048
Nice place.

208
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,938
Let me start by thanking you
for the meeting.

209
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,233
We're both busy men.
I won't waste your time.

210
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,569
But I'm a businessman, like you.

211
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:30,326
The information you seek maybe,
maybe, maybe is in my possession.

212
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,832
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

213
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,917
You feel me?

214
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:45,133
On the phone, you told me
you know where Pallomari is. Correct?

215
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,054
Look, let me put it this way...

216
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,059
Patricia and I are in love.

217
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,478
We want to be together.

218
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,442
So Guillermo's a problem for me.

219
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:09,532
And from what I've heard,
he's a problem for you too. Am I right?

220
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,618
You are correct.

221
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,333
So maybe we can help each other.

222
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:23,129
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

223
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,344
Okay.

224
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,931
Okay.

225
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:37,852
- Let me fix you a drink. Okay?
- Sure.

226
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,773
By the way, are you guys
running Windows 95 yet?

227
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,193
Think we're going to wait for next year.

228
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,905
Where the fuck is Pallomari,
you queer?

229
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,740
Did you hear me?

230
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,466
Here's the milk. Just a few minutes
and then you go to bed.

231
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,974
- Get in your room.
- Who is it? Who is it?

232
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,018
I don't know.
Get in your room. Quickly.

233
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,818
- Drop the gun! Put it down!
- Drop your weapon! Put it down!

234
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,904
- It's okay.
- They're the gringos.

235
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,656
- Calm down.
- Do you know them?

236
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,824
- They came to my office.
- Put the gun down.

237
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,994
- Close the door.
- We're here to help you.

238
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,413
Close the door.

239
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,457
- Okay.
- Okay.

240
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,461
Lower your gun.
You understand?

241
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,050
- I'd put the safety on.
- Sorry.

242
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,970
Do you want to sit?

243
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,619
Okay, DEA, are we speaking English
or Spanish or...? I don't give a shit.

244
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,663
The Colombians have a warrant
for your arrest.

245
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,790
- I know.
- And the cartel wants you dead.

246
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,792
I'm well aware of that.

247
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,925
The only way you survive this
is if we get you out to the United States.

248
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,468
Guillermo...

249
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,931
- The United States?
- We have your ledger.

250
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,690
You decode it for us
and you testify on what you know...

251
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,317
That's quite a bit.

252
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,111
...and we make sure that
you and your family are safe.

253
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,951
- Which place in the United States?
- I'm not sure. We have a program that...

254
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,164
Yeah, I know. The program.
But if I'm giving up my life...

255
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,169
...I want to know
what I'm getting for it.

256
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,255
For instance,
which kind of house will we have?

257
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,884
My family requires
a certain amount of square footage.

258
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,511
It wasn't very hard for us to find you
and it won't be hard for them.

259
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,263
Do you understand that?

260
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:23,934
This is your chance
to keep your family alive.

261
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,272
We will negotiate the details later.

262
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,901
This is the only option you have.
Do you understand that?

263
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,364
- Yeah.
- Okay.

264
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,699
Why don't you pack your things,
as little as possible.

265
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,577
No, Guillermo.
We can't leave for at least a week.

266
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,789
- You heard them.
- The company. I can't just leave!

267
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,458
- I need at least a week...
- Okay!

268
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:59,095
Put the radio on the dash
and your hands on the wheel.

269
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,866
How are you, Jorge Salcedo?

270
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,042
Go help your kids pack
and let me talk to your wife.

271
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,961
Yeah.

272
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:40,469
I know about Fredy Moya.
It's none of my business.

273
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:44,265
- You're right. It's not your problem.
- You realise what happens if they find you?

274
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,643
And your kids?

275
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,902
I have to say goodbye to him.
We're in love. I can't leave like that.

276
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,239
Mrs. Pallomari, if you stay, you die.

277
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,700
Understood?

278
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,745
I'll be honest with you.

279
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,497
The truth is...

280
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,710
I was very disappointed
to hear you were the fucking rat.

281
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,007
But I still like you.

282
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,638
It's all good. I'm not going to kill you.

283
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,851
David Rodríguez...

284
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,856
...he wants to do it himself
personally, you know?

285
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,776
That's fine by me.

286
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,655
That way,
our friendship will remain intact.

287
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,295
- Let's go.
- Come on, damn it!

288
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,381
- The jacket...
- Okay, that's it. Let's go.

289
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,925
We're on our way down.

290
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,198
'Salcedo, we're in the lobby now.'

291
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,242
Are we clear?

292
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,411
'Salcedo?'

293
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,748
Tell them to come out.

294
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,546
Jorge, we clear or not?

295
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,551
Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.

296
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,515
All clear.

297
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,686
Copy.

298
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,688
All right, stay close.

299
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,123
Let's finish this.

300
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,880
Put the gun down.

301
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,426
I don't want to kill you.

302
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,764
We both know that's a lie.

303
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:39,106
Get down! Get behind the car!
Over there!

304
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,163
What the fuck happened?

305
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,374
He has the keys.

306
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,835
- Let's move!
- Come on, get in the car!

307
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,629
Let's go!

308
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:02,922
- You drive.
- Patricia!

309
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,967
Don't look!
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!

310
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,765
- Don't look at that!
- What the fuck is he doing here?

311
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,643
He saved your life!
Get in the fucking car!

312
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,436
Open! Open!

313
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,649
Be careful, be careful. Okay.

314
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,233
Move, move, move, move!

315
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,707
What happened? Huh?

316
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,335
They killed Navegante.

317
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,966
- And Pallomari?
- The motherfucker's gone.

318
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,468
You sure?

319
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,600
We're going to the airport.
We're going to catch those...

320
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,812
We're leaving, now!
Motherfuckers!

321
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,402
You, come with me.

322
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:11,865
We're going to the airport.
Take the guys. Now, now, now!

323
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,461
That's the North Valley, you fuckers.
Who do they think they're messing with?

324
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,714
You just got smoked, bitches.

325
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,806
Boss!

326
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,517
Boss!

327
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,867
Let's go. Out.

328
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,078
- Could you open, please?
- Yes. There you go.

329
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,455
Thank you.

330
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,208
Patricia, get out this way.
Careful, my love.

331
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,626
Okay.

332
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,131
- What's this?
- You're wanted by the CNP.

333
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:12,843
We can't aid the escape of a fugitive,
so you've gotta fly yourself out.

334
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,055
Do you see that?
We have a private plane.

335
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,390
We have a plane just for us.

336
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,770
- If you could sign here, sir?
- Me? Okay. Yeah.

337
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,607
You have to pay for the plane.
Whatever you have on you.

338
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,860
I don't carry that kind of cash...

339
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,822
It's just a technicality.
So that it's not kidnapping.

340
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,784
Just a moment.
If it's just a technicality...

341
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,997
- Thanks. Okay.
- Okay.

342
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,917
Get on the plane. Go.
Everything's going to be fine.

343
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,377
Come on. Let's go.

344
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,842
Goodbye, Salcedo.

345
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,168
Ladies and gentlemen, my next witness
has direct, first-hand knowledge

346
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:32,798
of the criminal activities uncovered
by Operation Cornerstone.

347
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,675
Please state your name, sir.

348
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,302
Guillermo Pallomari.

349
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,638
And you were an accountant
for the Cali cartel?

350
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,142
No, I was the chief accountant.
The chief<i>. El jefe.</i>

351
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,811
'Guillermo Pallomari
had a lot to say.

352
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,897
'And he said it in federal courtrooms
from Miami to New York City.'

353
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:52,359
This is the ledger of Mr. Pallomaro
that only he himself can interpret.

354
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,655
I'm sorry, your Honour, my English is not
quite good, but his Spanish is awful.

355
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,199
Can you repeat my name?
"Pallomari." It's so simple.

356
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,869
'And people were interested
in what he had to say,

357
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,205
'especially about the cartel's influence
with the Colombian government.

358
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,332
'So that government
went on the defensive.'

359
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,711
'And we have total
agreement in that these testimonies

360
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:16,175
'that we have heard from Mr. Pallomari
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.

361
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,551
'Thank you very much.'

362
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,469
'But the damage was done.

363
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,973
'It would be most helpful if the Colombian
president, who's head of the government,

364
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,225
'was as dedicated
to fighting narcotics trafficking

365
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,269
'as many of the people
in his own government.'

366
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,731
'The U.S. House and Senate
began making noise about decertification,

367
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:35,068

in The War on Drugs into an enemy,

the vital foreign aid

369
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,532
'that served the shadowy interests
of both nations.

370
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,326
'And that scared people.

371
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:47,456
'Enough to see justice finally done?
Well, governments don't work that way.'

372
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,374
You know how many times
I've gotten a call

373
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,085
from the Department of Justice and State
the same morning?

374
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:58,300
Count 'em on one finger.
Guess we have you to thank for that.

375
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,345
I'm headed over
to the National Palace right now,

376
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:07,142
to make clear to President Samper himself
that the godfathers stay in jail.

377
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,271
- At least for the foreseeable future.
- But that's as far as it goes?

378
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,862
We drew up a draft indictment outlining
President Samper's ties to the Cali cartel.

379
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,656
Alleged ties.

380
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,743
And I suggest you keep that draft
to yourself.

381
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,455
The DOJ's not going to topple
a government, Agent Peña.

382
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,336
You can't tell me
you're surprised by that.

383
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,383
Some part of me
was holding out hope, I guess.

384
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:44,304
Well, you should tell that part
to grow the fuck up.

385
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,766
No, I mean it, Agent Peña.
You should be happy.

386
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,977
You played the system
like a goddamn fiddle.

387
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,816
You won.

388
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,450
Yes, sir.

389
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,171
'Another deal.

'Not until they know the truth.'

399
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:23,653
You know what it means
if you go on the record, right?

400
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,865
There'll be a price to pay.

and occupation.

DEA attaché in Colombia.

we're guests in a "Narco-Democracy"?

Good.
They're responsible. We all are.

You know, any aspirations you had
for your career...

425

behind the barn and shot.

426

00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:39,386
'Back in Colombia, Jorge Salcedo
was publicly branded a rat.'

468
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,889
The danger that he put himself in
to insure the success of our operation...

469
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:47,185
'And in the States, despite testimony
that he was instrumental to our efforts

470
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,855
'to capture and prosecute
the Cali godfathers,

471
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,859
'he still had to plead guilty
to felony conspiracy charges.

472
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,405
'And from there, Jorge Salcedo...

473
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:03,660
'...the guy who had the most to do
with bringing down the Cali cartel

474
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:07,497
'disappeared into the Federal
Witness Protection Program

475
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,291
'somewhere in the U.S.

476
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,962
'A prison of its own.'

477
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:35,817
- You knew him, right? Agent Camarena?
- Of him.

478
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,861
My first assignment out of the academy

479
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,113
was a task force that
searched for him in Guadalajara.

480
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:46,453
It all started there. Before him,
we didn't even know we were in a war.

481
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,664
Another hot one down there
for you, huh?

482
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,916
You took down the big players
in Colombia.

483
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:56,296
Yeah, well... we'll make new ones.

484
00:45:56,421 --> 00:46:00,800
Don't turn a victory into a defeat, Javier.
The Colombian super-cartels are gone.

485
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:04,429
And whoever comes next are gonna be
fighting amongst themselves for years.

486
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:08,224
They're still only going to be a shadow
of what Medellín and Cali were.

487
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,353
And now it's time to take the fight
to the real enemy in The War on Drugs.

488
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,272
Mexico.

489
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:17,066
"The real enemy"?

490
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,863
Let me put in some calls. I'll make
this bullshit resignation go away.

491
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,202
What else is a guy like you gonna do?

492
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,194
All right, fellas. Let's move.
Keep going.

493
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,989
Keep going.

494
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,909
You helping me with this or not?

495
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,873
- I thought I was getting a partner.
- Come on, Pop. Give me that.

496
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:56,875
Stubborn.

497
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,299
You can stand here
for an hour and count 20 of 'em going by.

498
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:09,387
So... do you have to fix
the fence every time a storm hits?

499
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:15,393
Someone has to do it.
That's how life works.

500
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,987
You thinking
of taking them up on it? Mexico?

501
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:29,991
It's different there.

502
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,119
- Son, let me tell you...
- Dad.

503
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,332
I've done enough.

504
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,753
I'm through.

505
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,262
Hand me that cutter.
