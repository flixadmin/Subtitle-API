1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,685
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,206
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,649
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,650
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,490
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,848
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,126
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,601
Previously on Arrow...

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,887
Who's Lonnie Machin?

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,770
<i>"MALCOLM". He's kind of
an ex-boyfriend of Thea's.</i>

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,281
Tell me where I can find Damien Darhk?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,604
<i>You don't need another man
clouding your mind.</i>

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,961
Alex, run!

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,281
It's gone.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,806
Lyla, you need to tell us what Rubicon is.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,442
It's every NATO ally. Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,801
<i>We have 12 hours to stop it.</i>

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,521
Darhk is powered by death.
So, if even one of those nukes hits...

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,966
<i>He'll be unstoppable.</i>

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,481
We lost one. It's in the air.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,601
Direct hit on Havenrock.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,921
How many casualties?

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,321
<i>"LYLA". Tens of thousands.</i>

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,520
Hello, Oliver. Nice timing.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,800
I think you're
going to need much bigger arrows.

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,962
Cool. You know,
I didn't even mean to do that.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,410
I turn steel arrows into dust,
and you thought lead would do the trick?

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,011
He's not human anymore.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,041
Oh, I'm still human. Just better.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,328
Doesn't give you
the right to remake the world.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,842
Why not? It's been done before.
Noah and the flood.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,651
People even worship the responsible party.

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,646
This might smart a little.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,043
I'm pulling the oxygen out of your bodies,
molecule by molecule,

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,201
but here's the good news.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,807
I'm not going to kill you.
Well, not right now, at least.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,440
Instead, I'm going to
regain control of Rubicon.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,365
That way, when the whole world
goes all Dr. Strangelove,

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,171
you can feel your skin
melt from Armageddon.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,006
Oliver, let's go!

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,644
Come on! We gotta go, now!

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,087
Come On.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,611
What happened here?

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,602
Too bad. I liked him for you.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,606
Where's Machin?

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,011
I... I don't know.

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,567
He disappeared, okay?
I wasn't paying attention.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,609
Why do I have trouble believing you?

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,610
Let go of me!

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,446
Not to sound too much like your father,
but I really think you need a timeout.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,250
<i>Government officials
couldn't confirm the death toll.</i>

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,450
<i>However, various reports
place the number in the tens of thousands.</i>

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,087
<i>Evacuation efforts
of the surrounding areas continue...</i>

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,487
What are you doing?

55
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,483
We can't afford
to get caught up in grief right now.

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,880
Now, I've bought us 24 hours

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,884
by sending Rubicon's launch algorithms
into an infinite loop,

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,963
but if we can't find a more permanent...

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,564
God, what am I doing?

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,485
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- Don't "sweetheart" me.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,608
You don't get to do that,
but you're right.

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,649
I can't get wrapped up in this.

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,969
Have you been watching the news?

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,167
I can't stop.

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,369
Ironically, last week my mom was giving me
a hard time about living in Star City.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Between the earthquakes,

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,400
the viral attacks,
the homicidal super soldiers,

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,840
why would anyone want to live here?

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,606
It turns out we live in
only the second worst place in America.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,761
Curtis.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,169
This is my father. Noah Kuttler.

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,371
Noah Kuttler. Huh.

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,968
You know, it's funny
because there's this super hacker

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,050
who's wanted by the FBI
whose name is also Noah Kuttler.

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,328
He's kind of a big deal on the Dark Web.

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,207
Honestly, I thought they could have used
a more flattering photo

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,691
for the wanted poster.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,525
Wait, you...

80
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,126
You're the Noah Kuttler?

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,528
And, if you're Felicity's dad,
you were married to Donna...

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,041
And you make so much more sense now.

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,881
Yup.

84
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,041
This is... it was a big mystery.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,241
I was trying to figure out, like, how...

86
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,924
We have work to do.
HIVE was behind the Havenrock explosion.

88
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,123
They stole a cyberweapon called Rubicon

89
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,482
and now are using it
to commandeer the world's nukes.

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,922
So, we have less than 24 hours to stop it,

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,050
or the world is going to
experience the sequel to WarGames.

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,891
Actually, there was
a direct-to-DVD sequel in 2008,

93
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,321
but it was a bomb, too,
so, that reference still holds.

94
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,447
I have to go.

95
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,481
Don't worry.
Me and your fugitive dad have got this.

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,401
He says, just realizing
he said that out loud.

97
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,449
Today was supposed to be Christmas,
and I woke up to a lump of coal.

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,841
Is it because I've been naughty this year?

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,651
It's because Kuttler and his daughter
are wrestling us for Rubicon.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,848
Which is why
I felt the need to up our game.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,924
Mr. Seldon, pleasure to see you.

102
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,407
Do you know what the best part
about leading a prison break is?

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,927
A long list of criminals that owe you.

104
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,691
Amar, Brickwell, and now Mr. Seldon.

105
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,525
- It's like one-stop shopping for thugs.
- I'm a hacker, not a thug.

106
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,331
Oh. Turns out he and Ms. Smoak
have a history.

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,960
Just your typical boy meets girl,
boy falls in love with girl,

108
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,849
boy goes to jail for girl.

109
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,809
Boy tries to kill girl for money.

110
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,082
Speaking of thugs,
we have a new problem at Tevat Noah.

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,170
Not this guy again.

112
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,450
Don't worry, darling.
I'm dealing with him.

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,961
Give Mr. Machin my love, my love.

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,203
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,163
<i>A long-range ballistic KN-08 missile</i>

116
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,529
<i>was responsible
for the nuclear blast at Havenrock.</i>

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,570
<i>The Pentagon has not further commented.</i>

118
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,320
What's going on?
What the hell happened in Havenrock?

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,527
Darhk happened.

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,529
This city is starting to panic.
Are they right to?

121
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,920
Felicity's got it under control,

122
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,491
but my wife
and her top secret government agency's

123
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,846
looking for a more permanent solution.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,126
I cannot get in touch with Thea!

125
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,282
- It's okay. She got a hold of me.
- All right.

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,931
Thanks for not being dead.

127
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,845
Um, aren't we all going to be
if you're away from your computer?

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,930
Curtis and Kuttler
are dealing with Rubicon.

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,485
What did Thea say?
Do you know where she is?

130
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,608
It's not good news. HIVE has her.

131
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,410
- Do you have a location?
- I'm tracing a signal.

132
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,006
I should have taken more processors
from Palmer Tech on my way out.

133
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,685
They made a mistake letting you go.
They'll see it.

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,320
And if they don't,
I'm taking revenge plan suggestions.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,486
Got it. Thea's message came from
the intersection of Berkeley and Childers

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,681
right in the heart of the Glades.

137
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,121
I thought you said
Thea and her boyfriend went out of town.

138
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,327
I thought they did.

139
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,527
Let's go.

140
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,404
- I'm coming with you.
- I want you to stay here.

141
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,001
If this gets worse, the city's going to
need someone to listen to

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,525
that they can trust.

143
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,246
What is it? Say something.

144
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,686
Your eyes were glowing.

145
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,410
Like Reiter?

146
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,971
On, my God.

147
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,889
- Oliver, what's happening to me?
- It doesn't matter.

148
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,447
We will figure it out,
but for now we have to keep moving.

149
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,886
All right? Come on.

150
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,286
Oliver!

151
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,081
It's incredible.

152
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,001
I know now why Reiter sought this power.

153
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,685
When you furrow your brow like that,
you look just like Moira.

154
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,047
Don't you dare talk about my mother.

155
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,204
Fine. Let's talk about the future instead.

156
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,771
Genesis is coming.

157
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,564
With Machin running around,

158
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,604
we can't have
another X-factor on the loose.

159
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,531
"We"? Not your HIVE overlords?

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,445
Point being, I need your word
that you won't cause any trouble.

161
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,961
Or what?

162
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,570
Or I will have to do something
to assure your compliance

163
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,882
that I really don't want to do.

164
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,645
Well, when there's something
I don't want to do,

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,290
I just get it over with.

166
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,408
This will make everything better.

167
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,241
Overwatch,
are you sure this is the spot?

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,129
There's nothing here.

169
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,486
That's impossible.

170
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,284
Okay, not impossible,

171
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,684
but my backtrace on Thea's message
has a 99.9999% accuracy rate,

172
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,161
so unless this is part
of the .0001 percentile...

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,163
<i>It's just an empty street.</i>

174
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,691
Just look
for anything out of place, all right?

175
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,889
Whatever HIVE has built
is probably recent, you know, new.

176
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,771
Is there supposed to be
sewer access on the street?

177
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,490
<i>Not according to city plans.</i>

178
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,401
Stand by.

179
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,730
Help me with something, Malcolm.

180
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,929
How is it again that this
juvenile annoyance, Lonnie Machin,

181
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,366
is still a problem for us?

182
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,722
- Machin is exactly what we...
- Actually, I've changed my mind.

183
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,850
I'm not interested in excuses,
just results.

184
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,121
Yes?

185
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,209
<i>Two hostiles have
breached the southeast entrance,</i>

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,890
<i>one in green, the other in black.</i>

187
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,520
Send a squad
and secure the entrance.

188
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,761
Green and black.

189
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,570
Oliver's come
for his baby sister, most likely.

190
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,927
Mmm. And since she's only here
because of you,

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,169
lbeHeve
that makes Mr. Queen your problem.

192
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,563
You have a lot on your plate, Malcolm.
I suggest you get started.

193
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,721
Come on, sweetie.

194
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,088
How did HIVE build all this
without anyone knowing?

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,287
Well,
doesn't hurt having someone

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,169
controlling the city's infrastructure.

197
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,163
Can't find any public blueprints on file

198
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,243
for an underground lair
with a creepy sewer entrance.

199
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,766
Believe me,
there are no public blueprints for this.

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,082
Unbelievable.

201
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,850
Just like Mount Weather.

202
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,923
Continuity of government facility
built by FEMA during the Cold War,

203
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,451
in case of a nuclear attack.

204
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,331
I think that we found the ark
that HIVE's been building.

205
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,890
- What?
- I lost their signal.

206
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,166
Well, get it back.

207
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,324
I have to get back to Curtis and Kuttler.

208
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,166
All right. I'll cover comms.
I hear anything, I'll patch you in.

209
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,129
What's the emergency?
Is Rubicon still stabilized?

210
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,648
Where is Kuttler? Did he do something?
Did he... Are you drinking a beer?

211
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,167
I knew that
being a child of divorce was hard,

212
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,486
but what I did not have any idea about
was all the yelling,

213
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,120
the name-calling, the loudness.

214
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,484
- You poor thing.
- Uh... Oh.

215
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,681
What are you talking about?

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,841
Oh, God, do you even listen?

217
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,485
So, I'm here to take her away from you?

218
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,244
My God, you just...
Yada, yada. My brain...

219
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,846
- Honestly, my brain is numb.
- Can we not with her here? She's here.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,651
This really is the end of the world.

221
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,001
It actually does the opposite.

222
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,403
Baby, I've been so worried about you.
Oh, my God.

223
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,963
Do you know I have called?

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,884
I have called you a million times, baby.

225
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,166
I have been calling and calling.

226
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,845
- Are you okay?
- Mom, I'm fine.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,126
Just been a little distracted.

228
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,441
With your father?

229
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,166
Thanks for telling me.

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,490
I don't know.
Everything just happened so fast.

231
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,641
What has?

232
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,561
Sit down.

233
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,089
What? What?

234
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,446
I have to tell you something.

235
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,806
I'm going to be a grandma!

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,207
- I'm going to be a grandma!
- No, no, no. No, you're not.

237
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,522
I knew you had
more than a bad burrito the other day.

238
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,681
I knew it was more than that.

239
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,281
- Okay.No“.
- Baby! Baby!

240
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,442
I am not pregnant.

241
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,210
Is that the only news
that a woman can have?

242
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,044
The world is under attack,
and I need my...

243
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
I need Noah to help me stop it.

244
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,489
Honey, what happened
in Havenrock is horrible,

245
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,324
but that doesn't mean
the world is going to end.

246
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,885
- She's telling the truth.
- You know, I know...

247
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,407
Which she clearly gets
from my side of the family, thank you.

248
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,885
You know, I know
when my daughter is lying, okay?

249
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,371
There were plenty of times
when she was a teenager,

250
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,726
not that you would know.

251
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,126
Here we go.

252
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,964
For once, this isn't about you, Dee.

253
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,730
Oh, you're calling me "Dee"?

254
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,882
- There are nuclear missiles...
- Are you calling me "Dee"?

255
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,366
Somebody stick something sharp in my eye.

256
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,010
It is going to happen to the entire world.

257
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,525
Unless we stop it, which we will.

258
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,843
Sweetie, why do you even think
this is something that you can...

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,367
Because I work with the Green Arrow, Mom.

260
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,805
- For how long?
- Three years.

261
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,444
And you've been keeping this from me?

262
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,081
Yes.

263
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,721
Wow, I guess you and your father
are more alike than I thought.

264
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,609
- Mom.
- We can talk about it later, hon,

265
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,650
after you save the world.

266
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,441
Get in here.

267
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,647
FELICITYI Oh!

268
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,801
Yeah.

269
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,607
The world's two best hackers side by side.
This is history.

270
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,730
I mean, it's... It's no biggie.

271
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,921
What just happened?

272
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,566
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,007
It's crazy.
Take away the psychos in the smocks...

274
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,164
might as well be Ivy Town.
Everyone looks so happy.

275
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,971
Happy's when you're mindless
on some little yellow pill.

276
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,408
Let's just assume
we weren't invited over for casserole.

277
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,766
What's our play?

278
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,968
We split up and find Thea.

279
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,282
Scope the houses on the north.
I'll head south.

280
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,650
<i>Good afternoon.
Today is a brisk and sunny 75 degrees.</i>

281
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,087
<i>It is a lovely day to be outside.</i>

282
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,286
<i>As we all enjoy Tevat Noah, I want to
take this moment to express my gratitude.</i>

283
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,120
<i>And I want to thank each and every one...</i>

284
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,731
I've got eyes on Thea.

285
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,962
Fourth house down.
There are two hostiles with her.

286
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,850
Speedy, let's get you out of here.

287
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,885
Are you all right?

288
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,206
I have the intruder.

289
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Move, and I will kill you.

290
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,124
- Thea...
- Don't move.

291
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,727
Listen to me.

292
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,763
You're not thinking clearly.

293
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,810
In her defense,
she's a little drugged at the moment.

294
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,929
I should have taken your head.

295
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,328
That's always been your problem.

296
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,847
An inability to do what is necessary.

297
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,160
Laurel is dead because of you.

298
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,811
What are you going to do?

299
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,647
We've already established
you're not going to kill me.

300
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,443
- What the hell?
- It's the yellow pills.

301
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,965
Son of a bitch.

302
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,404
We got to go. Let's move!

303
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,444
Not that it's not scintillating
to watch you type,

304
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,967
but when exactly will I have Rubicon back?

305
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,726
Hacking isn't as easy as waving your hand.

306
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,120
Ah. Point taken.

307
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,925
So, you and Felicity Smoak.
I just don't see it.

308
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,001
She used to be a lot different.

309
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,488
All clear. Looks like
we bought ourselves a few minutes.

310
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,325
John, this place is enormous.
I don't know how we're going to find Thea.

311
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,484
Just have to make sure
that the Ghosts don't find us.

312
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,685
So much for clear.

313
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,641
We're not going to hurt you.

314
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,490
Then what are the weapons for?

315
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,371
There's a woman
being held against her will.

316
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,965
We're just here to bring her home.

317
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,363
<i>Citizens of Tevat Noah,
I have disturbing news.</i>

318
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,722
<i>We are under attack
from a man in a green hood</i>

319
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,245
<i>and another in a black helmet.</i>

320
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,162
<i>Do not let them disrupt Genesis.</i>

321
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,204
<i>These individuals
are not only an affront to our home,</i>

322
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,648
<i>but to our future
and the futures of our children.</i>

323
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,564
<i>Find them and kill them.</i>

324
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,881
Oh, no.

325
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,048
It's okay, Oliver.

326
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,328
I know what to do now.

327
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,802
I finally understand
what Reiter was after.

328
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,211
Taiana, Reiter was insane.

329
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,441
TAIANAI Why?

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,770
He said after his village was destroyed,
he would never be powerless again.

331
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,129
I have a village, too, Krasnoyarsk,

332
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,601
run by a government strongman named Kovar.

333
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,887
Taiana...

334
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,407
Now I know
why fate has led me to this place.

335
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,006
To give me the strength to free my home.

336
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,128
Okay. All right.

337
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,564
You'll go back to Russia,
and you can take on this Kovar.

338
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,122
But right now there are people here
that need our help.

339
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,049
What would Vlad want you to do?

340
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,689
What would your brother expect you to do?

341
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,561
Find these hostiles at once.

342
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,128
Nothing can be permitted
to stand in the way of Genesis.

343
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,281
Thank you.

344
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,288
I'm not sure murdering vigilantes is
what your loyal supporters signed up for.

345
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,764
Well, you better hope that
they don't find Mr. Queen and Mr. Diggle

346
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,961
before you do, Malcolm,

347
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,330
or I'll be forced to seriously question
what your purpose here is.

348
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,046
Every time I knock down a firewall,
five more pop back up.

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,646
It would seem that Mr. Darhk
has a counter-hacker in his employ.

350
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,484
- And he's good.
- Yeah.

351
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,404
Okay. I might have something.

352
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,848
Now, until the FBI gets their way,
smartphones are protected by encryption.

353
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,321
If you don't enter your passcode
after enough times,

354
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,209
then the device bricks itself, right?

355
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,931
Curtis, I don't even have the time
to tell you that I don't have the time.

356
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,445
You just did. But here's the point.

357
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,290
Instead of trying
to break Rubicon's encryption...

358
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,527
We make it stop working
in the first place.

359
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,967
You're suggesting
as it is with a smartphone...

360
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,043
We overload Rubicon
with too many access requests.

361
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,321
And it shuts itself down.

362
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,289
Unfortunately, I doubt very much
that A.R.G.U.S.

363
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,490
would leave Rubicon so vulnerable
to such a brute force attack.

364
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,846
Let them try.

365
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,680
You're always such a stick in the mud.

366
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,846
Yes!

367
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,485
Let's all take hacking advice

368
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,361
from a woman whose only use
for her smartphone is as a mirror.

369
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,646
So funny. Not.

370
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,370
Felicity may have
gotten her brains from you,

371
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,490
but she got her creativity from moi.

372
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,410
Matching lipstick
to lip liner isn't creativity.

373
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,364
And, while I may
not be father of the year...

374
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,891
Oh, try the past two decades.

375
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,169
I recently took a bullet for our daughter.
Not metaphorically, either.

376
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,005
- By the way, a metaphor, it's a...
- Oh, I know what a metaphor means,

377
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,049
just like I know
what abandoning your family looks like.

378
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,249
Really? Because I remember
not having much of a choice in the matter.

379
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,211
<i>- Uh... Felicity?
- Hello, Felicity.</i>

380
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
- Remember me?
- Cooper.

381
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,240
<i>Your system is now under my control,</i>

382
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,926
<i>just like Rubicon will be
in the next five minutes.</i>

383
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,764
<i>Once again, you lose.</i>

384
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,730
<i>- O'n, flak.
- Oh, flak.</i>

385
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,763
Who is this guy, again?

386
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,163
Cooper Seldon, her ex-boyfriend.
How could I forget?

387
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,129
I thought he was dead,
and he just came back evil.

388
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,964
Oliver, Dr. Palmer, this guy.

389
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,043
You really have
a complicated romantic history.

390
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,326
Not the best time, Curtis.

391
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,481
Be honest, Felicity, hacker to hacker.

392
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,961
You prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be?

393
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,281
Once more unto the breach.

394
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,930
Is he seriously going
full Star Trek VI on you?

395
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,360
He shut our system down with a virus.

396
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,966
- It's an X-axis binumeric algorithm.
- I know.

397
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,930
I created it in college. Wait.
How did you know?

398
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,320
Just because I wasn't in your life

399
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,801
doesn't mean
I wasn't keeping tabs on my daughter.

400
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,769
He's sending electrical surges
to all our previous lPs!

401
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,846
Whatever it is, it's working.

402
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,331
It is, but it's pinging back
to his location.

403
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,521
You thinking what I'm thinking?

404
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,330
We hitch our own code onto the back trace.

405
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,641
Curtis, your Rubicon lockout...

406
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,370
How long
till you can get me an executable?

407
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,807
- Uh... Twenty seconds.
- Great.

408
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,211
If this works, it will send the latest
surge back to its point of origin,

409
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,646
triggering Rubicon to lock itself out.

410
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,644
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Just get the son of a bitch.

411
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,364
Locked and loaded.

412
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,561
Got you.

413
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,570
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

414
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,566
To be or not to be...

415
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,247
Did it work?

416
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,521
- I think it worked.
- It worked.

417
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,842
Well, the power's still on.
That's... That's good, right?

418
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,726
Rubicon's offline.

419
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,683
He's going to need more
than some third-rate hacker

420
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,844
to get it back up again,
all because of you, sweetheart.

421
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,121
Thanks, Dad.

422
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,521
Mom?

423
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,171
Streets are filled.

424
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,005
Ruvé's mobilized the entire ark
looking for us.

425
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,565
They're in here!

426
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,927
Quiet.

427
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,321
You can't win. You can't stop Genesis.

428
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,370
What are you going to do when you're
not here to enjoy your brave new world?

429
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,521
Spartan.

430
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,486
Easy.

431
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,765
He almost got us killed.

432
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,088
They're like Thea.
They're not in their right minds.

433
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,480
<i>"MAN". You mean the pills?</i>

434
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,689
We haven't taken any. Not even one.

435
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,241
<i>None of us have.</i>

436
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,969
We're here because we believe.

437
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,411
Because we know
the world is evil and darkness.

438
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,011
It's beyond saving.

439
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,601
How can you believe that?

440
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,606
Because we've lived it. Every day.

441
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,525
So many promises
were made to save the city.

442
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,211
But it all just fell apart,
and we were the ones left in the rubble.

443
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,924
Damien Darhk has given us hope.

444
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,047
Can you, with your masks and your guns,
actually say the same?

445
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,686
There's a plane due east.
Stay here. We'll hold off Reiter's men.

446
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,808
Taiana, help me with this guy. He's alive.

447
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,486
Hey. He's alive. Help me with him.

448
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,051
He's too bad.

449
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,248
He'll only slow us.
Keep us from helping the others.

450
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,084
We're not just going to leave him here.

451
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,480
You're right.

452
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,322
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?
- His death is inevitable.

453
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,801
Why waste his life
when it can make me stronger?

454
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,804
What are you doing with my clothes?

455
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,001
When I get stressed, I... I like to fold.

456
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,361
Yeah.

457
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,364
I know. When you two were married,
it was like living at the Gap.

458
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,121
Hey, what did Noah mean when he said

459
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,123
that he didn't have much choice
in the matter when he left?

460
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,206
I always just assumed he disappeared.

461
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,847
He didn't disappear, hon.

462
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,881
I did.

463
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,361
We did.

464
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,042
I had a 7-year-old daughter,
and I know all about gambling,

465
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,731
and I wasn't willing to take the bet
that your father could possibly change.

466
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,327
You let me believe that he abandoned us.

467
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,521
Well, I don't...

468
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,685
I don't know
what to say about that, hon.

469
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,444
I mean, I think...

470
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,044
I think he just didn't
want you to lose your mom, too.

471
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,484
Hey, look at me.

472
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,445
I didn't lose you.

473
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,366
Did I?

474
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,287
Never.

475
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,924
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,326
I love you.

477
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,288
Do you ever think
that maybe Darhk has a point?

478
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,722
No, Darhk is psychotic.
Everyone down here is.

479
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,206
Are they?

480
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,286
He's not wrong.

481
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,447
The world is coming apart
just like Star City.

482
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,171
I mean, it is worse than it has ever been.

483
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,641
That's because Darhk's been
spending the past year trying to kill it.

484
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,486
Then why is he giving these people
more hope than we ever could?

485
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,804
Go! Go to the bedroom! Take cover!
Go! Move, move, move!

486
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,206
I'll hold them off. Go find Thea. Go, now!

487
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,161
Thea.

488
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,770
This isn't you, Thea.

489
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,604
They are trying to control you.

490
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,001
But you are stronger than that.
You can fight through it.

491
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,404
L...

492
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,081
can't.

493
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,606
Yes, you can!

494
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,362
Every day, we stand side by side
to protect this city,

495
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,966
and no matter how dark or how hopeless,

496
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,766
you always keep fighting,
you never give up!

497
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,691
I refuse to believe
that you're going to give up now.

498
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,925
So, fighfl

499
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,002
Drug me again,
and I will kill you, you son of a bitch.

500
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,571
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

501
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,880
<i>Uncle Lonnie here.</i>

502
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,931
<i>See, I just absolutely adore
your little community.</i>

503
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,242
<i>It's so welcoming to outsiders.</i>

504
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,449
<i>But it's so structured.</i>

505
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,722
<i>Going to have to fix that.</i>

506
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,171
<i>Mr. Darhk, remember me?</i>

507
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,449
<i>The loyal servant you rejected, betrayed?</i>

508
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,127
In 20 minutes, I'm going to kill someone.

509
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,687
It can be your wife...

510
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,130
Oh, but, Damien, you're my first choice.

511
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,125
<i>Ball's in your court, buddy.</i>

512
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,009
<i>Oh, and be quick about it,</i>

513
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,288
<i>because in 21 minutes,</i>

514
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,288
<i>I'm going to blow your little
underground world into next week.</i>

515
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,721
<i>Okay?</i>

516
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,481
So, Machin is down here?

517
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,688
An ongoing pest we've yet to exterminate.

518
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,604
Yeah, he killed Alex, who brought me here

519
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,809
because Ruvé drugged him,
just like you did to me.

520
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,122
We can discuss
my parenting philosophy later.

521
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,084
Mr. Machin is the immediate threat.

522
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,321
To Darhk and his wife,

523
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,005
and I still don't understand
why we should care.

524
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,965
Because he has already tried once
to kill everyone down here.

525
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,366
<i>Malcolm's right.</i>

526
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,000
We're not letting anyone else die.

527
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,566
This place isn't safe.

528
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,849
I need you to get your family out of here
in order to protect them.

529
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,001
Please.

530
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,968
Now, you know the way out.

531
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,724
So, if we can't stop Machin,

532
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,689
then you are going to lead the evacuation.

533
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,730
I don't recall volunteering.

534
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,682
And even if I did,

535
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,207
where exactly would I evacuate them to?

536
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,403
Everything above our heads
is going to be under a mushroom cloud.

537
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,449
I refuse to believe that.

538
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,490
Because you're a fool.

539
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,600
Because I have hope.

540
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,047
Let's go.

541
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,526
Taiana...

542
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,484
lam not just going to
let you kill this man.

543
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,364
I'm the only one who can stop Reiter.

544
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,760
This is how.

545
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,649
I need that man's power.

546
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,643
Listen to yourself. This isn't you.

547
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,167
Whatever that idol is doing,
it is warping your mind!

548
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,607
No. I've never been clearer.

549
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,046
Now, get out of my way!

550
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,561
No, don't!

551
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,243
Déja vu all over again.

552
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,723
You as the bait,
me waiting to kill your husband.

553
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,647
You know, I really hope
I get it right this time.

554
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,325
You have no idea
the power that you're up against.

555
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,286
Look at you.

556
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,761
No longer the whimpering victim.

557
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,844
Mommy's so strong and impressive.

558
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,441
Isn't she?

559
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,807
You do realize
that you're planning to destroy

560
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,851
the last safe place
left on the entire planet, right?

561
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,290
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,251
Did I leave you with the impression
that I was a rational guy?

563
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,010
That's my mommy.

564
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,366
Isn't she pretty?

565
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,965
Oh, and she brought her friends.

566
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,121
This is over.

567
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,321
<i>More like under.</i>

568
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,290
I tinkered with the engineering here.

569
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,922
This whole place
is powered by a dwarf star alloy.

570
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,128
Very powerful, but a little touchy.

571
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,009
So you might want to
be careful where you aim

572
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,970
because a stray shot
could blow this whole place.

573
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,851
- We're not letting you out of here.
- Oh.

574
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,281
Well, in that case...

575
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,002
Unless you want to die, let's go! Go!

576
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,525
Let's go!

577
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,366
Bye, Mommy.

578
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,728
I got you. Come on. Come on.

579
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,725
There's no time.

580
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,684
Save my daughter.

581
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,606
Please.

582
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,845
Promise me.

583
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,081
I promise.

584
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,720
We need to get out of here,
like, right now.

585
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,044
Finally, Electric Boogaloo awakes.

586
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,771
Sir, there's something
happening at Tevat Noah.

587
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,488
Well, it looks like the real estate value
of the Glades just went up.

588
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,488
It is called gallows humor.

589
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,250
What about everybody else?

590
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,802
I saw Merlyn leading some evacuations.
There must be other access points.

591
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,485
Or Malcolm's underneath all that.

592
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,085
What about her?

593
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,846
Is anyone there?

594
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,126
Green Arrow, Spartan, Speedy?

595
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,685
Hell, I'd take Malcolm Merlyn
at this point.

596
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,970
We're all safe.

597
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,161
Where are you with Rubicon?

598
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,725
HIVE is locked out. We're good.

599
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,810
The city is safe...

600
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,167
You sound like
there's a "but" to that sentence.

601
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,688
People still need saving.

602
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,720
They still need hope.

603
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,685
Give it back!

604
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,686
Taiana, if you want it back,
you're going to have to kill me.

605
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,046
And I'm betting you won't.

606
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,770
And what about me, Mr. Queen?

607
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,927
And after killing you,

608
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,366
I'll kill her.

609
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,651
Tell me.

610
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,562
It was Machin. He's...

611
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,370
Ruvé?

612
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,651
I'm sorry.

613
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,004
My daughter?

614
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,725
We're still getting reports of survivors.

615
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,370
We're locked out of Rubicon.

616
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,561
Momentarily.

617
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,047
I know someone who can get us back online.

618
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,531
Damien...

619
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,047
Tevat Noah is gone.
It's buried under miles of ash.

620
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,046
Even if you could
regain control of Rubicon,

621
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,050
there'd be no place on Earth that is safe.

622
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,609
If there's no place left on Earth
that's safe,

623
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,321
let it all burn.

624
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,681
All right, I'm listening.

625
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,001
Though, if you could
keep the lecture short...

626
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,810
- No lecture.
- I'd appreciate it.

627
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,208
- Just a request.
- Uh-huh.

628
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,249
Leave, and this time,

629
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,086
don't come back.

630
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,771
- What?
- You helped Felicity tonight.

631
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,490
Maybe it was because you'd be nuked, too.

632
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,449
Maybe it was a broken clock
being right for once.

633
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,285
Either way, we both know it wasn't you.

634
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,769
- Dee...
- You know who you are.

635
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,522
Are you really going to stand here

636
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,409
and tell me that you've changed?

637
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,770
You're every bit as dangerous
to our daughter

638
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,604
as the day I took her from you.

639
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,409
If you care about her,

640
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,121
you will walk away.

641
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,771
After everything that's happened,
she'll be crushed.

642
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,480
She'll survive.

643
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,961
She's strong. She's my daughter.

644
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,289
You can lie to her,
but can you lie to yourself?

645
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,008
Can you really believe
that leaving isn't the best thing for her?

646
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,530
<i>What do you think
your parents are talking about?</i>

647
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,330
I'm trying not to think about it.

648
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,404
Maybe they're discussing that thing
that Noah said before

649
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,403
about not having much of a choice.

650
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,005
That's exactly what
I'm trying not to think about.

651
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,128
- Felicity, I helped you save the world.
- Mmm-hmm?

652
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,964
The least you can do
is give me a little gossip.

653
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,690
Okay, fine.

654
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,047
So, apparently...

655
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,366
My dad didn't leave.
My mom kicked him out.

656
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,170
Did she tell you why?

657
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,001
I think she didn't want
to risk him hurting me.

658
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,924
I mean, he could promise
whatever he wanted,

659
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,004
but he was a criminal, is a criminal.

660
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,201
So he inevitably would have
gone back to his old habits.

661
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,361
Mmm-hmm.

662
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,201
What does that mean?

663
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,964
It just sounds familiar, that's all.

664
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,126
The criminal
who you don't think can change,

665
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,887
the slightly overactive
but understandable breakup.

666
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,487
Just saying.

667
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,051
You and Oliver,

668
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,327
Donna and Noah.

669
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,367
Where is Noah?

670
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,090
He's going away for a little while.

671
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,210
That's what you told me when I was seven.

672
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,290
Boo-hoo!

673
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,965
Are you getting all weepy?

674
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,161
Do you need a moment?

675
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,086
No? Good.

676
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,725
'Cause I need you to do me a favor.

677
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,526
Go to hell.

678
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,771
Why bother?

679
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,088
I'm going to bring it to us.

680
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,281
