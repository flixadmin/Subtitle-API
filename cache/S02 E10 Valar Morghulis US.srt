1
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,061
Pod.

2
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,314
Pod!

3
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,027
Find Bronn or Varys.

4
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,531
Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.

5
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,161
-Tell them I am very much alive.
-Yes, My Lord.

6
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,332
Would you like something for the pain?

7
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,502
What happened?

8
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:55,341
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon
suffered a stunning defeat

9
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,010
at the hands of your father.

10
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,597
Where am I?

11
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,600
These are your new chambers.

12
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,563
A little cramped, perhaps,
but you don't need much room, do you?

13
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,483
You are no longer Hand of the King.

14
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,077
For your trouble.

15
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,064
I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon,
first of my name,

16
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,901
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

17
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,280
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the Realm,

18
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,867
do hereby proclaim my grandfather,
Tywin Lannister,

19
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,663
the Savior of the City
and the Hand of the King.

20
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,344
Thank you, Your Grace.

21
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,648
Lord Petyr Baelish. Step forward.

22
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,028
For your good service and ingenuity

23
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,197
in uniting the Houses of Lannister
and Tyrell,

24
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,659
I declare that you shall be granted
the castle of Harrenhal

25
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,120
with all its attendant lands and incomes.

26
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,749
To be held by your sons and grandsons
from this day until the end of time.

27
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,252
You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.

28
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,882
I shall have to acquire some sons
and grandsons.

29
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,555
Ser Loras Tyrell.

30
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,857
Your House has come to our aid.
The whole realm is in your debt,

31
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,983
none more so than I.

32
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:22,238
If your family would ask anything of me,
ask it and it shall be yours.

33
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,073
Your Grace.

34
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,745
My sister, Margaery,
her husband was taken from us before.

35
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,498
She remains innocent.

36
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,210
I would ask you to find it in your heart
to do us the great honor…

37
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
of joining our Houses.

38
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,341
Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

39
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,305
With all my heart, Your Grace.

40
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,683
I have come to love you from afar.

41
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,938
Tales of your courage and wisdom
have never been far from my ears.

42
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,735
And those tales have taken root
deep inside of me.

43
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,910
I, too, have heard tales of your beauty
and grace. But…

44
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,830
the tales do not do you justice, My Lady.

45
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,834
It would be an honor to return your love.

46
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,213
But I am promised to another.

47
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,633
A King must keep his word.

48
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,595
Your Grace, in the judgment
of your small council,

49
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,973
it would be neither proper nor wise
for you to wed the daughter

50
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,892
of a man beheaded for treason,

51
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:38,064
a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
against the throne as we speak.

52
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,610
For the good of the realm,
your councilors beg you...

53
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,865
to set Sansa Stark aside.

54
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,169
I would like to heed your wishes
and the wishes of my people.

55
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,381
But I took a holy vow.

56
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:09,428
Your Grace, the Gods do indeed
hold betrothal solemn,

57
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,808
but your father, blessed be his memory,

58
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:20,064
made this pact before the Starks
revealed their falseness.

59
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,570
I have consulted with the High Septon
and he assures me

60
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:30,867
that their crimes against the realm
free you from any promise

61
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,454
you have made to them,
in the sight of the Gods.

62
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,960
The Gods are good.
I am free to heed my heart.

63
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,047
Ser Loras, I will gladly
wed your sweet sister.

64
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,842
You will be my queen.

65
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,181
And I will love you
from this day until my last day.

66
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,163
My lady.

67
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,541
My sincerest condolences.

68
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,212
They're right.
I'm not good enough for him.

69
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,506
You shouldn't say that.
You'll be good enough for many things.

70
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,134
He'll still enjoy beating you.

71
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,803
And now that you're a woman...

72
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,015
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

73
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,978
-But if he's not marrying me--
-He'll let you go home?

74
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,150
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

75
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,986
You have a tender heart...

76
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,700
just like your mother did at your age.
I can see so much of her in you.

77
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,703
She was like a sister to me.

78
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,626
For her sake, I'll help get you home.

79
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,298
King's Landing is my home now.

80
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,010
Look around you.

81
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,680
We're all liars here...

82
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,809
and every one of us is better than you.

83
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,780
Come in.

84
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,659
Make yourself comfortable.

85
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,500
That doesn't look very comfortable.

86
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,337
Here. Watch me.

87
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,511
-No need for that, my dear.
-Are you sure?

88
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,849
-Most men like what they see.
-I'm not like most men.

89
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,726
That's what most men say.

90
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,604
But if you don't want what most men want,

91
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,107
you'll have to tell me
what you'd like me to do.

92
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,612
I'd like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish

93
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,364
has been all you'd hoped it would be.

94
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,701
Have we met?

95
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,287
You wouldn't remember me if we had?

96
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,249
-I meet a lot of men.
-And I think you remember them all.

97
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,295
I think your true talents are wasted
on them.

98
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,339
You're very kind, My Lord.

99
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,300
Allow me to return the favor.

100
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,600
You're afraid.

101
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,811
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

102
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,523
-I know who you are.
-And?

103
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,153
Unlike your current employer,
I protect those who work for me.

104
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,784
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims.
Or force them to abuse each other.

105
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,411
How did you know about that?

106
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,331
I thought you said you knew who I was.

107
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,377
What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

108
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,936
Littlefinger looks at you
and sees a collection of profitable holes.

109
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,730
I see a potential partner.

110
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,568
-I'm afraid of him.
-Oh, you should be.

111
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,405
He's a dangerous man.

112
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,825
But everyone has their weaknesses.

113
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,787
Your current employer hides his very well.

114
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,790
But not as well as he thinks.

115
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,881
-You're a virgin, I take it?
-Walk.

116
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
Childhood must have been awful for you.

117
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:06,475
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?
They laughed at you, called you names.

118
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,103
Some boys like a challenge.

119
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,898
One or two must have tried
to get inside Big Brienne.

120
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,066
One or two tried.

121
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,445
And you fought them off.

122
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,449
Maybe you wished one of them
could overpower you,

123
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,578
fling you down, tear off your clothes,
but none of them were strong enough.

124
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,538
I'm strong enough.

125
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,874
-Not interested.
-Of course, you are.

126
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,084
You'd love to know what it feels like
to be a woman.

127
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,883
They lay with lions.

128
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,220
Tavern girls, I'd say.
Probably served my father's soldiers.

129
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,849
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss
and a feel.

130
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,851
That's how they earned this.

131
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,772
The glorious work
of northern freedom fighters.

132
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,066
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

133
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,528
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

134
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,781
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

135
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,830
-What are you doing?
-Burying them.

136
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,249
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

137
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,712
-I think these women would understand--
-I don't care what you think.

138
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,674
Untie me. Now.

139
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,552
I gave it to you to cut the rope,
and now I don't have my dagger no more.

140
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,138
Unless it got stuck in your arse
on its way to your cunt,

141
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,432
it stands to reason that it's-- Hey!

142
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,979
-What's your business here?
-Travelling a prisoner.

143
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,193
-You're a woman?
-A woman.

144
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,070
Fuck me!

145
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,948
If you're quite finished, I--

146
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,787
-All right, we'll be going.
-Whoa! Whoa!

147
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,082
Who do you fight for?

148
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,125
The Starks.

149
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,337
What'd he do?

150
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,301
-Apparently, eating is now a crime.
-No, stealing is a crime.

151
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,637
But it's not a crime to starve,
that's justice for you.

152
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,889
-Where you taking him?
-To Riverrun.

153
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,182
Why Riverrun?

154
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,686
You steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

155
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,896
-Why not kill him?
-For stealing a pig?

156
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,775
I don't give the orders.
He must be important to someone.

157
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,735
Sending him with you,
how important could he be?

158
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,075
All right. Have it your way. Milady.

159
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,998
-Do I know you?
-Have you been to Ashemark?

160
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,584
-No.
-Then you don't know me.

161
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,628
You ever go to the river market
at Salt Rock?

162
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,463
Is it near Ashemark?

163
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,091
-No.
-Then I've never been there.

164
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,552
What you think of these beauties?

165
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,222
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

166
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,308
Two of them we did, yeah.

167
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,478
Wait!

168
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,150
I do know you.

169
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,861
That's Jaime Lannister!

170
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,281
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

171
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,783
If this were the Kingslayer,
think I'd know about it.

172
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,368
How would you know
what the Kingslayer looks like?

173
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,621
I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.

174
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,749
They dragged him out the woods
and threw him down before the King.

175
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,001
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

176
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,211
If he was,
I'd only be travelling his head.

177
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,921
I have a question for you both.

178
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,549
I want you to answer it at the same time.

179
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,760
I count to three, you both answer.

180
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,012
What's his name?

181
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,306
One.

182
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,350
Two.

183
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,851
Three.

184
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,451
Two quick deaths.

185
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,272
Those were Stark men.

186
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,650
I don't serve the Starks.

187
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,569
I serve Lady Catelyn.

188
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,074
I told her I'd take you to King's Landing.
And that's what I'm going to do.

189
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,744
Stay.

190
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,807
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

191
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,310
-I know that.
-And you mean to do it anyway.

192
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,733
I love her.

193
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,696
-I know that seems important to you.
-It is important to me.

194
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,367
Your father didn't love me
when he married me.

195
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,079
He hardly knew me, or I him.

196
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,751
Love didn't just happen to us.

197
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,337
We built it slowly, over the years,

198
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,839
stone by stone.

199
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,926
For you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.

200
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,848
It's not as exciting as secret passion
in the woods.

201
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,395
But it's stronger. It lasts longer.

202
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,484
And that's what would be in store for me
with one of Walder Frey's daughters.

203
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,861
-What you and father had?
-Why not?

204
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,240
Because she's not beautiful?
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

205
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,452
Now you're arguing just to argue.
Because you arranged it.

206
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,037
And you agreed to it!

207
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,415
You gave him your word.

208
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,169
Treat your oaths recklessly
and your people will do the same.

209
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,463
If your father lived his life

210
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,089
-for one thing--
-My father is dead.

211
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,844
And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.

212
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,784
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

213
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,577
I did.

214
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,372
-I still see it.
-The flames lied.

215
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,169
And I'm no better than a savage,
trusting in a Fire God.

216
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,508
I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.

217
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,053
I led my men
to the gates of the seventh hell...

218
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,348
as their brothers burned alive.
And for what?

219
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,602
Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister
and the Tyrells?

220
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,938
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

221
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,900
-The Lord of Light only allows me--
-You claim to speak for a God.

222
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,570
Will you quit the war
just because you've lost a battle?

223
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,280
You talk about war
as if you understand it.

224
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,449
-I've been fighting far longer than you.
-Have you?

225
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,035
Show me how you fight.

226
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,040
Show me.

227
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,215
Where is your God now?

228
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,260
Will he save you?

229
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,805
Where is your God?

230
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,893
Inside you.

231
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,779
I murdered my brother.

232
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,748
We murdered him.

233
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,877
-Share the weight with me.
-It wasn't your brother.

234
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,387
This war has just begun.
It will last for years.

235
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,390
Thousands will die at your command.

236
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,227
You will betray the men serving you.

237
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,397
You will betray your family.

238
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,652
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

239
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,155
And it will all be worth it...

240
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:47,412
because you are the Son of Fire.
You are the Warrior of Light.

241
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,085
You will sweep aside this pretender
and that one.

242
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,338
You will be king.

243
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,177
You promise these things, but…

244
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,681
you don't know.

245
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,433
None of us know.

246
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,769
Let me show you.

247
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,865
Look into the fire, My King. Look.

248
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,453
-I see fire.
-Keep looking.

249
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,130
Do you see?

250
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,591
Do you see, My King?

251
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,029
Yes.

252
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,791
I will kill that man.

253
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,379
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

254
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,298
how many spears they run through me,

255
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,301
I will kill that horn-blowing cunt
before I fall.

256
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,970
They want you to know you're surrounded.

257
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,640
I know I'm surrounded. I know that,

258
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,977
because I stood on the battlements
and saw that I was surrounded.

259
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,898
They don't want you to sleep.
They want to sap your spirit before they--

260
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,150
Thank you, wise bald man.

261
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,613
Thank you for explaining siege tactics
to me.

262
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,910
No word from my father.

263
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,371
No.

264
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,916
Send more ravens.

265
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,544
You killed all the ravens.

266
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,801
The first time I saw Winterfell.

267
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,683
First time I saw Winterfell…

268
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,104
it looked like something
that had been here

269
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,396
for thousands of years...

270
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,776
and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.

271
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,696
I saw it and I thought…

272
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,744
of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.

273
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,373
We never stood a chance
against the man who lives here.

274
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,251
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

275
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:43,505
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.

276
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,719
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me of that.

277
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,392
You know what it's like to be told
how lucky you are

278
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,768
to be someone's prisoner?

279
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,606
To be told how much you owe them?

280
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,154
And then to go back home
to your real father.

281
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,870
I will kill that man,
I swear to the Drowned God,

282
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,496
the old Gods, the new Gods,

283
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,124
to every fucking God
in every fucking heaven,

284
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,835
-I will kill that man.
-Theon, Listen to me.

285
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,172
I serve Winterfell...

286
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,674
and now Winterfell is yours...

287
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,677
I'm bound by oath to serve you.

288
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,722
And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

289
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,432
Run.

290
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,270
Five hundred Northmen wait outside
the walls. You have 20 men.

291
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,397
You can't win.

292
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,984
-Wait for nightfall and run.
-There's nowhere to run.

293
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,987
I'll never make it back
to the Iron Islands.

294
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,366
And even if I did, even if by some miracle
I slipped through the lines

295
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,203
and made it home, I'd be a coward.

296
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,080
The Greyjoy who ran.

297
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,959
The shame of the family.

298
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,755
Don't go home.

299
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,091
Join the Night's Watch.

300
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,512
Once a man has taken the black...

301
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,100
he is beyond the reach of the law.

302
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,979
All his past crimes are forgiven.

303
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,775
I won't make it to the Wall.

304
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,695
I won't make it ten feet
past the Winterfell gates.

305
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,113
There are ways...

306
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,743
hidden passageways, built so the lords
of Winterfell could escape.

307
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,205
The road will be dangerous...

308
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,584
but with a little luck--

309
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,509
The Night's Watch is an ancient,
honorable order.

310
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,054
You'll have opportunities there.

311
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,726
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

312
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,480
The opportunity to make amends
for what you've done.

313
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,901
I've done a lot, haven't I?

314
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,155
Things I never imagined myself doing.

315
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,412
I have known you for many years,
Theon Greyjoy.

316
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,750
You're not the man
you're pretending to be.

317
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,796
Not yet.

318
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,343
You may be right.

319
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,474
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

320
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,485
You hear that?

321
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,614
That's the mating call of the Northmen.

322
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,284
They want to fuck us.

323
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,122
I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
I'm ready for one.

324
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,210
They say every Ironborn man is worth
a dozen from the mainland.

325
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,340
-You think they're right?
-Aye.

326
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,677
We die today, brothers.

327
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,140
We die bleeding from a hundred wounds,

328
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,769
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts.

329
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,898
But our war cries will echo
through eternity.

330
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,860
They will sing
about the Battle of Winterfell

331
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,821
until the Iron Islands have slip
beneath the waves.

332
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,115
Every man, woman and child

333
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,243
will know who we were
and how long we stood.

334
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:48,500
Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen,
Stygg and Black Lorren.

335
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,420
Ironborn warriors will cry out our names

336
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,091
as they leap onto the shores of Seagard
and Faircastle.

337
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,217
Aye!

338
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,177
Mothers will name their sons for us!

339
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,303
Aye!

340
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,680
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

341
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,681
Aye!

342
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,477
And whoever kills that fucking
horn blower will stand in bronze

343
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,396
above the shores of Pyke!

344
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,563
Aye!

345
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,607
What is dead may never die!

346
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,150
What is dead may never die!

347
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,407
Thought he'd never shut up.

348
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,494
It was a good speech.
Didn't want to interrupt.

349
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,126
What is this? What are you doing?

350
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:38,883
Let's go home.

351
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,692
-Why should I believe you?
-Why would I lie about it?

352
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,486
To create strife between my sister and me.

353
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,822
Where before there was nothing but love.

354
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,452
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you
on your sister's orders.

355
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,581
If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
you'd be a dead man.

356
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,294
-Pod.
-Yes, My Lord.

357
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:20,091
Would it be excessive of me to ask you
to save my life twice in a week?

358
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,928
-No, My Lord.
-You're a good lad.

359
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,558
Get Bronn. Tell him I want four
of his most loyal gold cloaks

360
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,059
outside my door at all times.

361
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,897
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved
of his command of the City Watch.

362
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,983
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly

363
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,652
in the hands of your father.
Or your sister.

364
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,489
It varies from cloak to cloak.

365
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,617
-Then my hill tribesmen.
-Have gone home.

366
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,828
Your father paid them quite handsomely.

367
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,878
I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other
for some time, my lord.

368
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,632
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

369
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,220
-And I thought we were friends.
-We are.

370
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,097
Podrick, would you mind?

371
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:29,327
There are many who know that without you,
this city faced certain defeat.

372
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,124
The King won't give you any honors.
The histories won't mention you.

373
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,294
But we will not forget.

374
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,549
Come along now, Podrick.

375
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,471
My love.

376
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,893
-It was good of you to come.
-Good of me? Of course, I come!

377
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,817
-I want to see you.
-Believe me, you don't.

378
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,486
Have you looked?

379
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,781
I will be the first.

380
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,640
Well?

381
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,435
You're a mess.

382
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,356
I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.

383
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,401
-You should charge me double.
-You think I am here for money?

384
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:48,156
That's the arrangement we made.
I pay you, and you lie to me.

385
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,619
I'm a poor little rich man
and nobody loves me,

386
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,787
so I make jokes all the time
and pay them to laugh!

387
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,539
Fuck your money.

388
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,293
-Let's leave.
-Leave?

389
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,463
Leave King's Landing.
They tried to kill you, they'll try again.

390
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,425
Going into wars, fighting soldiers?
You're terrible at this.

391
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,638
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

392
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,141
-You don't belong here.
-What would we do in Pentos?

393
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,518
Eat. Drink.

394
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,812
Fuck. Live.

395
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,862
-I want to go with you.
-So do it!

396
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,783
Your father, your sister,
all these bad people. They can't stop you.

397
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,285
Forget about them. Come with me.

398
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,623
I can't.

399
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,626
I do belong here.

400
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,798
These bad people are what I'm good at.

401
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,385
Outtalking them, outthinking them,
this is what I am.

402
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,097
And I like it.

403
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,810
I like it more
than anything I've ever done.

404
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,525
Are you going to leave?

405
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,616
You have a shit memory.

406
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,372
I am yours. And you are mine.

407
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:37,640
In the sight of the Seven,
I hereby seal these two souls...

408
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,645
binding them as one for eternity.

409
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,276
Look upon one another…

410
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,653
and say the words.

411
00:33:55,199 --> 00:34:01,873
Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

412
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:08,296
I am hers and she is mine from this day
until the end of my days.

413
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,574
Is this a riddle?

414
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,534
Khaleesi!

415
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,120
Khaleesi!

416
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,047
You trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

417
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,052
You want me? Here I am.
You're afraid of a little girl?

418
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,329
How did he find us?

419
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,565
-What are you doing here?
-Waiting for you.

420
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,692
How did you know we'd come this way?

421
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,488
After all you've seen,
this is your question?

422
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,990
How did you kill those guards?

423
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,576
Was it hard?

424
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,454
No harder than taking a new name.

425
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,498
-If you know the way.
-Show me how.

426
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,209
I want to be able to do it too.

427
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,877
If you would learn, you must come with me.

428
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,587
Where?

429
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,382
Far and away, across the Narrow Sea.
To Braavos.

430
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,176
My dancing master was from Braavos.

431
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,888
To be a dancing master is a special thing.
But…

432
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,809
to be a Faceless Man,
that is something else entirely.

433
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,773
The girl has many names on her lips.
Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,

434
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,650
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

435
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,319
Names to offer up to the Red God.

436
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,072
She could offer them all…

437
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,449
one by one.

438
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,203
I want to...

439
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,374
but I can't.

440
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,961
I need to find my brother and mother.

441
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,339
And my sister.

442
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,676
I need to find her, too.

443
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,054
Then we must part.

444
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,142
.
A man has duties as well. Here.

445
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:32,935
What is it?

446
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,187
A coin of great value.

447
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,399
Could it buy a horse?

448
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,402
It is not meant for the buying of horses.

449
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,529
Then what good is it?

450
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,323
If the day comes
when you must find me again,

451
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,744
just give that coin to any man
from Braavos and say these words to him...

452
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,871
Valar Morghulis.

453
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,373
Valar Morghulis.

454
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,254
Please, don't go, Jaqen.

455
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,468
Jaqen is dead.

456
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,971
Say it again, Valar Morghulis.

457
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,015
Valar Morghulis.

458
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,976
Good.

459
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,860
Farewell, Arya Stark.

460
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,679
Osha. What are you doing?

461
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,224
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

462
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,977
-We'll make you better
-I feel just fine.

463
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,067
They burned it down.
They burned everything.

464
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,695
Not everything. Not you.

465
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,075
They may come back. You have to go.

466
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,038
Put on your warmest clothes,
pack as much food as you can carry,

467
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,789
-and go north.
-North's the wrong way...

468
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,709
and mother and brother are south.

469
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,379
We don't know where.
There are too many enemies to the south.

470
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,382
Go to the Wall, to Jon.

471
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,135
He'll look after you
and let your mother know you're safe.

472
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,095
I don't want to leave you.

473
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,265
No more than I want to leave you.

474
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,435
I pulled you into the world...

475
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,021
both of you.

476
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,608
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

477
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,110
And for that, I consider myself very...

478
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,488
very lucky.

479
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,824
Go now, with Hodor.

480
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,786
Go on. I'll be right here.

481
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,254
Osha.

482
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,592
You must protect them.
You're the only one who can.

483
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,348
You may have to protect them
against your own kind.

484
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,892
I got no great love for my own kind.

485
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,189
I'll get you milk of the poppy.

486
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,859
-Tell me where to find it.
-I don't want milk of the poppy.

487
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,414
Do it quickly.

488
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,062
Until the sun rises in the west
and sets in the east.

489
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,524
Until the rivers run dry

490
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,778
and the mountains blow in the wind
like leaves.

491
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,571
They missed their mother.

492
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,535
They want to be with you.
Do you want to be with them?

493
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,120
You will be.

494
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,375
When your dragons were born,
our magic was born again.

495
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,794
It is strongest in their presence.

496
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,213
And they are strongest in yours.

497
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,425
You will be with them,

498
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,805
through winter and summer
and winter again.

499
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,185
Across a thousand, thousand seasons
you will be with them.

500
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,856
And we will be with you.
Until time comes to an end.

501
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,656
Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.

502
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,410
This is not my home.
My home is across the sea

503
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,495
where my people are waiting for me.

504
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,706
They will be waiting a long time.

505
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,933
Drakharys.

506
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,567
We should be there by sundown.

507
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,322
Won't be a fun night for you.
Mance knows how to make crows sing.

508
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,161
If you know what to say,
you might just make it through the night.

509
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,084
Not talking's not the way to go.

510
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,547
Careful with that.
You might hurt yourself.

511
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,384
You've never swung a sword before,
have you?

512
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,094
You look like a baby with a rattle.

513
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,136
Enough of that!

514
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,899
-Stop!
-Why, traitor?

515
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,736
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

516
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,154
Let them fight.

517
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:02,554
That's it? That's what you couldn't do,
you little shit?

518
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,895
Your traitor father teach you that?

519
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,817
Or was it your whore mother?

520
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,380
We are the watchers on the Wall.

521
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,020
You can tell Mance...

522
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,899
that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.

523
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,456
Burn the body.

524
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,376
You don't want this one coming back
for you.

525
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,141
Come along, Jon Snow.

526
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,962
Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

527
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,977
Khaleesi, please.

528
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,063
He told me you'd never leave Qarth alive--

529
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,064
Come.

530
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:31,971
Nothing.

531
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:43,066
Thank you, Xaro Xoan Daxos.

532
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,819
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

533
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,742
I am the King of Qarth.
I can help you now. Truly help you.

534
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,121
We can take the Iron Throne.
I'll bring you 1,000 ships.

535
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,540
-Please, Khaleesi, I beg you. Please.
-All that you have dreamed

536
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,960
-is within your reach!
-I beg you, please!

537
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,503
-Please!
-Khaleesi.

538
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,923
-Please!
-Khaleesi!

539
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,278
It's all a lie.

540
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,364
Looks real enough to me.

541
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,912
Real enough to buy a ship.

542
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,458
Aye, a small ship.

543
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,422
I thought we were coming north
to fight wildlings.

544
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,135
Is this goat?

545
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,512
Moose.

546
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,808
People shouldn't live where you need
to burn shit to keep warm.

547
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,479
Well, if you see a tree, let me know.

548
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,858
If you step back and think about it,

549
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:51,736
the thing about Gilly
that's so interesting is--

550
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,780
-Bloody kill me.
-Not truely.

551
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,450
The thing about her
that I find so interesting is,

552
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:59,410
after all that Craster's done to her,

553
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,330
she still got hope
that her life might get better.

554
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,875
The thing about Gilly that you find
so interesting

555
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,211
is that she said six words to you.

556
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,631
The thing about you
that I find so interesting

557
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,341
is absolutely nothing.

558
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,931
It's Jon and the Halfhand! They're back.

559
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,479
Two blasts is wildlings.

560
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,564
-You're not fighting alone.
-Come on.

561
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:34,946
Three blasts?

562
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,156
Run!

563
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,999
Wait! Wait for me!

564
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,628
Grenn!

565
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,256
Edd!
