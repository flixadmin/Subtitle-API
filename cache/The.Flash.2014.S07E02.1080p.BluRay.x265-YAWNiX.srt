1
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:09,427
<i>He was the most
brilliant mind I ever met.</i>

2
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,682
<i>They all were.</i>

3
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,727
<i>Whatever the problem,
you could...</i>

4
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,522
<i>count on a Wells...</i>

5
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:25,276
<i>a council of them to have the answers.</i>

6
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,821
<i>Now...</i>

7
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,157
<i>they're all gone.</i>

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,209
We gotta find the answers ourselves.

9
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,314
Why does it always feel like
for us to win,

10
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,191
some of us have to lose?

11
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:14,325
This wall is nano-engraved
with the names of everyone we've lost.

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,288
So that no matter
how the timeline changes...

13
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:22,166
they'll never be forgotten.

14
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,718
Those Wells...

15
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:36,264
they took some getting used to,
didn't they?

16
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:40,435
If we learned anything from them,

17
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:44,981
it was that our greatest weapon
against darkness

18
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,692
isn't our superpowers.

19
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,989
It's our humanity.

20
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,910
And our love for each other.

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Barr?

22
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,346
Barr... I know what you're doing.

23
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,808
Don't blame yourself.

24
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:24,854
What you just said...

25
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,524
Ramsey infecting me,

26
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,986
Eva using a copy of Iris
to manipulate my emotions...

27
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,617
Lately, it feels like my heart
is my enemy's greatest weapon.

28
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,495
Have faith, son.

29
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,666
We will get Iris back.

30
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,129
I feel that in my heart.

31
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,383
What the...

32
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,374
This is supposed to open a portal
to the Mirrorverse?

33
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,710
Yeah. Supposed to.

34
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,881
I thought I could use Atlantean tech
to tackle perpetual motion,

35
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,716
one of science's greatest problems.

36
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,385
But guess what I found waiting for me?

37
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:26,142
More problems. This thing's a dud.

38
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,608
I don't know what to do.

39
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,611
I lost my friend...

40
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,741
my girlfriend is trapped
in another dimension...

41
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,619
and nothing my brain comes up with

42
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,996
seems to get me any closer
to saving her.

43
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,915
I promise you, we will get them back.

44
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,669
Kamilla, Iris, Singh. All of 'em.

45
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,091
Yeah.

46
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,221
Okay.

47
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,057
Refocusing.

48
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:11,145
So, Chester's away at Grandma Runk's,
but lucky for us,

49
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,481
he's been scienceing
in between bingo rounds

50
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,942
and he seems to think
there are two problems

51
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,486
we need to solve
if we wanna open our portal.

52
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,112
Problem number one.

53
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,120
You haven't found the method
to reconfigure the molecular stability

54
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,665
of the dimensional barrier
that damages organic matter?

55
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,753
Yeah, that's right.
How did you know that?

56
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:37,922
I saw you write it.

57
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,799
No, you didn't.

58
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,677
I thought I did.

59
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,554
I was about to.

60
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,476
But you guessed right.

61
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,771
Eva used Ramsey's blood
to tackle that problem,

62
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,231
and open her portal.

63
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,066
Unfortunately, for us,
without a replacement

64
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,819
for Ramsey's evil sentient goo,
we're kind of up a creek.

65
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,238
So that brings us to problem number two.

66
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,244
Quantum entanglement from reversed
Higgs boson particles

67
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,745
disrupts the geo-spatial algorithm,

68
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,123
preventing us from locating people
in the Mirrorverse.

69
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,849
Meaning, we have to know Kamilla, Singh,

70
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,711
and Iris' location
in order to pull them out.

71
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,466
You freaky.

72
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,717
I know where they'll be.

73
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,307
Iris sent a message to Kamilla
and Singh in the Mirrorverse,

74
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,350
telling them to meet
in the Speed Lab tonight.

75
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,853
Don't ask me how I got it
'cause I have no idea.

76
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,272
Iris's neural pathways have likely
achieved an equilibrium

77
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,749
with the harmonic frequency contained

78
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,650
within the fractalized
dimensional plane.

79
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,658
He freaky.

80
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,638
Our mission's going
better than expected.

81
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,557
Hoshi and Ultraviolet's raids
on Black Hole stash houses

82
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,281
have liberated crates
of your mirror-tech.

83
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,354
Good.

84
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,606
Rawlins, do you notice anything...

85
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,776
different about me?

86
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,277
Sorry?

87
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,822
Do you see anything out of place?

88
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,541
Yeah. Now, that you mention it.

89
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,794
You look tired.

90
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,382
Your desk is a mess
and you skipped your coffee today.

91
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,425
You got me.

92
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,053
But there is something...

93
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,515
familiar.

94
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,726
That look in your eyes.

95
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,730
It's how Carver looked
when he kept secrets from us.

96
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,901
I'm nothing like Joseph.
I will never lie to you.

97
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,237
I promise.

98
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,826
Good. Because we've located
our next stash house.

99
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,744
Want me to gather the Assassins Three?

100
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,162
No.

101
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,849
It's been a while since I've enjoyed
the pleasure of tearing down

102
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,750
my husband's empire, so...

103
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,295
I will handle this one myself.

104
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,009
So, he's what, a genius now?

105
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,179
No, I'm a genius.
My guy's on a whole other level.

106
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,932
His neurons are firing at super-speed,

107
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,685
synaptic connections are off the charts.

108
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,896
The quantum computers can't
even keep up processing his results!

109
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,315
The Artificial Speed Force.

110
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,277
The Artificial Frackin' Speed Force.

111
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,505
It didn't just give you
your old powers back,

112
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,739
it gave you a new one.

113
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:53,159
Enhanced cognition by way
of a Speed Force booster shot!

114
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,659
Huh?

115
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:56,746
Barry can think fast, now.

116
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,124
Cool. How fast?

117
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,127
Let's find out, shall we?

118
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,089
Lady and gentleman, this...

119
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,761
is a Quantum Ball. Trademark pending.

120
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,263
Ever heard of it? Of course you haven't.
But you will.

121
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,349
Mark my words, one day, Quantum Ball,
trademark pending,

122
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,977
will be the world's
next great sporting event.

123
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:23,481
You see, this little sphere
amplifies kinetic energy,

124
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:28,486
firing in directions that can only be
described as... unpredictable.

125
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,487
But not for you.

126
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,490
Your enhanced cognition should let you

127
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,201
analyze every variable,
in every scenario.

128
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,662
And predict the unpredictable.

129
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,290
Barry Allen.

130
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,459
Places, please.

131
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:53,718
Call it.

132
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,807
Eh... no cheating. Turn around.

133
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,108
Ready.

134
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,237
Wall, lamp,

135
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,990
pipe, conduit... Duck. Now!

136
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,253
I have super-speed thinking.

137
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,924
I know how to open a portal
to the Mirrorverse.

138
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:40,349
- Uh... what?
- Yeah, repeat that.

139
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,725
For Allegra.

140
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,145
All right. I'm sorry. I'm...

141
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:46,689
Let me show you.

142
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,527
Ramsey's unique cells
created a polar-covalent bond

143
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,279
with the molecules
in Eva's mirror portal.

144
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,780
That's why she needed his blood.

145
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,325
Right. It formed like
a bio-friendly skin

146
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,719
on the inter-dimensional barrier.

147
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,343
So, we need Ramsey's blood.
We knew that.

148
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,580
No, we don't need it.

149
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,143
His blood would have bonded
with the electro-negative particles

150
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,001
and become dark matter photons.

151
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,670
Those particles wouldn't just stay
on the mirror portal.

152
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,548
No, they wouldn't.
They'd attach themselves to Eva.

153
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,800
Those photons are still on her.

154
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,469
If we could collect them,
we could open our portal.

155
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,640
But it would take years to develop
a prototype that could do that.

156
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,579
Not if we integrate the neural net
in The Thinker's chair,

157
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,898
synched to a nanite bridge, fed into the
Tachyon Enhancer's non-reductive loop.

158
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,067
No. But wait, wouldn't...

159
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,737
Well...

160
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,657
Yeah... I guess that could work.

161
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,367
But isn't Eva still holed up

162
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,804
behind McCulloch Tech's force field?
We'll never get close to her.

163
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,308
You're gonna bring out another board.

164
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:49,001
Factoring in geographical
analytics, concealment probability,

165
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,462
these are the remaining
Black Hole stash houses.

166
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,798
There's a 97.6% chance
Eva's hitting this one next.

167
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,096
Right, so...

168
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,433
that's where we go,
and that's what we do.

169
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,187
Just wish I could
have seen it earlier.

170
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,523
This isn't on you.

171
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,149
We wouldn't be in this mess

172
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,402
if I had seen through
Iris' mirror duplicate sooner.

173
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,073
Eva's not the first to use my emotions
against me.

174
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,980
Let's make sure she's the last.

175
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,084
- Kamilla.
- Iris.

176
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,710
Thank God.

177
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,315
When you disappeared, I thought
that neural dissonance sickness got you.

178
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,019
Yeah, well,
she tried to use it against me,

179
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,425
but I was able to fight her off.

180
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,928
I think
I've been in this place for so long,

181
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,554
that I've gained control over it.

182
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,198
I think that's how I was able to send
you and Singh that message.

183
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,392
That's amazing.

184
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,645
What about Singh?
Did you find him at the hospital?

185
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,313
I looked everywhere, but...

186
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,440
Iris, what if we never find him?

187
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,484
What if we never escape?

188
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,194
What if we stay here so long,

189
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,838
that our minds just get
completely destroyed...

190
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,949
Kamilla, we've been through
our fair share of danger.

191
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,704
So, no matter what dimension we're in,
no matter what kind of villain we face,

192
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,623
there is nothing that can stop us
as long as we stick together.

193
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,169
- Are you with me?
- Let's do this.

194
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,671
Good.

195
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,340
Because I'm thinking
if my message got to you,

196
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,024
then it could have gotten to Singh, too.

197
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,052
So let's go find him. Come on.

198
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,062
That doesn't belong to you.

199
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,108
Then again, it never belonged
to my husband, either.

200
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,194
It was my reflective chip technology

201
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,865
that was twisted to create that weapon.
So, it's mine...

202
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:47,161
to wield or destroy. Now, step aside.

203
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,456
Go! Go!

204
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,464
You were right.
Eva's here, and she's amped.

205
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,384
How do you like
your phantom now, Joseph?

206
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,512
Not the day for us
to be short-staffed.

207
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,512
Actually, we're good.

208
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,223
I called in a little bit
of extra muscle.

209
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,778
S'up?

210
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,446
Nice outfit, by the way.

211
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,615
Why are you here?

212
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,242
You know, for funsies.

213
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,705
Looks like
someone's back to a 100%.

214
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,874
Long live the Snow Queen.

215
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,292
Eva's faster than me.

216
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,346
Frost is gonna distract her,
while I run by with the Tachyon Enhancer

217
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,739
and collect the particles we need.

218
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,925
We might only get one shot at this.
Let's make it count.

219
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,949
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

220
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,866
Frost!

221
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,006
Barry, help her!

222
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,271
Frost.

223
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,276
Frost.

224
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,949
You let her get hit.

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,960
Whatever Eva hit Frost with,
it's light-based.

226
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,577
Her healing's trying to compensate,
but it's not enough.

227
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,300
I can't fix this without Caitlin.

228
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,931
- What is that?
- A cure.

229
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,056
Has it been tested?

230
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,519
I ran 2,371 tests in my head.
We're good.

231
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,604
Barry, that is not...
What are you doing?

232
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,909
What happened?

233
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,829
You took the brunt of
Eva's laser blast to help us.

234
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,456
I just returned the favor

235
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,875
with a cryogenically fortified
paracetamol cocktail.

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,253
That fortified my cellular walls.
Yep. That'll do it.

237
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,356
Of course you wouldn't have had to
take the brunt of the blast

238
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,508
if Barry hadn't let you get hit
in the first place.

239
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,010
- Cisco, let me explain.
- Barry...

240
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,181
What were you thinking? I saw you. I...

241
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,974
You had the time
to run her out of the way,

242
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,810
and you just stood there
like you wanted her to get hit.

243
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,605
There was a.0002% chance

244
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,483
of the Tachyon Enhancer getting damaged
in that scenario.

245
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,566
I couldn't risk that.

246
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,986
I also knew I could reverse
any ill effects

247
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,780
Frost received from Eva's blast.

248
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,449
These aren't ill effects!
This was a light wound.

249
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,802
Like the kind that almost killed her.
And we just got her back!

250
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,495
Cisco, it's okay.

251
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,456
I'm fine, and now,
we have a chance to save our friends.

252
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,874
I'd take a hit for that any day.

253
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,301
You got lucky with that cocktail.

254
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,136
Luck had nothing to do with it.

255
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,100
So... super-speed thinking, huh?
What's that like?

256
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,437
Sometimes, it's like a barrage
of images flying at me.

257
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:46,191
Others, it's like a scene
playing out in my head.

258
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,860
So...

259
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,780
what is your speed-brain say
our next move is?

260
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,866
You saw Iris' message. Eva's watching.

261
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,035
She would no doubt
see our attempt to open a portal

262
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,163
to the Mirrorverse and stop us.
I need to find a solution.

263
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,000
You should recuperate for 14.2 minutes.

264
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,382
Then help Cisco gather
all our McCulloch intel,

265
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,379
so I can cross-reference it
with our Eva data.

266
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,047
I need to aggregate.

267
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,013
Huh.

268
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:21,643
Well, Barry seems like
he has things in hand and then some.

269
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,856
Yep. He'll probably have this Eva sitch
wrapped up in no time.

270
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,862
You're thinking about Nash.

271
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,364
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,200
Honey, it's just my empathic abilities,

273
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,202
they take on
a mind of their own, sometimes.

274
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,331
It's okay. It's just...

275
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,211
My dad left me before I could walk.

276
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,880
And ever since then,

277
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,215
anyone's who's even
come close to being...

278
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,925
A father figure?

279
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,219
Yeah, I...

280
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:02,059
I cut them out of my life
before they could cut me out of theirs.

281
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,394
That's why I pushed Nash away.

282
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,482
Anyway, I should just get over it.
He's gone.

283
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,567
Only if you let him be.

284
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,948
Did you know that the law goes
way back in my family?

285
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:22,245
Yeah, my granddad was the first
Black paralegal in Oklahoma,

286
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,580
and my mom,

287
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,000
first female independent counsel
in the State of Texas.

288
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:32,506
Both of them were pioneers
for social justice, and my heroes.

289
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,716
- I'll say.
- Yeah.

290
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,595
Right now, my granddad's file cabinet

291
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,597
is in the corner of my office.

292
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:46,103
And I carry my mom's briefcase
into court with me every single day.

293
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,940
Honey, the people that we love,

294
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,944
they're only gone
when we stop carrying them with us.

295
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,781
How you choose to carry Nash
is up to you.

296
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,833
I figured out her secret.

297
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,752
This isn't her world. It never has been.

298
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,676
Thank you, Arielle.
I'm glad to to be here.

299
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,638
- I'm lucky to be anywhere.
- Indeed.

300
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,139
Let's jump right into it.

301
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,475
You came here today,
to make an announcement.

302
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,017
Yes.

303
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,646
Before I was kidnapped,

304
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,483
I was developing technologies
with promise to advance the world.

305
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:38,655
Fresh water. Healthier crops.
Clean renewable energy.

306
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:42,200
I am thrilled to finally return
to my life's work.

307
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,870
<i>Improving our world.</i>

308
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,204
Why are we watching this?

309
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,249
At the stash house,
Eva referred to herself as a phantom.

310
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,127
It reminded me of Carver's
dying words when Eva killed him,

311
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,045
that she wasn't his wife.

312
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,423
I've analyzed behavioral patterns,
body language,

313
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,883
even graphological handwriting.

314
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,762
That... is not Eva McCulloch.

315
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,723
What? What do you mean?

316
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,976
She's sitting right there,
talking to Rachel Maddow 2.0.

317
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,437
I slept in the same bed
with a mirror duplicate of Iris

318
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,022
without knowing the difference.

319
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,940
You did the same with Kamilla.

320
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,194
So, you think this is a mirror Eva?

321
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,488
McCulloch security database
will show us.

322
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,450
Yeah, good luck.
I tried hacking them a week ago.

323
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,162
What? How?

324
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,666
McCulloch's black box servers
run a hybrid theorem-proving system

325
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,959
with model-checking.

326
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,257
His mind is getting faster.

327
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,259
Yes, it is.

328
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,266
Did she just die?

329
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,519
- Oh, my God.
<i>- No.</i>

330
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,604
<i>Help!</i>

331
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,482
<i>Someone help me!</i>

332
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,945
Which brings us to why
you're here today.

333
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,989
Precisely. Allow me to present

334
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,618
McCulloch Technologies' future
for humanity.

335
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,807
Whoa, what you doing with that footage?

336
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:11,873
Exposing the truth.

337
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,549
<i>Eva?</i>

338
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:26,555
<i>No. No, please stay with me.</i>

339
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,868
I don't think that's such a good idea.

340
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,603
<i>Help!</i>

341
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,522
No! Stop that... Stop!

342
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,024
No! Stop!

343
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,026
No! Stop!

344
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,864
I'm so sorry.

345
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,824
- I'm sorry.
- That footage we saw,

346
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,994
does it show you killing
the real Eva McCulloch?

347
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,705
No, of course I wouldn't do that.

348
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,707
- I didn't do that.
- What are you?

349
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,166
A meta?

350
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,252
- A shapeshifter?
- No. I...

351
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,546
The world wants answers.
We deserve to know.

352
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,588
Rawlins!

353
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,259
If you're not Eva McCulloch,
who or what are you?

354
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,219
I'm not a monster.

355
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,347
I'm not a monster!

356
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,772
Why did you do that?

357
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:23,194
Eva would sense us opening a portal.
Now, she is too distracted to notice.

358
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,989
And there couldn't be
another way to distract her?

359
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,659
There were 141 ways.
This was the most efficient.

360
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,703
Uh, I'm not sure emotionally wrecking

361
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,039
an already whacked out villain
was "efficient."

362
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,458
Historically speaking,
when our enemies are upset,

363
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,919
which is exactly what I accomplished,
they make mistakes.

364
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:42,088
We need to prep the portal machine
while Eva's on her heels,

365
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,215
and then retrieve our targets.

366
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,385
You mean our friends.

367
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,556
One and the same.

368
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,812
- Cisco...
- I know.

369
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,359
Something's seriously wrong with Barry.

370
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,826
Greetings, Barry Allen.

371
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,746
Your biological signals
indicated state of distress.

372
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,916
- May assist you?
- I needed a second opinion, Gideon.

373
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,420
I just ran the necessary calculations
to operate Cisco's portal device.

374
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,423
The results have me concerned.

375
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,051
Analyzing
temporal-spatial data.

376
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:33,223
Estimated time to complete
quantum computations, 18.4 hours.

377
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,225
Invert the Feynman shortcut and apply it

378
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:39,020
to one-half mass times velocity squared,
compensating for tachyon decay.

379
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,861
Thank you
for a more efficient method.

380
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,068
Calculations complete.

381
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,619
I was correct.

382
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,540
We cannot save all of them.
We have to choose.

383
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,196
Would you like me to inform
the rest of the team?

384
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,005
<i>What do you mean
we have to choose?</i>

385
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,299
Simply put, the longer
the person is in the Mirrorverse,

386
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,219
the more dark matter photons
are required to pull them out.

387
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,014
Kamilla and Singh
have been trapped for less time,

388
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,016
therefore, they can be
retrieved together.

389
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,350
With Iris...

390
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,146
It would take everything
we have to retrieve her.

391
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,815
There's got to be another way.

392
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,154
Barry? What's your speed-brain tell you?

393
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:34,993
We have to choose.
Kamilla and Singh. Or Iris.

394
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,120
It is the only way.

395
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,874
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

396
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,545
- I guess... we vote.
- On this?

397
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,964
I don't know. Dude,
do you know another way to be fair?

398
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,011
This is beyond screwed up.

399
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:57,974
But if this is the only way...

400
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,062
who thinks we should save Iris?

401
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,988
And Kamilla and Singh?

402
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,669
Sorry, Barry.
Got to go with the numbers.

403
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,151
Are you all right, Barry Allen?

404
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,180
You appear to be distracted.

405
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,391
I just ran a simulation
to see how this will play out.

406
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,892
Would you like me to inform

407
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,561
the rest of the team
of this development?

408
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,813
No.

409
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,940
This is something I must do alone.

410
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,150
Are you sure, that's the best...

411
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,172
What is all this stuff?

412
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,591
I have no idea.

413
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,222
Iris, help me, please.

414
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,348
David.

415
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,479
David, can you hear me?

416
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,982
Is this Neural Dissonance?

417
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,608
No, but it's similar.

418
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,987
It's a side effect of being sent
to the Mirrorverse by the Mirror Gun,

419
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,782
instead of Eva pulling
Singh through her office mirror.

420
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,534
How do you know that?

421
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,329
I don't know, I just do.

422
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:47,250
Iris, I was shot, too, with...

423
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:53,882
Kamilla!

424
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:08,688
Hey.

425
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,064
Talk for a sec?

426
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,818
Of course.

427
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:15,903
What's with the suit?

428
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,489
We're about to open
a portal to the Mirrorverse.

429
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:19,657
One must be prepared.

430
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,077
Right. About that...

431
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,413
I looked over the schematics,

432
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:29,250
and I think there might be something
wrong with the Artificial Speed Force.

433
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,422
You remember how Thawne
used negative emotion

434
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,925
to stabilize his Speed Force machine?

435
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,386
Well, since we didn't want
to make the same mistake,

436
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,723
we used an inert substance,
an argon-xenon hybrid

437
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,976
that would generate
no emotional fallout.

438
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,979
But I think that was a mistake.

439
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,900
Yes, the ASF gave you...

440
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,153
increased cognitive function...

441
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,865
a thousand times over, but...

442
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,079
it's done the exact opposite
to your emotional response.

443
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,412
I'm better this way.

444
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,792
The team is safer this way.

445
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,384
Look, man...

446
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:23,179
I know you think your heart
has been used against you...

447
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,224
but it's not a weakness.

448
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,812
It's what makes you human.
I mean, without it...

449
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,780
Why's the portal target set to Iris?

450
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,160
What about saving the others?

451
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,455
We do not have enough dark matter
photons to save all three of them.

452
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,591
So, instead of consulting your team...

453
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:02,719
you just decided on your own.

454
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,971
I've already seen
the outcome of this debate.

455
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,224
You eventually vote to save
Kamilla and Singh...

456
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:12,395
Like hell, I would never vote
on something like that.

457
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,315
If you would come to me, I would have
told you we'll find another way.

458
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,607
That's what we always do.

459
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,444
Your emotions are making you irrational.

460
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:22,280
And your lack of them
are making you wrong!

461
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,088
You cannot predict
what I would have done

462
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,326
because you cannot predict emotion!

463
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,793
Barry... I know you.

464
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:39,964
I know your heart and I know that
you're doing this because you miss Iris.

465
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:41,924
My feelings are irrelevant.

466
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,093
Iris has knowledge of Eva,

467
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,054
which could give us
a tactical advantage.

468
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:49,015
Therefore, Iris is
the logical choice to liberate.

469
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:54,854
The fact is, Singh and Kamilla
are expendable.

470
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,371
Expendable?

471
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,551
Don't ever call her expendable.

472
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,900
We're gonna give you
back your heart, Barry.

473
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,403
And it's gonna be by choice.

474
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,241
Or by force.

475
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,003
Don't make us do this, Barry.

476
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,889
Iris would agree with me.

477
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,767
No, she wouldn't.

478
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,487
You've just been hit
with Velocity-Zero charge.

479
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,906
It temporarily dampens your speed.

480
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,697
You're not the only one
who could predict reactions.

481
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,529
Your defeat is inevitable.

482
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,949
Velocity X in your system
is nearly depleted.

483
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,077
Your time as a speedster
is coming to an end.

484
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:02,124
Maybe... but I'm not only a speedster.

485
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:26,899
The Babel Protocols aren't just
force fields and tech. It's us.

486
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,777
- Sorry for the tough love.
- But we need the real you back.

487
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:31,861
Don't worry.

488
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,840
We're going to shut off
the Artificial Speed Force

489
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,944
and get your head straight.

490
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,376
You lost this fight
before it even began.

491
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,338
Look out!

492
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,724
Hang on, guys. I'm gonna get you
to the Med Lab, and we'll get you some...

493
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,071
Barry.

494
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,574
Oh, my God.

495
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,328
Please tell me this isn't a trick.

496
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:04,914
Your message to Kamilla and Singh
led us here.

497
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,736
I'm ready to bring you home now.

498
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,960
Okay. Um...

499
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,463
I just want to get Singh
and Kamilla through first.

500
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,733
They're in pretty bad shape
and they're gonna need some help...

501
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:15,966
Not them, just you.

502
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,220
We cannot bring you all back.

503
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,723
You have been there longer.
You have more knowledge of Eva.

504
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,309
Therefore retrieving you
is the logical choice.

505
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,510
Did you hear what I just said?

506
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,606
Barry, they could die.
They need you to save them.

507
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:37,530
This is not the outcome I predicted.

508
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,655
What?

509
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,450
You need to come through. Now.

510
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,466
Iris... Stop.

511
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:00,928
Your resistance
is de-stabilizing the portal's energy.

512
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,303
That is dangerous.

513
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:05,308
Barry, this isn't you!
This isn't right!

514
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:55,941
Iris?

515
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,902
Iris?

516
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:01,697
Hey, hey, hey, Iris.

517
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,660
I didn't see this.

518
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,957
No, no, no...

519
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:16,462
No, no, no, no.

520
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,680
No!

521
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,980
Iris.

522
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,639
This isn't my world.

523
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:13,936
This isn't my world.
This isn't my world.

524
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,480
This isn't my world...

525
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,469
But it can be.

526
00:39:58,147 --> 00:39:59,440
Good night, Hawkshaw.

527
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,109
- Tell Gwen thanks for the brownies.
- I will.

528
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,522
You see, they're not coming to save you.

529
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,484
They're coming to save me.

530
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:51,508
