1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,256
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash,
Arrow <i>and</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,768
Since we learned of them,
we've been calling them the Dominators.

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,021
- You can't do this alone.
- I don't plan to.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,681
BARRY: <i>Guys, thanks for coming.</i>

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,100
This is Kara Danvers, Supergirl.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,820
I went back in time
to change the timeline.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,108
It's called Flashpoint
and now things here are different

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,618
- than before I left.
- You just erased

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,450
a daughter from my life?

10
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,114
He took it upon himself
to change the timeline.

11
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,161
And because of it my brother was killed.

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,326
There's no amount of feeling bad

13
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,790
that could ever make up for that.

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,372
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>I'm having memories of a stranger,</i>

15
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,337
<i>but she's not really a stranger.</i>

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,295
What if when you interacted
with your younger self in 1987, you...

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,713
Inadvertently changed my past.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,847
You're back.

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,849
Oh, it's so good to see you.
I love you, Dad.

20
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,854
Call Lyla, tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,151
Maybe they chose us because
we couldn't fight back.

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,311
DR. HEYWOOD:
<i>Because none of you are meta-humans.</i>

23
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,650
RAY: <i>What is their plan?</i>

24
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:09,328
GIDEON: <i>The phrase loosely translates to
"We are nearing completion of the weapon. "</i>

25
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,205
I can't believe that you guys escaped
an alien spaceship.

26
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,460
Key words, "Alien spaceship."

27
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,337
- I have questions.
- They can wait.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,794
- Thanks for helping me get my sister home.
- Yeah, man.

29
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,337
What's our status?

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,843
Nothing since the Dominators

31
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,675
paid their little visit
to mess with our heads.

32
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,759
- Why would they do that?
- What if they were trying

33
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,516
to pit us against each other
in order to gain intel about meta-humans?

34
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,677
Man, I wish they would just send
us an IM with a questionnaire.

35
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,596
Metas pose the biggest threat
to their invasion.

36
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,764
It would make sense
they'd wanna get to know their enemies.

37
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,023
By kidnapping people.

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,061
Perhaps they were searching your minds
for potential meta-human vulnerabilities.

39
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,192
I think it's time we return the favor.

40
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,023
What do you wanna do?
Kidnap one of them now?

41
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,284
Ever since we fought off that one ship,
they've kind of been in short supply.

42
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,866
Actually, I know where to find one.

43
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,865
I've been reviewing old army footage

44
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,410
of their first encounters
with the Dominators.

45
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,754
And I think I've pegged the fight to...

46
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,876
Redmond, Oregon, 1951.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,392
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>You're suggesting we travel to 1951,</i>

48
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,231
<i>abduct a Dominator and interrogate it</i>

49
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,111
to determine their intentions.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,197
They kidnapped us.

51
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
Seems fair.

52
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,321
- Time travel. I'm definitely in.
- Okay, hold on there.

53
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,581
Professor Stein and Caitlin
have been talking about a way

54
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,740
<i>to take down the Dominators.</i>

55
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,580
<i>- They could probably use your help.</i>
- Pass.

56
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,827
Yeah, I mean, I'm with him.

57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,712
Mostly because
I don't wanna lose my geek cred,

58
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,872
but time travel...

59
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,416
I could take Amaya and Mick.

60
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,336
- Do it.
- Okay.

61
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,632
Yes!

62
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,969
And, uh, the new president called,

63
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,179
which would be cool
under different circumstances.

64
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,639
But she wants to meet with us.

65
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,270
Let's bring Ray and Sara as backup.

66
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,930
What about me? I can do backup.

67
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,232
Let me talk to you for a second.

68
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,565
I don't know.

69
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,071
I would like to minimize
your involvement in this.

70
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,111
Why? Because I'm an alien?

71
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,824
I also happen to be your biggest weapon.

72
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,206
You are an unknown quantity
and this is not personal.

73
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,242
Except that's exactly how this feels.

74
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,912
Kara, when I started living this life,
it was just me.

75
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,002
I was going up against human threats.
That I could handle.

76
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,041
Then it was meta-humans,
and I can handle that.

77
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,461
Now, I learned
that there are multiple arsenals

78
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,174
brainwashed aboard an alien spacecraft.

79
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,135
I'm sure that was unnerving.

80
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,516
I don't get unnerved.

81
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,847
But when I go up against something new,
I push back.

82
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,609
Right or wrong,
it is who I am and it is what I do.

83
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,772
So, I am asking for a little bit of space
because I have to draw the line somewhere.

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,784
<i>I need to claw back a sense of normalcy.</i>

85
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,161
Please stay here.

86
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,300
This ship is everything.

87
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,885
What type of propulsion system
does it use?

88
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,799
- No idea.
- Oh, my God, that construct on the bow

89
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,263
looks like it could be
some sort of Time Sphere.

90
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,803
- Yeah, no idea.
- To operate a ship of this size,

91
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,312
the deep-link nets would have to be...

92
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,394
Oh, my God, you'd have to use,
like, a quantum neural chipset...

93
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,934
Hey, guys, guys. Amaya and Rory
are waiting for us on the bridge.

94
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,319
Can we just keep moving this along?

95
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,446
- This ship is...
- Automatic.

96
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,948
- Supersonic.
- Hypnotic.

97
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,949
- Funky fresh.
- Funky fresh.

98
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,155
CAITLIN: Professor?

99
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,495
It's highly unlikely
we can fashion a weapon

100
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,625
with sufficient force
to overcome the Dominators.

101
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,083
I was thinking the exact same thing,
which is why I invited...

102
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,498
So, what if instead

103
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,213
we try to attack them
with something infinitesimally small.

104
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,345
I'm sure you're familiar with the story
of the lion with the thorn in his paw?

105
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,724
You used to love telling me that story
when I was a kid.

106
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,019
Oh. Hello.

107
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,683
The lion with the thorn in his paw
is a parable.

108
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:09,477
A story about a big, ferocious creature
that is felled by something small.

109
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,987
So, what do you need help with?

110
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,022
I'm afraid it's classified.

111
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,445
Oh, juicy.

112
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,532
Some sort of secret
government space weapon, no doubt.

113
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,279
Something like that.

114
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,416
Only this sort of work
is slightly out of my wheelhouse.

115
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,669
Yeah, if only you knew someone
with a PhD in nanotechnology.

116
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,916
Unfortunately, Raymond's busy
working on other things.

117
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,504
I was talking about me.

118
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,965
Did the six years I spent at MIT
magically slip your mind?

119
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,723
Of course not.

120
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,887
Good. Okay, let's get to work.

121
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,406
We made it. This is the '50s.

122
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,570
Oh, sick.

123
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,158
Severe time jumps can cause nausea,
temporary deafness...

124
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,832
Linguistic disorientation.

125
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,457
You, clean it up.

126
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,592
We're gonna kidnap an alien.

127
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,845
Okay, I know I did not just
travel through time

128
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,005
so we could stay on the ship.

129
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,807
Ponytail, you're staying on the ship.

130
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,562
I'll take that as
"Have fun storming the castle."

131
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,358
Oh, for real? You're gonna use
<i>Princess Bride</i> against me?

132
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,735
Against me?

133
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,441
Okay, I got you, girl.

134
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,117
Celebrating July 4th early?

135
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,619
Ray made it for me.

136
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,745
You look like a star-spangled idiot.

137
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,158
We need to find the Army.

138
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,083
I think we found them.

139
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,974
What are we waiting for?
Let's grab an alien and get out of here.

140
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,320
Just waiting for one of the weaker ones
in the herd.

141
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,157
I don't think there are any weak ones.

142
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,037
Oh.

143
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,661
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

144
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,292
It's a real-life Spielberg movie.

145
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
And we're stuck in here.

146
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,421
Okay.

147
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,874
I think I know
what's really bothering you.

148
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,588
I'm having the worst case of FOMO

149
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,753
while everyone else is out there
kidnapping an alien?

150
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,046
No.

151
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,639
I think you escaped 2016
to get away from Barry.

152
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,470
Mmm-mmm. Excuse me,

153
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,934
I escaped 2016
so that I could come see the Waverider.

154
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,182
And so that I could time travel.

155
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,360
- And?
- And...

156
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,317
Also, yes,
I wanted to get away from Barry.

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,608
Ha! You realize that's insane, right?

158
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,026
You're holding a grudge
against your best friend

159
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,785
when the world
is potentially going to end.

160
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,538
I'm sorry, "my best friend"?
He only killed my brother.

161
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,199
- He didn't kill...
- Okay, you're right,

162
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,457
he didn't literally kill my brother.

163
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,334
What I mean to say is, he was responsible.

164
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,712
<i>Okay, he just needed to save his family,</i>

165
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,293
and in doing that,
he ended up destroying mine.

166
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,604
You know, all this
time traveling, fighting aliens...

167
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,980
This is stuff I used to dream about
as a kid.

168
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,266
Heh. Yeah, me, too.

169
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,064
It doesn't feel like a dream.

170
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,697
- No.
- Just feels weird.

171
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:47,077
Well, exactly,
and it's only gonna get weirder.

172
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,239
So, that's why we have to be able
to rely on our friends.

173
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,705
I really wish I could right now, Felicity.

174
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,912
But he's not my friend.

175
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,392
- They're taking off.
- I don't get it.

176
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,024
Why are the Dominators attacking us,
then just leaving?

177
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,732
It's an RIF mission.
Reconnaissance-In-Force.

178
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,316
Ah, look.

179
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,648
<i>A straggler.</i>

180
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,411
We need him alive, Mick.

181
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,371
I'm just gonna rough him up a little.

182
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,003
Hey!

183
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,502
Squeal, you pig.

184
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,516
Hey, Dad?

185
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,269
- Dad?
- What?

186
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,025
- Um, I'm sorry.
- Can you hand me those induction clamps?

187
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,273
Yes.

188
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,577
This reminds me of that time
we stayed up all night

189
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,037
building my seventh grade science project.

190
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,081
Remember how mad Mom got
when she found out

191
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,212
you let me drink coffee to stay awake?

192
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
No.

193
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,381
I mean, no, no, I should never...
Never have let you do that.

194
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,640
Uh... Sorry, will you excuse me?

195
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,224
Are you okay, Dad?

196
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,229
I'm just, uh, preoccupied with my work,
that's all.

197
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,068
You know, you're really taking this
whole absent-minded professor thing

198
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,231
to a new level.

199
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,611
I don't know what you mean.

200
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,947
Your daughter.
Ever since you've come back,

201
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,237
you've treated her like a total stranger.

202
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,248
That's because she is a total stranger.

203
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,458
Sorry. It's just that
when I last left 2016,

204
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,124
that young woman did not exist.

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,675
Wait, you're saying
Lily belongs to another timeline?

206
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,305
That when Barry created Flashpoint...

207
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,340
Unfortunately, this is all my fault.

208
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,518
You see, a month ago,
I interacted with my younger self

209
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:22,023
back in 1987
and unwittingly motivated him,

210
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,142
me,

211
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,939
to sire a child.

212
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,948
So, it's because of my carelessness

213
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,321
that this Time Aberration exists.

214
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,448
She is not an Aberration.

215
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,331
She is brilliant and funny
and a lot like you,

216
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,661
just a little less uptight.

217
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,952
Please stop talking about her like this.

218
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,495
She is not a real person.

219
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,289
She is a real person. She's your daughter.

220
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,383
Wait.

221
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,049
When we finish fighting the Dominators,

222
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,799
you're going to go back in time
and erase her?

223
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,517
No.

224
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,142
I'm going to restore the timeline.

225
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,186
Unlike your friend Barry,

226
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,193
I have the luxury of fixing my mistakes.

227
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,665
AGENT: Well done.

228
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,046
I see that you've managed
to catch us a specimen.

229
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,048
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to keep this one.

230
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,424
Who are you?

231
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,422
Just a humble civil servant.

232
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,171
- I don't like guys with badges.
- Easy, Mick.

233
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,345
We just wanna ask a few questions.

234
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,179
We'd love to answer them, but...

235
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,720
- We're in a bit of a hurry.
- AGENT: <i>And so are we.</i>

236
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,812
You don't understand.

237
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,527
We're here to save the future.

238
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,027
And you can tell me all about it.

239
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,658
When you wake up.

240
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,332
Crap! Where do you think
they're taking them?

241
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,917
Those Men In Black types
are probably gonna take them

242
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,377
to a secret lab
and run experiments on them.

243
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,833
Have you seen <i>Stranger Things?</i>

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,217
Uh, maybe too much TV, Cisco.

245
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,923
Life imitates art, Felicity.

246
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,713
Either way, whether you like it or not,

247
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,222
we're gonna have to be the ones
to rescue them.

248
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But we're the tech support.

249
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,728
No, this is tech support.

250
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,730
Set your phasers to stun.

251
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,101
This is why I hate the government.

252
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,443
Can't you two use your powers
and get us out of here?

253
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,075
Whatever they tranqued us with
is screwing with our powers.

254
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,405
Hey, he's still alive.

255
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,576
Although, something tells me
none of us are gonna be alive for long.

256
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,378
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Wait.</i>

257
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,423
This is the exact opportunity
we've been looking for.

258
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,252
To get captured?

259
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,715
No.

260
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,721
To talk with one of the Dominators.

261
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,928
And find out what they want
with our planet.

262
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,592
Well, this is a first.

263
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,432
Talking with an alien.

264
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,308
Excuse me, Mr. Alien Guy.

265
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,069
SARA: So where's the President?

266
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,738
She's late.

267
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,662
Well, you gotta figure
she's got a lot on her plate,

268
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,948
what with the whole alien invasion thing.

269
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,458
And her predecessor getting killed.

270
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:31,747
Hey, uh, what'd you say to Kara earlier?
She seemed pretty angry.

271
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,291
I didn't know she was capable
of being angry.

272
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,084
We've got movement.

273
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,823
I'm sorry. President couldn't make it.

274
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,154
Who are you?

275
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,819
If I tell you,

276
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,656
I'll have to kill you.

277
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,079
Look.

278
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,089
We just wanna know
why you attacked our planet.

279
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,592
I mean, we're just down here
minding our own business,

280
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,752
then you guys just drop from the sky
and attack us.

281
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,136
<i>Why?</i>

282
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:26,681
There has been a recent emergence
of meta-humans on your planet.

283
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,187
Wait, he's talking about the JSA.

284
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:35,819
DOMINATOR: <i>We are here to determine
if your kind are a threat.</i>

285
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,028
Let's start with him.

286
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,828
Rest of you will have to wait your turn.

287
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,457
Uh, I think we have a misunderstanding.
See, we're the good guys.

288
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,041
The President invited us here.

289
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,298
Barry, I think it's time we do something.

290
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,337
And fast.

291
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,651
- Sniper.
- On it.

292
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,264
We're trying to help you.
This is how you thank us?

293
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,432
You don't understand.
The reason the xenomorphs are here...

294
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,021
is because they have a beef
with the meta-humans.

295
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,777
Tell us something we don't know.

296
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,109
Like, what exactly have we done to them?

297
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,898
Nothing yet.

298
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,201
But they see individuals
with powers such as yours

299
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,953
as a future threat.

300
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,534
And, frankly, so do I.

301
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,288
What do you think they're doing to him?

302
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,298
Same thing they're gonna do to us
unless we get out of here.

303
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,636
Oh, yeah! Y'all call for tech support?

304
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,640
Great. Saved by geeks.

305
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,931
Waverider is ready
to take us back to 2016.

306
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,986
If we leave him here,
they're gonna kill him.

307
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,772
So what? He's an alien.

308
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,441
Just 'cause they're douches
doesn't mean we have to be.

309
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,701
- Well...
- We gotta send him home.

310
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,111
How?

311
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,163
Don't we have one of their ships
aboard the Waverider?

312
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,573
Yeah, but it's damaged.

313
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,992
- Felicity's gonna help me fix it.
- FELICITY: I am?

314
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,374
- I'm gonna help him fix it.
- See?

315
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,834
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

316
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,510
Guys, it's up to us to show
the Dominators we're better than this.

317
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,385
Fascinating.

318
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,017
The creature's nervous system
is not unlike our own,

319
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,023
which means it must be capable
of experiencing pain.

320
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,735
Maybe that's why he's screaming.

321
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,700
Don't worry,
we're gonna get you out of here.

322
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,165
Bye.

323
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,259
- He didn't even say thank you.
- What is that?

324
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,295
I think it's a transponder.

325
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,887
Where'd you get that?

326
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,851
I may or may not have stolen it
from his ship.

327
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,556
What does it do?

328
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,188
I think we can use it to communicate
with him when we get back.

329
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,357
- Oh, my God, like an alien pen pal.
- Exactly.

330
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,938
You kids finished?

331
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,776
- Gideon?
- GIDEON: <i>Yes, Mr. Rory.</i>

332
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,939
Prepare for, um...

333
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,403
- Time jump.
- Time jump.

334
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,160
GIDEON: <i>Course plotted
for Central City, 2016.</i>

335
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,585
If you're such BFF's with the Dominators...

336
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,087
Then, why don't you call them off?

337
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,964
We know you sent them packing
once before back in 1951.

338
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,966
That was just a reconnaissance mission.

339
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,718
What brought them back?

340
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,672
You did, Mr. Allen.

341
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,016
He knows who you are.

342
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,019
You threatened the entire universe
when you used your powers

343
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,226
to upset the normal course of time.

344
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,063
You're talking about Flashpoint?
How do you even know about...

345
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,272
They told us.

346
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,937
I made a mistake, okay,
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

347
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,481
For the past 60 years,

348
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,651
we have enjoyed a truce
with your so-called Dominators.

349
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,407
You broke the truce.

350
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,245
What do they want?

351
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,874
I've negotiated a deal with them.

352
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,627
If Mr. Allen surrenders himself,

353
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,001
they will leave us in peace.

354
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,672
<i>You really wanna save the world?</i>

355
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,171
Here's your chance.

356
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,946
I can't see. Why can't I see?

357
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,698
At least you're not throwing up.

358
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,827
What's it doing?

359
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,158
I don't know.

360
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,164
Either our food's ready,
or this guy's trying to call us.

361
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,496
Hey, how do I answer?

362
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,124
Hey. Oh, my God, it's him.

363
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,510
He's even uglier
than the last time we saw him.

364
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:58,967
<i>Sixty-five of your years ago,
you saved me from capture.</i>

365
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,185
Listen, you don't need to thank us.

366
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,435
Yeah, he does.

367
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,144
He can thank us by turning around
and heading home.

368
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:09,561
<i>I will show you my gratitude
by sparing your lives.</i>

369
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,698
<i>But I cannot do the same for Barry Allen.</i>

370
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,531
<i>If your friend does not turn himself in,</i>

371
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,741
<i>we will have no choice</i>

372
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:25,752
<i>but to deploy a weapon
that will exterminate all meta-humans.</i>

373
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,001
SARA: It's a trap.

374
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,419
If they're that threatened by meta-humans,

375
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,508
it's hard to believe
they'd be satisfied with just one.

376
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,389
Yeah, well, if I know Barry,
he's gonna wanna be that one.

377
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,141
Well, Oliver's trying
to talk him out of it.

378
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,519
And if he does, what's the collateral
damage of the meta-bomb?

379
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,848
Projected casualty count
is around 2 million non-meta-humans.

380
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,311
Okay, so what if we negotiated with them?

381
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,691
CISCO: <i>Yeah, I don't know if you noticed,</i>

382
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,272
but our last chat with them
didn't go so well.

383
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,937
Well, what've we got to lose?

384
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,151
Look, maybe we should contact them.

385
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,816
And make it fast.

386
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,525
We got incoming.

387
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,123
- Dominator ships are coming in worldwide.
- Including Central City.

388
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,712
Yeah, but they're not moving or anything,

389
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,418
- they're just sitting there.
- For now.

390
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,460
So much for the truce
Secret Agent Man negotiated.

391
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,629
They're trying to leverage us
into handing Barry over.

392
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,466
Contact the Dominators.

393
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,978
Looks like your friend's
not calling you back.

394
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,355
- No, he's not, but I got a plan B.
- Go.

395
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,141
If this came from their drop ship,

396
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,479
and the drop ship came
from the mother ship,

397
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,269
theoretically, I could use it
to vibe us up there.

398
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,525
And if you can't?

399
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,533
Then, I'd be vibing us into the cold,
unforgiving vacuum of space.

400
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,740
- So, let's not do that.
- Yeah, let's not. Okay.

401
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,300
What an unusual gift.

402
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,803
You appear to be a meta-human as well.

403
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,635
Yeah, well,
I figured you'd cut me some slack

404
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,391
seeing as how we saved you back in 1951.

405
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,767
Remember that?

406
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,396
Much has changed on your planet
in the last 60 years.

407
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,647
The threat of your kind
has become imminent.

408
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,436
Listen, ET, we're not a threat.

409
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,821
Metas are protecting this planet.

410
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,905
And besides, the guy who tortured
your ugly ass back in 1951 was human.

411
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:28,621
But what happens when a man like him
inherits abilities like yours?

412
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,170
<i>We have seen it happen
on countless other worlds.</i>

413
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:38,050
Which is why we must exterminate your kind

414
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:44,636
before the scourge of your planet
becomes the scourge of ours.

415
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,601
Well, he's out of his giant mind.

416
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,432
What if he's right?

417
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,273
What if in using our powers
to make the world better,

418
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,778
we actually end up destroying it?

419
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,610
Dude, I get it. Barry screwed up.

420
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,274
Yeah, so did we.

421
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,692
Back in 1951.

422
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,329
We messed with time
when we freed the Dominator.

423
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,456
Who is now coming to kill us.

424
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,079
This whole time I've been mad at Barry.

425
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,587
Now I'm the one who messed with time.

426
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,553
I just wanted to make things right.

427
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,551
I only ended up making them worse.

428
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,058
I'm an idiot.

429
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,150
I can't stabilize
the nanomolecular reaction.

430
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,780
Damn it!

431
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,653
Well.

432
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,248
Speaking as a daughter,

433
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,627
I'm not sure that outburst
had anything to do with her project.

434
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,162
What, you think it's related to me?

435
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,205
She doesn't know
that you think she's an Aberration.

436
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,171
All she knows is that her father
is keeping her at arm's length.

437
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,710
The world is being invaded by aliens.

438
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,844
I don't think this is the time
for family therapy.

439
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,383
It is when the world's best chance
at a workable weapon

440
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,768
is focused on getting
her daddy to love her.

441
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,111
Lily?

442
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,948
Hey. I'm sorry.

443
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,277
Morn always said I got my temper from you.

444
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,698
No, no, I'm the one who owes the apology.

445
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,126
If it feels like
I've been keeping my distance,

446
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,332
I assure you, it's nothing personal.

447
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,957
Yeah, it feels personal.

448
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,753
No, I mean, it's not personal to you.

449
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,845
I'm sorry. I wish I could explain,

450
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,431
but my life has gotten
rather complicated lately.

451
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,807
So?

452
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,394
You raised me to enjoy complexity.

453
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,554
That's...

454
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,150
The nanomolecular reaction
keeps breaking down

455
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,188
because the replication
is sequential, not...

456
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,570
Exponential.

457
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,451
The reaction requires greater complexity.

458
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,819
Yeah.

459
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,329
Why are you looking at me like that?

460
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,337
Because I truly believe
I'm seeing you for the first time.

461
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,007
LILY: <i>What is it?</i>

462
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,725
My friend Barry.

463
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,811
He's about to do something terrible.

464
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,440
This isn't up for debate.

465
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,643
It's not even a close call.

466
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:48,442
<i>I turn myself over to the Dominators,
they leave the rest of the world alone.</i>

467
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,239
- It's simple.
- No, it's not simple.

468
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,950
Barry, it doesn't matter what you've done.
You can't do this.

469
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,740
It's been an honor to know all of you.

470
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,833
<i>To fight alongside of you.</i>

471
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,661
Now it's up to you to keep our home safe.

472
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,220
OLIVER: <i>Barry. I'm not letting you leave.</i>

473
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,134
No offense, Oliver, but you and what army?

474
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,559
This one.

475
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,939
Listen, Red, I don't like you,

476
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,198
but when you've got a crew,
you don't take a hit for the rest.

477
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,625
That's actually pretty inspiring.
I mean, up until the point

478
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,661
that Mick compared us
to a bunch of criminals, but...

479
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,000
AMAYA: <i>According to the Dominators,</i>

480
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,039
we might as well be.

481
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,753
And maybe they're right.

482
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,760
Maybe we do more harm than good,
but this is our chance to find out.

483
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,889
CISCO: <i>We're not letting you
sacrifice yourself.</i>

484
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,761
There's no way.

485
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,435
I don't care if that's what it means
to be a hero.

486
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,595
You're not a hero to me.

487
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,640
You're my friend.

488
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,061
JAX: <i>Yo, guys.</i>

489
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,822
You know that ship
that landed in Central City?

490
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,067
It's opening up.

491
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,618
Here we go.

492
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,044
I'm reading reports of ships opening
all over the world.

493
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,754
- Oh, frak.
- Talk to me.

494
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,840
Something from the Dominator's mothership
just broke atmo,

495
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,629
and not to get too technical,
but it's really, really big

496
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,921
and falling to Earth really, really fast.

497
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,305
BARRY: It's the meta-bomb.

498
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,309
Why would the uglies drop ships on us
if they're just planning on blowing us up?

499
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:43,769
Because the ships were a distraction
to keep us from stopping the meta-bomb.

500
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,144
Too bad 'cause we're gonna stop it.

501
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,400
- We're gonna stop it, right?
- Let's hope.

502
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,318
BARRY: <i>We have to keep
the Dominators at bay.</i>

503
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,532
PROFESSOR STEIN: This might help.

504
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,664
I've mass-produced a small device,
that when placed on individual Dominators,

505
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,745
will cause indescribable agony.

506
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,411
Not the nicest invention, but this is war.

507
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,624
Nice going.

508
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,838
The caveat, of course,
is that if we activate the weapons

509
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,500
before all the devices are placed
on the Dominators,

510
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,089
they'll know what we're up to.

511
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,504
Well, we gotta do it fast.

512
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,422
Only way I know how.

513
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,430
Damn, that's big.

514
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,268
I didn't think it was gonna be so big.

515
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,104
- What're we gonna do?
- You got me.

516
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,861
I only know how to stab, punch
or skewer things.

517
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,232
Fry, you freaks.

518
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,247
See you later, Dominator.

519
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,563
This thing has to have
a tractor beam, right?

520
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:52,726
Yup.

521
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,533
It's slowing down but, like, barely.

522
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,914
Thank you, Cisco, I haven't noticed.

523
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,624
Strap in.

524
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,620
Firestorm, if you're done playing
with your friends out there,

525
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,084
we could really use your help.

526
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,463
I'm on it.

527
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,254
Good work planting
Professor Stein's nanoweapons,

528
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,507
but we've still got Dominators
all over the country.

529
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,134
This looks like a job for Supergirl.

530
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,005
FLASH: Thanks, Felicity.

531
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,799
<i>I'm not the least bit insulted.</i>

532
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,639
Uh, sorry. I meant Supergirl and Flash.

533
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,269
This is totally a job
for the both of you.

534
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,851
That's what I meant. Supergirl and Flash.

535
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,651
Firestorm, we're holding it up.

536
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,030
But, like, barely.

537
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,032
Not helping, Cisco.

538
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,950
- SARA: <i>Firestorm, do it now.</i>
- Do what?

539
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,535
PROFESSOR STEM:
<i>I believe Ms. Lance intends for us</i>

540
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,042
<i>to transmute the meta-bomb
into something harmless.</i>

541
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,043
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

542
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,511
All right, devices are being planted.

543
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,675
Let me know when I can bring the pain.

544
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,145
Come on, Firestorm.

545
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,226
Grey, I can't do it, man. It's too big.

546
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,732
Still waiting on that signal.

547
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,899
Do it.

548
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,360
Done.

549
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,744
It's working!

550
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,705
What about the superhero bomb?

551
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,256
I can't. I can't do it.

552
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,713
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>You must, Jefferson.</i>

553
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,425
<i>I have a daughter. Her name is Lily
and she's counting on you.</i>

554
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,097
<i>She's counting on both of us.</i>

555
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,726
They did it!

556
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,607
They can do that?

557
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,192
They did that.

558
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,357
Ground, what's your status?

559
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,743
They're retreating.

560
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,290
It's not just them.

561
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,290
It's all around the world.

562
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,970
He did it.

563
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,722
No, Oliver.

564
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,133
We all did it.

565
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,494
Many responsibilities have fallen to me

566
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,491
since the President's passing
at the beginning of this crisis.

567
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,582
<i>Sobering, sad responsibilities.</i>

568
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,746
This is not one of them.

569
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,839
Today, it is my distinct honor
to bestow upon you

570
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:52,429
a small acknowledgment of the great debt
that the world owes to you all.

571
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,014
Is it just me or is she really hot?

572
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,725
<i>Although your brave efforts must
remain a secret...</i>

573
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,888
She's hot.

574
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,604
Know that meta-human or not,

575
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,353
<i>masked or not,</i>

576
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,025
each and every one of you is a hero.

577
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,199
Whoo!

578
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,076
Thank you.

579
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,580
Thank you.

580
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,041
Hmm? Hmm?

581
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,250
Let's go drink.

582
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:28,877
Cheers.

583
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,762
It's like looking into a mirror.

584
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,930
Hey, you know what's funny?

585
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,312
She really kind of looks like my cousin.

586
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,062
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Hey.

587
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,851
Either of you ever saved the world before?

588
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,066
Mmm-hmm. Last year.

589
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,571
- Oh, it doesn't get old, does it?
- No.

590
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,448
It sure beats screwing up the world.

591
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,405
Hey, you are too hard on yourself.

592
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,819
That's what people usually tell me.

593
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,158
And for good reason I'm sure, but...

594
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,741
Back on my Earth,
it's just me and my cousin.

595
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,453
Between the two of us,
we're more powerful than...

596
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,496
- Yeah, everybody in this room combined.
- No, no.

597
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,256
That's the point.

598
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,588
That's what you've all proven here.

599
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,595
Meta-human or not, superpowers or not,

600
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,932
you are Earth's mightiest heroes.

601
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,058
Um...

602
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,262
I owe you an apology.

603
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,524
Keeping you at arm's length
was the wrong move and, uh...

604
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,526
Well, the truth is that this Earth
could probably use a Supergirl.

605
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,863
Well, that's funny.

606
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,650
Because I was just thinking
my Earth could use an Oliver Queen.

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,618
I know you said you don't get unnerved.

608
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,283
But if you did,

609
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,377
I think hardship
is what makes us stronger.

610
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,794
That's probably why these people
look to you as their rock.

611
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,047
You guys feeling the group hug?

612
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,806
- No.
- Come on, come on.

613
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,387
- Okay.
- All right.

614
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,516
Hey, Kara,

615
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,649
- I made you something. Yeah.
- What? Cisco.

616
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,067
What, uh...

617
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,316
What is it?

618
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,025
Oh. It's, uh...

619
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,816
- It's an inter-dimensional extrapolator.
- Oh. Uh...

620
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,368
It creates small breaches,
so you can use it

621
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,825
to cross over to our universe
anytime you need to.

622
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,912
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

623
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,497
I also included
communication functionality,

624
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,504
so if you ever need any help
you can always contact the team.

625
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,169
RORY: Hey, skirt.

626
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,001
Call me.

627
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,060
All right, Grey. Spill.

628
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,690
How is it you have a kid?

629
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,401
I didn't think I had to explain
such matters to you, Jefferson.

630
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,732
Come on, you know what I mean.

631
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,279
When we traveled back to 1987,

632
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:03,449
I gave my younger self a lecture
about neglecting Clarissa and he...

633
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,869
And he followed your advice
all the way to pound town.

634
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,704
Wait.

635
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,794
You created an Aberration.

636
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,924
Which is why you cannot tell the team.

637
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,711
If you don't want me to tell the team,
that means you...

638
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,309
I do not want to lose my daughter.

639
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,777
Something tells me
you weren't invited here.

640
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,108
Dr. Heywood.

641
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,113
Don't Dr. Heywood me.
What the hell are you doing here?

642
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,151
I like parties.
And I'm here for the mop up.

643
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,161
Cover up. But you can't cover this up.

644
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,913
Agent Smith.

645
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,665
It's so funny seeing you here.

646
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,078
I was just having the loveliest chat
with your President about you.

647
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,496
I was telling her on my Earth,

648
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,915
we have a Department
of Extra-Normal Operations

649
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,630
which deals specifically with aliens.

650
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,635
She thought it was an excellent idea.

651
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,757
She also loved my pitch about
reassigning you to Antarctica.

652
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:12,109
Maybe next time, you're a little nicer
to strange visitors from another planet.

653
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,354
<i>Pack a jacket.</i>

654
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,199
BARRY: You ready to see
if Cisco's gadget works?

655
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,441
KARA: Ready.

656
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,030
And remember,

657
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,161
if you guys ever need me,
I'm just a call away.

658
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,321
Same here.

659
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,717
It's weird to think that
all of this started with the two of us.

660
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,552
Ever think about what it would be like
if we never got on that boat?

661
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,971
I don't know if I have to think about it.

662
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,065
I mean, maybe the Dominators showed us
what our lives would have been like.

663
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,319
I know it was a prison, but in a way...

664
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,900
In a way, it was a gift.

665
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,951
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

666
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,505
DIGGLE: There she goes.

667
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,713
Off to her spaceship,
time traveling as if it's totally normal.

668
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,962
Well...
John, it's like you said.

669
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,756
Normal sort of went out the window
when this one arrived.

670
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,100
I may never understand you, man, but...

671
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,263
You're one of the best men I know.

672
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,061
Thanks, Digg.

673
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,941
So, will you forgive me for what I did?

674
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,240
Barry, it's like I keep telling this guy,
you have to forgive yourself.

675
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,868
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

676
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,495
Yeah, thanks.

677
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,491
Well. We ought to do this more often.

678
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,875
Get together, I mean.

679
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,870
I don't know if the world could take it.

680
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,289
I meant, like,
without the world being threatened.

681
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,881
If the world wasn't being threatened,
what would we do?

682
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,223
I'm just saying that
next time I'm gonna get you.

683
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,637
I'm just saying I've beaten you twice.

684
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,180
The first time was a tie.

685
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,472
And the second time?

686
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,775
There were no witnesses the second time.

687
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,358
Super speed and arrow tools.

688
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,898
Our lives aren't exactly normal.

689
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,493
I told Kara that I was looking
to reclaim some normal.

690
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:32,282
Thinking on it now, I'm not so sure.

691
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,285
I know what you mean.

692
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,497
We both got a look
at what life would look like normal.

693
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,549
It would've been happy.

694
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,634
But not full.

695
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,384
No. No, nowhere close.

696
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,220
To things not being normal.

697
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,095
To life being full.
