1
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:58,256
Ashwathama is dead.

2
00:01:58,589 --> 00:01:59,881
Ashwathama (the elephant).

3
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,714
Salutations to the Creator, Brahma

4
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,464
The utterance of whose name...

5
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,089
grants his instantaneous presence.

6
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:46,797
Upon whose arrival,
all the enemies bite the dust.

7
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,756
The end of the Pandavas!

8
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,756
Even though Abhimanyu isn't here,

9
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:04,172
you're carrying the last heir
of the Pandavas in your womb.

10
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:14,756
If you're here to kill
me, go ahead, Krishna.

11
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,381
I'm not Arjuna to listen to your teachings.

12
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:22,881
Of the sins committed in
these 18 days of Kurukshetra,

13
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,672
your unrighteousness is the worst.

14
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,922
How could you stoop so low,
being the son of Dronacharya?

15
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:33,172
You have no right to utter
my father's name, Krishna.

16
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:41,464
You could've stopped
his death if you wanted to.

Ashwathama...

00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,714
Be it God or Drona,
nobody can escape karma.

25
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,839
You shot an arrow at an unborn baby.

26
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,089
You must face the
consequences of your karma.

27
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:22,381
Alright then. Spin your chakra
and kill me as a punishment.

28
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,464
Death isn't your punishment, Ashwathama.

29
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:26,339
It's your salvation.

30
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,756
Over time, all the
Pandavas will be deceased.

31
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,006
My body will perish.

32
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,922
This Yuga will reach an end.

33
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,964
But you won't face death.

34
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,839
Your wounds won't heal
for thousands of years.

35
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,381
You will neither die nor live.

36
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,881
You'll suffer alone, bearing
witness to many sins.

37
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,339
I curse you as such!

38
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:51,256
Is there no atonement for me?

39
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,172
You wanted to kill me now.

40
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,881
But one day, you'll have to save me.

41
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:58,797
Me?

42
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:00,214
Kaliyugam is coming.

43
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,672
Kali is coming.

44
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,797
When unrighteousness increases...

45
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,839
and darkness engulfs the world,

46
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,797
I must reincarnate again.

47
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,422
Kali is going to be so
powerful in that Yuga that...

48
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,214
he can cause hindrance to my birth.

49
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:17,047
That's when you must
safeguard my birth haven.

50
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,047
When the Sun disappears from the sky,

51
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,214
When the air is filled with toxins,

52
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,839
When River Ganga is
devoid of its last drop,

53
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,756
When this gem finds its way back to you,

54
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:28,422
remember the time has come.

55
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,839

No idea.

72
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:58,506
Brother, do you have some water?

73
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,089
Ma'am, some water, please?

74
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:23,714
Have you dried out from washing
away all our sins, Gangamma?

75
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,381
Where did you come from?

76
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:32,922
Nobody gives water for free here.

77
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:33,964
Did you know that?

78
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,381
No, I didn't.

79
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:39,506
In fact, I've never stepped
out of my town before.

80
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:41,172
What are you doing here now?

81
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,506
Come here.

82
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,881
Do you see that?

83
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:55,381
A star shining in broad daylight.

84
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:56,506
So what?

85
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,672
It appeared only 3 days ago.

86
00:09:58,672 --> 00:09:59,631
So what?

87
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:03,214
It first appeared 6000 years ago.

88
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:04,547
This is only the second time.

89
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:05,631
So what?

90
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,422
So...

91
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,089
What's up with you two?

92
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:12,381
Is this your sister?

93
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:17,172
Can't you see that I'm a boy?

94
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,797
Okay, my boy.

95
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,839
Well, why are you guys going to Kashi?

96
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:26,756
Do we have anywhere else to go?

97
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,297
Hey!

98
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,131
Look!

99
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:35,589
We've reached Kashi!

100
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,839
The last standing city in this world.

101
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:42,381
The first ever city to exist on Earth.

102
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:36,547
Wow!

103
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:52,381
When will they open that gate?

104
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:54,547
When you have a million units.

105
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,589
I'll definitely get inside someday.

106
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,047
They have everything there.

107
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,506
They even have flowers.

108
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:00,881
I'm sure.

109
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,922
When you suck all the resources from Earth,

110
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,672
you obviously have everything in there.

111
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:09,881
Who's up there?

112
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,589
The Leader of the Complex.

113
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:17,047
The 200 year old warden.

114
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,631
Supreme Yaskin.

115
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,089
Don't you know God is
banned in Kashi, you old man?

116
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:46,006
The Complex will kill
you if they hear of this.

117
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,547
No, sir. Please.

118
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,922
Tell me this. Why is your
God seated on a dog?

119
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,881
What's his name?

120
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,839
I don't recall, sir.

121
00:12:56,464 --> 00:12:57,464
But...

122
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:01,756
Everyone believes he is
the protector of Kashi.

123
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,297
Boys!

124
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:08,172
The new stuff is here.

125
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,381
Hold. Hold. Stop the vehicle.

126
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:25,464
Pull all the girls aside.

127
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,797
She's positive.

128
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:51,631
What's wrong?

129
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,631
Where are you taking her?

130
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:54,047
-Saanu...
-Dad!

131
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,547
Saanu... Saanu...

132
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,256
Where are you taking her?

133
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,339
She's unwell.

134
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,422
The Complex needs your daughter.

135
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:06,297
Fertile girls are worth 10,000 units.

136
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,297
Dad!

137
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:09,172
Please let her go!

138
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,006
Saanu! Saanu!

139
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:18,672
Brother...

140
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:21,797
How many units will you
give me in exchange for a girl?

141
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:22,756
Where's the girl?

142
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,047
Look.

143
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:27,839
She was just there.

144
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,339
Everyone, step out.

145
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:52,422
For tomorrow.

146
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:53,881
For tomorrow.

147
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:56,881
Rumi...

148
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,881
What are you doing here?

149
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,089
All of us are here on the same mission.

150
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:04,047
Mariam is so worried about you.

151
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,339
I need to inform her that we found you.

152
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,797
Everyone at Shambala is looking for you.

153
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:12,422
Hi, Rumi. Where have you gone?

154
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,589
This isn't the age for you to risk things.

155
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:16,047
How could you just leave?

156
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,922
We lost so many of our
people in the Bombay war.

157
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,256
You can't endanger Shambala
based on your crazy beliefs.

158
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,089
That crazy belief is the
foundation of Shambala, Veeran.

159
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,589
It's the hope for a better tomorrow.

160
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,797
Come back, Rumi.

161
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,214
The kids miss listening to your stories.

162
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:39,006
Tell them those stories are
going to come true, Mariam.

163
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,047
The time mentioned in
the puranas has come!

164
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,422
All the stars and planets suggest the same.

165
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:50,964
And so do my instincts.

166
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,464
The Mother is coming.

167
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,089
Please get the woman.

168
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,547
What's your name, love?

169
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,172
Divya.

170
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:40,006
-What's this?
-Shambala's belief.

171
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,381
When darkness engulfs the world,

172
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:45,881
this will show us the way.

173
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,047
When the Prophetic Mother who carries
God in her womb arrives,

174
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,422
this lights up.

175
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:10,714
What happened?

176
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,339
It didn't light up.

177
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,006
Sorry.

178
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:21,797
Carrying a life inside you
is a blessing in today's time.

179
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:25,922
But there's still time to find
the life we're searching for.

180
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,256
It's never going to happen.

181
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,672
That compass will never light up.

182
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:32,006
Nobody will believe your stories.

183
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,714
The truth doesn't seek validation, Veeran.

184
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:38,631
When the time comes,
you'll see it for yourself.

185
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:40,631
That all these stories are true.

186
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:43,131
That God is returning.

187
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:46,339
Raiders! Let's go!

188
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:48,756
Hey, careful!

189
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:52,547
Hurry up!

190
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:57,631
Luke, faster!

191
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,631
Come!

192
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,464
They're opening the Complex gates.

193
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:24,297
Stop.

194
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:33,714
Come back.

195
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:46,589
Commander,

196
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:51,714
these Rebels were found because of my tip.

197
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,422
Can I enter the complex?

198
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:01,214
Wow!

199
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,047
A fertile girl.

200
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:06,047
How did you manage to escape for so long?

201
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:09,089
Take her to the labs.

202
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:12,381
We will extract your
womb and use it freshly.

203
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,339
Don't do it!

204
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,839
Then show me the way to Shambala.

205
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:22,589
Here's Shambala.

206
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:26,214
Oh! Hello, Mariam.

207
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,922
You're still just as beautiful.

208
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,381
Why did you hide and
send this old man instead?

209
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,589
Show me the way to Shambala.

210
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:39,922
And I'll send him back.

211
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:44,506
What are the Rebels fighting for anyway?

212
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,506
For these dogs?

213
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,839
They'll kill you for this bitten apple.

214
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,131
What are you doing this for, huh?

215
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,631
For change.

216
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:06,422
And to end you for
turning humans like this.

217
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,506
For tomorrow.

218
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:12,464
If today ceases to exist,
there will be no tomorrow, right?

219
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:13,922
Please.

220
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,881
She has nothing to do with us.

221
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:19,172
Then show me the way to Shambala.

222
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:21,006
Do it and I'll let her go.

223
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,006
Don't answer him.

224
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:30,631
They won't spare me no matter what you say.

225
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,006
This baby won't see the light of day.

226
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,214
If you want another baby to be born,

227
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,214
this isn't how the world should be.

228
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:43,881
The world needs to change.

229
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,047
Don't tell him.

230
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:49,839
Sorry.

231
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:51,839
Wrong answer.

232
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,631
Forgive me, love.

233
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:07,922
Your belief should come true.

234
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,047
You should find the
Mother you're looking for.

235
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:24,256
Such a waste!

236
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:28,381
When will you guys understand?

237
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,339
All the wars have come to an end.

238
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,881
Only the Complex remains in the world.

239
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,214
And there's only one God.

240
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,714
Supreme Yaskin.

241
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:43,297
You're right.

242
00:22:44,214 --> 00:22:45,506
There's only one God.

243
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:48,797
Are you talking to me?

244
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:52,381
Darker has engulfed from all the sides.

245
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,839
It's now time for the light to shine.

246
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,547
He is coming!

247
00:22:58,631 --> 00:22:59,672
Who?

248
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:01,922
Every religion...

249
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,006
and race...

250
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:07,381
is waiting for his arrival.

251
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:09,089
Ahura Mazda,

252
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,672
Rudra Chakrin,

253
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,214
Second Coming,

254
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:15,047
The last avatar in the Dasavataras,

255
00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:17,214
He may have a million names.

256
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:19,631
But the calling is one.

257
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,756
He will pierce through the darkness...

258
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:24,506
and shine light upon...

259
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:27,464
Rumi!

260
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:32,256
Catch them.

261
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:37,631
5000 units for every little rat.

262
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:41,714
Rumi.

263
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:48,006
From now on, you must tell
stories to the kids, Mariam.

264
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:10,631
So, is the tree dead?

265
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:12,089
No, my love.

266
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:13,506
It isn't dead.

267
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,214
It's waiting.

268
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:20,547
It's waiting for the day
light will shine again.

269
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,756
Ajju, go! I'll handle them.

270
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,381
Go straight. Don't look back.

271
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,964
Found the baby rat!

272
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:20,131
You're worth at least 5000 units, right?

273
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:25,881
One-star bounty.

274
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:27,339
You guessed it right.

275
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,047
5000 units.

276
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:31,839
You guys can leave. Bye.

277
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,839
What is this?

278
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:38,506
These are my handcuffs.
And this is my bounty.

279
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:40,172
This is my gun.

280
00:25:42,631 --> 00:25:44,339
Hey! Stop it!

281
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,006
How dare you shoot me!

282
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:53,506
My boss will come and smash you all now.

283
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:56,756
Oooh! Who's your boss?

284
00:25:56,797 --> 00:25:58,714
A kickass soldier in the past wars,

285
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:01,547
who has never lost a single fight till now,

286
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,297
The Undefeated,

287
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:05,172
The One and Only,

288
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,006
Bhairava!

289
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:28,131
Ah! He's back!

290
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,672
I wonder what he'll do this time.

291
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:33,756
Bhairava, wake up!

292
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:35,714
I hyped you up big time. Wake up!

293
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:38,172
Hey, Bujji. Please. 5 minutes.

294
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:40,422
The Great Bhairava?

295
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:41,547
Yeah.

296
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:44,464
We've heard crazy stories
about your fights, boss.

297
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,131
I've heard about you too.

298
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,506
A good fighter.

299
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:51,297
But you're not loyal.

300
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:53,547
You jump ship depending
on who pays more, is it?

301
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:54,964
This is our bounty.

302
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,047
He fell right into my lap.

303
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:58,422
That's 5000 units.

304
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,756
Guys, pay 5000 units and take him.

305
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:06,339
Defeat us and earn the units.

306
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:18,422
1..2..3..4..5..6..

307
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:19,714
9!

308
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,422
Woah! That's too many guys!

309
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:24,464
Bujji, return the bounty.

310
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:27,297
I can't wake up and fight
for those 5000 units now.

311
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,256
I was having such a nice dream.

312
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,839
We were inside the complex.

313
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:39,631
The table was decked
with unlimited food, Bujji.

314
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:45,089
You were in the complex? But how?

315
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:48,047
Using units like everyone else.

316
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:51,006
Do you have one million units?

317
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:53,797
A few units short.

318
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,881
Current balance. 250 units.

319
00:27:57,547 --> 00:27:59,214
Bujji, did they ask you?

320
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:00,922
Did they ask you for the details?

321
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:02,422
I have a special offer for you.

322
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:05,089
Stop us.

323
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:08,214
I'll give you another 5000 units.

324
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:12,631
As a bonus, you can
have the old man as well.

325
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,464
Are you tempted now? 10,000 units in total.

326
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,547
It's too early in the day to fight, Bujji.

327
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:22,381
What? It will be night in some time.

328
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:26,589
Okay.

329
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,839
You were supposed to charge my shoes.

330
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:45,881
Your shoes. You only put them on charge.

331
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:49,422
How can you be so irresponsible, Bujji?

332
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,797
Okay, leave it.

333
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:54,589
Okay.

334
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:56,756
Play a nice song.

335
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,006
Let me get into fight mode.

336
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,339
Yes, boss.

337
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:13,881
Hey...

338
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:53,297
Bujji...

339
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,089
Bhairava!

340
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,089
Go get him!

341
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,714
Hey, baldie!

342
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:14,422
Hey, catch!

343
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:30,422
Hey, Kappa (Frog) ! Enough of this circus!

344
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,339
Come stand in front of me!

345
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,047
Got you! Got you! Got you!

346
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:55,631
Hey, furry! Got scared?

347
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:57,631
You...

348
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,172
Bujji, are you okay?

349
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,297
Why do you care?

350
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:08,297
Does it hurt?

351
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:10,381
This furry man hit me.

352
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:12,047
And you're jumping around like a frog.

353
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:15,297
If you really care about me, go whack him.

354
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,922
Bhairava, we lost our bounty.

355
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,672
That bounty is mine.

356
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:51,506
Catch him!

357
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:14,922
There's a staircase, brother.

358
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:44,839
Hey, hey! Stop!

359
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:58,464
What are you watching, baldie?

00:33:10,797 --> 00:33:13,922

00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:07,672
Hey!

388
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:09,922
Let go!

389
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:14,131
Come here.

390
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,672
Bujji, I want to whistle.
Please take off one handcuff.

391
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,006
-Please, Bujji.
-Okay.

392
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,589
-Thanks, Bujji.
-You're welcome.

393
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:36,881
Bujji, you see this?

394
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:39,297
I have fans too.

395
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,589

Hey, kiddo. My units.

401
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,256
This is mine.

402
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:17,631
This is mine.

403
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:20,297
You won't get any units for this. Take it.

404
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:22,964
This is Kaala Bhairava!

405
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:27,797
People believed he was the
protector of Kashi once upon a time.

406
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:31,214
You should protect Kashi now, Bhairava.

407
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,256
Yeah.

408
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,464
Yeah, I know.

409
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:37,131
Protector, my foot!

410
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:39,631
Kashi will be fine only if he leaves.

411
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,922
-He ate my paan.
-He was just complimenting me.

412
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:19,381
What are you doing here?

413
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:22,172
Give me some fresh news.

414
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:23,631
I'm bored to death.

415
00:38:07,756 --> 00:38:09,297
Why are you looking at me like that?

416
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:11,422
A life within a life.

417
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,006
It's so strange,

418
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,297
don't you think?

419
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,214
But it won't survive.

420
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:24,047
Sometimes I wish I was negative.

421
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,839
I could get out of this cage at least.

422
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:32,797
You won't get it.

423
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:48,131
You're sad that you're not positive, huh?

424
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:49,881
You got to do nothing.

425
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:51,047
There's good food.

426
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:52,881
They treat you like a Queen.

427
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,964
You never had the fortune, I heard.

428
00:38:57,506 --> 00:38:58,464
Poor girl!

429
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,131
Everyone feels hungry.

430
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,506
If you can't be positive,

431
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:20,881
you got to be smart at least.

432
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,881
Commander Manas.

433
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:39,214
We were not expecting you.

434
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:41,131
Is it?

435
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,297
Call me when you're expecting me.

436
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,672
I'll come back.

437
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,172
I didn't mean that, sir.

438
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:53,089
Supreme wants to know
the status of Project K.

439
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:54,339
91 days.

440
00:39:54,714 --> 00:39:56,214
How many days did Supreme ask for?

441
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:57,672
150 days, sir.

442
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:01,714
Have some shame!

443
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:03,839
You have such a huge lab here.

444
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:05,839
Thousands of girls at your disposal.

445
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:09,256
And these... matching uniforms.

446
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:11,381
It's such a waste!

447
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:14,172
Can I... Can I show you something, sir?

448
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,381
Please come.

449
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:20,089
We're summoning all the fertile
women to the labs like you asked.

450
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,797
Including little girls.

451
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:27,756
The formula Supreme prepared
is far beyond human DNA.

452
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:30,381
This formula is so powerful that...

453
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:32,297
it puts these girls' lives at risk.

454
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:38,506
None of the women are
able to carry this formula.

455
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:40,381
Supreme wants the serum.

456
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,547
Not your explanations.

457
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:48,839
You said there's a 91 days pregnant woman.

458
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,339
Extract her.

459
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:52,756
We should wait a few more days.

460
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:55,006
Her vitals are not stable.

461
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:57,006
Supreme ordered to see me today.

462
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,547
Not in a few more days.

463
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,756
Extract her. That's an order.

464
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:04,839
Sorry.

465
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,881
You couldn't hit the century this time.

466
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:09,797
Better luck next time.

467
00:42:35,797 --> 00:42:36,589
Is she dead?

468
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:39,381
We've been trying for a few years now.

469
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,256
This experiment can never be successful.

470
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:43,339
There's only one way to do this.

471
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:47,131
If we know what Supreme exactly wants,

472
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:49,547
we will know how to proceed further.

473
00:42:50,672 --> 00:42:52,922
What is Project K?

474
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:55,131
If you don't know already,

475
00:42:55,797 --> 00:42:57,589
it means you're not meant to know.

476
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:00,589
Do you know?

477
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:04,631
I can sacrifice my life for Supreme.

478
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:07,172
But I cannot do this blindly anymore.

479
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:08,714
I need his help.

480
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:11,839
Take me to him. I'll ask him personally.

481
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:13,589
Alright.

482
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:34,297
Counselor Bani.

483
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:36,631
What a beautiful day, isn't it?

484
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:39,672
Why is he here?

485
00:43:39,672 --> 00:43:41,172
He's a scientist at the labs.

486
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:45,047
He has some important
doubts about Project K.

487
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:46,172
Follow me.

488
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:07,339
Hand me the serum.

489
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:27,381
I'm meeting him for the
first time in so many years.

490
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:30,506
Make sure it's not your last time.

491
00:45:15,131 --> 00:45:18,756
Manas from Project K is here.

492
00:45:36,381 --> 00:45:40,839
Supreme, this is the best
serum from the labs so far.

493
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,672
I got it extracted personally.

494
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:50,922
No one is living beyond 100 days.

495
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:53,256
What's in this serum?

496
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:24,714
What happened?

497
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:46,297
It's been so many days...

498
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,339
since someone tried to kill me.

499
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,172
I've offered many lives to death.

500
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:27,881
Death won't come near me.

501
00:47:29,006 --> 00:47:32,297
I feel pity for you.

502
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,256
Why did you want to kill me?

503
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:37,964
For the greater good.

504
00:47:37,964 --> 00:47:39,172
The greater good?

505
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:44,756
Do you know how many lives the
greater good has taken in history?

506
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:50,422
The greater good changes every
time Kings and King-ships change.

507
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:52,839
Don't be deluded by it.

508
00:47:54,714 --> 00:47:56,797
What do you seek anyway?

509
00:47:57,047 --> 00:48:00,339
I want to save this world.

510
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:04,339
I want to save this world.

511
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:10,089
Isn't that what I'm doing?

512
00:48:10,256 --> 00:48:13,881
All those people waging wars
in the name of God and money...

513
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:16,297
I united them with just one war.

514
00:48:18,422 --> 00:48:19,506
Is that wrong?

515
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,464
Since you're destroying
nature down to dust,

516
00:48:25,214 --> 00:48:27,256
I kept it out of your reach.

517
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:29,047
Is that wrong?

518
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,797
You can't do whatever you feel like.

519
00:48:31,797 --> 00:48:32,922
Who the hell are you?

520
00:48:32,964 --> 00:48:35,797
Who the hell are you guys to destroy it?

521
00:48:38,922 --> 00:48:42,089
Despite the endless opportunities
spanning over generations,

522
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:44,631
man fails to redeem
himself and he never will.

523
00:48:48,214 --> 00:48:49,881
It's not your fault.

524
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,881
Human beings are defected to begin with.

525
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:22,839
You wanted to know...

526
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:25,714
what this serum consists of, right?

527
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,797
It has the solution to your defect.

528
00:49:31,756 --> 00:49:33,506
The solution to everything.

529
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:37,672
Don't worry.

530
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:40,797
A new world will rise.

531
00:49:50,256 --> 00:49:53,714
Find a woman who can carry the
formula in her womb for 150 days.

532
00:50:38,714 --> 00:50:39,547
Hey.

533
00:50:40,547 --> 00:50:41,589
Which month?

534
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:44,797
Five.

535
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:46,381
Five!

536
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,256
That is...

537
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:53,381
150 days!

538
00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:56,672
How is this possible?

539
00:50:57,631 --> 00:50:59,672
No one was able to carry beyond 3 months.

540
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:03,714
You were never positive before, were you?

541
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:08,672
As always, I got negative
in the last seeding.

542
00:51:08,881 --> 00:51:10,131
How is this possible then?

543
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:11,714
I have no clue.

544
00:51:12,672 --> 00:51:13,797
But one day,

545
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:16,464
there was movement.

546
00:51:18,381 --> 00:51:19,839
What if the Complex finds out?

547
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:22,839
They will kill it.

548
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:25,381
If they find out from another
source, they will kill you as well.

549
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:26,672
-Let's go.
-No!

550
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,839
You've crossed 120 days.

551
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,506
You'll be treated like a
Queen at the Complex.

552
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:36,881
If you don't tell them, I will.

553
00:51:37,256 --> 00:51:41,172
I don't even remember my mom's face.

554
00:51:42,672 --> 00:51:46,756
My dad sold me to the
Complex when I was a kid.

555
00:51:46,756 --> 00:51:50,547
I don't have anything in this world.

556
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:52,547
But this.

557
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:54,839
It's not a life that's
growing in your womb.

558
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:56,006
It's an experiment.

559
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,381
There's no need to get sentimental.

560
00:51:59,256 --> 00:52:00,839
It's born to a lab experiment.

561
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:02,047
Not a father.

562
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:05,214
But it will be born to a mother.

563
00:52:07,214 --> 00:52:08,547
So, what's the plan?

564
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:11,297
How many days can you hide it?

565
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,964
You will be exposed soon.

566
00:52:17,297 --> 00:52:18,464
Please.

567
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:21,506
I want to...

568
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:24,214
keep this.

569
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,422
What an epic fight, Bhairava!

570
00:52:31,464 --> 00:52:33,589
We share so many stories about you.

571
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:36,756
Didn't you lose a single
fight till now? Really?

572
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:39,381
Bujji, I like this one.

573
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:43,089
Bhairava, please let me go.

574
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:45,089
I don't like him, Bhairava.

575
00:52:45,464 --> 00:52:48,089
You can't sell me, boss. You're my hero.

576
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:50,214
Better kill me.

577
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:54,131
Sorry, boss. I'll get only
half the units if I kill you.

578
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,714
You just called me a hero.

579
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,047
I'll get you a scrumptious last meal.

580
00:52:58,381 --> 00:53:00,297
No need. It's a waste of units.

581
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:01,589
Chintu!

582
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:05,214
My best friend.

583
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:08,089
He sells the best food in Kashi.

584
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:12,047
Hey, Chintu. What's today's special?

585
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,131
-Your death.
-Shut up!

586
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:17,631
You're here for your units?
They are safe with me.

587
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:23,839
I'll return your money as
soon as I go to the Complex.

588
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:24,922
You know it!

589
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:26,464
I swear on you!

590
00:53:26,506 --> 00:53:32,256
I'm 101% sure that you lie 99% of the time.

591
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:36,714
This is what you tell everyone
in Kashi. Give me a break.

592
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:41,547
What's that?

593
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:45,631
It's fresh out of the Complex.

594
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:46,881
I want it.

595
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,172
Don't think so highly of yourself, mate.

596
00:53:49,214 --> 00:53:51,089
It's worth 5000 units.

597
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:53,047
Take this inside, Subbalakshmi.

598
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:55,131
Here. 5000 units.

599
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:10,422
Wow! You fought so
hard and bought an egg?

600
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:12,214
It's a real egg, Bujji.

601
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,256
Whatever.

602
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:15,047
Now forget about going to the Complex.

603
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:19,047
We can earn only an egg
with these petty bounties.

604
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,172
If we want to go to the Complex,

605
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,672
we need to hit a jackpot, Bujji.

606
00:54:25,714 --> 00:54:27,672
Boss, can I take a look?

607
00:54:29,006 --> 00:54:30,214
No, you cannot.

608
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:35,672
We need to preserve this
in a high security zone, Bujji.

609
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:38,089
By the way, what's with the name Bujji?

610
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:39,131
Is it a nickname?

611
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:41,589
Bionic User Josen Intelligence.

612
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:44,422
I used to pilot the Complex
ships once upon a time.

613
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:45,464
Look at me now.

614
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:47,839
I pulled you out of the
junkyard and gave you a body.

615
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,756
Show some gratitude.

616
00:54:49,964 --> 00:54:51,006
A little.

617
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:54,006
We don't need gratitude, Bhairava.
 We need units.

618
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:57,006
Bhairava, why don't
you join forces with us?

619
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,256
Will you pay me more units?

620
00:54:59,256 --> 00:55:01,631
Come on! Everything isn't about the units.

621
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:02,922
Do it for the greater good.

622
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:04,839
Fight on our side for a better tomorrow.

623
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:07,881
I've fought on all sides, boss.

624
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:11,006
No matter who wins,

625
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:14,756
this is how people like us end up.

626
00:55:15,172 --> 00:55:16,631
I finally realized something.

627
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,131
There's only one side
to be on in the world.

628
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:23,464
Your own side.

629
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,797
Selfish side.

630
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,839
I was orphaned at a war.

631
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,131
A pilot saved me.

632
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:46,839
Apparently, I didn't cry a bit.

633
00:55:46,881 --> 00:55:48,672
As if I was acquainted with war.

634
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:10,214
The pilot taught me everything.

635
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,714
How to survive in this world.

636
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,172
How to fight.

637
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,256
Everything.

638
00:56:19,672 --> 00:56:23,256
The Complex announced a
bounty on him due to his actions.

639
00:56:35,881 --> 00:56:38,381
You lost everything. What's left to give?

640
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:50,131
Will you send him with me?

641
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:01,256
He thought of selling me
and entering the Complex.

642
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,631
Bhairava!

643
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:09,922
Sorry.

644
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:15,089
But he forgot that I
was his student after all.

645
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:20,006
I'm sorry, Captain.

646
00:57:24,256 --> 00:57:27,506
I helped capture him
before he could sell me.

647
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:34,464
You're right.

648
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,797
This is how you're
supposed to live in this world.

649
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:39,339
Don't change.

650
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:52,672
Sorry, boss.

651
00:57:53,214 --> 00:57:55,714
I didn't know you had such
a sentimental flashback.

652
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:58,672
Ask him again next week.
He'll narrate a different flashback.

653
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:01,672
Alert! Alert!

654
00:58:01,714 --> 00:58:03,214
Forced entry at home location.

655
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:05,089
Door broken. Three armed men.

656
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:05,672
Come.

657
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:07,256
Please let me go, boss.

658
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:09,214
Boss, please!

659
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:20,797
What do you hope to find, guys?

660
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,881
There's nothing here.
He sold everything ages ago.

661
00:58:24,339 --> 00:58:26,047
If someone were interested,

662
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,964
he would've sold me as well long back.

663
00:58:30,964 --> 00:58:32,714
Who would buy you, man?

664
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:35,256
How much will your
oxygen cylinder sell for?

665
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:36,547
Nothing at all.

666
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,922
Not a single unit.

667
00:58:40,256 --> 00:58:41,631
It's been empty for a while now.

668
00:58:41,797 --> 00:58:43,839
He uses it by force of habit.

669
00:58:44,714 --> 00:58:47,964
Of course, it's empty. You used it all up.

670
00:58:48,422 --> 00:58:49,881
When I rented you this place,

671
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:52,172
Rent.

672
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:53,881
Wow!

673
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:55,922
What a sweet word!

674
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:57,922
Did you ever pay rent?

675
00:58:57,964 --> 00:59:00,756
Hi, Ronnie. Did you come
so far for just 10,000 units?

676
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:02,714
Hold on. I just got done with a fight.

677
00:59:03,256 --> 00:59:06,339
I'll pay you first as
soon as I get the money.

678
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:08,672
What about me?

679
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:09,881
Hey, Leon.

680
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,006
Where did you come from?

681
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:15,506
I want my 20,000 units right now.

682
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:18,464
Otherwise, I'll take your car.

683
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,797
Please do that.

684
00:59:20,797 --> 00:59:22,297
I'll kill you, old man!

685
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:24,297
What will you do with
this piece of junk, sir?

686
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:26,881
Your units are completely safe with me.

687
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:28,589
I'll pay you back.

688
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:31,297
I promise.

689
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:33,589
What's the value of your promise, Bhairava?

690
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,381
Hey, Roxie!

691
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:44,131
He'll return my units first.

692
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:49,172
After that, I don't care if you
whack him or kill him even.

693
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:50,922
Roxie...

694
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:54,922
How many units do you want? Tell me.

695
00:59:55,547 --> 00:59:57,089
Let me take you home.

696
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,131
What?

697
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,131
Will you take me home too?

698
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,756
Bhairava, I got to go, okay?

699
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:10,464
Wait up, sir. Collect your units.

700
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:12,256
It's okay. I'll see you later.

701
01:00:15,464 --> 01:00:17,047
Nice. Correct.

702
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:18,422
He deserves it.

703
01:00:20,006 --> 01:00:21,547
I hope you're not hurt.

704
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:27,256
Hey, Roxie...

705
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:32,422
Roxie, I really missed you.

706
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:35,506
I thought you wanted me.

707
01:00:35,547 --> 01:00:37,714
But you're only after my units.

708
01:00:39,547 --> 01:00:42,006
I would never have to see your face again.

709
01:00:42,297 --> 01:00:44,006
I got a job at the Complex.

710
01:00:56,672 --> 01:01:00,089
Roxie, Roxie, Roxie... Please.

711
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:02,131
God, take my eyesight away!

712
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:03,756
Everyday...

713
01:01:04,214 --> 01:01:05,964
I keep thinking about you.

714
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:09,672
Then tell me where we met the first time.

715
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:10,964
He's screwed!

716
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:15,047
Well, the sand bike...

717
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,797
You forgot, didn't you?

718
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,589
How could I forget, Roxie?

719
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:21,214
It's very important.

720
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:23,297
No way I'd forget, Roxie.

721
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:25,506
-Bujji...
-Hello. Don't involve me.

722
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:29,797
Don't you want kids, Roxie?

723
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:34,214
Are you really going to the Complex?

724
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:35,172
Yeah.

725
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:39,089
-Please take me along.
-Why?

726
01:01:39,964 --> 01:01:42,464
Because I like you, Roxie.

727
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:43,464
That's a lie!

728
01:01:43,464 --> 01:01:45,756
You like only yourself, Bhairava.

729
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:47,714
You're the most selfish guy in the world.

730
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:49,881
Correct. Correct. Correct.

731
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:51,631
Still, take me along for a day.

732
01:01:51,631 --> 01:01:53,297
Even a minute or second would do.

733
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:56,172
Take me to the Complex
and I'll do anything you want.

734
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:57,756
Okay, fine.

735
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,339
Tell me you love me like you mean it.

736
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:09,297
I love you.

737
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:18,672
I love you.

738
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,422
You can't do any better than that.

739
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:33,047
Hey... 9 AM, East Gate.
See you tomorrow.

740
01:02:34,131 --> 01:02:37,381
Yeah!

741
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:38,756
Yeah!

742
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:50,381
Supreme has sent orders to try again.

743
01:02:50,381 --> 01:02:52,922
We're giving you another chance.

744
01:02:53,756 --> 01:02:55,922
Even if one of you
turns out to be positive,

745
01:02:56,714 --> 01:02:58,172
it means we're successful.

746
01:02:58,631 --> 01:03:01,006
All of you will go through
seeding tomorrow.

747
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:04,172
If Supreme's mercy is upon you,

748
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:06,797
you all could be positive too.

749
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:08,172
Good luck.

750
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,881
Hey, it's this way.

751
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:34,006
Not this way?

752
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:43,089
Roxie. Work permit for 70 days.

753
01:03:43,131 --> 01:03:45,339
He's the temporary
worker that I registered.

754
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:49,464
Bhairava. Work permit for 60 minutes.

755
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:51,464
What? Only an hour?

756
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:53,089
Be grateful. Now let's go.

757
01:04:05,547 --> 01:04:07,339
Thank you. Thank you.

758
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:33,756
Come. This is our floor.

759
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:44,214
This generator room is
like the Sun of the Complex.

760
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,547
This is where all the energy is generated.

761
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:50,589
It sucks all the energy from the Earth.

762
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:02,881
Bhairava, let's go.

763
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:05,464
We got a lot of work to do.

764
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:11,881
I can't waste my one hour here.

765
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:13,881
I didn't come to the
Complex for this. Let's go.

766
01:05:13,881 --> 01:05:15,631
But, no, no, no!

767
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,089
It's my fault that I helped you.

768
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:21,589
How selfish!

769
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:24,881
I'm going to lose my job.

770
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,589
Hey, hello.

771
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:28,881
What are you looking at?

772
01:05:29,006 --> 01:05:29,964
Hello!

773
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:35,881
Very pretty.

774
01:05:37,797 --> 01:05:39,089
Let's go, Bhairava.

775
01:05:40,047 --> 01:05:41,089

788
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:59,172
Counsellor Bani, we've found
nothing of this kind before.

789
01:09:59,214 --> 01:10:01,006
Despite our team's relentless efforts,

790
01:10:01,006 --> 01:10:03,339
we're unable to identify the material.

791
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:10,881
What's happening?

792
01:10:39,839 --> 01:10:40,922
What?

793
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:46,172
Please.

794
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:50,089
Help.

795
01:10:56,922 --> 01:10:58,922
Give it to me. It's okay.

796
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:05,881
Sorry.

797
01:12:42,547 --> 01:12:44,547
Let me go! Let me go!

798
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:18,506
This is a miracle.

799
01:13:18,547 --> 01:13:21,547
Finally, we found a woman who
can carry the formula for 150 days.

800
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,714
The baby in her womb is
growing rapidly than a regular one.

801
01:13:25,964 --> 01:13:29,256
At this rate, she'll deliver the baby soon.

802
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,381
Supreme has zero
interest in growing babies.

803
01:13:33,506 --> 01:13:35,422
Prep her for extraction.

804
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:19,589
They shot you, didn't they?

805
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,339
You were supposed to die.

806
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:25,422
Death is certain for the one who is born.

807
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:28,297
Though you're speaking in
Telugu, I don't understand it.

808
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:30,964
I guess it's the generation gap.

809
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:34,006
-What's your name?
-Go away!

810
01:14:34,214 --> 01:14:35,506
My name is Raia.

811
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:39,047
I've never seen a human being like you.

812
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:41,297
You fought incredibly well!

813
01:14:43,797 --> 01:14:47,589
Rebels will easily win the
war with a soldier like you.

814
01:14:47,964 --> 01:14:49,881
In war,

815
01:14:50,589 --> 01:14:52,756
only death wins.

816
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,089
This isn't my war.

817
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:58,797
Hello! How long have you been out?

818
01:14:58,839 --> 01:15:00,672
Do you know what the situation is like?

819
01:15:01,006 --> 01:15:03,922
Do you have any idea how
many people you could save?

820
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:05,964
My purpose is to save...

821
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,422
only one person.

822
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,172
Only one!

823
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:49,131
Supreme wanted a 120 days old serum.

824
01:15:49,881 --> 01:15:51,672
But you are...

825
01:15:53,172 --> 01:15:55,797
I'll take this serum to Supreme personally.

826
01:16:05,381 --> 01:16:06,589
Please let me go!

827
01:16:07,339 --> 01:16:09,256
Please don't hurt me.

828
01:16:16,797 --> 01:16:17,964
Please stop!

829
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:43,131
Where did she go?

830
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:10,631
That was close.

831
01:18:10,672 --> 01:18:12,922
Sorry, there was no
other way to get you out.

832
01:18:15,006 --> 01:18:16,881
I thought it was all over.

833
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:20,381
I was terrified that my baby would die.

834
01:18:20,422 --> 01:18:22,631
You ignored the fact
that you could've died.

835
01:18:22,672 --> 01:18:24,672
That's what makes you special, M 80.

836
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:28,547
I messaged my people. They must be waiting.

837
01:18:29,506 --> 01:18:30,839
Your people?

838
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:32,672
Who are you?

839
01:18:34,922 --> 01:18:36,047
I'm a Rebel.

840
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:37,881
From Shambala.

841
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,131
I was a spy at the lab for 2 years.

842
01:18:41,756 --> 01:18:45,381
I watched many horrific
incidents and still did nothing.

843
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:47,922
I convinced myself that
I'm on a different mission.

844
01:18:50,297 --> 01:18:51,297
But...

845
01:18:51,881 --> 01:18:53,297
after seeing you,

846
01:18:53,339 --> 01:18:56,881
there was no bigger
mission than saving you.

847
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:00,547
Let's go.

848
01:19:02,381 --> 01:19:03,256
Geez!

849
01:19:03,714 --> 01:19:04,797
That was embarrassing.

850
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:07,964
Don't worry, Bhairava. You don't
have much respect to begin with.

851
01:19:09,172 --> 01:19:10,922
You don't have a heart, Bujji.

852
01:19:12,589 --> 01:19:14,089
Brother, give my drink back.

853
01:19:15,172 --> 01:19:16,547
What kind of a drink is this?

854
01:19:16,756 --> 01:19:18,089
The Complex has amazing stuff.

855
01:19:19,006 --> 01:19:19,922
Tastes like nectar.

856
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,672
Have that and give my drink back.

857
01:19:21,714 --> 01:19:23,547
-Hold on.
-Give my drink back.

858
01:19:23,589 --> 01:19:24,839
You gave me liquor.

859
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:29,214
But I gave you the
chance to give me liquor.

860
01:19:29,506 --> 01:19:30,839
That's how big my heart is.

861
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:37,047
What's my future, Bujji?

862
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:40,089
How long should I drink
cheap liquor with the locals?

863
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:44,631
Do you want to know your future?

864
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:45,839
Fifty.

865
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:47,381
Fifty units only.

866
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:49,089
Fifty.

867
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:51,589
Start talking. I'll see.

868
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:53,131
Hey, pretty parrot!

869
01:19:53,506 --> 01:19:55,839
Predict Bhairava's future.

870
01:20:07,964 --> 01:20:13,172
I've never seen such
a card in my entire life.

871
01:20:14,631 --> 01:20:16,922
Your life is about to change.

872
01:20:16,922 --> 01:20:19,047
So I'll go to the Complex. Thanks.

873
01:20:19,089 --> 01:20:21,506
They're all frauds,
Bhairava. Don't believe them.

874
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:22,881
Bujji, listen.

875
01:20:23,089 --> 01:20:25,047
Don't demean our culture.

876
01:20:25,631 --> 01:20:27,256
There are so many things
beyond our understanding.

877
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:31,547
A big obstacle awaits you.

878
01:20:31,589 --> 01:20:32,839
I don't believe in all this.

879
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:33,797
Let's go, Bujji.

880
01:20:37,047 --> 01:20:39,506
Kashi has an underground tunnel network.

881
01:20:40,672 --> 01:20:42,339
The Complex isn't aware of it.

882
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,756
If you want to leave the labs unnoticed,

883
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,089
this is the only way.

884
01:20:47,506 --> 01:20:48,589
There it is.

885
01:20:48,672 --> 01:20:51,297
My people will be waiting at that tunnel.

886
01:21:15,256 --> 01:21:16,589
There's no time, M 80.

887
01:21:16,631 --> 01:21:19,089
Hurry up! This tunnel is your way out.

888
01:21:31,006 --> 01:21:32,047
Hurry up!

889
01:21:38,047 --> 01:21:39,381
What are you looking at? Go!

890
01:21:39,422 --> 01:21:41,797
-What about you?
-I'll be fine.

891
01:21:41,922 --> 01:21:42,881
Hey.

892
01:21:43,506 --> 01:21:44,881
Good luck to the both of you.

893
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:12,256
Lilly contacted for the first
time after going undercover.

894
01:22:13,172 --> 01:22:15,339
So it must be something really important.

895
01:22:16,339 --> 01:22:18,006
Maybe we should go inside.

896
01:22:18,547 --> 01:22:19,422
Come.

897
01:22:21,089 --> 01:22:23,089
Shut up and get in the truck, you two.

898
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:25,339
We've lost so many of us already.

899
01:22:27,089 --> 01:22:29,089
We're returning to Shambala immediately.

900
01:22:46,964 --> 01:22:48,089
Do you hear that?

901
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,547
Err...

902
01:22:50,589 --> 01:22:51,672
No.

903
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:53,047
What is it?

904
01:23:04,339 --> 01:23:05,881
The day River Ganga...

905
01:23:06,797 --> 01:23:09,881
is devoid of its last drop.

906
01:23:09,964 --> 01:23:11,672
What are you talking about?

907
01:23:22,547 --> 01:23:24,006
When this gem...

908
01:23:33,964 --> 01:23:36,672
...reaches its way back to you,

909
01:23:37,797 --> 01:23:39,964
It's time.

910
01:23:40,214 --> 01:23:41,589
Time for what?

911
01:23:49,006 --> 01:23:51,797

What do you guys think of me, huh?

925
01:25:15,964 --> 01:25:17,881
Do you know who you're
demanding money from?

926
01:25:19,756 --> 01:25:21,464
Do you even know who I am?

927
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:24,547
The Great Bhairava!

I am Dronacharya's son.

931

My name is Ashwathama.

932
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:18,797

When the time comes,

939
01:26:40,672 --> 01:26:42,672
You'll see for yourself...

940
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,172
that all these stories are true.

941
01:26:49,297 --> 01:26:50,756
And that God will return.

942
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:02,756
Something has changed, Bujji.

943
01:27:13,589 --> 01:27:15,381
They're fully fried.

944
01:27:15,672 --> 01:27:16,922
We didn't find the girl, sir.

945
01:27:17,756 --> 01:27:19,589
Should I go look for her?

946
01:27:20,089 --> 01:27:21,047
Go!

947
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:27,631
Nobody can find out about this.

948
01:27:29,964 --> 01:27:31,089
Commander Manas.

949
01:27:32,506 --> 01:27:34,172
Bani is calling you.

950
01:27:34,756 --> 01:27:35,839
Why?

951
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,006
Did he find out?

952
01:27:38,047 --> 01:27:39,589
I don't know, sir.

953
01:27:56,089 --> 01:27:57,131
Recently,

954
01:27:57,214 --> 01:28:02,631
did you notice anything
unusual in Kashi or at the labs?

955
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:07,797
What is this?

956
01:28:08,797 --> 01:28:11,006
-Gaandeevam.
-What's that?

957
01:28:11,131 --> 01:28:15,256
A weapon created by the
Creator himself, Lord Brahma.

958
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:19,881
The man who knows how
to use this can defeat God.

959
01:28:20,172 --> 01:28:21,131
Really?

960
01:28:34,089 --> 01:28:35,839
Since last night,

961
01:28:35,839 --> 01:28:39,672
no human or machine could
come anywhere near this.

962
01:28:40,339 --> 01:28:42,381
Something is happening, Manas.

963
01:28:42,964 --> 01:28:44,797
We need to be alert.

964
01:28:45,214 --> 01:28:47,506
I'm sure everything
has a scientific reason.

965
01:28:47,506 --> 01:28:51,381
This is beyond our
scientific knowledge, Manas.

966
01:28:51,547 --> 01:28:54,339
A new power has been awakened.

967
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:19,047
You've been at the lab for so long.

968
01:29:19,256 --> 01:29:20,797
This is how the outside air is.

969
01:29:21,339 --> 01:29:22,672
Put on the oxygen mask.

970
01:29:26,589 --> 01:29:27,756
What happened to Lilly?

971
01:29:31,006 --> 01:29:31,839
I don't know.

972
01:29:31,881 --> 01:29:33,256
Why did she save you?

973
01:29:35,964 --> 01:29:37,006
I don't know.

974
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:42,006
What do they do at the labs?

975
01:29:43,256 --> 01:29:44,756
What's Project K?

976
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,214
How can you be so clueless?

977
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:50,881
Say something.

978
01:30:07,422 --> 01:30:09,214
Hey, slowly.

979
01:30:09,339 --> 01:30:10,756
There's a pregnant woman on board.

980
01:30:10,797 --> 01:30:14,172
I don't remember the last time I
saw a woman being this pregnant.

981
01:30:14,672 --> 01:30:16,297
Poor girl. Did you scare her?

982
01:30:18,256 --> 01:30:20,547
How can she say
'I don't know' to everything?

983
01:30:20,672 --> 01:30:22,839
Remember what Mariam used to tell.

984
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:25,256
Do you think she's the
woman from her stories?

985
01:30:25,756 --> 01:30:26,756
I don't know.

986
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:30,631
How can you say
'I don't know' to everything?

987
01:30:31,422 --> 01:30:32,464
Here.

988
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:34,881
I'll go say hi to her.

989
01:30:44,256 --> 01:30:45,881
He may come off as harsh but...

990
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:47,381
Veeran's a good man.

991
01:30:49,839 --> 01:30:51,256
Are you trying to scare her?

992
01:30:51,297 --> 01:30:53,214
Where are you guys taking me?

993
01:30:53,756 --> 01:30:57,589
Listen, it's dangerous for you
to be out there with this belly.

994
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:59,172
So, we're going to Shambala.

995
01:30:59,214 --> 01:31:01,589
You and your baby will be safe there.

996
01:31:03,381 --> 01:31:05,089
Can I touch it once?

997
01:31:05,506 --> 01:31:07,006
Kyra, stop!

998
01:31:07,422 --> 01:31:08,672
You're creeping her out.

999
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,964
Sorry, I...

1000
01:31:11,006 --> 01:31:14,381
I mean, we grew up
listening to Mariam's stories.

1001
01:31:14,756 --> 01:31:18,047
She's been waiting for you since forever.

1002
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:19,297
For me?

1003
01:31:19,339 --> 01:31:20,464
Not just Mariam.

1004
01:31:20,506 --> 01:31:24,547
Her mother, grandmother and
everyone else have been waiting for you.

1005
01:31:24,964 --> 01:31:27,131
We know everything about you.

1006
01:31:27,172 --> 01:31:29,047
Well, what's your name?

1007
01:31:29,381 --> 01:31:31,506
Please don't tell me that you don't know.

1008
01:31:32,964 --> 01:31:34,172
We don't have names.

1009
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:38,297
Serial number SU-M80.

1010
01:31:39,006 --> 01:31:40,797
Oh, SUM80.

1011
01:31:40,839 --> 01:31:42,881
Hi. My name is Kyra.

1012
01:31:42,881 --> 01:31:44,214
My dad gave me that name.

1013
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,422
It means 'Good luck' in some language.

1014
01:31:46,964 --> 01:31:50,839
He died in the Complex
raid the day after I was born.

1015
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,922
Maybe not so lucky for him. Yeah.

1016
01:31:54,547 --> 01:31:57,964
That guy cleaning the gun
like a psycho over there...

1017
01:31:57,964 --> 01:31:59,756
That's Ajju. My partner.

1018
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:02,047
-Partner?
-Yeah.

1019
01:32:02,881 --> 01:32:04,464
By partner, I mean...

1020
01:32:05,214 --> 01:32:06,714
Yeah, he's mine.

1021
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:10,131
Let me see a smile, Ajju.

1022
01:32:10,131 --> 01:32:11,464
Please. A small one.

1023
01:32:11,881 --> 01:32:14,256
They killed so many of us, Kyra.

1024
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:17,172
As long as the Complex exists,

1025
01:32:17,589 --> 01:32:19,172
how can one smile?

1026
01:32:20,589 --> 01:32:22,422
From the inside, dude.

1027
01:32:22,422 --> 01:32:25,131
You can still find a
reason to smile. Come on.

1028
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:28,047
I'll smile after I kill
everyone at the Complex.

1029
01:32:28,172 --> 01:32:29,089
Okay?

1030
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:32,714
He's such a charming fellow.

1031
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,589
Sometimes I forget what
I saw in him in the first place.

1032
01:32:35,797 --> 01:32:38,964
We're getting married
after reaching Shambala.

1033
01:32:39,006 --> 01:32:40,922
I guess that makes you
the Chief Guest GU40.

1034
01:32:40,964 --> 01:32:42,589
GU40. G 40.

1035
01:32:43,047 --> 01:32:44,047
What's marriage?

1036
01:32:44,089 --> 01:32:45,339
Oh, right.

1037
01:32:45,547 --> 01:32:47,631
You're not aware of any of this.

1038
01:32:48,006 --> 01:32:50,714
Marriage is an old tradition.

1039
01:32:50,839 --> 01:32:52,964
You circle around fire...

1040
01:32:53,172 --> 01:32:56,797
and promise each other
to live together forever.

1041
01:32:57,006 --> 01:32:58,089
And then?

1042
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,089
And then...

1043
01:33:00,131 --> 01:33:01,631
And then...

1044
01:33:01,797 --> 01:33:02,881
That's it.

1045
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:05,256
They live together.

1046
01:33:05,256 --> 01:33:07,839
They build a house, have pet dogs, kids.

1047
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:11,714
Does it sound silly?

1048
01:33:12,714 --> 01:33:13,714
No.

1049
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,589
It sounds nice.

1050
01:33:15,797 --> 01:33:16,839
I know, right.

1051
01:33:17,839 --> 01:33:21,797
Everyone should have their
person in this crazy world.

1052
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:25,589
Humanity is one big family,

1053
01:33:26,006 --> 01:33:28,881
we should fight for the
greater good, that's all fine.

1054
01:33:29,006 --> 01:33:30,047
But...

1055
01:33:30,631 --> 01:33:33,131
You should have someone
you can call your own.

1056
01:33:34,922 --> 01:33:37,297
Someone's hand to hold.

1057
01:33:37,339 --> 01:33:39,506
Someone's shoulder to lean on.

1058
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:43,172
That sense of belongingness hits different.

1059
01:33:45,714 --> 01:33:47,589
Smile now at least.

1060
01:33:50,922 --> 01:33:52,506
You're cute, GU 40.

1061
01:33:52,547 --> 01:33:53,631
GU 40...

1062
01:33:53,672 --> 01:33:56,256
Kyra, her name is SU-M80.

1063
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:58,756
What kind of a name is SU-M80?

1064
01:33:58,756 --> 01:34:00,089
It's not even a real name.

1065
01:34:01,547 --> 01:34:04,297
Umm... SU-M80.

1066
01:34:04,339 --> 01:34:05,756
SUM80.

1067
01:34:05,797 --> 01:34:06,714
Umm... Sumathi.

1068
01:34:06,756 --> 01:34:07,756
Sumathi?

1069
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:09,339
Sumathi...

1070
01:34:11,131 --> 01:34:12,089
Sumathi.

1071
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:13,464
It's a bit old-fashioned.

1072
01:34:13,464 --> 01:34:15,672
But it's better than SU-M80.

1073
01:34:20,464 --> 01:34:21,672
Don't be scared.

1074
01:34:26,589 --> 01:34:27,631
I see a Raider.

1075
01:34:27,672 --> 01:34:29,631
Let him come. We got this.

1076
01:34:30,047 --> 01:34:31,172
Sometimes, you don't need this.

1077
01:34:31,214 --> 01:34:32,464
You need this to win.

1078
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:49,672
This is so far away from your village.

1079
01:34:50,922 --> 01:34:53,714
Where are you guys
coming from? I want the truth.

1080
01:34:53,714 --> 01:34:56,339
We came in the hopes to
find some scrap to sell, sir.

1081
01:35:00,256 --> 01:35:02,339
The competition is quite less here.

1082
01:35:04,006 --> 01:35:05,839
A woman has escaped from the labs.

1083
01:35:08,631 --> 01:35:09,964
With the help of a Rebel.

1084
01:35:11,547 --> 01:35:12,756
Do you know where she is?

1085
01:35:12,797 --> 01:35:15,339
Sir, we make a living out of selling scrap.

1086
01:35:15,339 --> 01:35:17,256
We don't know anything.

1087
01:35:18,131 --> 01:35:19,339
Open the back.

1088
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:21,797
There's nothing back there, sir.

1089
01:35:22,547 --> 01:35:24,131
We had kind of a rough day, sir.

1090
01:35:24,131 --> 01:35:25,672
We couldn't find any scrap.

1091
01:35:26,006 --> 01:35:28,006
Maybe I'll find something.

1092
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:32,339
I can pay you some units if you want.

1093
01:35:32,381 --> 01:35:33,839
I said open the back!

1094
01:35:34,047 --> 01:35:35,672
Okay, sir. Okay, sir.

1095
01:35:49,964 --> 01:35:52,297
-There's nothing here.
-I told you, sir.

1096
01:35:55,339 --> 01:35:57,297
Yeah, you're really trash.

1097
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:02,631
Let's go.

1098
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,297
Didn't I tell you already?

1099
01:36:11,339 --> 01:36:13,131
There's nothing in there, sir.

1100
01:36:20,214 --> 01:36:21,422
There's nothing, sir.

1101
01:36:31,172 --> 01:36:31,964
Boom.

1102
01:36:47,672 --> 01:36:49,797
He has sent a bounty alert. Get up.

1103
01:36:50,256 --> 01:36:52,131
It's time to pick up the gun.

1104
01:36:57,089 --> 01:36:58,589
Now's the time to fire the guns.

1105
01:37:15,089 --> 01:37:16,089
Dude...

1106
01:37:16,547 --> 01:37:18,047
Tell me this.

1107
01:37:19,006 --> 01:37:20,714
The entire house is empty.

1108
01:37:20,964 --> 01:37:22,506
So is your car.

1109
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:24,506
Why don't you sleep over there?

1110
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:26,506
Do you have to sleep here only?

1111
01:37:27,922 --> 01:37:29,464
My life is over there.

1112
01:37:30,797 --> 01:37:31,922
Hey, old man.

1113
01:37:32,006 --> 01:37:34,381
Guess what I'll do once
I enter the Complex.

1114
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:36,506
Do whatever the hell you want.

1115
01:37:36,547 --> 01:37:37,756
But pay my rent first.

1116
01:37:37,756 --> 01:37:38,756
No, listen.

1117
01:37:38,964 --> 01:37:40,756
Once I enter the Complex,

1118
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:43,506
I'll breathe in kilos of fresh air.

1119
01:37:44,006 --> 01:37:45,714
-Let me...
-Hey, back off.

1120
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:47,506
You took my food.

1121
01:37:47,506 --> 01:37:48,797
You occupied my bed.

1122
01:37:48,839 --> 01:37:50,881
Now you want to steal all the oxygen?

1123
01:37:50,964 --> 01:37:51,839
Listen.

1124
01:37:52,214 --> 01:37:54,131
Let's come to an understanding.

1125
01:37:54,422 --> 01:37:57,131
Find a nice girl and settle down in life.

1126
01:37:57,381 --> 01:37:59,672
How long will you stay in my house?

1127
01:37:59,672 --> 01:38:01,506
Do you think I love staying with you?

1128
01:38:01,714 --> 01:38:04,506
One big bounty. One shot.

1129
01:38:04,881 --> 01:38:07,089
-I'll go to the Complex.
-And do what?

1130
01:38:08,631 --> 01:38:11,339
I'll live happily over there.

1131
01:38:11,714 --> 01:38:14,714
Happiness should come from within.

1132
01:38:15,214 --> 01:38:16,506
It came.

1133
01:38:16,631 --> 01:38:19,881
You'll only get cough
from within if you stay here.

1134
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:22,422
I can't live here anymore. I'll leave soon.

1135
01:38:25,047 --> 01:38:26,464
Bhairava, five star bounty.

1136
01:38:26,464 --> 01:38:28,339
Rebel chase in process. Let's go!

1137
01:38:29,006 --> 01:38:30,672
It's a jackpot, old man.

1138
01:38:31,006 --> 01:38:33,297
It's time to pay your rent.

1139
01:38:49,214 --> 01:38:51,339
A Raider vehicle is
already headed this way.

1140
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:57,047
I'll handle the Raider.

1141
01:38:58,547 --> 01:38:59,506
Use it.

1142
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:07,422
I'll go after him. You stay here.

1143
01:39:11,339 --> 01:39:12,422
For tomorrow.

1144
01:39:15,464 --> 01:39:17,047
Hey, Sumathi. Don't worry.

1145
01:39:17,089 --> 01:39:18,797
Kyra means Lucky, remember?

1146
01:39:23,547 --> 01:39:24,631
I'll be right back.

1147
01:39:51,256 --> 01:39:52,172
Where did she go?

1148
01:40:00,339 --> 01:40:01,422
Hi, guys.

1149
01:40:02,214 --> 01:40:03,256
Catch.

1150
01:40:04,256 --> 01:40:05,631
Ah, good catch!

1151
01:40:19,631 --> 01:40:23,047
If you don't stop that truck,
you'll be the first to die.

1152
01:41:26,256 --> 01:41:27,589
Veeran!

1153
01:41:42,214 --> 01:41:43,214
Ajju...

1154
01:43:09,422 --> 01:43:11,547
Sumathi, did you get scared?

1155
01:43:12,047 --> 01:43:13,964
Didn't I tell you that I'm lucky?

1156
01:43:33,464 --> 01:43:34,589
Ajju...

1157
01:43:51,756 --> 01:43:53,256
Let me see a smile, Ajju.

1158
01:43:55,172 --> 01:43:56,589
Kyra!

1159
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:14,131
Ajju.

1160
01:44:18,047 --> 01:44:19,297
Ajju, what's wrong?

1161
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:22,839
Kyra...

1162
01:44:23,047 --> 01:44:24,172
Kyra...

1163
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,131
Four teams in pursuit of bounty.

1164
01:44:34,256 --> 01:44:35,339
We're the last ones.

1165
01:44:35,797 --> 01:44:38,339
Chances of success, 0.18%.

1166
01:44:38,339 --> 01:44:41,131
Bujji, can you clarify a doubt for me?

1167
01:44:41,131 --> 01:44:42,297
Sure. Go ahead.

1168
01:44:42,339 --> 01:44:45,089
How can you fit so much
negativity in that small brain?

1169
01:44:45,964 --> 01:44:49,172
Never mind. I'm getting
really good vibes today.

1170
01:44:54,214 --> 01:44:55,339
Who's that?

1171
01:45:03,172 --> 01:45:05,381
Hi, sir. I haven't seen you in a while.

1172
01:45:05,464 --> 01:45:06,714
What's with the shaved head?

1173
01:45:06,756 --> 01:45:07,756
No, it looks nice.

1174
01:45:10,339 --> 01:45:11,589
Sir, sir, sir!

1175
01:45:13,839 --> 01:45:16,922
You took the car parts
promising to work for me.

1176
01:45:17,339 --> 01:45:19,506
How long will you keep running from me?

1177
01:45:19,672 --> 01:45:21,339
It's just car parts, sir.
I'll dismantle them again.

1178
01:45:21,339 --> 01:45:22,464
I don't consent to that.

1179
01:45:23,547 --> 01:45:25,797
I'm not here for the car parts.

1180
01:45:25,922 --> 01:45:27,339
I'm here for you.

1181
01:45:28,214 --> 01:45:31,381
Damn! I'm screwed for
5 years if he catches me.

1182
01:45:31,506 --> 01:45:33,089
Bujji, full speed.

1183
01:45:33,131 --> 01:45:34,672
We're at maximum speed.

1184
01:45:34,672 --> 01:45:37,672
Then turn on flight mode.

1185
01:45:37,714 --> 01:45:38,964
It's not ready yet.

1186
01:45:39,006 --> 01:45:40,172
To hell with you!

1187
01:45:40,214 --> 01:45:43,131
For once in life, just for today,

1188
01:45:43,172 --> 01:45:44,381
just be positive.

1189
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:46,589
It's an order.

1190
01:45:47,089 --> 01:45:48,589
Flight mode on.

1191
01:45:58,964 --> 01:46:00,339
Hey, Bhairava!

1192
01:46:00,631 --> 01:46:02,089
I'll find you again.

1193
01:46:02,131 --> 01:46:04,006
And this time, I'll lock
you up for 10 years.

1194
01:46:04,006 --> 01:46:05,047
10 years!

1195
01:46:05,131 --> 01:46:06,547
You can't catch me!

1196
01:46:07,381 --> 01:46:09,381
Always trust your boss, Bujji.

1197
01:46:09,797 --> 01:46:11,589
Everything will be alright.

1198
01:46:12,964 --> 01:46:14,256
Warning! Warning!

1199
01:46:14,297 --> 01:46:15,881
Flight system failure!

1200
01:46:16,006 --> 01:46:17,881
Bhairava! Bhairava!

1201
01:46:25,672 --> 01:46:27,339
Can I sound negative now?

1202
01:46:42,589 --> 01:46:43,797
Hey, Ajju!

1203
01:46:44,922 --> 01:46:46,047
Ajju, come here.

1204
01:47:48,547 --> 01:47:50,547
Ajju! Ajju! Ajju!

1205
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:53,297
Ajju!

1206
01:47:55,339 --> 01:47:57,631
There's a woman in the truck. Go get her.

1207
01:48:00,214 --> 01:48:01,297
Will you save her?

1208
01:48:03,256 --> 01:48:04,714
Who will save you?

1209
01:48:12,964 --> 01:48:14,047
Hi, guys.

1210
01:48:14,297 --> 01:48:15,881
Sorry, did I disturb you?

1211
01:48:17,006 --> 01:48:19,589
I suggest you drop the guns and leave.

1212
01:48:22,047 --> 01:48:24,381
I'm saying it for your own good.

1213
01:48:24,422 --> 01:48:25,631
Should we listen to you now?

1214
01:48:25,672 --> 01:48:27,297
Not me. My teacher.

1215
01:48:36,839 --> 01:48:38,131
She's here.

1216
01:48:39,506 --> 01:48:41,214
I can sense that she's here.

1217
01:48:41,922 --> 01:48:45,547
Hey, old man. You look like you're
retired and approaching death.

1218
01:48:45,547 --> 01:48:46,881
You could use some help.

1219
01:48:47,214 --> 01:48:48,547
Fire!

1220
01:48:54,256 --> 01:48:56,506
I guess your war has begun again.

1221
01:48:56,756 --> 01:48:57,964
War?

1222
01:49:01,006 --> 01:49:02,756
This isn't like war to me.

1223
01:49:03,714 --> 01:49:06,839
It's like the worship of
weapons before going to war.

1224
01:49:33,547 --> 01:49:34,714
Hi.

1225
01:49:35,589 --> 01:49:36,922
Is he okay?

1226
01:49:39,089 --> 01:49:40,381
How come you're here?

1227
01:49:42,172 --> 01:49:43,506
Where's the gem?

1228
01:50:09,422 --> 01:50:10,464
Hi.

1229
01:50:11,714 --> 01:50:13,006
My name is Raia.

1230
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:14,797
What's your name?

1231
01:50:16,297 --> 01:50:17,422
Sumathi.

1232
01:50:19,547 --> 01:50:20,547
Don't be scared.

1233
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:22,631
My teacher has got this.

1234
01:51:24,256 --> 01:51:25,422
Amma...

1235
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:04,172
Bujji, what's happening exactly?

1236
01:52:04,214 --> 01:52:05,964
We're travelling upside down.

1237
01:52:12,756 --> 01:52:15,464
-Who's that giant man?
-Angry giant man.

1238
01:52:15,464 --> 01:52:17,589
He destroyed all the Raiders.

1239
01:52:21,422 --> 01:52:22,756
He cut down my work by half.

1240
01:52:22,797 --> 01:52:23,756
Is the bounty there?

1241
01:52:23,797 --> 01:52:25,547
The bounty is in the back of the truck.

1242
01:52:25,589 --> 01:52:29,256
Bujji, ask the Complex to open their gates.

1243
01:52:29,256 --> 01:52:30,797
I am coming!

1244
01:52:42,006 --> 01:52:43,797
I'll have a real egg in the Complex.

1245
01:52:44,172 --> 01:52:45,881
And a plate full of food.

1246
01:52:48,339 --> 01:52:50,464
I'll also swim in the sea.

1247
01:52:53,714 --> 01:52:55,797
Massage.

1248
01:52:56,047 --> 01:52:57,172
At the complex...

1249
01:52:58,297 --> 01:52:59,839
Do you think they have nectar?

1250
01:53:02,797 --> 01:53:04,922
Woah! The girl from the Complex.

1251
01:53:14,589 --> 01:53:15,464
Hi.

1252
01:53:16,131 --> 01:53:17,006
Hi.

1253
01:53:18,589 --> 01:53:19,589
Bye.

1254
01:54:04,464 --> 01:54:05,922
Hi.

1255
01:54:32,797 --> 01:54:35,714
He's hitting hard, Bujji. Let's leave.

1256
01:54:37,506 --> 01:54:39,256
My Complex...

1257
01:55:06,672 --> 01:55:08,714
Where have you come from, sir?

1258
01:55:10,922 --> 01:55:12,006
Stay there.

1259
01:55:38,214 --> 01:55:40,714
Okay. That's enough.

1260
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:20,422
Hey! Love you, Bujji!

1261
01:56:28,297 --> 01:56:30,256
Bujji is back, old man.

1262
01:56:43,464 --> 01:56:44,631
Bhairava!

1263
01:57:26,839 --> 01:57:28,756
He's a tough nut, the old man.

1264
01:57:42,672 --> 01:57:43,797
Not again!

1265
01:58:42,881 --> 01:58:44,131
Statue!

1266
01:59:20,464 --> 01:59:22,506
150 days.

1267
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:25,464
A formula we deemed impossible.

1268
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:31,214
Where's the serum that
was extracted from her?

1269
01:59:31,214 --> 01:59:33,297
We could extract only a drop, Bani.

1270
01:59:33,714 --> 01:59:35,631
Please don't tell Supreme.

1271
01:59:36,506 --> 01:59:38,256
We almost had her.

1272
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:41,381
There was an old man who was 8 feet tall.

1273
01:59:43,506 --> 01:59:46,464
He was untouched despite
firing several rounds at him.

1274
01:59:47,297 --> 01:59:49,839
Did he have a gem on his forehead?

1275
01:59:52,381 --> 01:59:53,339
Yes.

1276
01:59:54,964 --> 01:59:57,047
It looked like some sort of light.

1277
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,172
Ashwathama!

1278
02:00:01,797 --> 02:00:04,547
He wasn't born in this period of time.

1279
02:00:04,714 --> 02:00:06,547
He is immortal.

1280
02:00:07,339 --> 02:00:09,714
The puranaas are coming true.

1281
02:00:10,256 --> 02:00:13,631
Ashwathama, the pregnant woman,

1282
02:00:13,964 --> 02:00:15,631
Gaandeevam.

1283
02:00:16,464 --> 02:00:20,797
God created this weapon
when he was on Earth.

1284
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:26,047
After God left, the weapons
eventually lost their power.

1285
02:00:26,339 --> 02:00:29,672
If that power has returned now,

1286
02:00:30,256 --> 02:00:33,547
it means that God is coming back.

1287
02:00:34,256 --> 02:00:36,672
He is growing inside that woman's womb.

1288
02:00:36,714 --> 02:00:40,089
I've heard my fair share
of these silly stories.

1289
02:00:40,381 --> 02:00:43,839
Some God will appear on a white horse.

1290
02:00:44,506 --> 02:00:47,589
Our ancestors put it quite intelligently.

1291
02:00:48,464 --> 02:00:52,631
The white horse here
refers to his birth star.

1292
02:00:53,131 --> 02:00:58,214
The 'Khadga Ashwini' star that
appears once in every 6000 years.

1293
02:00:59,672 --> 02:01:03,922
All the planets are going
to align in a few days,

1294
02:01:04,089 --> 02:01:07,006
leading to a rare eclipse formation.

1295
02:01:07,006 --> 02:01:10,089
The darkest day in 6000 years.

1296
02:01:10,131 --> 02:01:12,797
The last day before the
star disappears again.

1297
02:01:12,839 --> 02:01:15,881
If the baby isn't born before that,

1298
02:01:15,881 --> 02:01:21,797
the star won't appear
for another 6000 years.

1299
02:01:21,964 --> 02:01:24,297
We need to stop this at any cost.

1300
02:01:24,339 --> 02:01:26,881
Otherwise, it's a threat to Supreme's life.

1301
02:01:41,381 --> 02:01:42,256
Where is it?

1302
02:01:44,672 --> 02:01:45,672
Hello.

1303
02:01:45,672 --> 02:01:47,006
There's no road ahead.

1304
02:01:47,506 --> 02:01:48,839
We'll crash into the mountain.

1305
02:01:51,464 --> 02:01:52,839
Ashwa uncle, help!

1306
02:02:04,964 --> 02:02:07,464
Mariam, Mariam, Mariam!

1307
02:02:07,922 --> 02:02:10,797
Mariam, a huge...

1308
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:14,131
A 7 feet tall giant.

1309
02:02:14,131 --> 02:02:16,006
What are you saying? Be clear.

1310
02:02:16,006 --> 02:02:17,631
The Mother has arrived.

1311
02:02:24,464 --> 02:02:25,506
What happened?

1312
02:02:26,881 --> 02:02:27,881
Where's Kyra?

1313
02:02:28,422 --> 02:02:30,006
Where's everyone else?

1314
02:02:33,631 --> 02:02:34,756
For tomorrow.

1315
02:02:41,297 --> 02:02:42,672
Hey, drop him.

1316
02:02:42,714 --> 02:02:43,547
Drop him!

1317
02:02:44,839 --> 02:02:46,172
Drop the gun.

1318
02:02:46,297 --> 02:02:47,089
Drop it!

1319
02:02:47,131 --> 02:02:48,964
Sir, they're one of us.

1320
02:02:48,964 --> 02:02:50,047
Sir... Sir...

1321
02:02:51,131 --> 02:02:53,131
Hey! I said drop the gun!

1322
02:02:53,714 --> 02:02:54,547
Drop it!

1323
02:02:56,089 --> 02:02:56,964
Sir.

1324
02:03:05,047 --> 02:03:05,922
Come.

1325
02:03:07,922 --> 02:03:09,797
Veeran, who is this?

1326
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:11,339
I don't know.

1327
02:03:12,464 --> 02:03:13,381
But,

1328
02:03:13,922 --> 02:03:15,506
he's definitely not our enemy.

1329
02:03:39,547 --> 02:03:41,881
Is she the woman who escaped from the lab?

1330
02:03:46,422 --> 02:03:48,422
Why did you bring her here?

1331
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:51,589
A 5 million bounty has
been announced on her.

1332
02:03:52,506 --> 02:03:56,297
The whole world, including
the Complex is after her.

1333
02:03:56,422 --> 02:03:57,964
How will you save her?

1334
02:03:58,006 --> 02:03:59,547
I will save her.

1335
02:04:02,047 --> 02:04:03,339
Who the hell are you?

1336
02:04:03,381 --> 02:04:04,797
Being tall isn't enough.

1337
02:04:04,797 --> 02:04:06,506
Have you ever been to war?

1338
02:04:06,631 --> 02:04:07,547
Excuse me.

1339
02:04:07,589 --> 02:04:11,047
He fought a war with Sri
Krishna in Mahabharata.

1340
02:04:13,422 --> 02:04:16,214
Maybe we can take her to the flux lands.

1341
02:04:16,672 --> 02:04:17,797
They can't track us there.

1342
02:04:18,506 --> 02:04:20,714
The Nomens will eat her.

1343
02:04:20,714 --> 02:04:23,631
Veeran, I want her
out of here this instant.

1344
02:04:23,756 --> 02:04:25,256
She will not be going anywhere.

1345
02:04:31,172 --> 02:04:34,256
Sometimes, even my belief was shook.

1346
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:38,506
The Mother has arrived.

1347
02:04:39,047 --> 02:04:40,547
She came to her maternal home...

1348
02:04:41,047 --> 02:04:42,464
to give birth to God.

1349
02:04:44,047 --> 02:04:46,381
Tell Shambala the Mother has arrived.

1350
02:04:52,756 --> 02:04:53,797
Hey, stop!

1351
02:04:54,089 --> 02:04:54,964
Stop!

1352
02:04:56,297 --> 02:04:57,839
Has everybody gone crazy?

1353
02:04:59,131 --> 02:05:03,047
Do you realize that her presence
has just put us all in danger?

1354
02:05:04,922 --> 02:05:09,131
She's an ordinary pregnant
woman who escaped from the lab.

1355
02:05:09,256 --> 02:05:10,922
There's nothing special about her.

1356
02:05:12,964 --> 02:05:14,089
Moreover,

1357
02:05:14,964 --> 02:05:17,381
how can you claim that
God is going to be born?

1358
02:05:18,089 --> 02:05:19,256
What's the proof?

1359
02:05:28,589 --> 02:05:29,631
Do you remember...

1360
02:05:30,881 --> 02:05:32,006
the last time it rained?

1361
02:05:45,589 --> 02:05:46,839
For tomorrow.

1362
02:06:45,506 --> 02:06:47,797
Ashwa uncle, I can't see anything.

1363
02:07:29,797 --> 02:07:30,839
Listen, dear.

1364
02:07:32,297 --> 02:07:35,256
Shambala has waited a long time for you.

1365
02:07:38,506 --> 02:07:41,464
We're ready to do anything for you.

1366
02:07:43,297 --> 02:07:44,214
Tell us.

1367
02:07:44,381 --> 02:07:45,714
What do you want?

1368
02:07:46,547 --> 02:07:47,881
I'm hungry.

1369
02:07:55,631 --> 02:07:57,672
This tree is like a temple to us.

1370
02:08:20,922 --> 02:08:23,256
It's clean water. You can drink it.

1371
02:08:25,214 --> 02:08:26,214
Take it.

1372
02:08:41,631 --> 02:08:43,381
How is all of this here?

1373
02:08:43,881 --> 02:08:47,256
The compass that found you was from here.

1374
02:08:48,381 --> 02:08:50,089
That's the point this tree grew from.

1375
02:08:52,672 --> 02:08:55,589
And that's how Shambala
came to life around this tree.

1376
02:08:56,089 --> 02:08:58,881
Just when we were concerned
about losing that life energy,

1377
02:08:59,339 --> 02:09:00,422
you showed up.

1378
02:09:03,339 --> 02:09:05,297
Shambala's belief came true.

1379
02:09:07,256 --> 02:09:09,672
Hereafter, everything will be fine.

1380
02:09:22,589 --> 02:09:23,631
Where's the old man?

1381
02:09:23,881 --> 02:09:26,339
He's the guy who hit us.

1382
02:09:26,756 --> 02:09:29,672
She escaped because of him.

1383
02:09:41,714 --> 02:09:44,089
Bhairava, you're blacklisted.

1384
02:09:46,422 --> 02:09:48,214
We're seizing all your units.

1385
02:09:49,089 --> 02:09:51,256
You're permanently banned from the Complex.

1386
02:10:08,756 --> 02:10:09,631
What's wrong?

1387
02:10:09,797 --> 02:10:11,297
I lost.

1388
02:10:11,714 --> 02:10:13,006
For the first time.

1389
02:10:14,006 --> 02:10:15,006
Impossible!

1390
02:10:15,506 --> 02:10:16,506
I don't believe you.

1391
02:10:19,506 --> 02:10:20,381
Go.

1392
02:10:22,297 --> 02:10:23,381
What?

1393
02:10:23,797 --> 02:10:24,714
Are you letting me go?

1394
02:10:24,756 --> 02:10:26,881
When did you become such a saint?

1395
02:10:27,797 --> 02:10:29,297
He's a good guy, sir.

1396
02:10:29,797 --> 02:10:31,797
Bujji, give him those 500 units.

1397
02:10:32,339 --> 02:10:33,422
He'll grab a bite.

1398
02:10:33,881 --> 02:10:36,214
Are you going to pay my rent as well?

1399
02:10:36,797 --> 02:10:38,506
If so, please inform me in advance.

1400
02:10:38,756 --> 02:10:40,131
My heart is delicate.

1401
02:10:41,881 --> 02:10:45,214
I'll do some work and
pay your rent, old man.

1402
02:10:48,672 --> 02:10:52,006
I fought a great deal to go to
the Complex all these days.

1403
02:10:54,172 --> 02:10:55,339
It's all over now.

1404
02:11:01,881 --> 02:11:04,172
I finally gained a sense of clarity.

1405
02:11:05,672 --> 02:11:07,006
This is my life right here.

1406
02:11:09,131 --> 02:11:10,464
I don't have anybody.

1407
02:11:12,922 --> 02:11:14,964
Nobody needs me.

1408
02:11:20,464 --> 02:11:21,839
We need you, Bhairava.

1409
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:24,256
You shouldn't stay back here.

1410
02:11:24,964 --> 02:11:26,797
Come with me to Shambala.

1411
02:11:27,381 --> 02:11:28,881
Shambala...

1412
02:11:30,131 --> 02:11:31,172
You go.

1413
02:11:33,089 --> 02:11:35,089
Who would take me inside anyway?

1414
02:11:35,464 --> 02:11:36,839
Hey, I'll talk to them.

1415
02:11:37,214 --> 02:11:39,422
You're a hero to so many others like me.

1416
02:11:39,797 --> 02:11:41,047
Come be on our side, Bhairava.

1417
02:11:41,089 --> 02:11:42,256
Don't hesitate. Let's go.

1418
02:11:43,464 --> 02:11:44,714
Damn, those rebels!

1419
02:11:45,089 --> 02:11:46,714
They must've taken her to Shambala.

1420
02:11:47,172 --> 02:11:48,756
I want that woman!

1421
02:11:48,756 --> 02:11:52,047
We've sent Raiders in
every direction, Commander.

1422
02:11:52,297 --> 02:11:53,214
We'll catch her.

1423
02:11:53,256 --> 02:11:54,506
You can't do shit.

1424
02:11:56,006 --> 02:11:58,589
You can't do shit as long
as that old man is with her.

1425
02:11:58,797 --> 02:11:59,922
Old man?

1426
02:12:00,172 --> 02:12:02,172
He's the one who thrashed your men.

1427
02:12:02,214 --> 02:12:04,422
Nobody could lay their hand on him.

1428
02:12:06,339 --> 02:12:07,714
Except for me.

1429
02:12:08,672 --> 02:12:09,922
Who is this guy?

1430
02:12:10,381 --> 02:12:12,547
He's Bhairava, sir. A bounty hunter.

1431
02:12:12,881 --> 02:12:14,381
He hit our Raiders.

1432
02:12:14,714 --> 02:12:15,964
I blacklisted him.

1433
02:12:16,172 --> 02:12:17,881
Now that you've blacklisted me anyway,

1434
02:12:17,964 --> 02:12:19,006
let me hit again.

1435
02:12:25,631 --> 02:12:28,756
The point is, only I can bring her back.

1436
02:12:30,547 --> 02:12:32,214
You have no option.

1437
02:12:32,881 --> 02:12:34,131
How can you be so sure?

1438
02:12:35,256 --> 02:12:36,839
Check my records.

1439
02:12:37,339 --> 02:12:39,547
I haven't lost a single fight till now.

1440
02:12:40,589 --> 02:12:42,589
I won't lose this one either.

1441
02:12:43,339 --> 02:12:44,131
Alright.

1442
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:45,839
I'll give you one chance.

1443
02:12:46,839 --> 02:12:48,547
If you bring her back,

1444
02:12:48,839 --> 02:12:52,547
I'll personally hold your hand
and take you inside the Complex.

02:15:02,631 --> 02:15:04,631
Give her some space.

1451
02:15:10,589 --> 02:15:12,339
Let's throw this cane away now.

1452
02:15:12,839 --> 02:15:15,214
We'll get you a kickass weapon in Shambala.

1453
02:15:15,422 --> 02:15:17,714
This isn't an ordinary cane.

1454
02:15:18,922 --> 02:15:21,214
It's my weapon from an ancient war.

1455
02:15:21,381 --> 02:15:23,964
So, tell me. How was your war like?

1456
02:15:23,964 --> 02:15:26,381
Was it more depressing
than the current wars?

1457
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:30,631
Were there a lot of casualties?

1458
02:15:32,339 --> 02:15:34,922
Anyway, I'm sure you were the best fighter.

1459
02:15:34,964 --> 02:15:36,172
No one can beat you.

1460
02:15:37,797 --> 02:15:39,547
No, I lost.

1461
02:15:44,547 --> 02:15:45,714
Really?

1462
02:15:46,339 --> 02:15:47,797
Who defeated you?

1463
02:15:47,797 --> 02:15:50,339
The Weirder of Gaandeeva. Kunthi's son.

1464
02:15:50,922 --> 02:15:52,006
Arjuna.

1465
02:16:00,339 --> 02:16:01,756
Ashwathama!

1466
02:16:02,422 --> 02:16:05,797
This is the Gaandeevam made
by the Creator, Brahma.

1467
02:16:05,964 --> 02:16:08,172
Nobody can fight it.

1468
02:16:11,672 --> 02:16:14,547
Oh. So I take it Arjun is the best?

1469
02:16:15,297 --> 02:16:16,172
No.

1470
02:16:19,214 --> 02:16:21,214
There was another warrior.

1471
02:16:21,339 --> 02:16:23,381
More powerful than Arjuna?

1472
02:16:23,714 --> 02:16:24,631
Yes.

1473
02:16:26,964 --> 02:16:28,797
He was my brother.

1474
02:16:28,839 --> 02:16:30,089
What happened to him?

1475
02:16:30,339 --> 02:16:31,464
Karma.

1476
02:16:33,172 --> 02:16:34,672
He met with a miserable death.

1477
02:16:35,131 --> 02:16:37,589
A warrior like him didn't deserve it.

1478
02:16:38,714 --> 02:16:41,797
This weapon belonged to him.

1479
02:16:43,381 --> 02:16:45,589
It's more powerful than...

1480
02:16:46,506 --> 02:16:48,797
Arjuna's Gaandeevam.

1481
02:16:51,089 --> 02:16:52,131
Wow!

1482
02:16:53,422 --> 02:16:56,506
Then why don't you use it?

1483
02:16:56,506 --> 02:16:58,881
It works only in his hands.

1484
02:17:00,422 --> 02:17:02,006
Without him,

1485
02:17:02,756 --> 02:17:04,672
this weapon is powerless.

1486
02:17:05,964 --> 02:17:09,714
Right now, this is as good
as an old man's walking stick.

1487
02:17:20,256 --> 02:17:22,797
Bhairava, you exhausted
all your units on me.

1488
02:17:22,797 --> 02:17:24,672
Your current balance is zero.

1489
02:17:24,714 --> 02:17:25,922
Are you doing the right thing?

1490
02:17:25,964 --> 02:17:26,881
Are you sure?

1491
02:17:29,547 --> 02:17:30,547
Bhairava...

1492
02:18:51,922 --> 02:18:52,839
Where do you think you're going?

1493
02:18:52,881 --> 02:18:55,339
I'll follow you wherever you go, amma.

1494
02:18:55,464 --> 02:18:57,547
Why is everyone calling me 'amma'?

1495
02:18:57,589 --> 02:18:59,381
They say that...

1496
02:18:59,964 --> 02:19:02,172
the entire universe resides within God.

1497
02:19:02,547 --> 02:19:05,631
But that God resides within you.

1498
02:19:07,464 --> 02:19:11,047
What else can we call you if not 'amma'?

1499
02:19:13,339 --> 02:19:14,422
As you please.

1500
02:19:14,797 --> 02:19:16,881
But I need to get out of here.

1501
02:19:16,881 --> 02:19:18,464
There's a threat to your life.

1502
02:19:18,506 --> 02:19:21,006
I don't think so. In fact,
I'm a threat to everyone.

1503
02:19:21,006 --> 02:19:22,797
People around me end up dying.

1504
02:19:23,047 --> 02:19:24,339
I won't die.

1505
02:19:30,672 --> 02:19:32,547
The gun was in my hand.

1506
02:19:32,964 --> 02:19:35,839
Kyra would've been alive if I had fired it.

1507
02:19:36,006 --> 02:19:39,172
You were born to bring
another life into this world.

1508
02:19:39,714 --> 02:19:40,714
You can't cause someone's death.

1509
02:19:40,714 --> 02:19:42,339
What are you even talking about?

1510
02:19:43,256 --> 02:19:46,422
For a baby who hasn't
taken its first breath yet,

1511
02:19:46,589 --> 02:19:48,381
how many more people need to die?

1512
02:19:48,631 --> 02:19:51,422
Every death has a higher purpose.

1513
02:19:53,339 --> 02:19:57,547
This baby will give life to the world.

1514
02:20:01,047 --> 02:20:02,672
But why am I the chosen one?

1515
02:20:08,797 --> 02:20:11,422
God gives his biggest responsibilities...

1516
02:20:12,131 --> 02:20:14,756
to the ones who can fulfill them.

1517
02:20:17,297 --> 02:20:20,631
To carry God in your womb...

1518
02:20:22,047 --> 02:20:24,881
takes patience that of Mother Earth.

1519
02:20:26,256 --> 02:20:28,547
Because you possess that kind of patience,

1520
02:20:28,547 --> 02:20:31,297
he chose you as the Mother.

1521
02:20:36,297 --> 02:20:38,964
Birthing a new life is your duty.

1522
02:20:38,964 --> 02:20:40,964
Protecting you is my responsibility.

1523
02:20:47,672 --> 02:20:48,922
Are you sure?

1524
02:20:49,631 --> 02:20:50,881
Do you remember the way?

1525
02:20:52,256 --> 02:20:53,672
I was born there, Bhairava.

1526
02:20:53,839 --> 02:20:55,089
Of course, I remember.

1527
02:21:02,756 --> 02:21:04,172
We're almost there.

1528
02:21:04,756 --> 02:21:07,839
Go straight at full speed.

1529
02:21:10,047 --> 02:21:11,422
There's nothing ahead, Bhairava.

1530
02:21:11,464 --> 02:21:13,339
All I see is a mountain on my sensors.

1531
02:21:13,589 --> 02:21:15,422
Trust me, Bhairava. Let's go.

1532
02:21:15,464 --> 02:21:17,047
It's dangerous to be out here for long.

1533
02:21:17,047 --> 02:21:19,506
If we crash ahead, even
our parts won't be found.

1534
02:21:19,506 --> 02:21:20,631
Let's go back.

1535
02:21:25,839 --> 02:21:27,589
No going back now!

1536
02:21:44,172 --> 02:21:45,714
Welcome to Shambala.

1537
02:21:50,339 --> 02:21:51,464
Luke, is that you?

1538
02:21:52,047 --> 02:21:53,339
-Relax, guys!
-Who is he?

1539
02:21:53,964 --> 02:21:54,964
He's Bhairava.

1540
02:21:55,006 --> 02:21:56,297
He's a great fighter.

1541
02:21:56,297 --> 02:21:57,672
He's on our side now.

1542
02:21:57,714 --> 02:21:59,506
Hmm. Does Veeran know?

1543
02:21:59,506 --> 02:22:01,381
I'm taking him to Veeran now.

1544
02:22:01,506 --> 02:22:03,089
Okay. Follow me.

1545
02:22:03,089 --> 02:22:04,172
What about me?

1546
02:22:04,964 --> 02:22:07,089
I'll finish the formalities
and be right back.

1547
02:22:08,256 --> 02:22:09,672
Take care of the car.

1548
02:22:09,922 --> 02:22:11,881
I fixed it just a while ago.

1549
02:22:15,381 --> 02:22:17,714
That's one massive set-up
centered in the mountains.

1550
02:22:18,506 --> 02:22:21,297
Kudos to you for keeping it a
secret from the Complex for so long.

1551
02:22:21,506 --> 02:22:22,381
This way.

1552
02:22:23,339 --> 02:22:24,547
How's everyone?

1553
02:22:25,381 --> 02:22:26,339
It rained.

1554
02:22:26,339 --> 02:22:28,172
What? Are you serious?

1555
02:22:28,339 --> 02:22:30,714
Like Mariam said, the Mother has arrived.

1556
02:22:31,256 --> 02:22:32,131
Where is she?

1557
02:22:32,506 --> 02:22:33,547
She's at the tree.

1558
02:22:33,881 --> 02:22:35,422
It rained, the Mother arrived,

1559
02:22:35,422 --> 02:22:36,464
and now you're here too.

1560
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:38,506
See, Bhairava. Everything's changing.

1561
02:22:42,756 --> 02:22:43,714
Sorry, kid.

1562
02:22:53,089 --> 02:22:54,339
We need to go.

1563
02:22:55,047 --> 02:22:56,589
It's dangerous to be here.

1564
02:25:28,672 --> 02:25:30,839
I came prepared this time, old man.

1565
02:25:30,881 --> 02:25:31,714
Let's go!

1566
02:25:54,756 --> 02:25:55,839
Fire!

1567
02:26:37,297 --> 02:26:39,089
Hello, Shambala!

1568
02:26:39,881 --> 02:26:41,172
I caught you!

1569
02:26:41,839 --> 02:26:42,881
Veeran...

1570
02:26:43,256 --> 02:26:44,172
Go.

1571
02:26:47,839 --> 02:26:49,422
-Let's go!
-Come!

1572
02:26:50,631 --> 02:26:51,964
Let's go!

1573
02:26:53,214 --> 02:26:54,214
Come.

1574
02:26:54,256 --> 02:26:55,839
Get out of the way, old man.

1575
02:26:56,172 --> 02:26:57,339
There's no time.

1576
02:27:18,339 --> 02:27:19,631
Bujji!

1577
02:27:24,964 --> 02:27:27,214
Yes! I won!

1578
02:28:31,589 --> 02:28:33,589
Oh, no! Force field?

1579
02:28:34,339 --> 02:28:35,506
What do we do now?

1580
02:28:52,214 --> 02:28:54,381
Go get her.

1581
02:29:02,006 --> 02:29:03,839
Sirius, are you ready?

1582
02:29:05,589 --> 02:29:07,006
For tomorrow.

1583
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:20,964
The darkness that we've
been fighting this whole time...

1584
02:29:20,964 --> 02:29:23,672
now stands at our doorstep.

1585
02:29:25,631 --> 02:29:26,839
What should we do?

1586
02:29:28,339 --> 02:29:29,672
Should we run away?

1587
02:29:31,672 --> 02:29:32,797
Or should we fight?

1588
02:29:32,839 --> 02:29:33,839
We should fight!

1589
02:29:33,839 --> 02:29:36,089
-So, shall we fight?
-Yes, let's fight!

1590
02:29:47,964 --> 02:29:49,506
For tomorrow.

1591
02:30:32,256 --> 02:30:33,131
Mom!

1592
02:32:41,381 --> 02:32:42,547
For tomorrow.

1593
02:32:59,047 --> 02:33:01,047
Hurry up. There's no time.

1594
02:33:04,089 --> 02:33:05,047
Garuda One.

1595
02:33:05,672 --> 02:33:06,964
Take off immediately.

1596
02:33:09,547 --> 02:33:11,256
Help! Help!

1597
02:33:11,797 --> 02:33:13,756
-Help!
-Too many of them are left behind.

1598
02:33:14,089 --> 02:33:16,214
First you need to get out of here. Move!

1599
02:33:29,589 --> 02:33:30,881
Take off immediately!

1600
02:33:31,089 --> 02:33:32,339
What about you?

1601
02:33:32,506 --> 02:33:34,547
Go. That's an order.

1602
02:33:39,756 --> 02:33:40,714
Andrew!

1603
02:34:03,922 --> 02:34:06,547
What are you doing? Why did you get down?

1604
02:34:06,964 --> 02:34:09,047
Garuda One. Land right now.

1605
02:38:05,922 --> 02:38:08,172
I want to kill you right here, right now.

1606
02:38:09,547 --> 02:38:11,506
But Supreme insisted that...

1607
02:38:13,047 --> 02:38:15,506
he would kill you and your baby.

1608
02:38:46,172 --> 02:38:47,547
You called the baby God, right?

1609
02:38:49,089 --> 02:38:51,506
Is there nobody else to save her?

1610
02:39:55,756 --> 02:39:57,297
Blow him to hell.

1611
02:40:51,922 --> 02:40:54,714
Did I take too long, Son of Acharya?

1612
02:42:58,339 --> 02:43:00,131
Bhairava, we got to hurry.

1613
02:43:04,922 --> 02:43:07,256
Hey, girl from the labs.

1614
02:43:07,339 --> 02:43:08,714
What are you doing here?

1615
02:43:13,047 --> 02:43:15,339
Bujji, the old man is trapped.

1616
02:43:17,756 --> 02:43:19,839
Let's run away.

1617
02:43:27,797 --> 02:43:29,839
Please don't take me inside the Complex.

1618
02:43:30,547 --> 02:43:32,672
Flight mode on. Ready for take off.

1619
02:43:33,381 --> 02:43:34,339
Brother!

1620
02:43:34,589 --> 02:43:36,922
Bujji, the old man is coming back.

1621
02:43:47,339 --> 02:43:48,214
Full throttle!

1622
02:43:48,256 --> 02:43:50,256
Bhairava, we're already running on reserve.

1623
02:43:50,422 --> 02:43:51,839
Hold on, brother!

1624
02:43:53,214 --> 02:43:54,589
Listen to me.

1625
02:43:58,422 --> 02:44:01,464
No, Bhairava! We don't
know where that will take us.

1626
02:44:16,672 --> 02:44:17,839
Who's that?

1627
02:44:18,631 --> 02:44:19,964
Ashwathama,

1628
02:44:20,714 --> 02:44:23,714
this is the Gaandeevam
created by the Creator, Brahma.

1629
02:44:24,297 --> 02:44:26,547
Nobody can fight it.

1630
02:45:16,297 --> 02:45:18,631
Did I take too long, Son of Acharya?

1631
02:45:18,714 --> 02:45:19,756
No.

1632
02:45:20,339 --> 02:45:22,881
You came at the right time, my brother.

1633
02:45:37,047 --> 02:45:38,381
See that, Kesava?

1634
02:45:39,131 --> 02:45:40,672
How can he be my equal?

1635
02:45:41,297 --> 02:45:44,714
He could push our
chariot back by only 2 feet.

1636
02:45:45,714 --> 02:45:48,881
But my weapon pushed
his chariot back by 10 feet.

1637
02:45:50,756 --> 02:45:52,172
O' Dhanunjaya!

1638
02:45:52,381 --> 02:45:54,672
Your chariot is a blessing
from the God of Fire.

1639
02:45:56,714 --> 02:45:59,631
Guarding it is Lord Hanuman,
as symbolized on the flag.

1640
02:46:01,922 --> 02:46:04,506
Riding it is me, the Master
of all three worlds.

1641
02:46:09,381 --> 02:46:12,131
He still managed to push it back by 2 feet.

1642
02:46:12,506 --> 02:46:14,089
Think about it, Arjuna.

1643
02:46:15,756 --> 02:46:17,839
He's not an ordinary warrior.

1644
02:46:18,047 --> 02:46:20,422
I see the radiance of the Sun in his eyes.

1645
02:46:22,464 --> 02:46:25,422
In his hand is the Vijaya Bow,
which stands undefeated till date.

1646
02:46:37,006 --> 02:46:39,506
History will not forget his name.

1647
02:46:42,922 --> 02:46:44,964
The Descendant of the Sun.

1648
02:46:45,672 --> 02:46:46,797
Karna!

1649
02:47:08,797 --> 02:47:10,922
A mistake has been made, Supreme.

1650
02:47:11,089 --> 02:47:13,964
The woman who carried
the formula for 150 days...

1651
02:47:14,006 --> 02:47:16,256
has escaped from the labs.

1652
02:47:16,797 --> 02:47:19,214
This is what they extracted from her.

1653
02:47:22,547 --> 02:47:24,047
Just one drop.

1654
02:47:46,297 --> 02:47:48,047
Something is happening.

1655
02:47:48,172 --> 02:47:50,589
The Gaandeevam that nobody can touch.

1656
02:47:51,256 --> 02:47:53,714
The immortal Ashwathama.

1657
02:47:54,006 --> 02:47:56,131
A force beyond everyone's understanding.

1658
02:47:56,506 --> 02:47:57,631
Some...

1659
02:47:58,256 --> 02:47:59,297
Some...

1660
02:47:59,881 --> 02:48:01,547
new power.

1661
02:48:59,506 --> 02:49:02,214
If a single drop encompasses such power,

1662
02:49:02,506 --> 02:49:04,631
I completely understand now, Supreme.

1663
02:49:04,922 --> 02:49:07,422
I'll go get that woman back.

1664
02:49:08,047 --> 02:49:09,047
No.

1665
02:49:10,047 --> 02:49:11,214
I'll go get her myself.

1666
02:49:27,797 --> 02:49:32,089
The Lord is arriving on his chariot!

1667
02:49:36,797 --> 02:49:41,381
I will cause destruction to thee!

1668
02:49:42,964 --> 02:49:45,339
I will cause an earthquake!

1669
02:49:45,381 --> 02:49:47,797
I will cause an earthquake!

1670
02:49:47,839 --> 02:49:49,922
I will cause an earthquake!
