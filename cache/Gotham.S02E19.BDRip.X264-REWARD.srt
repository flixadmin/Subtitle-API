1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,090
Oh, crud.

3
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:08,510
<i>He killed my mother, Jim.
He had her murdered in front of me.</i>

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,178
I am going to kill you.

5
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:11,763
<i>I think I found something.</i>

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>The week of his murder, he was supposed to
meet a woman named Karen Jennings</i>

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,060
<i>about something called Pinewood Farms.</i>

8
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:20,647
<i>Pinewood Farms was a bioengineering
program at Wayne Enterprises.</i>

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,232
<i>It started up again, didn't it?</i>

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,275
<i>That's why my father came to see you
after all those years.</i>

11
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:27,112
<i>Karen Jennings is gonna be dead
the minute she hits Blackgate Prison.</i>

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,279
<i>That's why we're gonna break her out.</i>

13
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,157
The man who contracted Matches Malone
to kill your parents

14
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,617
called himself The Philosopher.

15
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,578
And I'd be willing to bet that this
is the man who is behind Pinewood.

16
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,831
<i>"Hugo Strange, The Philosopher."</i>

17
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,457
He runs Arkham now.

18
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,126
We brought someone back.

19
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,546
Azrael!

20
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,215
We actually did it.

21
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:04,649
Rally to me.

22
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:08,069
St. Dumas will deliver us.

23
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,323
<i>St. Dumas will protect us.</i>

24
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,075
Heathens!

25
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,452
Idolaters!

26
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,538
Spawn of Satan. Prepare to die.

27
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:24,753
Don't, don't. No, don't. Please.
Sister, speak to me, please.

28
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,379
Please, speak to me.

29
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,759
Who are you? Huh? Who are you?

30
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,845
Has there been any improvement
since he woke up yesterday?

31
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,138
No.

32
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,515
But he is wonderful, isn't he?

33
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:44,272
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Strong as an ox, fast as a snake.

34
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,857
And mad as a hatter.

35
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:51,988
There's not much use bringing back
the dead if they come back crazy.

36
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,573
Oh, he's not crazy.

37
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,909
He just doesn't know who he is.

38
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,370
His psyche can't reconcile
being brought back from the dead.

39
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,624
<i>It's fractured,
grasping at fragmented memories.</i>

40
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:07,045
The texts that he has written on the walls
are all verses from this book.

41
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,423
<i>"The Will and Order of St. Dumas"?</i>

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,928
The Galavan family is proudly descended
from 12th century crusading knights.

43
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,013
This is their secret text.

44
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:20,725
Evidently, our patient has memorized
the whole book.

45
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:24,729
<i>His brain is struggling to rebuild
a coherent self.</i>

46
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:28,691
- But he's using the wrong parts.
- So, what's the cure?

47
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,861
Good question.

48
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,662
What is it?

49
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,375
Mr. Gordon.

50
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:50,588
Professor Strange.
Sorry to drop by unexpected.

51
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,549
Oh, not at all. Please, have a seat.

52
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,094
To what do I owe the pleasure?

53
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,638
I've been hired by a client
to look into something.

54
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,765
- I was hoping you could help me with it.
- Of course.

55
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,976
This is Karen Jennings.

56
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,770
<i>She was murdered last night.</i>

57
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,357
- Oh, how tragic.
- She was a test subject

58
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,278
in an old Wayne Enterprises program
called Pinewood Farms.

59
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:17,031
Before she passed, Karen mentioned
you were involved with the program.

60
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,827
- That was a long time ago.
- Try and remember...

61
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,997
If you can.

62
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,460
Pinewood Farms was started by Thomas Wayne
in an attempt to cure

63
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,255
humanity's greatest ailments
on the genetic level.

64
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,051
- Old age, disease, even death.
- But that's not what happened, is it?

65
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:42,724
Karen said the program tried to play God,
and you ended up creating monsters.

66
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,517
I was just a researcher,

67
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,353
with no knowledge of that
until it was too late.

68
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,856
A man of your skill and expertise,
a lowly researcher?

69
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,066
I find that hard to believe.

70
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,818
But it's true.

71
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:58,364
Mr. Wayne excelled at compartmentalizing
every aspect of his life.

72
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:01,868
Within Pinewood, the left hand often
didn't know what the right was doing.

73
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,745
He lied to us all.

74
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,955
Not many people
would see you as the victim here.

75
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,834
I was one of the ones who forced
Thomas Wayne to shut down the program.

76
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,172
But by then, so many people had been hurt.

77
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,258
- I have a theory.
- Hmm?

78
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,762
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.

79
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,681
I believe you've restarted the program.

80
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,518
- And I would like to know--
- Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?

81
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,020
Excuse me?

82
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,315
This whole city
has turned its back on you,

83
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:37,278
despite you risking your life to save it
over and over again.

84
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,822
I'm not here
for a therapy session, Professor.

85
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,658
No, it's more like an interrogation

86
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,036
by a man who is no longer
a police officer,

87
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,414
who no longer has the right
to demand answers.

88
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,709
The only reason you're sitting
in that chair is because I allow it.

89
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:58,132
So let me ask you, why are you here?

90
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,053
Like I said, I have a client.

91
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,389
Bruce Wayne, I suppose.

92
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:06,891
<i>So it's a job.</i>

93
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:10,353
You're here to pay the rent? Surely not.

94
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,482
<i>All that's happened to you,
this last year...</i>

95
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,777
Hero cop found guilty of murder,

96
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:22,573
sentenced unjustly to Blackgate,
and now you returned to what?

97
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,576
You've lost everything.

98
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,913
You're trying to make up
for the sins of your past

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,290
<i>and you believe
that this case will somehow</i>

100
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,668
bring about your own personal redemption.

101
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,295
- No.
- You're not doing this for your client.

102
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,589
- You're doing this for yourself.
- You're wrong.

103
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,219
You just exhibited several tells.

104
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,888
Facial tics, expressions,
and eye movements

105
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:50,476
that people involuntarily
betray themselves with when they lie.

106
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,107
- Let's talk about Victor Fries.
- Victor Fries is dead, Mr. Gordon.

107
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,442
Really?

108
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:58,943
I saw him last night.

109
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,612
That's impossible.

110
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,206
This is a court order signed
by District Attorney Dent

111
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,167
<i>to exhume Fries' body.</i>

112
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,003
Where's it buried?

113
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,715
He was cremated.

114
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:23,885
Thank you.

115
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:25,887
For what?

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,015
I can read tells, too.

117
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,352
<i>You're lying. I needed to be sure
you were behind all this.</i>

118
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,063
And now I am.

119
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,002
Don't lie! I heard you!

120
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,882
- Please... Don't.
- Please do.

121
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,009
Squeeze the life from him. Kill him.

122
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,011
- Kill him now.
- Are you two fighting again?

123
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:11,599
- He called me fat.
- I didn't do anything, it wasn't me.

124
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,142
It was Lucy.

125
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,686
The fifth personality again.

126
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:18,606
Such a nasty attitude.
See, this gets complicated.

127
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:22,819
See, Lucy is in his head 'cause Rudy has
what's called multiple personality--

128
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,153
In his head?

129
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,198
- Then I'll pull her out.
- No, no, no.

130
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,408
- She's a ghost.
- A ghost?

131
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:30,660
Yes.

132
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,704
And she makes Rudy say things
that he doesn't wanna say.

133
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,042
I can see her.

134
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,710
Lucy,

135
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:44,173
you've got some nerves,

136
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,592
making old Rudy say things like that.

137
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,014
You know that Helzinger is not fat.

138
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:57,186
In fact, you said
that Helzinger was handsome.

139
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,108
Don't you shove me.

140
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:05,611
Oh! She slapped me.

141
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,281
Now I'll tell you something, Lucy.

142
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,575
You will leave Rudy alone

143
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:15,955
and if you come back here again,
you'll have to deal with me.

144
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,042
Thank you, Lucy.

145
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,464
She really made you say all that?

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,051
Yeah.

147
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,762
Wasn't me.

148
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,183
- Sorry.
- Hey!

149
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,895
- Lucy thinks I'm handsome?
- Mmm-hmm.

150
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,479
Isn't that right...

151
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,774
What is he doing here?

152
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,611
Hello, Jimmy.

153
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,947
- Go to hell, Ed.
- You've already put me there. Here.

154
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,118
But not for long, my friend.
I'll find my way out.

155
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,121
'Cause this place is just one big puzzle,
and puzzles are my forte.

156
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,540
Nobody beats me.

157
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,254
I did. See you never, Ed.

158
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,299
That's what you think.

159
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,927
I have
a feeling he is going to be

160
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,511
more than a simple nuisance.

161
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:15,806
Not the type to be bribed,
nor distracted easily.

162
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:18,851
- Indeed. If only we...
- Very interesting.

163
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,063
What has no hands,
but might knock on your door

164
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,606
and you better open up if it does?

165
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,817
Mr. Gordon's continued interference
threatens to slow us down

166
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,986
when we're about to reach
our finest moment.

167
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,446
He'll do more than that.

168
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:32,990
Mr. Nygma.

169
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,744
Eavesdropping is rude and unwise.

170
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,580
Eavesdropping implies intent,
and I mostly...

171
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,667
- Accidentally overheard.
- Overheard what?

172
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,921
Jim Gordon, the word nuisance.
Sounds familiar.

173
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,092
Probably has something to do with your
releasing Penguin and Gordon's ex-fiancée.

174
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,344
Probably.

175
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,430
I can help you take him down.

176
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,683
I know everything about Jim Gordon.

177
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,602
If you let me out of here we could
probably just sit down in your office--

178
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:04,897
Mr. Nygma, you can't help me.
I'm here to help you.

179
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,692
Those are the roles that were defined
for the two of us.

180
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,653
- Now, there's another pressing matter.
- No, listen, I...

181
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,572
I can manipulate people.

182
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,825
I did it to Gordon once,
and I can do it again.

183
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,786
See, people's brains are just a mystery.

184
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,830
And once you figure it out...

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,082
Look, Helzinger.

186
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,544
Can't stand criticism
because of an overbearing mother.

187
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,630
Wants love and approval.
Gets mad when he doesn't get it.

188
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:30,881
So I give it.

189
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,134
Oh, thank you.

190
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:38,180
Sharon. Kleptomaniacal due to
obsessive compulsive disorder.

191
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,228
Just give her something to concentrate on.

192
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,688
And--

193
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,441
And Norton, serious boundary issues.

194
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,236
Prone to torture, violence
and cannibalism.

195
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,905
Unless he thinks he's your friend.

196
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:56,824
- For me?
- Mmm-hmm.

197
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,747
My point is, everyone has a story.

198
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:04,457
<i>And they just wanna be listened to.</i>

199
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,917
My God. I should be the shrink.

200
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,586
What did you say?

201
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,338
I'm sorry. Was that too far?

202
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,298
Everybody has a story.

203
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:16,927
That's it. Mr. Nygma,
you've actually been very helpful.

204
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:31,817
I have it, Peabody.
I have the cure for our prized patient.

205
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,528
- Do tell.
- What is an identity?

206
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,989
What is a sense of self?

207
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,785
It is a story
that we humans tell ourselves.

208
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,538
We have got to give him
a great heroic story.

209
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,084
We need to give him
a good heroic dose of Thorazine.

210
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,794
But you're the boss.

211
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,048
Perfect. Perfect.

212
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,300
Sir? Sir.

213
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,553
Stop! He's dangerous.

214
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:10,189
Hello?

215
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,608
Hello?

216
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,503
I need all available security
to the reanimation lab now.

217
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,798
No! Do not let them in. Do not interfere.

218
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,137
My son.

219
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,180
My son, please stop.

220
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,435
Why have you forsaken me?
Have you forgotten the code?

221
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,565
Who are you?

222
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,403
My poor, dear, son.

223
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,655
Who do you think I am?

224
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,866
Your son?

225
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,034
You're my father?

226
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,287
Who else?

227
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:10,958
Don't you feel a father's love
when I look into your eyes?

228
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,252
Where am I?

229
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:16,964
What is happening to me?
What happened to me?

230
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,215
Shh. Shh.

231
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,050
Why don't I know my name?

232
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,719
My son.

233
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,890
Calm your heart.

234
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:30,019
Demons took you to the Land of Death
and bewitched your soul.

235
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:34,899
But I brought you back to life.
You are the redeemed one.

236
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,359
What is my name?

237
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,073
You know your name.

238
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,536
No, no. There is another life.

239
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,874
There is a sister, a high tower--

240
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,417
No, no, no. Bewitchment.

241
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,336
False memories put into your head.

242
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:59,215
I am your father and your lord.

243
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:06,889
"And he who has another birth,
brought forth from the cold grasp of death

244
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:11,018
"shall rise again and serve my order.

245
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:14,563
<i>"I say this and it becomes.</i>

246
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,526
"And I will give him the name of..."

247
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,238
- Azrael.
- Yes.

248
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,574
I am Azrael.

249
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,119
My Lord Dumas...

250
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,622
Command me.

251
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,599
This man ordered my parents' death.
You're sure?

252
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,019
I know he was part of the reason
they were killed.

253
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,980
Why is he not under arrest?

254
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,815
It's not so simple, hoss.

255
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:00,442
The evidence we have is far too tenuous
for a warrant.

256
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,987
It's ancient hearsay, not fingerprints.

257
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,613
Only witness is dead.

258
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,198
Barnes wouldn't even say no.

259
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,534
He would just look at me like I was nuts.

260
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,704
I'm sick of this.

261
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:14,582
We know where Strange is.

262
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,501
We know he's hurting people right now,
and you two are talking about politics

263
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,295
with your boss and
getting a piece of paper signed.

264
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,006
- This is the way it works, Bruce.
- Why?

265
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,674
You're not a cop anymore.

266
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,887
Give us a second?

267
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,687
Bruce, I know you're frustrated.
But we need to do this the right way.

268
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,065
The right way? And how many times
did that fail with Galavan?

269
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,193
- It's not the same.
- He bent and broke the law

270
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,447
over and over again,
and Strange is doing the same thing.

271
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,033
This man killed Karen, maybe my parents.

272
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,871
Look, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

273
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,374
But I fear we're going down
the same path as before,

274
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,543
- and we won't get justice unless--
- Unless what?

275
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,631
What you did to Galavan.

276
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,217
What you knew you had to do, because
of the bureaucracy and the red tape--

277
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,552
What I had to do?

278
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,889
I chose to kill a man in cold blood.

279
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,517
And it was the wrong choice,
crossing that line.

280
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,436
You'll pay for it.

281
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,272
Over and over again, like I have been.

282
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,399
Like I still am.

283
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,654
And it will make you
more like the evil you're trying to fight.

284
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,327
You need to be better.

285
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,288
Do you understand me?

286
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,875
Just hold out a little bit longer.

287
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,251
<i>We'll work on Barnes.</i>

288
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,546
Get him to sign off on a warrant.
And put Strange away for good.

289
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,841
The right way.

290
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,223
<i>Fearing
the knights had become soft and weak</i>

291
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,849
<i>from lack of leadership,</i>

292
00:16:56,225 --> 00:17:00,145
<i>Lord Dumas split and divided them,
and formed a new faction.</i>

293
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:05,609
<i>He named this new sect after himself,
calling it the Order of St. Dumas.</i>

294
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,278
Okay. Impressive.

295
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:09,613
Yes.

296
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,534
His psyche
couldn't reconcile death and rebirth

297
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,286
<i>until we gave it a grander context.</i>

298
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,499
- A story.
- He's Azrael now.

299
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:27,214
A fabled 12th century knight who died for
the cause of his feudal lord, Adam Dumas.

300
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,301
This Dumas character was made a saint,
performed a lot of miracles and so forth

301
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,638
and one of those miracles
was bringing Azrael back to life.

302
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,599
I still prefer Thorazine.

303
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,395
You need to learn to work
with what you have, Ms. Peabody.

304
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,440
Okay.

305
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:49,027
Our creations need new personas to equal
and embody what they have become,

306
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,904
to give their minds focus.

307
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:56,618
Perhaps this was Mr. Galavan's destiny
all along.

308
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,329
How do you even know
if the persona will hold?

309
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,707
There's only one way to find out.

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,963
We send our beautiful monster out in
the wild with a simple task to perform.

311
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,633
He's going to need something to wear.

312
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:18,682
"Mr. Nygma,
you have actually been helpful.

313
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,851
"Mr. Nygma,
you have actually been helpful."

314
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,770
This imbecile. The complete arrogance.

315
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,194
Inmate Helzinger. Come with me.

316
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:31,987
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,218
Why do they keep disappearing
down that hallway?

318
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,555
Strange is hiding something.

319
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,146
Where are you taking me?
Where are we going?

320
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,818
<i>Where are we going?</i>

321
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,259
How interesting.

322
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,143
Move.

323
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,733
Hey, I know you.

324
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,112
<i>I have a gift for you, my son.</i>

325
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:01,535
I'm crafting your armor as we speak.
But first, your skills must be tested.

326
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,328
I got it.

327
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,290
You're the mayor.

328
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,710
What is this place? What is going on?

329
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,129
- That is a demon.
- What is going on in here?

330
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,256
- He lives in fire.
- I wanna get out of here.

331
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,092
That case will give you
everything you need to destroy him.

332
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,510
<i>I wanna get out of here!</i>

333
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:24,391
Let me out of here. Let me out.
I wanna get out of here. I wanna--

334
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,482
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but good enough.

335
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,445
Try opening the chest, my son.

336
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,203
<i>The Sword of Sin.</i>

337
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,583
Your ally and instrument of justice.

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,421
A vanquisher of evil for generations.
She thirsts for blood.

339
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,425
Generations? That sword
was made yesterday.

340
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,801
It doesn't matter.

341
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,347
Our replica is central to his acceptance
of his new identity.

342
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,975
An awe-inspiring signature weapon.

343
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,355
What must I do?

344
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,068
A murderer walks the streets of the city
a free man.

345
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,530
For his sin, by your blade,
he must be destroyed.

346
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,743
- Tell me his name.
- James Gordon.

347
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,538
My Lord, I am the Angel of Death.

348
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,084
James Gordon dies...

349
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,130
Tonight.

350
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,553
<i>My officers responded
to an anonymous tip</i>

351
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,264
and arrived here earlier this evening.

352
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,850
Upon entering the construction site,

353
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,730
my men discovered the bodies
of four male victims.

354
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,901
It will be some time before we have
any information about their identities.

355
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,737
Uh. Uh...

356
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,906
That's all I have for you at this time.

357
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,324
Excuse me.

358
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,326
No, that's it.

359
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,789
- Hey, Cap. Look who I found.
- Shut it, Bullock.

360
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,041
- You have one hell of a nerve.
- Listen.

361
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,585
You think I don't know it was you
that busted out Karen Jennings?

362
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,087
- Tell me it wasn't you.
- Captain--

363
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,631
No. I don't wanna hear it.
How do I keep falling for your games?

364
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,091
Really, it's a mystery to me.

365
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,635
Every time you come back,
I truly believe that you've changed.

366
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,470
You're like an optical illusion.

367
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,097
Listen, I just need
five minutes of your time.

368
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,433
Hargrove, Snead, escort Mr. Gordon

369
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,601
off my crime scene immediately.

370
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,771
You. We're gonna have a little discussion
about this tomorrow morning.

371
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,274
Captain Barnes, please. Hear him out.

372
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,859
Listen, kid...

373
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,527
Mr. Wayne.

374
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,405
I don't care how much money
or pull you have in this town.

375
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,450
- I'm through talking to him.
- Are you through listening to the truth?

376
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,786
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

377
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,461
All right, five minutes.
No, three minutes.

378
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,468
Okay, bobby pins?

379
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,263
- Only one?
- It's all I could steal.

380
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,308
It'll have to do.
Rudy, did you get the ammonia?

381
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,809
Here.

382
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:16,772
- Perfect.
- Okay. Now we just need the bug zapper.

383
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,192
- What is this?
- It's a fly swatter.

384
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,819
I can see that it's a fly swatter.
I didn't ask for a fly swatter.

385
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,321
I asked for the bug zapper in the kitchen.

386
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,697
What's the difference?

387
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,491
The difference is that
one has a black light

388
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,868
that emits ultraviolet energy,
and this is leather on a stick.

389
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,495
They both kill flies.

390
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,081
I don't need to kill flies.
I need you to go back to the kitchen

391
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,665
and get the bug zapper.

392
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,418
What are you gonna do
with all this stuff anyway?

393
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,048
I think Professor Strange
is hiding something.

394
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,676
And I think that something
is a secret way out of this dump.

395
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,722
So I'm gonna use this stuff to find it.

396
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,855
So, in a nutshell,

397
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:03,568
Hugo Strange is making monsters
out of dead people in his spare time.

398
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,571
And he had Karen Jennings
killed by Victor Fries,

399
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:11,284
- who's been dead for three months.
- I know it sounds far-fetched.

400
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,787
Far-fetched? No. It sounds insane.

401
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,331
But it's true. Trust me.

402
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,708
How can I trust you
when you're talking crazy?

403
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,920
How can I trust you when you've lied to me
so many times? Monsters?

404
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,214
I lied to you because it's hard
to tell you the truth.

405
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:28,218
You're stubborn and you're angry and
the GCPD has paid a price for it.

406
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,428
Really? You self-righteous punk.

407
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,223
You think you have all the answers?
Maybe you should run it yourself.

408
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,475
- Maybe I will one day.
- In your dreams.

409
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,688
Who's there?

410
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,653
- I said who's out there?
- What the hell?

411
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,324
<i>James Gordon.</i>

412
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,036
<i>The time for your penance has come.</i>

413
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,497
You know this guy?

414
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,457
Who are you?

415
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,418
<i>I am Azrael,</i>

416
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,629
<i>righteous scourge of sins,</i>

417
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,592
<i>and I have come to kill you, James Gordon.</i>

418
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,597
Put down that weapon.

419
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,267
Put the weapon down.
Put it down right now or I'll shoot.

420
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,046
<i>Captain!</i>

421
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,971
Jim!

422
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,212
I need information now.
What do we know about this guy?

423
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,299
Just what you saw. Calls himself Azrael.
Wants to kill me.

424
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,345
We know Hugo Strange is responsible.

425
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,931
- Told you so, did he?
- Who else could it be?

426
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,683
I have no idea.

427
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,643
I have to find out the facts.

428
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,561
<i>Fun part of being a police detective.</i>

429
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,189
- Instead of a loose cannon vigilante--
<i>- Excuse me, Captain.</i>

430
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,817
I find your flippant attitude
to be inappropriate.

431
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,570
I find you to be
kind of a pain in the ass.

432
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,448
- What's he even doing here?
- I'm a concerned citizen.

433
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,534
I wanna know
what you're doing about all of this.

434
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,202
You...

435
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,037
Oh, uh...

436
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,331
<i>I'm gonna assemble a strike force.</i>

437
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,251
Call in all off-duty personnel.

438
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,713
We're gonna dragnet the living daylights
out of this whacko.

439
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,216
A knight from outer space
shouldn't be hard to find, right?

440
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,510
Okay?

441
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,637
That's what <i>we're</i> gonna do.

442
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,725
What you're gonna do is go home and stop
inserting yourself into police business.

443
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,393
- Captain--
- That's the final word.

444
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,981
He's right.

445
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,734
It's time you went home.
Leave the rest of this to the police...

446
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,278
- And to me.
- This is not just police business.

447
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:34,738
This is my business, too.

448
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,866
I can't make the moves I need to make
if I'm worrying about you.

449
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,910
You need to be at home,
where Alfred can look after you.

450
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,812
Hello, Grace. How are you today?

451
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,610
<i>Incredibly, the attacker
fled the crime scene by,</i>

452
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,111
<i>for all intents and purposes,</i>

453
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,905
<i>scaling the side of the structure,</i>

454
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,448
<i>literally disappearing into thin air.</i>

455
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,035
<i>In all my years, Ken, I must say,
I've never seen anything quite like it.</i>

456
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,746
<i>That a human being
should be capable of such feats.</i>

457
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,539
<i>It just astounds the mind.</i>

458
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,723
<i>Theo Galavan,
the new Mayor of Gotham.</i>

459
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,643
<i>Oh, brother, like I don't
know you from way back.</i>

460
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,270
<i>Remember.</i>

461
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,817
<i>He calls himself Azrael.</i>

462
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:58,988
He's armed, dangerous, and has exhibited
some extraordinary physical abilities.

463
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,950
But no one, and I mean no one,

464
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:06,121
comes into our city
and tries to carve up my officers.

465
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,791
<i>We're gonna go out tonight
and we're gonna comb each and every block</i>

466
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,043
<i>until we find this masked freak</i>

467
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,963
and put him behind bars where he belongs.

468
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,466
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

469
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,718
Good. Now get out there and get him.

470
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,849
What are you doing?

471
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,143
- I'm going out there.
- The hell you are.

472
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,519
Excuse me?

473
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,187
You're staying here
for your own protection.

474
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,897
That's an order.

475
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:36,901
I'm not a cop anymore, remember?
I don't need to follow your orders.

476
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,947
You're absolutely right.

477
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,033
You two. Put Mr. Gordon, here, in lockup.

478
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,369
- What?
- I'm holding you on suspicion

479
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,164
of breaking Karen Jennings
out of GCPD custody.

480
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,375
- Don't do this.
- I've already done it.

481
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,673
So many stories to choose from.

482
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,384
I feel like a child on Christmas morning.

483
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,386
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

484
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,473
I want to install personas
into more subjects immediately.

485
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,100
Everything we've worked for
is finally within reach.

486
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:15,064
'"But I don't want to go among
mad people,' Alice remarked.

487
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,859
'"Oh, you can't help that,' said the cat.

488
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,236
""We're all mad here.""

489
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,116
Oh, yes. Yes. That will do nicely.

490
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,342
No news from the search.

491
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,261
- Let me out of here.
- This is for your own good.

492
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,306
Trust me.
You've broken enough laws for one day.

493
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,725
There are times when breaking the law
is the right thing to do.

494
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:55,522
- And who gets to decide that. You?
- Yeah. Someone has to.

495
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,106
No, Jim. You're wrong.

496
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,526
Look where Gotham's going.

497
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,446
Maniacs, perverts and freaks
crawling out of every hole.

498
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,698
<i>It's like a sea of evil flooding the city.</i>

499
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:10,912
If a man doesn't cling onto the law,
he'll lose his bearings. Drowned.

500
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,506
- Blackout?
- I don't think so.

501
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,884
Yeah, me neither.

502
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,751
<i>James Gordon.</i>

503
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,009
Back up against the cell. Move.

504
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,598
This is Captain Barnes of the GCPD.

505
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:17,061
Whoever you are, step into the light,
or we will take you out.

506
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,147
<i>But I am the light.</i>

507
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:23,192
<i>Tasked with vanquishing the evil
in that cell.</i>

508
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,903
You can die trying.

509
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:29,741
<i>You lead these men,
so I will parlay with you.</i>

510
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,785
- Parlay?
<i>- Order them to stand aside,</i>

511
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:35,413
<i>and allow the sinner, James Gordon,
to be punished.</i>

512
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,416
<i>Do this and I will spare them all.</i>

513
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:42,211
<i>Decline, and they will face my judgment.</i>

514
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,089
<i>Their lives now rest in your hands.</i>

515
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,550
<i>How many will die?</i>

516
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,886
<i>All? Or one?</i>

517
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,263
<i>Decide, Captain.</i>

518
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,267
- You can go to hell.
<i>- I've been there.</i>

519
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,062
<i>You go.</i>

520
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,400
<i>Over there. You see him?</i>

521
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:15,912
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

522
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,580
<i>I don't know.
You got eyes on him?</i>

523
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,265
Get him out of there!

524
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,571
<i>Such an amazing tool of destruction.</i>

525
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,950
<i>Vile sorcery.</i>

526
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,819
We need a bigger gun.

527
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:31,654
<i>Yeah.</i>

528
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,948
I'm gonna lure the freak up the stairs.

529
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,034
And you show up with something
that will tear a hole in this bastard.

530
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,162
- You got it.
- Let's get to the roof right now.

531
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,033
<i>You.</i>

532
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,745
<i>You will show me to him.</i>

533
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:24,957
<i>You will tell me where he is.</i>

534
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,584
<i>And then what?</i>

535
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:28,961
You'll spare my life?

536
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,214
<i>It's too late for that.</i>

537
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,634
<i>The most I can offer you
is a painless death.</i>

538
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,720
Let's dance.

539
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,402
<i>That is not possible.</i>

540
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,084
You?

541
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,254
You're dead.

542
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:12,713
Not anymore.

543
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,735
Finally.

544
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,448
Come to me.

545
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,370
And I will show you the way to hell.

546
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,497
I know the way.

547
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,598
<i>For those just joining us,
we're coming to you live</i>

548
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,808
<i>from outside of the
Gotham City Police Department.</i>

549
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,148
<i>There's been a major impact</i>

550
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,901
<i>on the vehicle.
It appears a body has fallen...</i>

551
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,986
<i>- It's Theo Galavan...</i>
<i>- Theo Galavan...</i>

552
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,323
<i>- Theo Galavan wearing a...
- Oh, my God.</i>

553
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,701
<i>- Looks like he has...
- Right...</i>

554
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:27,580
<i>Once again, we are confirming that
the former Mayor of Gotham city,</i>

555
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:31,626
<i>Theo Galavan, is alive and
dressed in a bizarre costume.</i>

556
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:32,960
Boss?

557
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,921
Boss? Boss?

558
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:39,508
It's getting crazy in this town, huh, Jim?

559
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,802
Don't talk, just breathe.

560
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:44,305
- I've tried.
- You're gonna be okay.

561
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,806
Sure, I am.

562
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,309
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

563
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,353
That makes two of us.

564
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:57,777
Boss, breathe. Come on, Captain.
Hold on, stay with me. Boss.

565
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,368
BP's falling fast. We got to go now.

566
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,787
Radio Gotham General.
Let them know we're coming in hot.

567
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,373
Jim? Jim, what the hell happened?
You okay?

568
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,540
Yeah.

569
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,250
It was Galavan.

570
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,545
- You sure?
- I know it's hard to believe.

571
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,173
But Azrael is Galavan.

572
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:35,898
Barb.

573
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,610
It's a little irritating.

574
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:40,820
Oh.

575
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,321
Sorry.

576
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:44,907
Hey.

577
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,578
Babes.

578
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,497
Relax.

579
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,165
Yeah.

580
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,085
No, I...

581
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,380
You guys have been so good to me.

582
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,424
That's okay. Don't worry.

583
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:03,592
Cocktails.

584
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,554
I make great cocktails.

585
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,807
- Sure. That'd be nice.
- What do you want?

586
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,768
- Uh, bourbon--
- Gimlets.

587
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,647
- Actually, bourbon sounds--
- I'm making gimlets.

588
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,445
Okay. She scares me.

589
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,613
Don't be a baby. She's harmless.

590
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,366
Honey, I know you like her,

591
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,368
but that woman's mad
as a bag of squirrels.

592
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,121
- She said she's cured.
- That's what an insane person would say.

593
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,875
Do we have any limes?

594
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:37,668
No.

595
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:39,086
Oh, my God.

596
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,964
<i>That's right, Don.
The masked assassin that attacked the GCPD</i>

597
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:46,469
<i>earlier tonight has been identified
as former Mayor, Theo Galavan.</i>

598
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:48,971
<i>Theo? It can't be.</i>

599
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,223
Holy moly.

600
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,312
<i>The assassin was forced
off the roof,</i>

601
00:39:56,562 --> 00:40:00,816
<i>then fell right over there,
then stood up in front of all of us.</i>

602
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,320
<i>And it was him, Theo Galavan, alive.</i>

603
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:08,741
<i>And from what we know, responsible for
three officers fatalities.</i>

604
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,995
Hello, old friend.

605
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,169
...<i>is still at large
and is considered extremely dangerous.</i>

606
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:21,670
Well...

607
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,507
He must have never have been dead.

608
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,008
I mean, that's the only possibility.

609
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:29,095
I mean, no one dies and
comes back to life again, do they?

610
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:30,763
No one.

611
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,515
But he did.

612
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,434
Strange.

613
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,728
Strange must be behind this.

614
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,023
What the hell is happening to our city?

615
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,526
Nothing good.

616
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:51,992
<i>- Oh, no. I don't wanna go.</i>
<i>- You're just going to...</i>

617
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,853
Ah!

618
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,175
Oh, my.

619
00:43:57,219 --> 00:43:58,220
English - SDH
