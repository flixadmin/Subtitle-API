1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,342
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,993
<i>( wind blowing )</i>

3
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,301
<i>( men shouting )</i>

4
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,564
What was she like?

5
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,901
She...

6
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,197
she had red hair.

7
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,951
Oh?

8
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,161
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

9
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,748
I want you to tell me what
it was like to have someone.

10
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,667
To be with someone.

11
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,460
To love someone and have
them love you back.

12
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,552
We're all gonna die a lot
sooner than I'd planned.

13
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,097
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

14
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,894
So you and Gilly never?

15
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,228
No.

16
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,439
She just had a baby.

17
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,693
And she never offered.

18
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,362
But if she had,

19
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,907
you would have?

20
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,826
You'd have broken
your vows?

21
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,874
The interesting
thing is,

22
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,752
our vows never
specifically forbid

23
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,670
intimate relations
with women.

24
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,547
What?

25
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,051
"I shall take no wife,"
yes, that's in there.
There's no denying that.

26
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,470
"I shall
father no children."
It's very specific.

27
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,139
But what do our vows
have to say about other...

28
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:46,351
activities is open
to interpretation.

29
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,856
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

30
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,197
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

31
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,366
We didn't.

32
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,537
So what's it like?

33
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,250
It's...

34
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,213
there's this person,
this whole other person.

35
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,841
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you.

36
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,052
And you--

37
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,929
for a little--

38
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,264
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

39
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,476
You're-- I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

40
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,478
No, you're really not.

41
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,271
What did I get for it?

42
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,441
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

43
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,529
There'll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

44
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,239
There will.

45
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,534
They've already done
the worst thing to me
they could ever do.

46
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,372
Go get some sleep, Sam.

47
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,833
I'll take this watch.

48
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,902
( screeches )

49
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,491
( screeches )

50
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,170
Did I ever
tell you about her?

51
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,381
- My Sheila?
- Yes.

52
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,717
That was a night
to remember.

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,137
Of course, I'd had
a good bit to drink.

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,014
( chuckles )

55
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,307
Her fangs were sharp,

56
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,726
but she knew
how to use them.

57
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,354
And she was nice
and soft down below.

58
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,149
No, she was no
ordinary beast.

59
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,901
Many is the man who--

60
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,153
I know you never
fucked a bear.

61
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,947
You know you never
fucked a bear.

62
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,326
Right now I don't want
to think about the bear
you never fucked.

63
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,537
Right now all I want
to think about

64
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,248
is each one of these
arrows finding its way
into a crow's heart.

65
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,877
We could be waiting
here a while.

66
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,295
Good.

67
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,255
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

68
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,805
They came up here
to our land

69
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,390
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

70
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,851
Then they started
hunting us down.

71
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,190
This time, we're the ones
doing the hunting.

72
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,694
You've got a lot
to say about killing.

73
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,656
Even more words
than arrows.

74
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,243
Back in those villages,
I killed just as many
of them as you did.

75
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,286
More, I reckon.

76
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,457
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

77
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,292
I probably killed
him already.

78
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,836
Styr:
<i>So you've said.</i>

79
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,879
And if not,

80
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,800
the only thing left of him
is gonna be his fun bits
hanging around my neck.

81
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,510
Styr:
<i>More words.</i>

82
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,804
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

83
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,808
Serve him up a nice juicy
slice of ginger minge.

84
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,727
( men laughing )

85
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,148
You been thinking
about that ginger minge?

86
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,026
Wondering what
it tastes like?

87
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,073
Maybe I have.

88
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,534
Jon Snow is mine.

89
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,329
Anyone else
tries to kill him,

90
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,249
I'll have
an arrow for them.

91
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,797
And not one of
your bald friends is
fast enough to stop me.

92
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,698
And what is it
that couldn't wait
until morning, Tarly?

93
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,825
Maester Aemon.

94
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,286
- How did you know--
- That it was you?

95
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,039
Who else
but Samwell Tarly

96
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,957
would be wasting candles

97
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,835
to read in the middle
of the night?

98
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,549
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

99
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,053
I know my way
around this library

100
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,847
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

101
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,141
Thousands of books

102
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,393
and no eyes to read them.

103
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,397
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies

104
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,691
if nothing else.

105
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,277
But you didn't
answer my question.

106
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,946
What are you reading?

107
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,323
Maester Faull.

108
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,201
Ah, the wildlings.

109
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,829
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

110
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,291
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

111
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,127
But what he says
about what they do,

112
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,796
it's all true.

113
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,591
It's exactly
what the survivors
of their raids report.

114
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,346
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

115
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,851
Love is the death
of duty.

116
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,562
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

117
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,775
He didn't listen
and neither did you.

118
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,779
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

119
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,741
to come here and read
about the terrible things

120
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,954
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

121
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,082
I don't love her.

122
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,959
- Yes, you do.
- No.

123
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,794
Yes, you do.

124
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,923
Heard it in your voice
when you first brought
her to me.

125
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,092
I remember how it sounds.

126
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,303
I was in love once.

127
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,470
You were?

128
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,808
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

129
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,352
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

130
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,188
Is it so difficult
to imagine

131
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,274
that an old person
was once,

132
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,484
more or less,
like you?

133
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,154
I'm sorry, Maester.

134
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,822
I didn't mean it
like that.

135
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,659
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

136
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,872
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

137
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,125
Of course you do.

138
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,962
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

139
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,800
A future king
always does.

140
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,678
Some of them
were quite forward

141
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,264
in their attempts
to win my affections.

142
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,893
One of them succeeded.

143
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,645
I was very young.

144
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,357
Who was she?

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
Ah.

146
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,903
I could tell you
everything about her.

147
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,821
Who she was,

148
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,365
how we met,

149
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,617
the color of her eyes,

150
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,453
and the shape
of her nose.

151
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,582
I can see her

152
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:09,418
right in front of me.

153
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,840
She's more real
than you are.

154
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,264
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

155
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,142
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

156
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,354
than the prospect
of imminent death.

157
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,856
Go to bed, Tarly.

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,073
Pyp:
<i>Sorry, I can't open the gate</i>
<i>for anybody. Orders.</i>

159
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,325
Gilly:
<i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>They killed everyone.</i>

160
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,619
<i>Everyone but me</i>
<i>and my baby.</i>

161
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,080
<i>They're out there.</i>
<i>I saw them on my way here.</i>

162
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,040
<i>They may have seen me.</i>
<i>They may have followed me.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

163
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,917
Pyp:
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,210
Gilly:
<i>If they find us out here,</i>
<i>you don't know...</i>

165
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,045
Pyp!
Open the gate.

166
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,756
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

167
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,758
Yes.

168
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,969
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

169
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,805
Oh, Pyp,
open the fucking gate!

170
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,724
I never heard you
curse before.

171
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,560
Yes, well,
best get used to it.

172
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,568
Are you all right?

173
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,611
- ( panting )
- ( baby fusses )

174
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,156
Shh, you're all right.

175
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,118
Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

176
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,871
- It was horrible.
- I'm so, so sorry.

177
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,706
I didn't know
until I got back.

178
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,291
Don't let them
send me away, Sam.

179
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,293
- Never.
- I know there's
no women allowed.

180
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,629
Anyone who tries
to throw you out will
be having words with me.

181
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,841
From now on,
wherever you go,

182
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,218
I go, too.

183
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,766

184
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,312
<i>( horn blows )</i>

185
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,022
Man:
<i>Get ready!</i>

186
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,149
-<i> Man the gate!</i>
<i>- Ready yourselves!</i>

187
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,401
<i>Make haste!</i>

188
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,320
-<i> Prepare!</i>
<i>- Up on the Wall!</i>

189
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,197
<i>Quickly!</i>
<i>Up! Up!</i>

190
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,242
-<i> How many?</i>
<i>How many are there?</i>
<i>- ( horn blows )</i>

191
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,702
-<i> ( horn blows )</i>
<i>- ( screeches )</i>

192
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,579
Beyond the trees!

193
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,502
It's time.

194
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,269
( men shouting )

195
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,106

196
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,093
Light them up!
Light them all!

-<i> ( horn blowing )</i>
<i>- ( men shouting )</i>

198
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,813
Move!

199
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,650
Pick up the pace!

200
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,860
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

201
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,953
Here we go, boys,
there's one.

202
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,123
Let's go.
There's two.

203
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,211
Let's get the next load.

204
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,842
That's the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

205
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,804
100,000 you say?

206
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,015
Yes, Ser.

207
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,267
You can say it
if you like.

208
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,271
We should have sealed
the tunnel while we
had the chance,

209
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,649
like you suggested.

210
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,861
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

211
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,783
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

212
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,745
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

213
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,414
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

214
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,958
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

215
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,627
that's the end--

216
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,047
for him,
for the clever
little twats,

217
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,965
for everyone.

218
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,968
This is not the end.
Not for us.

219
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,012
Not if you lot
do your duty

220
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,848
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

221
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,186
And then you get
to go on hating me

222
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,979
and I get
to go on wishing

223
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,482
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

224
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,193
<i>( horn blows )</i>

225
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,340
Sam:
<i>You'll be safe</i>
<i>down here.</i>

226
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,300
I'll check on you
as soon as I can.

227
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,179
You're leaving me again?

228
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,889
I'm not leaving you.

229
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,684
You're going up there
and we're staying down here.
That's leaving.

230
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,103
You said from now on
we'd stay together.

231
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,189
I didn't mean
in the same room.

232
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,440
What are you going
to do out there?

233
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,235
- Help my brothers.
- How?

234
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,362
You're going to
fight the free folk
when they come?

235
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,407
They'll kill you.
In Mole's Town,
they killed everyone.

236
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,160
I can't just hide here
with you while they're
fighting out there.

237
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,996
Why not?
You won't matter
up there.

238
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,833
You will down here.

239
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,961
I am a man of
the Night's Watch, Gilly.

240
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,296
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

241
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,132
and I have to keep it

242
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,926
because that's
what men do.

243
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,066
Promise me
you won't die.

244
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,822
I promise you
I won't die.

245
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,290
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

246
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,502
- ( men shouting )
- ( horse whinnies )

247
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,942
There's a lot more wildlings
on the other side of the Wall
than this side.

248
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,070
We've got loads
of weapons and things.

249
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,072
It's the perfect place
for us to be.

250
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,283
I've never thrown
a spear before.

251
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,286
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

252
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,914
This is no place
for me to be.

253
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,334
You're not afraid?

254
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,711
Of course I'm afraid.

255
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,297
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

256
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,965
If you're afraid
of a band of wildlings,

257
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,968
how in seven hells
did you manage to kill
a white walker?

258
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,185
I didn't know
I was going to kill it.

259
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,854
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

260
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,065
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

261
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,153
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

262
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,072
I wouldn't have known.

263
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,743
I wasn't
Samwell Tarly anymore.

264
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,663
I wasn't a steward
in the Night's Watch

265
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,290
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

266
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,836
I was nothing at all.

267
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,631
And when you're
nothing at all,

268
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,551
there's no more reason
to be afraid.

269
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,805
But you're afraid now?

270
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,431
Yes, well...

271
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,561
I'm not nothing anymore.

272
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,081
Most of their men
are up top.

273
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,209
Didn't count more
than 20 down here.
Leftovers.

274
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,545
They got a big fat one
and a little bony one
manning the front.

275
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,338
How high are the walls?

276
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,382
Well, we'll be up
and over before they
know what's happened.

277

mammoths down there!

00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,340
Brother Slynt.

351
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,260
We just got word
that Ser Alliser
needs you below.

352
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,306
You're the most
experienced man he's got,
Ser, and he needs you.

353
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,017
Needed below?

354
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,186
Yes. Yes.

355
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,949
Archers, nock your arrows!

356
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,451
Man:
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

357
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,161
Draw!

358
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,790
Loose!

359
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,806
They won't summit
before dawn.

360
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,016
How do you know that?

361
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,976
Because I've made
that climb.

362
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,187
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

363
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,859
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

364
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,986
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

365
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,822
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

366
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,912
Nock!

367
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,291
Draw!

368
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,254
Loose!

369
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,802
( screams )

370
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,275
Down!

371
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,914
( screaming )

372
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,223
( laughs )

373
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,853
( screaming )
No! No!

374
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,499
To the gate.
Come on, let's move.

375
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,504
It's gonna open.

376
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,988
I got one right
through the heart.
He's dead.

377
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,449
- Oh, is it over?
- No.

378
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,284
Well, then...

379
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,961
You're all right.
You're all right.

380
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>( gurgling )</i>

381
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,341
I'll get help.

382
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,092
Shh. Shh.

383
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,512
Maester Aemon is coming.

384
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,514
He's gonna make
it all right.

385
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,558
Shh. Shh.

386
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,528
- Now.
- Now!

387
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,097
( whistles )

388
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,890

389
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,854
( bellowing )

390
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,033
( gates creaking )

391
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,289
The outer gate
won't hold.

392
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,208
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

393
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,877
Aye.

394
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,131
Hold the gate.

395
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,383
If they make it through...

396
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,554
They won't.

397
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,184
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

398
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,520
- You three, on me.
-<i> ( horn blowing )</i>

399
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,814
Come on,
you lazy bastards.

400
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,904
Oil.

401
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,823
Oil on the ramp!

402
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,251
Protect the gate!

403
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,113
( groans )

404
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,120
- ( groans )
- Get him inside.

405
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,376
Hold the fucking gate!

406
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,461
Hold it!

407
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,646
We need more men
down here.

408
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,107
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

409
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,443
Tell Jon.
He's in command.

410
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,570
Let's go.

411
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,581
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

412
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,671
Your name's Olly, right?

413
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,674
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

414
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,594
And when we
give the signal,
bring us back down.

415
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,555
You hear me?

416
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,813
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

417
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,756
( bellows )

418
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,092
( screaming )

419
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,722
Clear the way!
Let's go!

420
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,933
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

421
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,356
( grunts )

422
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,112
( roars )

423
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,828
Cut the rope!

424
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,830
( screams )

425
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,461
- Wait! No!
- ( screaming )

426
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,387
( roaring )

427
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,311
-<i> We need more archers.</i>
<i>- Here I am.</i>

428
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,855
-<i> Come on.</i>
<i>- Quickly.</i>

429
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,984
What are you
doing up here?

430
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,403
The wildlings
are over the walls.

431
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,363
Ser Alliser's fallen.

432
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,074
The castle won't stand
much longer.

433
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,537
Edd, you have the Wall.

434
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,584
If they try the mammoths
again, drop fire on them.

435
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,295
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

436
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,929
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

437
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,933
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

438
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,935
Light the fuckers up!

439
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,063
<i>Nock! Draw!</i>

440
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,232
Loose!

441
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,951
How are we
gonna stop that?

442
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,285
Shot 20 arrows
in him already.

443
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,745
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

444
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,163
Jon Snow's not
Lord Commander.

445
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,957
We hold the gate!

446
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,259
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

447
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,511
The gods aren't down here.

448
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,221
It's the six of us.
You hear me?

449
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,980
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

450
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,315
<i>It shall not end</i>
<i>until my death.</i>

451
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,859
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands,

00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,236
<i>father no children.</i>

453
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,989
I shall wear no crown
and win no glory.

454
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,282
I shall live and die
at my post.

455
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,201
All:
I am the sword
in the darkness.

456
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,953
I am the watcher
on the walls.

457
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,998
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

458
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:16,043
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

459
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,796
for this night
and all the nights to come!

460
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,923
- ( shouting )
- ( roaring )

461
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,012
I don't want you
out there.

462
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,139
You can't
protect me forever.

463
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,933
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

464
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,188
I need him
more than I need you.

465
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,348
We need you, boy.

466

Jon Snow.

474
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,033
Hush.
Don't talk.

475
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,831
Do you remember the cave?

476
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,838
We should have
stayed in the cave.

477
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,844
We'll go back there.

478
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,229
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

479
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,891
Drop the scythe, boys!

485
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,097
Don't cheer too loud.

486
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,477
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

Tormund.

00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:19,031
It's over.

491
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,532
Let it end.

492
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,826
This is how a man ends.

493
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,336
Put him in chains.

494
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,297
We'll question him later.

495
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,386
I should have
thrown you

496
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,347
from the top
of the Wall, boy!

497
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,391
Aye.

498
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,559
You should have.

Whoa, it's me.
It's me.

502
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,033

didn't I?

Sam:
We held them off.

Jon:
For one night.

506
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,179
This is a great
victory.

507
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,306
A great victory?

508
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,102
Mance was testing
our defenses.

509
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,687
He almost
made it through.

510
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,398
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

511
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,359
He has 1,000 times
as many men.

512
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,157
They'll hit us
again tonight.

513
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,659
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

514
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,536
but we'll never
beat them.

515
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,122
Where are we going?

516
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,790
Going to find Mance.

517
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,626
To fi---
you can't do that.

518
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,420
<i>No one gave you</i>
<i>any orders.</i>

519
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,507
Who's left
to give orders?

520
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,343
The wildling army's only
an army because of Mance.

521
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,054
He united
100 warring tribes.

522
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,056
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

523
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,934
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting
each other.

524
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,728
Scatter back
to their homes.

525
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,980
Without Mance?

526
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,482
You're going to kill him?

527
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,816
I'm gonna try.

528
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,693
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

529
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,820
And even if they did,
even if you managed
to kill him--

530
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,323
They'll kill me?
If I don't go, they'll
kill me anyway.

531
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,991
They'll kill
the rest of us, too.

532
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,410
Sam:
<i>They won't just kill you.</i>

533
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,245
They'll boil you.
They'll flay you.

534
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,830
They'll make it last days.

535
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,253
You're right.
It's a bad plan.

536
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,299
What's your plan?

537
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,803
They held the gate.

538
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,565
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

539
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,986
We need to burn
the bodies.

540
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,801
Raise the outer gate.

541
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,387
Then lower it again
as soon as I'm out.

542
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,233
What are you doing?

543
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,028
I promised Mormont
I'd never lose it again.

544
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,534
In case I don't come back.

545
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,377
Jon.

546
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,842
Come back.

547
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,020

548
00:49:14,618 --> 00:50:32,779
