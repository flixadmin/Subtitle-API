1
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,110
Jackie: The museum
will be very pleased

2
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:13,612
to have the golden dragon
returned to Hong Kong.

3
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,414
How come? They've
been yapping on TV

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,583
how it broke all kinds
of attendance records.

5
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,686
Yes, but maintaining
security has been difficult.

6
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,288
There were at least
2 attempts to steal it.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,957
Uh...Make that 3.

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,058
(Gasps)

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,192
Hey!

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,429
Uhh!

11
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,131
Quickly! Quickly!

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,234
Jackie!

13
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,137
No! Dah!

14
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,706
Looks like we hooked
the wrong fish.

15
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,146
How do we
get rid of him?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,784
They don't call them
sky <i> scrapers</i> for nothing.

17
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,822
Aah!

18
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,745
Bad day, bad day!

19
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,382
Bad day!

20
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,218
Uhh!

21
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,388
Aah!

22
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,690
(Whoosh)

23
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,063
The elevator is too slow.

24
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,364
Heh heh.

25
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,200
Uncle:
8 cantonese faces.

26
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,904
12, 13, 14--

27
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,472
you should
have seen me!

28
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,275
Rescuing the dragon,
chasing off the bad guys!

29
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,410
Oh, I mean,
uncle Jackie helped, too.

30
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,045
Less talk,
more counting,

31
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,547
how many chopsticks?

32
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,882
15, <i> sensei.</i>

33
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,317
15? Chopsticks always
come in pairs.

34
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,585
Count again!

35
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,987
Yep! Thanks to us,

36
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,322
that dragon's loaded up
and sailin' to--

37
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,724
Jackie:
No, it's not, Jade.

38
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,593
The cargo ship
was not a secure
enough transport.

39
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,196
The museum decided
that with the thieves
still at large,

40
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,832
the golden dragon
will instead travel
to Hong Kong

41
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,468
on the last place
anyone would
think to look:

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,371
A cruise ship.
I will accompany it.

43
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,872
Tsh. You lucked out.

44
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:57,609
Yes. The only problem
is that the museum

45
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,978
has given me
a 2-room suite.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,949
I do not know
what to do with
all that extra space.

47
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:07,019
I'm going on a cruise! <i> Yes!</i>

48
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,488
Ha ha ha.
All of us are going.

49
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,123
Uncle, tohru--

50
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,125
huh? Uncle does not cruise!

51
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,726
Uncle does inventory!

52
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,695
Uncle, when
was the last time

53
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,630
you took
a real vacation?

54
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,065
Let me see.

55
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,233
(Abacus clicking)

56
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,735
3, 4, carry the one.

57
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,938
Never! So, why start now?

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,873
Because it'll be
wicked fun!

59
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,541
Come on. <i> Please?</i>

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,677
Heh...

61
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,312
Ay, uh...

62
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:37,115
Eeh. Brown eyes
get uncle every time.

63
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,284
Fine. I'll go.

64
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,352
Yes!

65
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,054
I will stay here.

66
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,925
Tohru, hello?

67
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,994
Swimming pools,
whale watching.

68
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,064
All the shrimp you can eat.

69
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,833
Ok, strike that.
All the <i> pizza</i> you can eat?

70
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,003
I cannot
travel on a ship.

71
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,839
Tsh. Knew I shouldn't have
taken you to see <i> Titanic.</i>

72
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,608
That was just a movie, tohru.

73
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,209
It's not that, Jade.

74
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,278
I get seasick.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,746
Ha ha ha ha!

76
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,984
Oh. You're serious.

77
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,453
Hey, there's medicine
you can take for that.

78
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,887
I have tried.

79
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,456
Nothing helps.

80
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,826
Well, guess what.

81
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,929
I have a guaranteed
cure for seasickness.

82
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,297
You do?

83
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,699
Meet you back
at section 13, Jackie.

84
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,268
Gotta go pack!

85
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,482
12 inches thick

86
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,417
and absolutely
state of the art.

87
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,720
Most banks don't have
a vault this secure.

88
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,857
I'm sure it is more
security than is necessary.

89
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,702
Midnight rollerblading,
video arcade, dessert 24-7.

90
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,570
Cruising is so cool.

91
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,339
Ahh! Waste of time.

92
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,508
Will not even be able
to get a good cup of tea.

93
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,576
Woman: He drinks tea?

94
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,112
Thought Billy goats
only eat tin cans.

95
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,681
Ay ah!

96
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,549
Fat dragon
locked in vault!

97
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,051
Tohru, what's your mom--

98
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,886
um, Jackie said it
would be all right

99
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,288
to have her join us.

100
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,390
Where are you
going, uncle?

101
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,859
To lifeboat!
Row back to shore!

102
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,895
Good! I have
better things to do

103
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,830
than hang around
with junk-seller.

104
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,533
I visit with
my boy, relax,

105
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,301
play a little mahjong.

106
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,003
You play mahjong?

107
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,240
No. I win at mahjong.

108
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,710
5-time
all-Kyoto finalist.

109
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,846
Hong king community
center champion 1955.

110
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,349
Beat you with one hand
tied behind back.

111
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,850
Ha! Big talker.

112
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,953
How about you
put your tiles
where your mouth is.

113
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,241
Jade: Where have you
been, tohru?

114
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,476
You totally
missed dinner

115
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,211
and the make-your-own-
sundae bar.

116
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,747
They had everything.
Whipped cream, nuts--

117
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,015
(groans)

118
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,252
I think tohru has still
not found his sea legs, Jade.

119
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,355
You said you had a cure
for seasickness, Jade.

120
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,456
Oh?

121
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,058
Uh-huh. I do.

122
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,293
It's, uh...
Hypnotism!

123
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,395
Read a book about it.

124
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,597
Ah. This I would
like to see.

125
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,134
We kind of need
privacy, Jackie.

126
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,237
Now, just watch my hand.

127
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,745
(Gasps)
The horse talisman.

128
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,147
The healer.

129
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,949
My little pony's
guaranteed to cure
what ails you.

130
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,686
But you are forbidden
to remove the talismans
from section 13.

131
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,989
Ok, if that's
the way you feel.

132
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,259
Thought so.

133
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,535
Well?

134
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,869
(Stomach growls)

135
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,206
Ahh. Do you think there
is any orange sherbet left?

136
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,645
Ha! I win again.

137
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,580
Ah, you cheat again.

138
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,816
Every time I sneeze,
you move a tile.

139
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,151
You sneeze,
all the tiles move.

140
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,121
Bird beak nose should
have its own zip code!

141
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,889
Grrr!

142
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,745
Hmm. 7 through zero upgrade.
It's got a titanium shell.

143
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,014
Can you crack it?

144
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,853
Only one way
to find out.

145
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,621
(Snoring)

146
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,757
(Loud snoring)

147
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,297
Huh? Who's sawing?

148
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,037
What are you doing
out here, tohru?

149
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,672
Could not sleep.

150
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,509
I know what you mean.
Your mom snores
like a lawn mower.

151
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,277
I tossed my crackers.

152
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,447
Huh? Oh, you mean
you tossed your cookies.

153
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,015
Guess the cure's
like medicine.

154
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,316
Gotta keep taking it.

155
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,252
I'll get the talisman.

156
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,956
Talisman?
Where is it, Jade?

157
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,391
(Footsteps)

158
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,865
I will be checking
on the dragon
after breakfast.

159
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,967
If I do not find
the talisman
in the vault,

160
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,336
you will be
spending the rest
of the cruise

161
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,038
inside your room.

162
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,975
Hyuh! Yah! Huhh!

163
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,144
Status.

164
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,848
(Sighs)
Impervious.

165
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,685
Unh...Er...Uhh!

166
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,487
"How many times
have I told you

167
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,922
the talismans
are dangerous?"

168
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,724
Tsh. Tohru losing
his lunch is dangerous.

169
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,562
Man: I can attempt
a circuitry bypass,

170
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,763
but as soon as
a crew member

171
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,031
accesses
- the ship's computer,

172
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,232
he'll know
we're online.

173
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,333
Then I guess
we better

174
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,835
go with our
contingency plan.

175
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,837
Basil, butch...

176
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,940
We're taking
over the ship.

177
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,914
Unh...Come on, come on.

178
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,534
Unh...Err...Uhh!

179
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,669
Butch...

180
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,185
Hmm.
- You lose at mahjong,
Chinese checkers.

181
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,554
Billy goat care
to try gin rummy?

182
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,857
I prefer a game of skill.
Shuffleboard.

183
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,560
Uh, how about
relaxing by the pool?

184
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,761
Quiet!
- Quiet!

185
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,363
(Tohru groans)

186
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,132
Tohru, how is my
baby boy feeling today?

187
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,102
A little better, mommy.

188
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,371
Come. A walk
will do you good.

189
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,975
Where are we
walking to?

190
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,812
Breakfast. Ocean air always
gives me a big appetite.

191
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,748
Eggs, bacon, biscuits.

192
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,984
Tohru?

193
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,754
(Groans)

194
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,756
P.A.: Attention,
all passengers.

195
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,758
This is your captain.

196
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,126
Please assemble
in the ballroom

197
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,029
for a mandatory
safety presentation.

198
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,297
Heh! Not yet
have morning tea!

199
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,468
(People talking)

200
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,245
Ha! What kind of ship
they running?

201
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,947
Captain calls meeting,
no captain here!

202
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,053
Something is wrong.

203
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,823
Afraid the captain and crew
are indisposed, folks.

204
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,225
The ship is now
under my command.

205
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,195
What? Huh?

206
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,596
(All gasp)

207
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,708
Laser cage.

208
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,376
I suspect these
are the same men

209
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,577
as from the helicopter.

210
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,279
They are after the dragon.

211
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,047
Good.
They can have her.

212
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,549
Funny man won't
be so funny

213
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,951
when I whoop you
at shuffleboard!

214
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,863
Excuse me, tohru!
Thank you!

215
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,365
One of the rabbits
jumped his cage.

216
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,736
Maori fighting stick!

217
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,943
Drum stick! Heh.

218
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,681
Wha--?!

219
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,282
Aah! Uhh!

220
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,383
Oh!

221
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,987
Wah! Unh!

222
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,222
Ohh...

223
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,435
Unh! Ohh...

224
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,907
(Feebly)
Thank you, tohru.

225
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,610
I am going to be sick.

226
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,744
Aah!

227
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,249
How much longer?

228
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,185
Access code variables
are infinitely exponential.

229
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,653
In English.

230
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,221
Working on it.

231
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,861
I win. Again.

232
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,663
(Paper crumpling)

233
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,231
Heh! That's because
you have "xs."

234
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,699
"Xs" always win!

235
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,569
All will be settled
on shuffleboard court!

236
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,776
Oh, Jackie, would you
please stop pacing?

237
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,579
Sorry. I am very
worried about Jade.

238
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,914
These are dangerous men.

239
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,248
Jade: Don't worry,
uncle Jackie.

240
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,716
I got it
all covered.

241
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,118
Uhh! Jade!

242
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,723
Ok, here's the plan.

243
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,626
You distract him.
I'll do my famous
flying drop kick.

244
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,061
That will--
- no, Jade.

245
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,930
I have a better plan.

246
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:55,733
Find the communications room
and signal an s.O.S.

247
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,969
But--
- and please hurry!

248
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,905
Yeah, that's always
<i>my</i> favorite part
of the movie--

249
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,308
when the hero
makes a phone call.

250
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,548
Uh, hello?
Mayday! Mayday!

251
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,383
Can someone connect me
to section 13?

252
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,185
It's a top secret
organization.

253
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,154
Uh, they're probably
not listed.

254
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,290
On second thought, just
get me the coast guard.

255
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,361
Someone's
on the ship-to-shore.

256
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,532
Jade: The ship has been
taken over by a--

257
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,234
a bunch of thieving
pirates!

258
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,468
What is your location?

259
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,803
<i>Prince Arnold</i>
cruise ship.

260
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,972
And we're, like,
a few hundred miles
from San Francisco.

261
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:38,109
No, what is <i> your</i> location?
Where are <i> you</i> on the ship?

262
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,178
Well, I'm
in the radio room,

263
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,846
but what's that
got to do with--

264
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:42,981
uh-oh.

265
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,215
(Crumpling)

266
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,818
Uh, you're breaking up.
Over and out!

267
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,354
Butch...

268
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,588
Right.

269
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,191
Got us
a wild rabbit.

270
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,760
I'll hunt her down.

271
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,829
Jade.

272
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,636
(Grumbling)

273
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,972
She's in the air ducts.

274
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,774
Too tight for butch.

275
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,142
I have a solution.

276
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,810
Nice plan, Jackie.

277
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,679
This time,
we do it my way.

278
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,081
A little surprise
attack and--wha--?

279
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,750
Hey, who turned on
the air conditioning?

280
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,418
Whoa! Whoa! Unh!

281
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,588
Uh, which way to the pool?

282
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,190
Got her.

283
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,427
Good. If anyone
actually intercepted
that ship-to-shore,

284
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,062
we'll be crawling
with coast guard.

285
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,397
Another 20 minutes and--

286
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,832
new plan.
We blow the vault.

287
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,001
We discussed this, giles.
Too risky.

288
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,070
If a fire breaks out
or we breach the hull--

289
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,505
just do it!

290
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,976
Ow!

291
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,811
Hey! Come back here!

292
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,416
30 seconds.

293
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,059
(Gasps)

294
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,661
Slippery little eel,
ain't ya?

295
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,931
Well, maybe it'd be best
to return you to the water.

296
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:10,034
Uh, see this?
It has magic powers, and--

297
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,603
and it'll blast you
if I say the magic words!

298
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,072
Yeah. Right.

299
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,206
(Boom)

300
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,341
Aah!

301
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,712
(Water gushing)

302
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,747
I warned you.

303
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,615
The vault's open,
isn't it?

304
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,118
Yes, and so is a piece
of the hull.

305
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,390
No more magic! Please?

306
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,102
What's with all
the sirens?

307
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,403
The ship is sinking!

308
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,472
The passengers...
In the ballroom!

309
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,140
I'm all over it.

310
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,211
Jade to the rescue!

311
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,316
(All gasp)

312
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,020
Everyone, calmly
to the lifeboats.

313
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,788
(Everyone screaming)

314
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,290
There will not be
enough time to evacuate.

315
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,658
The talisman, Jade--

316
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,361
perhaps we can use it
to heal the ship.

317
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,064
Ok, but you're breaking
your rule about--

318
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,066
Jade!
- All right!

319
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,135
Uh, uh, I think
I lost it,

320
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,037
uh, in the galley!

321
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,505
I will find it!

322
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,241
Please climb into a lifeboat
with the others!

323
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,376
(Passengers arguing)

324
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,045
We're near
capacity, captain!

325
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,781
The boats can and will
accommodate every passenger

326
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,049
and crew member.

327
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,818
But we never really
had anyone <i> his</i> size.

328
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,356
That boat?
Bobbing up and down? Ohh.

329
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,225
I will stay here.

330
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,795
If my baby not going,
I not going!

331
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,229
Bah! Take
the Billy goat!

332
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,831
Ha! Nice try.

333
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,634
Uncle not leave ship
until whip you
at shuffleboard!

334
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,602
Take Jade.
Where is she?

335
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,607
Jackie'll never find
that talisman

336
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,543
without my eagle eyes.

337
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,151
The golden dragon!

338
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,454
You don't really think
you're going to stop us?

339
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,422
No. Take the artifact.

340
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,057
I only want
to protect the ship

341
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,659
and the people
aboard it.

342
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,993
I don't believe you.

343
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,495
Take care of him, boys.

344
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,464
We'll meet you topside.

345
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,341
Uhh! What about
butch and basil?

346
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,310
They snooze, they lose.

347
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,346
Hyuh!

348
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,681
Aah! Huh!

349
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,851
Uhh! Oh, gah!

350
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,254
Wah!

351
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,038
Aha?

352
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,579
Jade: Don't make me
use this.

353
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,151
Uhh! Get out of here
before she blows us up!

354
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,485
Trust me.

355
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,889
Blow us up?

356
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,223
It's a long story.

357
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,192
Let us hope this works.

358
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,396
(All gasp)

359
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,665
Look at that!

360
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,900
Ohh...

361
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,870
I don't believe it.

362
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,080
(Retches)

363
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,054
Ahh! Finally we can relax

364
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,223
and enjoy the cruise.

365
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,858
Where is tohru?

366
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,459
You got me.
Haven't seen him

367
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,761
since your big
lecture about how

368
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,497
"the talisman is not
to leave the vault."

369
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,471
It's nice to see those 2

370
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,174
actually enjoying
each other's company.

371
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,846
Ah, junk monger, weak
as scrawny chicken. Gah!

372
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,449
Toothless old bat
got nothing! Uhh...

373
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,958
Hey, Jackie...

374
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,092
Yes?

375
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,694
What do you do
on rainy days?

376
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,029
Actually, I will
drive my car,

377
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,864
especially at night,
middle of the night,

378
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,200
like at 3:00, 4:00.
Just by myself.

379
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,236
I let the rain...

380
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,438
Then I will stop,
you know, somewhere

381
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,406
around, beside the highway.

382
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,776
Have a sun roof
with all the glass
is on the top.

383
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,580
I just listen to music.
Listen to rain.

384
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,816
Really, really,
really relaxing.
