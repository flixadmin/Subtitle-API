ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,360
I'm really okay.

3
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,368
Cha Hyun-su.

4
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,486
I need to speak with you.

5
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,543
What?

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,081
Why are you only taking him?

7
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,086
What about me?

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,721
You're just being used.

9
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,886
Hey!

10
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,060
Hey!

11
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,727
Let me out, too!

12
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,242
It's vital the front gate be
properly barricaded, but it hasn't been.

13
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,494
And we only have wooden planks and chains
blocking the stairs.

14
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,164
Monsters could get through at any moment.

15
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,878
The same goes for where you were just now.

16
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,551
Why do you think I took your side?

17
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,553
I'll be straightforward.

18
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,973
You'll be taking on all the dangerous work
from now on.

19
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,012
If you don't want to,
then I can't help you.

20
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,684
What do you mean?

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,265
The guy in Room 1408.

22
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,851
Can you bring him here?

23
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,818
It was spring.

24
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,736
The flowers were so pretty.

25
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,082
All I wanted was to show my daughter
the pretty flowers.

26
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,499
Truly,

27
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,212
it was just for one second, but...

28
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,755
You must miss her a lot.

29
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,347
The day she first called me "mom,"

30
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,559
the day she first turned over by herself...

31
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,312
I was so touched

32
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,734
by such small things...

33
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,106
Seeing those chubby cheeks...

34
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,318
made me feel like I had everything.

35
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,827
You have children?

36
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,751
I used to.

37
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,878
Before this happened to my leg.

38
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,142
I want...

39
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,684
the same thing as Hyun-su.

40
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,562
If I turn, please...

41
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,153
kill me.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,060
I can't do as you asked.

43
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,356
I don't think

44
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,202
I can take care of them without you.

45
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,031
Is that so?

46
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,269
Is she not in there?

47
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,858
No.

48
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,164
She's gone.

49
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,384
We should let her go now.

50
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,650
KIM YEONG-SU, KIM SU-YEONG

51
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,118
Wait.

52
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,122
I heard you're a gangster.

53
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,540
Don't gangsters do anything for money?

54
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,372
I'll give you everything I have.

55
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,132
Just help me go outside.

56
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,336
I...

57
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,725
Move.

58
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,534
I... No, you can't...

59
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,939
Open the door.

60
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,202
Is this okay?

61
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,293
I don't think we can stop him.

62
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,036
You're not supposed to...

63
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,944
Wait.

64
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,250
Is this it?

65
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,842
Do you want me to starve?

66
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,461
You're glad I'm locked up in here,
aren't you?

67
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,717
I bet you're really enjoying this.

68
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,231
If I turn into a monster,
I'll eat you up first.

69
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,978
So do something, you stupid cow!

70
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,401
We have to save food!

71
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,310
Says who?

72
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,818
All that food is mine.

73
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,816
They said we're all going to share it.

74
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,986
Don't be ridiculous! You bitch!

75
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,379
You should hold it in.

76
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,210
I do it, too.

77
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,609
Rescuing Han Du-sik is the main goal.

78
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,237
The kids are secondary.

79
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,910
Focus on the main goal.

80
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,948
If things go south,

81
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,119
leave the kids.

82
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,300
Are you playing with people's lives?

83
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,222
Then who should I have sent?

84
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,644
It was the best option.

85
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,680
We need that man in Room 1408.

86
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,810
And I've decided not to hesitate
any longer.

87
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,769
Let go of me.

88
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,324
I'm sure there's another way
besides using other people.

89
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,750
What I'm using is the golden hour.

90
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,253
Cha Hyun-su was critically injured,
but he woke up in just a few hours.

91
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,130
If willpower can affect the turning stage,

92
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,515
and he can fight it,

93
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,359
then he will be the strongest weapon
we have.

94
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,942
This is what we call a weapon.

95
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,315
He's still human.

96
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,862
I agree.

97
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,621
For now.

98
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,619
And you sent him to die?

99
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,372
It would be best if you
become accustomed to using

100
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,325
people on the verge of turning
into monsters.

101
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,536
You really are twisted.

102
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,668
I don't think you understand

103
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,506
how dangerous our situation is.

104
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,048
What did you think

105
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,505
about the voting results?

106
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,396
They're marked with Xs.

107
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,516
I was thinking of secretly switching them.

108
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,742
- But I didn't need to.
- So you didn't switch the votes?

109
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,489
It was unexpected.

110
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,027
I didn't think people would vote
to let Hyun-su stay.

111
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,077
That's because you made them feel guilty,
talking about murder.

112
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,341
Do you really think they voted not to
kick him out because of their conscience?

113
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,090
Well, the man with the sword
and the girl with the bat

114
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,222
may have felt close to him
because they were together.

115
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
But the others?

116
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,392
It's not easy to accept someone
you don't know,

117
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,681
especially when your life is at risk.

118
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,188
So what's your point?

119
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,401
You still don't get it?

120
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,857
Cha Hyun-su and Kim Seok-hyeon.

121
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,151
Do you think
they're the only ones turning?

122
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,451
No. Everyone's scared.

123
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,540
Because they don't know when they'll turn.

124
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,787
There was someone who knew about this
before the government announcement.

125
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,134
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

126
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,923
It was a blog I found by accident
on the internet.

127
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,424
What did it say?

128
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,552
- Despair.
- What?

129
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,798
It said it's a curse.

130
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,514
And that humans will never overcome it.

131
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,386
You believe a stupid blog post
when you don't even know who wrote it?

132
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,734
Under the circumstances, we shouldn't
ignore even the smallest clues.

133
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,443
CRUCRU
THIS ISN'T A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.

134
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,275
CRUCRU

135
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,609
What's "Crucru"?

136
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,738
- Is it your blog?
- Hey, Yi-kyung.

137
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,952
Well...

138
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,954
When is it?

139
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,078
Our wedding photoshoot?

140
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,001
What?

141
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,078
Did you write you don't want
to get married?

142
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,424
No, it's nothing like that.

143
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,506
- Where are you going?
- There will be more infected people soon.

144
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,805
- So?
- So it's not going to be safe here either.

145
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,349
It's still safer than the outside.

146
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,562
- Do you want to come?
- To where?

147
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,852
A way to survival.

148
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,319
Ji-su.

149
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,493
I think

150
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,043
there's a monster here.

151
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,792
Let's kill it.

152
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,333
We can kill it.

153
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,804
You're scared, aren't you?

154
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,527
Sir!

155
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,448
Don't come!

156
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,583
Don't come near!

157
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,539
Don't come, Sang-wook!

158
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,147
Move.

159
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,203
Are you trying to burn
the whole building down, sir?

160
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,285
We can put out the fire later.
You're so harsh.

161
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,119
It will take ages to get
to the first floor.

162
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:18,384
My goodness. I'm not sure anyone
will still be alive by then.

163
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,343
Be careful.

164
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,348
Who's there?

165
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,414
He's alive.

166
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,276
The monster left him alive?

167
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,508
What are you doing?

168
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,689
I couldn't reach my son's hand.

169
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,611
I couldn't do anything

170
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,321
when the monster took my son.

171
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,026
It was too fast.

172
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,369
If I had caught my son's hand...

173
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,493
If I'd been able to reach that far,

174
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,075
would my son be still alive?

175
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,665
I can't forgive myself.

176
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm having nightmares every day.

177
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,495
The monster in my head is telling me
that it's all my fault.

178
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,167
Maybe it will be better
to just become a monster.

179
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,467
No! It's my fault. I should've
held onto him!

180
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,845
I should've kept my son next to me!

181
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,942
No! There was nothing I could do.

182
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,152
It's not my fault.

183
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,695
GREEN HOME BARBER SHOP

184
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,028
Shouldn't we do something about her?

185
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,784
Just leave her be.

186
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,696
She never associated
with people like us anyway.

187
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,870
She even sent her daughter
to a school in Gangnam.

188
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,632
She should've sent her
to a school close by.

189
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,814
- Are you awake now?
- I don't need any of that.

190
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,063
Yes, you do.

191
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,186
Your bleeding has stopped,
but you're still injured.

192
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,198
Is it okay to let him go like that?

193
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,243
There's no need to worry about him.

194
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,997
I bet he could take on a tiger by himself.

195
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,133
You look pretty hurt, too.

196
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,132
No, I'm fine.

197
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,632
Move that hand.
It'll get infected if you don't treat it.

198
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,134
I'll do it myself. Give me a bandage.

199
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,434
Move that hand, kid.

200
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,102
You're turning, aren't you?

201
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,439
Yu-ri, get away from him.

202
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,613
Put that hand away!

203
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,859
Or else I'll make sure your heart
never beats again.

204
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,036
Get out.

205
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,294
I wouldn't have helped you
if I knew you were a monster.

206
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Get out!

207
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,517
You have such a bad hobby.

208
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,914
I was just kidding.

209
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,489
You don't have to leave.

210
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,077
Why would I be scared of that
when I'm going to die soon, anyway?

211
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,464
- Pardon?
- Yu-ri.

212
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,789
You stay here.

213
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,836
You're going to the 14th floor, right?
And you said there are little kids there.

214
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,048
Yes, that's right.

215
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,590
Don't you need someone
who's not afraid of death?

216
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,089
- Sir!
- You're fired.

217
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,258
You've done well nursing an old man

218
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,717
with a bad temper.

219
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,935
I want to play superhero before I die.

220
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,689
Can you let me join you?

221
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,323
You're just acting tough.

222
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,440
What?

223
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,613
Don't fool yourself.

224
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,322
No one really wants to die.

225
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,657
Is becoming rude one of the symptoms
of turning into a monster?

226
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,420
Let me give you some advice, kid.

227
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,536
Not being afraid of death

228
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,747
and wanting to die are different things.

229
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,594
I'm planning on living longer than anyone.

230
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,239
What are you doing?

231
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,489
What are you hiding back there?

232
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,825
Hey. Are you crazy?

233
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,423
You really...

234
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,473
don't care about me.

235
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,465
What?

236
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,596
If I become a monster,

237
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,443
I'm sure I'll kill you.

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,940
You stupid bitch!

239
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,728
But...

240
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,992
I don't want to kill you
when I'm a monster.

241
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,785
That won't make me happy at all.

242
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,865
Jeez. You're talking nonsense.

243
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,171
My gosh.

244
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,637
Ma'am.

245
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,851
Is that man outside the door?

246
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,351
No, he went upstairs.

247
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,940
So don't worry.

248
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,407
He went upstairs?

249
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,165
Shit!

250
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,218
Son of a bitch...

251
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,271
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, ASSHOLE

252
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,883
Son of a bitch...

253
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,291
Have you been well?

254
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,542
What about the lady?

255
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,094
SURVIVORS, TURNING, DEAD

256
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,301
TURNING: CHA HYUN-SU,
KIM SEOK-HYEON, CHOI YUN-JAE

257
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,689
SURVIVORS: LEE EUN-HYEOK,
LEE EUN-YU, YOON JI-SU

258
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,239
Is anyone hearing this?

259
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,406
We're in despair right now.

260
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,575
We don't know

261
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,247
what to do, what's happening,

262
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,997
or how long we can survive this.

263
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,506
But we are still alive.

264
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,064
PREGNANT

265
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,968
We can't overcome this despair.

266
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,345
But...

267
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,113
I'm sure there is an end.

268
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,649
And we will hold out and fight

269
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,699
until that end.

270
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,985
Rest in peace.

271
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,662
I'm going to fight a little longer.

272
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,158
We

273
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,415
will survive.

274
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,310
Hey!

275
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,480
Over here! I don't think I'm turning!

276
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,686
Come and look at this!

277
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,157
Please help me!

278
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,235
Look!

279
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,503
Help me!

280
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,001
My goodness. You must've been scared.

281
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,424
Take care of him.

282
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,376
Why were you in there?

283
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,717
- Just in case.
- I would've lost my mind.

284
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,258
- I'm out now, so it's fine.
- Right...

285
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,592
Are you really cool
or just pretending to be?

286
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,257
Hey, Yun-jae is kind and patient.

287
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,347
- Are you a fan of Hanwha Eagles?
- Yes.

288
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,352
How did you know?

289
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,103
I can tell he's from Chungcheong Province.

290
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,225
But you're not using
any Chungcheong dialect.

291
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,902
I lived in Seoul for a long time.

292
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,488
What is he so nervous about?

293
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,317
- I guess it was really tough for him.
- Maybe.

294
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,025
Amazing. You guys are such hypocrites.

295
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,497
You pretended not to notice
when he was obviously

296
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,208
beaten up by someone,

297
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,788
but now you're acting all nice.

298
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,705
She hit way too close to home.

299
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,467
I feel like shit now. Damn it.

300
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,534
Hey.

301
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,077
That stupid gangster!

302
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,084
He's going to hear you.

303
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,570
He's a murderer.

304
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,414
That man's a murderer!

305
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,129
You fucking murderer.

306
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,955
He has no criminal record

307
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,670
and has no motive.

308
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,798
There isn't any evidence
to prove it was intentional.

309
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,719
And as his future shows great promise,

310
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,274
the court has decided
on the following sentence.

311
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,226
The accused, Hwang Seung-jae,

312
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,443
is sentenced to 11 months in prison
and 2 years of supervised probation.

313
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,235
You shouldn't die like that.

314
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,026
You shouldn't die peacefully.

315
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,659
No...

316
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,786
You don't deserve a humane death.

317
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,382
You...

318
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,218
You fucking murderer...

319
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,766
You don't deserve to live.

320
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,667
Why...

321
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,761
I LOVE YOU
DAD, MOM, KAPO

322
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,681
Su-yeong, why aren't they
bringing back our dad?

323
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,353
They can't

324
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,015
bring Dad here.

325
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,481
They said it will be too sad
for us if they bring him here.

326
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,570
That doesn't make sense!

327
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,163
PARK MIN-JU

328
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,549
Grandpa...

329
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,817
LEE SU-UNG

330
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,201
We were born human,

331
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,703
so we should die as humans.

332
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,601
Are you okay?

333
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,635
I should be strong

334
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,859
since I'm a mother.

335
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,195
What are you going to do now?

336
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,252
What do you mean?

337
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,132
It's not something
you can deal with alone.

338
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,628
It's not something to brag about.

339
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,550
I'll deal with this on my own.

340
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,641
Yi-kyung...

341
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,729
I still want to congratulate you.

342
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,979
Dinosaurs used to rule the earth,

343
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,073
but they went extinct
about 66 million years ago.

344
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,235
But this also proves that there is
a possibility humans

345
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,623
could also go extinct at any moment.

346
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,884
However, our ancestors
changed in order to survive,

347
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,298
and called it "evolution."

348
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,522
But if we humans are forced
to face an apocalypse,

349
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,148
will we...

350
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,565
choose another form of evolution?

351
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,912
Or will we choose to remain human?

352
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,840
