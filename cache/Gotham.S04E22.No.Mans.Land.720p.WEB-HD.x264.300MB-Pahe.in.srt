1
00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,602
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:04,897
Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

3
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:07,815
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,175
Whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

5
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,112
I care about you,

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,636
and I always will.

7
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:14,971
JEREMIAH: Jerome is dead.

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,439
Long live me.

9
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,541
(explosion)

10
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,709
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:21,911
I have bombs planted around the city.

12
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,591
GORDON: These are the buildings
Jeremiah's planning

13
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:24,948
to demolish with his bombs.

14
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,616
Once those buildings are blown,

15
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,211
they collapse and create the labyrinth
from the finished drawing.

16
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,658
GORDON: I have the locations

17
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:32,555
of every bomb Jeremiah planted.

18
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,093
How did they beat you, huh?

19
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:38,461
I'll have to start again.

20
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,762
RA'S AL GHUL: I had a vision.

21
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:42,232
Of Gotham in flames.

22
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:43,233
Together,

23
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:44,567
we can make that happen.

24
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,735
Now listen closely

25
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,003
to what you must do.

26
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:48,771
(gunshot)

27
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:51,508
Hold on, Selina.

28
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:53,576
(Alfred grunting)

29
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,213
(Bruce muttering) It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,750
- Make way.
- We'll do everything we can,

31
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,950
but the evacuation has us
dealing with a skeleton crew.

32
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:04,954
- Bruce.
- Selina.

33
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,467
I'm right here. You're at the hospital.

34
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,757
You're gonna be okay.

35
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,425
Are you gonna leave me?

36
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,027
No.

37
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:12,819
No, I'm gonna be right here.

38
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,990
You promise?

39
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,929
I promise.

40
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,271
(metal clanging)

41
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,490
You know, I don't know
why I brought him here.

42
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,051
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

43
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,978
You did the right thing, Alfred.

44
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,187
You say that.

45
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:44,556
You didn't see what he did to Selina.

46
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:47,759
Right. I better get to the hospital.

47
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:49,695
I'll stop by when I can.

48
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,695
Alfred.

49
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:54,539
He couldn't have put
a cap in that psycho,

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,330
- done the world a favor?
- Where are we?

51
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,355
Bomb squad's at the
last site on the map.

52
00:01:58,402 --> 00:01:59,883
After they disarm the
bomb, they're gonna put it

53
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:01,051
in a warehouse with all the others.

54
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,708
Also, the mayor called.

55
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,760
He wants to lift the evacuation order.

56
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,479
Tell him we're not doing anything

57
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,740
until we have all the bombs locked away.

58
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,057
Pardon me, Jim.

59
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:19,625
Don't you all have work to do?

60
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,961
(indistinct muttering)

61
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:26,632
What is it?

62
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,502
I'd like to press charges
against Bruce Wayne's butler.

63
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,065
I mean, just look at my face.

64
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:34,388
I think you look great.

65
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:37,709
And I'd like to speak to Bruce again.

66
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,639
We couldn't really talk before,

67
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,247
what with his girlfriend
bleeding out all over him.

68
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:47,552
You tried to prove
you're better than your brother.

69
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,554
But I'm still here.

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,289
The city's still here.

71
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,492
You're a failure, Jeremiah.

72
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:55,460
Enjoy Arkham.

73
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:58,019
Your brother did. Put him in the box.

74
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,113
Get him ready for transport.

75
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,776
Bring me Bruce Wayne, and I'll tell you
where the other bombs are.

76
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:04,803
We have all your bombs.

77
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,605
The maze bombs, yes.

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,441
I mean the other ones.

79
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:11,943
Jim...

80
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:15,347
as an engineer, you expect systems

81
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:16,682
to fail, so...

82
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,782
you build in redundancies.

83
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,790
And I am a very good engineer.

84
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,925
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

85
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:30,885
How many lives are you willing to bet?

86
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,131
You're right, you know.

87
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,634
I did fail.

88
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,410
I didn't yet understand
the vision I was servicing,

89
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,859
but I do now.

90
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,120
My eyes are open, as will yours be.

91
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,949
When you realize I'm not bluffing,

92
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:53,122
bring me Bruce Wayne.

93
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:55,721
And I'd like a coffee.

94
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:59,057
Black. Two sugars.

95
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:00,392
(sustained beeping)

96
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:03,165
No heartbeat.

97
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:06,531
Extraordinary.

98
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,814
This better work.

99
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,902
The chemicals
that turned him into this...

100
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,872
beautiful specimen

101
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:16,975
kept his organs surprisingly
well preserved.

102
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,545
Once we flush his body with antitoxin,

103
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:21,913
we'll top him off

104
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,849
- with some fresh blood.
- (whimpering)

105
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:26,752
And a quick jolt to the heart

106
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,781
will see him good as new.

107
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:36,528
You hear that?

108
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:38,163
You're gonna be cured.

109
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,122
- Yeah.
- (phone ringing)

110
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,417
What?

111
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,709
When?

112
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,340
What is it?

113
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,676
Selina's been shot
by that lunatic Jeremiah.

114
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:52,911
She's at Gotham General.

115
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,846
I have to go. I'll be back.

116
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:56,081
Of course.

117
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,682
You go check on the kid.

118
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:59,684
What? No, she's in surgery.

119
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,186
I'm gonna kill Jeremiah.

120
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:02,728
I'll come with you.

121
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:04,625
- I don't advise that. The procedure
- (groans)

122
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,610
should not be interrupted.

123
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,392
Stay.

124
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,853
I'll be here...

125
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,799
making sure everything goes as planned.

126
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,509
I'm doing this for Butch, not for you.

127
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,141
(softly): It's okay.

128
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,450
(siren wailing in distance)

129
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:35,754
Unfortunately, there's no telling

130
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:38,223
just how many battery bombs
Jeremiah produced.

131
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,692
He was fanatically secret
about his technology,

132
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:41,838
and Bruce trusted him, so...

133
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,829
He's gotta be bluffing.

134
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:45,363
- (knock on door)
- Yeah?

135
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,532
Cap, mayor's on the phone again.

136
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:49,134
The evacuation stays in effect.

137
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,815
I will tell him when it's lifted.

138
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:53,650
LUCIUS: <i>You think there are more bombs?</i>

139
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:56,619
Up till now, Jeremiah's actions sprang

140
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,410
from the fear and hatred of his brother.

141
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,879
Even his obsession with Bruce

142
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,950
is just a reflection of Jerome's.

143
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,249
What did he mean when he said

144
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:06,918
he didn't understand
the vision he was serving?

145
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,154
That his eyes had been opened?

146
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,324
YORK: Perhaps the previous mayor

147
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,025
took orders from a police captain.

148
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,161
- Sir, Captain Gordon is...
- Jim Gordon is not

149
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:18,597
the mayor of Gotham; I am.

150
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,466
The people need to know
the city is safe.

151
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,651
I'm lifting the order.

152
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,605
What are you looking at?

153
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,039
There's a man on the building

154
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,841
across the street, staring at us.

155
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:30,877
What?

156
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,391
(panicked screaming)

157
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:57,083
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

158
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,006
How many bombs are there?

159
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,559
Where are they?

160
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,570
I want to talk to Bruce Wayne.

161
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,011
(grunts)

162
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,449
Tell me where they are,
you son of a bitch.

163
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,301
- Who's helping you?
- Bruce Wayne.

164
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:16,021
You are never gonna talk
to Bruce Wayne, you hear me?!

165
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,657
Then more people will die. (chuckles)

166
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,259
But you never were good at holding on

167
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,571
to what you care about, were you, James?

We need you out here now!

♪ ♪

172
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,182
Can I help you?

173
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,784
Captain Gordon.

174
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,720
Major Rodney Harlan,
Seventh Division, Fort Henry.

175
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:51,723
Major, I assume you're here
to help with the evacuation.

176
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,408
If so, Detective Bullock can coordinate.

177
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,193
The governor has declared martial law.

178
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:58,596
Until this crisis is resolved,
I'm in charge here.

179
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,137
- Are you serious?
- Son, this is not a pissing match.

180
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:04,235
I was sent here to restore order

181
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:06,152
in a chaotic situation.

182
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,406
Can I count on you?

183
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,476
Yes, sir.

184
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,112
- What do we got?
- Not much. (sighs)

185
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:15,659
Valeska had a plan to knock down

186
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,940
a number of buildings in Gotham.

187
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:18,499
We recovered those bombs,

188
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,580
but he stashed away more.

189
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,586
Who's helping him? Somebody's got to be.

190
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:22,587
It's unclear.

191
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,289
We've heard reports that

192
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:25,790
his followers have turned on him,

193
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,112
which would indicate
he has someone else.

194
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,104
He would like to talk to Bruce Wayne.

195
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,663
That's clearly a trap.

196
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:33,098
His brother pulled the same gag.

197
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,577
There was a blimp, it was a whole thing.

198
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,068
We'll make sure he's safe.
Get me Bruce Wayne.

199
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,876
Major, you cannot bring
Bruce Wayne down here.

200
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,772
This is not your call, Captain.

201
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,767
- Now.
- SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

202
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,254
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

203
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,845
Arrest Captain Gordon.

204
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,780
- That's not necessary.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

205
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,827
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?!
- You listen to me!

206
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:52,484
This city is holding on by a thread.

207
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,120
I will not allow anything
to jeopardize it further,

208
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,389
including insubordination.

209
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:58,921
Escort Captain Gordon across the river.

210
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,203
Hold him there until you hear from me.

211
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,193
Get me Bruce Wayne.

212
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,867
(soldiers grunt)

213
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:13,838
I strike where you lie,
death's gentle cousin...

214
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,473
The answer's sleep, Ed.

215
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,542
(Gordon grunts)

216
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:21,279
It's polite to let people finish.

217
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,020
Rise and shine!

218
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,320
Good morning, sweetheart.

219
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,740
I know... waking up
in the Narrows, a prisoner.

220
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,700
Must feel like history repeating itself.

221
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,200
- Ed...
- Speaking of history,

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,290
remember when you
punched me in the face?

223
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,090
(groaning)

224
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,190
Ah, that felt good.

225
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,890
Listen to me, Jeremiah Valeska
has more bombs.

226
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,070
- You have to...
- I have to what, Jim?

227
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,680
Set you free? Help save the city?

228
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,650
Well, we've been there,
done that, and guess what.

229
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,920
Shocker! Lee and I are still fugitives.

230
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,790
I offered her a way out.

231
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,570
Oh, by returning the money?

232
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
She's dispersed that among all
the deadbeats of the Narrows.

233
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,450
Not exactly what I would've done,

234
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,620
but point is, it's gone.

235
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,900
Now, on with the show! We're a little...

236
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,800
(clicks tongue) pressed for time.

237
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,990
- (chuckling)
- (machine humming)

238
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,990
Ed.

239
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,200
Ed. Ed, wait. Ed...

240
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,230
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Ed!

241
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,360
- This is 50 pounds of pressure.
- Ed...

242
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,630
What are you doing?

243
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,100
(speaking French)
<i>Une peine forte et dure.</i>

244
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,400
Well, it's my own version of it, anyway.

245
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,950
You see, in the old days,
they used to pile weights

246
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,050
on a prisoner's chest

247
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,930
to try to get a confession.

248
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,200
Usually, they just died.

249
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,360
That's a hundred pounds.

250
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,500
(Gordon groans)

251
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,010
Why?

252
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,340
To help Lee break free from her history.

253
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,420
You see, she has this anchor,

254
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,780
dead weight, holding her to her past,

255
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,510
and that's you.

256
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,730
Once you're gone,

257
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,660
she'll finally be free to be the person

258
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,280
she was meant to be,
the person I want her to be.

259
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,460
(whirs)

260
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,360
- (groaning)
- 150.

261
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,270
You see, I saw you together.

262
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,840
I saw the way she looked at you.

263
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,170
So for her sake, you're gonna die.

264
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,260
And for my sake,

265
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,180
you're gonna suffer.

266
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,990
(whirring)

267
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,190
- (groans)
- Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

268
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,280
(laughs)

269
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,990
(car horn honking, siren wailing)

270
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,430
This evacuation's gonna leave
a lot of territory undefended.

271
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,650
A shame not to capitalize.

272
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,800
(grunting, blows landing)

273
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,250
Hello, Barbara.

274
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,760
- (panting)
- I was only hoping to talk.

275
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,340
By attacking my people?

276
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,290
- Call it a precaution.
- What do you want?

277
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,350
I'm leaving Gotham,
and I want you to come with me.

278
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,320
(scoffs) Try again.

279
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,790
I had a vision when I took back
the Demon's Head...

280
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,690
death, destruction, the city in flames.

281
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,870
But it didn't come to be.

282
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,190
- How disappointing for you.
- Indeed.

283
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,050
For many reasons.
Not least is that for centuries,

284
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,676
I have depended
on the Demon's Head to get ahead

285
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,170
of my enemies, but without the
full measure of its power...

286
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,750
Wait.

287
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,680
Are you saying you think
some of it might still be in me?

288
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,490
Interesting.

289
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,920
So I guess you're here
to kill me for it?

290
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,970
You misunderstand.

291
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,980
Remember the woman from the tapestry?

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,420
The one whose features you share?

293
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,610
The whore you murdered?
How could I forget?

294
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,270
I lied to get under your skin.

295
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,490
I loved her.

296
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,500
Very much.

297
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,370
I offered her eternity,
but she turned it down.

298
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,540
And now I make you the same offer.

299
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,180
Join me, and we will rule
the League of Shadows together.

300
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,250
Think about it.

301
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,270
What about your vision?
The city on fire?

302
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,090
I am making certain of it even now.

303
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,260
Its destruction will give rise
to the one I foresaw long ago,

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,860
the one who brought me here,

305
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,930
my heir.

306
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,540
(indistinct chatter, phones ringing)

307
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,339
Oh, Bullock? Bullock,
can you tell these punks

308
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,360
to let us go, please?

309
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,900
Major, the men escorting
Gordon were attacked.

310
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,110
Your guys didn't see who.

311
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,666
I'm thinking it's either
Valeska's cultists or...

312
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,110
Enough. Did you prepare
Valeska like I asked?

313
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,110
Yeah.

314
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,990
Mr. Wayne, you'll be perfectly safe.

315
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,936
If you can help us learn
the location of the bombs...

316
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,920
BRUCE: Major, you brought
me here against my will.

317
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,190
I want to go back to the
hospital and back to my friend.

318
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,860
Let's get this over with.

319
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,980
<i>Hello, Bruce.</i>

320
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,150
It's great to see you.

321
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,980
Where are the bombs, Jeremiah?

322
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,880
Closer, please.

323
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
Closer.

324
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,330
Tell me.

325
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,990
How is the young lady doing?

326
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,180
Well.

327
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,330
Hmm.

328
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,440
You know why we're destined
to be best friends?

329
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,630
Because we're very much alike.

330
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,510
You are as I used to be...

331
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,840
at war with your true nature.

332
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,490
You must truly embrace it
if you ever want to be free.

333
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,080
I'm just trying to help you.

334
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,120
Trying to help me.

335
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,170
By torturing Alfred?

336
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,870
Trying to destroy Gotham?
By shooting Selina?

337
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,840
You think we're alike

338
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,370
because there's a darkness
inside both of us.

339
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,840
But the difference is,
I know how to control mine.

340
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,890
I think you could be so strong.

341
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,410
I see it.

342
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,060
He sees it, too.

343
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,360
What do you mean, "he"?

344
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,410
Ask him about the bombs.

345
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,350
Where are the other bombs?

346
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,520
What bombs?

347
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,040
BRUCE: <i>The bombs you've
planted around the city.</i>

348
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,940
- You blew up the mayor.
- Ah.

349
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,450
That bomb. Yes, that was the only one.

350
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,770
But it did what it had to.

351
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,190
It got you here.

352
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,750
Well, that's enough.
I want my boy out, mate.

353
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,460
You said "he."

354
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,420
Who do you mean?

355
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,279
The one who opened up my eyes,
who showed me

356
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,640
that everything I was doing was not

357
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,700
to create a Gotham of my own, but yours.

358
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,190
The Gotham

359
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,630
you need.

360
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,410
Your dark island.

361
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,100
And it will come to be, Bruce.

362
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,150
Tonight.

363
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Tell me his name.

364
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,320
What did the doctor say?

365
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,980
Will the little bitch ever walk again?

366
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,890
What vertebrae did I sever?

367
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,390
I was hoping for the lumbar.

368
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,580
Tell me his name!

369
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,930
But you already know his name.

370
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,930
You're his heir.

371
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,720
Ra's al Ghul.

372
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,900
- No, it can't be.
- Shh.

373
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,510
(man screams)

374
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,040
- Bullock.
- Yeah.

375
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,630
350 pounds of pressure.

376
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,790
- (grunts)
- Getting hard to breathe?

377
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,820
- (grunts)
- I'll take that as a yes.

378
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,579
You know, if we listen carefully,

379
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,230
we can hear some ribs cracking soon.

380
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,330
(laughs)

381
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,270
450.

382
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,030
Healthy male adult.

383
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,450
His ribs should be able to take

384
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,070
about 450 pounds before they crack.

385
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
(groans)

386
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,400
Did you think you could
hide this from me, Ed?

387
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm Queen of the Narrows,
people tell me things.

388
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,350
I know how this looks.

389
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,926
It looks like you're trying
to crush Jim to death

390
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,026
because you think we still
have feelings for each other.

391
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,020
Well, perhaps we should jump
to why this is a good thing.

392
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,350
I can't wait.

393
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,820
He's holding you back.

394
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,390
From?

395
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,690
From being the person
that you are meant to be.

396
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,700
The woman that I love.

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,870
You really think so little of me?

398
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,300
- I don't follow that.
- How weak would

399
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,310
that person need to be if
Jim Gordon could hold her back?

400
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,920
It's actually insulting.

401
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,290
That's not what I intended. I...

402
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,530
Enough.

403
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,420
Yesterday,

404
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,500
you said a part of you
would always care for me.

405
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,270
The woman you loved is gone.

406
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,770
Understand?

407
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,240
Yes.

408
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,240
The Narrows is free
from landlords and gangs.

409
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,110
Every family has money
to build their life.

410
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,080
I'm done. I'm leaving.

411
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,280
I want you to come with me,

412
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
but if you kill Jim, don't bother.

413
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,460
And I will decide who I'm going to be.

414
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,690
Not you, not Jim Gordon. Me.

415
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,290
I'm leaving tonight.

416
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,960
It's your choice.

417
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,540
She chose me, Jim.

418
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,110
Did you hear that?

419
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,900
That's all I wanted.

420
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,920
You can have Gotham.

421
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,430
Uh... (grunts)

422
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,506
TABITHA: By the time I got there,

423
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,830
Jeremiah had already escaped.

424
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,800
Right. Where the hell is Ra's al Ghul?

425
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,500
Alfred. Let me guess.

426
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,970
Ra's helped Jeremiah kidnap Bruce,

427
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,770
so you came to me to find Ra's.

428
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,186
Would you care to tell me where he is?

429
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,510
I don't know where he is.

430
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,510
But I know where he's gonna be.

431
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,299
Ra's is leaving Gotham tonight,

432
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,010
after turning it to a pile of rubble.

433
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,620
With, I assume, Jeremiah's
help, so here's the deal.

434
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,040
You get to kill Jeremiah,

435
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,750
you get to rescue Bruce

436
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,850
and I get to kill Ra's.

437
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,700
And how do you plan on doing that, then?

438
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,130
I got a little surprise for him.

439
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,730
OSWALD: One question.

440
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,890
Who do I get to kill?

441
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,130
The only way to keep Butch on the table

442
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,250
was to promise I would come help.

443
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,840
Well.

444
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,460
Don't we make quite the little gang?

445
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,680
Let's do this.

446
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,280
(panting)

447
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,650
Hey.

448
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,730
My car's around the corner.

449
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,230
You're gonna want to ice those ribs.

450
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,370
Is it true, about you leaving Gotham?

451
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,570
Yes.

452
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,770
And taking Ed with you?

453
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,000
That's none of your concern.

454
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,760
Back in the GCPD, when I told
you there was so much

455
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,940
I wished I could change,
you asked me what I meant.

456
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,720
- Jim...
- I would change everything

457
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,410
that brought us to this point.

458
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
I would ask you to leave Gotham with me

459
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,050
that first moment I saw you,

460
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,850
and I would make sure
we had a life together.

461
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,290
Then you wouldn't be you.

462
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,760
Maybe that'd be a good thing.

463
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,560
No, it wouldn't.

464
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,690
I'm not going back to who I was.

465
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,590
But what you said yesterday,
about a part of you

466
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,120
always caring for me...
I feel the same way.

467
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,420
Good-bye.

468
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,420
Now go save Gotham.

469
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,306
- (phone ringing)
- Ready at your command.

470
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,620
Jim.

471
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,446
- GORDON: <i>Harvey?</i>
- Thank God you're all right.

472
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,320
- What the hell happened?
- <i>It's a long story.</i>

473
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,990
<i>- Did Harlan get Bruce to the precinct?</i>
- Yeah. It's bad.

474
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,600
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

475
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,920
Jeremiah escaped. He's got Bruce.

476
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,360
He took the bombs, all of them.

477
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,230
BRUCE: It's true.

478
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,130
- How did you two...
- Find each other?

479
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,990
I like to think it was you, Bruce.

480
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,490
You brought us together.

481
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,470
I trust things went smoothly?

482
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,230
Like clockwork.

483
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,700
Did your men retrieve my bombs?

484
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,940
They are en route to their
positions as we speak.

485
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,580
From here,

486
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,100
we can take in the full majesty

487
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,340
of Gotham's destruction.

488
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,250
You're both insane.

489
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,710
I know

490
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,960
it's difficult to fathom, Bruce,

491
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,050
but Jeremiah and I
are doing this for your benefit.

492
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,180
How is destroying Gotham
supposed to help me?

493
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,650
Because I had a vision,

494
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,259
that out of this crucible
of blood and fire

495
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,660
will rise the dark knight
that your city needs.

496
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,090
That I need.

497
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,300
To be honest, Bruce,

498
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,600
prophesies, visions...

499
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,640
not really my cup of tea.

500
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,740
But our friend revealed something to me:

501
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,580
that my twin obsessions,
rebuilding Gotham

502
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,050
and rebuilding you,
are one and the same.

503
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,600
You're the brother I never had,

504
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,700
the one Jerome never could be.

505
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,820
We will create a legacy in this city.

506
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,820
Gotham falls,

507
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,090
we rise.

508
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,030
Together.

509
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,170
A dozen transport vans were
stolen from the GCPD motor pool.

510
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,410
That's got to be how
they're carrying the bombs.

511
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,380
There were sightings here,
here and here.

512
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,126
They're moving towards
the outskirts of Gotham.

513
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,110
Jeremiah must've changed targets.

514
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,350
- Gordon.
- Perfect.

515
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,020
You have some explaining to do.

516
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,290
What happened to my men?

517
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,750
Major, we got serious fish to fry.

518
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,106
I didn't ask for your opinion,
Detective.

519
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,220
Two more sightings.

520
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,840
Bolyston and Third and then moving north

521
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,016
- along the Van Hook Highway.
- What? That doesn't make any sense.

522
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,260
What buildings would he
be targeting there?

523
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,930
Told me Jeremiah promised to
turn Gotham into a dark island.

524
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,120
We need to cancel the evacuation.

525
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,550
- Get those people off the bridges.
- Absolutely not.

526
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,166
They're filled with people
leaving the city.

527
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,640
We'll bring them back into Gotham.

528
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,920
- Buildings fall...
- The bridges are the targets.

529
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,030
- Harper, spread the word.
- Don't move.

530
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,970
Arrest Captain Gordon.

531
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,360
I wouldn't do that.

532
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,240
Arrest them both.

533
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,160
Officer, your radio.

534
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,670
This is Captain Gordon.

535
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,240
I want all the bridges
cleared immediately.

536
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,070
I repeat: clear all the bridges.

537
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,140
Civilization is so fragile, Bruce.

538
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,310
Gotham is soon to be each man
for himself,

539
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,120
a more savage place.

540
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,120
Sounds like fun.

541
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,850
Sure you want to leave?

542
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,700
Oh, hey, Bruce.

543
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,860
Freak.

544
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,690
RA'S AL GHUL: Hello, Barbara.

545
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,770
I'm really glad you came.

546
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,300
(sighs) Bad news, baby.

547
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm not leaving.

548
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,500
Gotham's in my blood.

549
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,770
And I don't think
I can let you leave, either.

550
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,140
You reforged it. Well, now.

551
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,980
You see, you say you're leaving,

552
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,150
but I've got a feeling
you're gonna be back.

553
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,230
And I don't like
looking over my shoulder.

554
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,060
Need I remind you, Barbara,

555
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,280
you've already tried using that knife.

556
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,890
And also, you're outnumbered.

557
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,200
Hmm. That Demon's Head's really
not working out for you, huh?

558
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,510
(yelling)

559
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,840
(siren wailing, horns honking)

560
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,710
(urgent chatter)

561
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,390
CHILD: Help! Help!

562
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,756
Bullock, what the hell is going on?

563
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,006
Why are we clearing the bridges?

564
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,350
Because we said to do it.
Now just do it.

565
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,760
Did a GCPD transport
van come through here?

566
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,760
About 20 minutes ago.
Had to make way for it.

567
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,150
What's your status?

568
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,776
HARPER: <i>All the bridges
are being cleared.</i>

569
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,076
But I just heard from our choppers

570
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,060
and they spotted vans on every bridge.

571
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,730
Vans are in position.

572
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,540
Bombs could go off any minute.

573
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,610
What the hell?

574
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,110
BULLOCK: Jim!

575
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,740
Out of the way!

576
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,350
(grunts)

577
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,280
When will you ever learn, Barbara?

578
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,750
The knife has to be held by...

579
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,390
Held by Bruce Wayne. I get it.

580
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,030
So you know, this is for Selina.

581
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,030
(grunts)

582
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,570
In that case, it must be
very disappointing for you,

583
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,190
dying like this.

584
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,480
(gunshots)

585
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,990
(grunting)

586
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,930
What are you doing?

587
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,610
Well done, Barbara.

588
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
(explosions booming)

589
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,760
(people screaming)

590
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,020
The choice is now yours.

591
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,780
Stay Bruce Wayne or accept your destiny.

592
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,260
Become Gotham's dark knight.

593
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,070
(alarm blaring, sirens wailing)

594
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,110
(gunshots, sirens blaring outside)

595
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,810
(sighs)

596
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,590
NYGMA: Seems Jeremiah's
made good on his threat.

597
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,790
And I take it that means
you're not leaving.

598
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,730
How can I?

599
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,920
They need me more than ever now.

600
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,650
No one will help them but me.

601
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,730
So what does that mean for us?

602
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,840
Ed, this is the end of the road for us.

603
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,030
All this time I've been
calling the other Ed stupid

604
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,780
and I'm the idiot.

605
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,340
You were never gonna leave with me.

606
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,890
You just wanted to save Jim Gordon.

607
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,490
You and Jim really
aren't that different.

608
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,720
You both think you know me.

609
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,390
You both want to change me.

610
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,900
Neither one of you really sees me.

611
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,260
(grunts)

612
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,770
(groaning)

613
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,070
For what it's worth, Ed,

614
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,070
I was offering you something real.

615
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,610
(pants)

616
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,780
But I was never gonna be who you wanted.

617
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,830
Sooner or later, you were
just gonna kill me.

618
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,260
It's just what you do.

619
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,050
That's quite possible.

620
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,950
(grunts)

621
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,770
But you're wrong, Lee.

622
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,570
I do see you.

623
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,540
(grunts)

624
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,910
(both groaning)

625
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,730
Calm.

626
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,230
Where's Butch?

627
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,030
What did you do with him?

628
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,990
I'm right here.

629
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,870
You're you.

630
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,580
Yeah.

631
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,950
I'm me again.

632
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,260
- Yeah.
- I love you.

633
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,470
I love you, too, baby.

634
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,040
(chuckles)

635
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,480
Oswald.

636
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,380
I'll never forget this.

637
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,380
Anything you need, I'm there.

638
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,320
Thank you, Butch.

639
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,060
I want you to know
I consider you a friend.

640
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,400
And that I am truly sorry.

641
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,860
What?

642
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,640
(groans)

643
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,520
Did you think I forgot
that you murdered my mother?

644
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,370
That I just got over it?

645
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,240
I have lived with that pain every day.

646
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,000
I could have killed you
any time I wanted,

647
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,140
but I believe in an eye for an eye.

648
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,040
You took away the one person I love,

649
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,660
so I took away the one person you love.

650
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,940
And you get to live with that.

651
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,180
(yells)

652
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,180
(grunts)

653
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,550
All of this...

654
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,680
finding Strange, curing Butch,

655
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,230
was all so you could kill him
in front of me?

656
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,530
Exactly.

657
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,800
But don't worry,

658
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,770
in time, when I feel

659
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,760

She did well in surgery,
