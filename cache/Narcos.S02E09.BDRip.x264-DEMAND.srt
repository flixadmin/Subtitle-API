1
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,133
Here to the right.

2
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,381
Stop.

3
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,177
Stay here.

4
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,527
Who's there?

5
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,602
Relax, sir. We come in peace.

6
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,903
Stay right there!

7
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,408
Relax.

8
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,185
How are the cows?

9
00:01:55,716 --> 00:02:00,051
The cops came here a few months ago.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,713
What did you tell them?

11
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,955
The truth.

12
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,487
That I haven't seen you in years.

13
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,932
You've gotten old, Pablo.

14
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,973
It happens.

15
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,503
You look younger.

16
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,006
It happens.

17
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,610
Life in the country keeps you young.

18
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,620
Be careful, it's hot.

19
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,157
What's your name?

20
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,693
Limón, sir.

21
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,667
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

22
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,796
- Jhon.
- Jhon.

23
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,274
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

24
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,642
- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

25
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,615
All right, gentlemen.

26
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,783
I get up at 5:00 a.m.

27
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,690
Good night.

28
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,287
Good night, Dad.

29
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,915
<i>I read in a book somewhere
about a rich guy who goes broke.</i>

30
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:56,426
<i>When he's asked how it happened,
how he had lost everything, he answered...</i>

31
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,225
<i>Slowly at first.
And then all at once.</i>

32
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,070
<i>For Pablo Escobar,
all at once had finally come.</i>

33
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,472
<i>His empire in shambles,
his army all dead or in jail,</i>

34
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:17,517
<i>Escobar did the one thing
he could still do, a disappearing act.</i>

35
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,251
<i>One month, 14 days and seven hours...</i>

36
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,819
<i>with no sightings, no intercepts, nothing.</i>

37
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,988
<i>While we waited
for his eventual reemergence,</i>

38
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,963
<i>the machine built to capture him
found itself idle.</i>

39
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,803
<i>And that brought
a different kind of danger.</i>

40
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,206
<i>One that comes
with too much time to think.</i>

41
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,603
<i>Some started to look inward
at the path we had taken to get here...</i>

42
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:50,810
<i>asking, how much of this blood is on me,
and how do I get clean?</i>

43
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,477
It is the state, not individuals,

44
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,457
that has justice in its hands
and the legitimacy to use arms.

45
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,152
<i>Under mounting political pressure,</i>

46
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,288
<i>Gaviria finally publicly denounced
Los Pepes.</i>

47
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,863
<i>And Los Pepes responded
with their own press release.</i>

48
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,500
<i>They said their job was done.</i>

49
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,197
<i>They were packing up and going home.</i>

50
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,206
<i>But Los Pepes wasn't something
you could turn on and off.</i>

51
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,835
<i>Its members were looking to the future.</i>

52
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,974
<i>One without Escobar.
And they each had their own version of it.</i>

53
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,542
<i>Los Pepes had knocked Pablo
out of the narco business</i>

54
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,590
<i>and that had created a vacancy
for a new cocaine king of Medellín.</i>

55
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,524
<i>Or, depending on who you asked,
maybe a queen.</i>

56
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,360
Gilberto's no longer our partner.
I don't care what he thinks.

57
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,331
Have you seen the news?

58
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,370
They issued a statement without us.

59
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,404
Los Pepes is done.

60
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,842
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

61
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,076
No one told me anything.

62
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,415
Listen to me, Berna.

63
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,781
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

64
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,752
We don't need anybody else.

65
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,216
Start moving this product now.

66
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,123
That's all fine, Judy.

67
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,928
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

68
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:13,057
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 million for Los Pepes?

69
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,427
I know where they are.

70
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,702
Be careful what you say.

71
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,241
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

72
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,970
I'm not interested in the reward.

73
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,815
I'm interested in my labs.

74
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,912
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

75
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:40,924
Sir?

76
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,788
Hello.

77
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,566
And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

78
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,732
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

79
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,468
This place is full of product.

80
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,976
What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

81
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:02,140
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

82
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,580
against the communists in the jungle.

83
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,020
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

84
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,453
And what do we do about Judy?

85
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,821
Do whatever you think is best.

86
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,453
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

87
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,465
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

88
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:28,668
What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

89
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,767
We'll learn.

90
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,314
If they can, why not us?

91
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,610
And what about Judy?

92
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,479
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

93
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,783
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

94
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,128
<i>Los Pepes may have disbanded,
but that didn't mean they were done.</i>

95
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,863
<i>The story of a vigilante army taking down
Escobar made for great headlines.</i>

96
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,566
<i>And while no one was named, it's not
to say it wasn't cause for concern.</i>

97
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,200
Yes, ma'am, as far as I know.

98
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,243
No, we're crystal clear on that.

99
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,714
Messina.

100
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,549
Yeah. He just got in.

101
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,349
- Hey, boss.
- Murphy fill you in?

102
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,258
Yeah.

103
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,888
This article's getting more traction
than we thought.

104
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,434
International news outlets keep calling,
want a statement from the ambassador.

105
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,867
- Are we giving one?
- No. Nobody is.

106
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,063
But we're watching it closely.

107
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,937
I don't need to tell you
it could look very bad for us.

108
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,406
I want to make sure we're covered.

109
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,841
Well, Los Pepes is disbanded.
It's basically over.

110
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,076
Look, I tend to agree. But the press may
shake a few more trees, see what falls.

111
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,275
What if someone talks?

112
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,410
The only people that are gonna
talk about Los Pepes is Los Pepes.

113
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,382
And they're not talking.

114
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,424
So we're covered.

115
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,787
We better be.

116
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,520
- Fabian.
- Yes?

117
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,463
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

118
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,091
Hurry up, Berna.

119
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,230
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

120
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,239
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

121
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,372
- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

122
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,108
Three in each.

123
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,281
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

124
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,924
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

125
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,048
Yes, sir.

126
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,349
- Peña.
- Javier.

127
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,521
What do you want?
Something happened, we need to talk.

128
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,117
I'm busy. I can't talk.

129
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,289
There's been an attempt on Judy.

130
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,496
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

131
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,136
Give me time.

132
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:19,935
What's going on?

133
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,173
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

134
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,180
Where you going?

135
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,352
I just want to make sure.

136
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,687
Fuck it. I don't want to know.

137
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,367
- Peña.
- Mr. Peña has arrived.

138
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,001
Let's go. Search.

139
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:25,105
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

140
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,910
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

141
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,745
I'm not leaving.

142
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,910
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

143
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:40,018
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

144
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:51,561
Look, you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

145
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,766
This is all your doing.

146
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,740
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

147
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,709
Don't call me again.

148
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,308
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

149
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,614
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

150
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,210
that's killed innocent people.

151
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:14,386
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

152
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,158
Are you threatening me?

153
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,393
Yes, I'm threatening you.

154
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,067
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

155
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,441
What do you want?

156
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,242
You're a cop.

157
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,417
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

158
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,182
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes'.

159
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,487
Arrest them.

160
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,351
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

161
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:53,256
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

162
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,640
We'll do it my way.

163
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,613
So you want Judy to be a rat?

164
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,344
I don't agree with this, Javier.

165
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,851
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

166
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:21,858
Berna, you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

167
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,229
Fuck your honor.

168
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,168
Says you.

169
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,865
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

170
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,002
And what have you done?

171
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,738
If you have a better idea, go for it.

172
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,378
Otherwise, this is the deal.

173
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,885
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

174
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,319
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

175
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:56,252
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

176
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,155
And you can go fuck yourself.

177
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,192
<i>Best way to make a bad story go away</i>

178
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,033
<i>is to come up with a better story...</i>

179
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,431
<i>and sell it hard.</i>

180
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,077
<i>This is one of the cornerstones
of American foreign policy,</i>

181
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,772
<i>and one we learned through years
of trial and error in Latin America,</i>

182
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,408
<i>Chile, Guatemala, Panama.</i>

183
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,010
<i>Getting caught with your pants
down sucks,</i>

184
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,613
<i>but if at the same time
you give the folks a big win,</i>

185
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:28,217
<i>like, say, dismantling the second biggest
drug cartel in the world,</i>

186
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,229
<i>well, then nobody's paying attention
to the bad story.</i>

187
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,595
<i>They're too busy patting you
on the back.</i>

188
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,933
<i>Risky plan? Yes.
But pressure will force you to take risks.</i>

189
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,302
<i>It'll force you to do a lot of things.</i>

190
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,069
We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

191
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,435
We don't even know where he is.

192
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,244
I don't know why
you're letting De Greiff come here.

193
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,114
He's coming to scare you.

194
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,254
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

195
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,484
You don't understand, do you?

196
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,926
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

197
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,897
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

198
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,493
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

199
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,004
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

200
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,233
They're going to give us their money?

201
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,309
No one is going to help us.

202
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,645
Everyone knows what that would mean.

203
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,124
Whatever he's doing...

204
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,771
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

205
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,496
Don't forget that.

206
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:20,368
Pablo? Pablo?
Can you hear me, Pablo? Please answer.

207
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,814
Tata, can you hear me?

208
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,686
Tata?

209
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,653
Can you hear me?

210
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,675
That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

211
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:09,510
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

212
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,811
Our donation to them is an advance.

213
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,478
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

214
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:19,286
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

215
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,326
What a fucking joke,

216
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,658
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

217
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:29,531
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

218
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,705
What? Any news about Judy?

219
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:38,642
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

220
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,170
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

221
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,479
What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

222
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,544
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

223
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,057
Don Berna. Him we found.

224
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,021
Where?

225
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,958
Here.

226
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,324
Out front.

227
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,000
Don Berna!

228
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,407
Welcome to Cali.

229
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,245
Gilberto, thank you, brother.

230
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,183
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

231
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,147
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

232
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,221
Very well, brother.

233
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,521
It's about Judy.

234
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,265
Where's Peña?

235
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,207
What do you need?

236
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,706
I got a tip. A guy.

237
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,510
He says he may have a lead, man.

238
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,014
Yeah, well, why don't you
give it to Martinez?

239
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,720
Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

240
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,893
He wants to give it to an American.

241
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,532
Yeah, what's he got? Who is this guy?

242
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,964
He's a guy I know.

243
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,904
Come on, Murphy. He's safe.
He knows I work with you.

244
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,439
What, he doesn't trust you?

245
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,139
All right. Bring him in.

246
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,203
He's in Bogotá.

247
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,551
So I gotta go to Bogotá
to meet your friend? Forget it.

248
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,482
Come on, Murphy.

249
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,619
You want Escobar, don't you?

250
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,553
Please, talk to him.

251
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,820
It's really important.

252
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,322
- All right. Set it up.
- Okay.

253
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,629
Thanks. You won't regret it.

254
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,797
In English, please!

255
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,738
Tata, are you there?
Can you hear me?

256
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,836
Tata, are you there?

257
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,608
There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

258
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,984
Why don't you come drink with us?

259
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,359
I'll be right there.

260
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,420
There's coffee in the thermos.

261
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,248
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

262
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,545
Those are the codes and frequencies.

263
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,779
Pablo is using a radio.

264
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,912
That's the way he communicates
with his wife.

265
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,789
And these are the codes, Murphy.

266
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,419
Yeah? Where did it come from
and how did you get it?

267
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:29,297
Lugo is a fiscal at the Tequendama.
He guards the family.

268
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,398
What do you want for this?
Money? Visa?

269
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,238
What do you want, Lugo?
Money? Visa?

270
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,401
It don't work that way, bud.

271
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,936
No visa, no money, you understand?

272
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,516
Is that what he thinks? That everyone
wants to go to the United States?

273
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,579
I don't want anything.

274
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:56,322
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

275
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,795
Find him and kill him.

276
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,110
So? What do you think?

277
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,979
Javi, he's given us everything.
We got codes, frequencies.

278
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,989
- I think it's real.
- Take it to Martinez.

279
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,052
I'm at the embassy.
I gotta call you back.

280
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,150
What you doing at the embassy?
What's going on?

281
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,730
Nothing I can't handle.
I'll fill you in when I can.

282
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,028
- Javi, let's get on this.
- Murphy, take it to Martinez.

283
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,534
I'll call you later.

284
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,135
Peña's in Bogotá?

285
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,173
Yeah, Javi's into something. Shit.

286
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:48,145
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Peña, okay?

287
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,807
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

288
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,880
We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

289
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,686
Don't lie to me again, Peña.

290
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:07,722
This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

291
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,099
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

292
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,936
It's not intel anyone can provide.

293
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,406
She has leverage over you.

294
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,438
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

295
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,846
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

296
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,013
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

297
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:37,522
She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

298
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,928
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

299
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,628
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

300
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,794
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

301
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:50,033
And Peña. Be discreet. Tell no one.

302
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,874
There are people in this building
who won't like it.

303
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,253
Going down?

304
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,831
So how's it going?

305
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,925
What are you doing, Pablo?

306
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,593
You don't know how to tie a knot.

307
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,037
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

308
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:40,582
Wanted, Pablo Escobar.
Reward 2,700,000 pesos.

309
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:45,089
Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.

310
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:51,186
In Bogotá, 222-50-12.
In Medellín, 461-11-11.

311
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,447
The kids would love to be here.

312
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,928
I've been thinking...

313
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,768
I could buy some land here
next to you.

314
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,907
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

315
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,314
And have my own farm.

316
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,532
We could run it together.

317
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,768
What do you think?

318
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,286
We need to finish putting up the wire.

319
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:20,206
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

320
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,213
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

321
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:32,080
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

322
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:39,891
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

323
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,592
You are a survivor.

324
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,267
A man of action.

325
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,604
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

326
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,076
- Good evening.
- Colonel.

327
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,443
Sit.

328
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:01,915
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

329
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,717
Yes, Colonel.
I verified the frequencies.

330
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,020
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

331
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,188
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

332
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,230
Did you hear him?

333
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,058
No, Colonel, not yet.

334
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:19,030
All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

335
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,631
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

336
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:26,268
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

337
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,605
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

338
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,911
can you hear him?

339
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,585
No. The antenna is not that strong.

340
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:06,251
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

341
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,447
I wasn't paying that much attention.

342
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,754
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

343
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,491
So, what do you think?

344
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,002
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

345
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:29,834
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

346
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,146
Now hold on to the pig.

347
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,320
Fuck!

348
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,216
Funny that you don't like blood.

349
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,488
How strange.

350
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,330
What are you trying to say?

351
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,399
Clean yourself.

352
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,680
You know what's funny?

353
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,321
That my dad...

354
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:27,427
has no fucking idea who I am.

355
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,932
I know very well who you are.

356
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:39,270
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

357
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,538
Is that right?

358
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,775
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

359
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,442
The United States? Disgusting.

360
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:52,247
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

361
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:56,794
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

362
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,024
- So what? So what? So what?!
- So what?!

363
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,899
And what about you? What about you?!

364
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:13,238
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

365
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,110
On this shithole farm.

366
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,886
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

367
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,055
Not even one fucking picture of them here.

368
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,620
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

369
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:35,962
That's right.

370
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,930
Now tell me...

371
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,768
Tell me...

372
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,248
what you think of me.

373
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,288
- Who cares?
- I do.

374
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,115
It's important to me.

375
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:08,157
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

376
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,465
But that's not possible, Pablo.

377
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,373
You chose your life!

378
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,835
Be in charge of it.

379
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,212
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

380
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,217
I'm ashamed.

381
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,848
I think you're a murderer.

382
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,956
At last, the truth.

383
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,702
At last, the truth.

384
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,205
A truth...

385
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,042
that breaks my heart.

386
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,882
Leave me alone.

387
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,789
Limón.

388
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:44,859
Yes, sir?

389
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,064
You like it here, right?

390
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,729
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

391
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,865
Peaceful.

392
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,815
Kneel down.

393
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:22,657
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

394
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,638
Under that tree is a buried case of money.

395
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,002
Go get it.

396
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,338
Are we leaving, boss?

397
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,739
Yes.

398
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:37,746
Go on.

399
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,965
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

400
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:02,530
How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

401
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,871
Do you not realize that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

402
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:12,713
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

403
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,276
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

404
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,791
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

405
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,156
You're sorry?

406
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,656
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

407
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,689
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

408
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,735
But you can't help us find asylum.

409
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,535
That's bullshit!

410
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,009
They're going to...

411
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,373
kill us all.

412
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,478
Mama, what's wrong?

413
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,990
Nothing, my love.

414
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,071
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

415
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,869
but I don't know what else to do.

416
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:23,052
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

417
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,055
Tell him to surrender.

418
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:30,622
The power of the law is your last hope.

419
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,797
Think about your children.

420
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,946
Shit.

421
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,522
- No.
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

422
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,857
- Do you like it? Yes?
- No. No.

423
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,627
Fuck.

424
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,726
Jhon. What are you doing here?

425
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,804
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

426
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,540
We spent it. It's gone.

427
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,448
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

428
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:46,287
You've already hurt me.

429
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,423
You fucked up my life.

430
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,603
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

431
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:03,604
Hang on, Maritza.

432
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,485
And this?

433
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:30,631
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

434
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:34,968
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

435
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,703
You lying bitch! Get off!

436
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,608
Motherfucker! Bastard!

437
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,445
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

438
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,214
Sooner or later,
they'll find you anyway.

439
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,486
What did you say?

440
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,184
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

441
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:00,697
I might! Why shouldn't I?

442
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:07,404
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero?

443
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:09,896
Jhon!

444
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,344
I know you! Get that shit out...

445
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,097
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

446
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,199
But I have bad news.

447
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,298
- What happened?
- Look.

448
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,581
It's rotten, sir.

449
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,592
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

450
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,737
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

451
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,304
There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

452
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,921
Get your things. We're leaving.

453
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,622
Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

454
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,001
Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

455
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,037
Where?

456
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,197
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

457
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,165
We've used it before.

458
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,870
Berna knows where.

459
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,105
I'll see you there.

460
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,901
Everything is ready, Judy.
Get in.

461
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,735
Let's go, Flaco.

462
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,170
She's on her way.

463
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,555
I know what you're thinking.

464
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,657
I'm making a mistake.

465
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,833
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

466
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,359
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

467
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:27,598
Up here, Flaco.

468
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,378
I can't protect a rat.

469
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:05,035
I didn't think you'd betray me.

470
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,610
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

471
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,273
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

472
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:15,284
And if I don't, what? What happens?

473
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:18,321
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

474
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,447
And I won't protect you anymore.

475
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,256
Tell me something.

476
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,583
Did Cali arrange this?

477
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,589
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

478
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,693
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

479
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,202
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

480
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:15,040
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

481
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,838
I only protected your life.

482
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:23,878
Relax. You'll have money.

483
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:27,219
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

484
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,992
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

485
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:36,527
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

486
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,835
Don't worry about a thing.

487
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:51,209
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

488
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,070
Hey, man. How's it going?

489
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,073
Everything good at the safe house?

490
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,937
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

491
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,778
Reassigned. Headed home.

492
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:30,878
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

493
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:33,219
Something about chain of command.

494
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,884
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

495
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:41,861
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald in...

496
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,866
oh, about five hours.

497
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,893
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

498
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:52,205
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

499
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,471
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

500
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,640
it won't be pointed in my direction.

501
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,916
You should've stayed in your lane.

502
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,391
And Cali too, right?

503
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,595
They get a pass?

504
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,791
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

505
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,232
Pay me?

506
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,902
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

507
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:27,110
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

508
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:32,682
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

509
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:37,915
For everything you know, you're
extremely naive.

510
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,650
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

511
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,419
The laughs.

512
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,587
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

513
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:51,427
I guess word about this Miami Herald thing
is spreading like a prairie fire.

514
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:53,831
And bring your passport.

515
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,706
I think you're going home, but...

516
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,106
you didn't hear that from me.

517
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:46,612
Tata?

518
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,417
Tata, can you hear me?

519
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,555
Pablo?

520
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,956
It's me, my love.

521
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,059
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

522
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,294
I've missed you so much.

523
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,994
Where have you been, Pablo?

524
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,106
I had to do something very important.

525
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,516
But I'm back home, my love.

526
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,645
I'm home.
