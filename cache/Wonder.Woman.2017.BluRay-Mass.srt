1
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:51,403
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

2
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,198
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:59,077
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,748
<i>It is a land of magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,293
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:11,423
<i>But the closer you get,</i>

7
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:16,261
<i>the more you see the great darkness
simmering within.</i>

8
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:23,226
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,896
<i>Mankind is another story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,882
<i>What one does when
faced with the truth</i>

11
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:34,154
<i>is more difficult than you think.</i>

12
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:46,166
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

13
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,294
<i>A long, long time ago.</i>

14
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,173
<i>And now,</i>

15
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,677
<i>I will never be the same.</i>

16
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,352
<i>Merci.</i>

17
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,567
Hello, Diana.

18
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,486
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.

19
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:58,446
<i>Diana!</i>

20
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,949
Diana!

21
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:02,534
<i>Come back!</i>

22
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:43,783
- It looks very good.
- Very good.

23
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,951
How is she doing?

24
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,119
She's good.

25
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,620
- Keep working with her.
- I will.

26
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,831
Naomi.

27
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:13,354
Diana!

28
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,316
Diana, I see you.

29
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,699
Where are you going?
Slow down!

30
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,836
Hello, Mother.

31
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,838
How are you today?

32
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,884
<i>Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits.</i>

33
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,596
But don't you think
it's time to start my training?

34
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,015
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

35
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,017
Does she?

36
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,354
I could begin showing her some things.

37
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,358
She should at least
be able to defend herself.

38
00:04:58,524 --> 00:04:59,567
From whom?

39
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,694
In the event of an invasion.

40
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:05,198
<i>Isn't that why I have
the greatest warrior in our history</i>

41
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,700
leading an entire army, General?

42
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,788
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

43
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:15,041
But you know,
a scorpion must sting,

44
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,794
<i>- a wolf must hunt...”</i>
- She is a child.

45
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,961
<i>The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.</i>

46
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,089
<i>But, Mother...</i>

47
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,799
There will be no training.

48
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,183
<i>What if I promised to be careful?</i>

49
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,894
It's time to sleep.

50
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,982
What if I didn't use a sword?

51
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:41,818
Fighting does not make you a hero.

52
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,737
Just a shield then. No sharp edges.

53
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:49,075
Diana, you are the most
precious thing in the world to me.

54
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,955
I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself

55
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,666
and begged Zeus to give you life.

56
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,626
You've told me this story.

57
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,630
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

58
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:06,426
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

59
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:07,593
Yes!

60
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,264
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

61
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,314
Long ago, when time was new

62
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:23,943
and all of history was still a dream,

63
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,446
<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i>

64
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:29,282
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

65
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,996
<i>Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.</i>

66
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,041
<i>Beings born in his image,</i>

67
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:41,878
<i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

68
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:46,716
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

69
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:50,887
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

70
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:54,307
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

71
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:58,811
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

72
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,193
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

73
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,487
<i>He turned them against one another</i>

74
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:10,656
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

75
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:15,703
<i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i>

76
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,498
<i>to influence men's hearts with love</i>

77
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:21,167
<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

78
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:27,340
<i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i>

79
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,722
<i>But it did not last.</i>

80
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,066
<i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt</i>

81
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,194
<i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i>

82
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:58,454
<i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i>

83
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,874
<i>Ares killed them one by one,</i>

84
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,211
<i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i>

85
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:10,925
<i>Zeus used the last of his power
to stop Ares,</i>

86
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,556
<i>striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.</i>

87
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:18,891
<i>But Zeus knew</i>

88
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:23,229
<i>that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.</i>

89
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:26,274
<i>An endless war,</i>

90
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,443
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i>

91
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,405
<i>and us with them.</i>

92
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,991
<i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i>

93
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,244
<i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i>

94
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:43,416
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i>

95
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,835
<i>to hide us from the outside world,</i>

96
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:48,337
<i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i>

97
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,094
<i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>

98
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,981
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

99
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,443
And the Godkiller?

100
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,157
The Godkiller?

101
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,951
The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god.

102
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:21,287
<i>Can I see it?</i>

103
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,174
The Gods gave us many gifts.

104
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,635
One day, you'll know them all.

105
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:39,055
This great tower is where we keep them.

106
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:52,652
The Godkiller.

107
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,949
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

108
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,910
Who would wield it?

109
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:05,998
I pray it will never be called to arms.

110
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,669
But only the fiercest among us
even could.

111
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:12,046
And that is not you, Diana.

112
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:15,258
You see, you're safe,

113
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,761
and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with.

114
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:33,943
You keep doubting yourself, Diana.

115
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,320
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

116
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,197
No, I don't.

117
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:44,395
You are stronger than you believe.

118
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,539
<i>You have greater powers than you know.</i>

119
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,624
<i>- But if you don't try hard...”
- Diana!</i>

120
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:01,387
Are you hurt?

121
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,139
No, Mother, I'm fine,

122
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:05,016
- I was just...”
- Training.

123
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:09,020
It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be.

124
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,397
Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...

125
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:13,774
No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to...

126
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,151
Take her to the palace.

127
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:17,987
Off you go.

128
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,706
You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

129
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:33,127
You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.

130
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,379
You speak of a time that may never come.

131
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,466
He might never return.

132
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,344
He could have died from his wounds.

133
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,430
Ares is alive.

134
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:47,933
You feel it, as I do, in your bones.

135
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,228
It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

136
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,986
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

137
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:01,906
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

138
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,369
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

139
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:20,841
You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her.

140
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:23,427
<i>Five times harder,</i>

141
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,638
<i>ten times harder.</i>

142
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,724
<i>Until she is better than even you.</i>

143
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,268
<i>But she must never know the truth</i>

144
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,187
<i>about what she is</i>

145
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,189
<i>or how she came to be.</i>

146
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,078
Harder.

147
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,039
<i>You're stronger than this, Diana.</i>

148
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,374
Again.

149
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:53,976
Never let your guard down.

150
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:56,937
You expect the battle to be fair.

151
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,522
A battle will never be fair.

152
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:13,454
Antiope!

153
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:16,373
Lay still.

154
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:17,750
You are bleeding.

155
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:21,754
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana, wait.

156
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:29,220
What have I done?

157
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,139
I'm sorry.

158
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,751
<i>Where did this fog come from?</i>

159
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,174
There. Go forward!

160
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,402
<i>There he is! The pilot! I can see him.</i>

161
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:32,778
He's there!

162
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,643
Wow.

163
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,064
You're a man.

164
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:16,321
Yeah. I mean...

165
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,992
Do I not look like one?

166
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,789
Where are we?

167
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:27,833
Themyscira.

168
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,251
Therma-what?

169
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:30,753
Who are you?

170
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,764
I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys.

171
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,973
What?

172
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,993
The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here.

173
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:47,144
- The Germans?
<i>- Diana!</i>

174
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,521
Step away from her, now!

175
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:53,025
<i>Ready your bows!</i>

176
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:57,863
They have guns, right?

177
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,615
Fire!

178
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,367
Fire!

179
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:04,870
Come on!

180
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,051
Stay there!

181
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:22,174
Shield!

182
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:45,113
No!

183
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,281
No!

184
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:53,538
No.

185
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:57,668
No, no. Antiope. Antiope.

186
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,504
Antiope, hey. Hey, hey.

187
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,298
Hey.

188
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:04,883
- Diana.
- Be still.

189
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:08,178
The time has come.

190
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:11,390
You... You must...

191
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:14,726
What? What, Antiope?

192
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,232
Godkiller.

193
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,859
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

194
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:24,987
- Go where?
- Go...

195
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:28,031
No, please, no. No. No!

196
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:30,158
No, no, no.

197
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,786
- No!
- Antiope!

198
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:35,539
No!

199
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:44,089
- You.
- No.

200
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,009
No, Mother, no.

201
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:48,927
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

202
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:50,929
What man fights against his own people?

203
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,932
- These aren't my people.
- Then why do you wear their colors?

204
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,060
I can't tell you that.

205
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:58,270
You need to tell us now!

206
00:22:58,437 --> 00:22:59,479
What is your name?

207
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,232
I can't tell you that either.

208
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,861
We should kill him now,
and be done with it.

209
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,029
<i>If he dies,</i>

210
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:12,367
we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came.

211
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,710
My, uh,

212
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:27,632
name is Captain Steve Trevor,
pilot, American Expeditionary Forces.

213
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,927
Serial number 8141921.

214
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,346
That's all I'm at liberty to...

215
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,478
Assigned to British Intelligence.

216
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,939
What the hell is this thing?

217
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:46,151
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

218
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,153
But it's really hot.

219
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,323
It is pointless, and painful, to resist.

220
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,283
What is your mission?

221
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,245
Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think.

222
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:58,455
What is your mission?

223
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:02,834
I am a...

224
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:08,507
I am a...

225
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:13,178
I am a spy.

226
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,975
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

227
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,021
<i>British Intelligence got word</i>

228
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:25,649
<i>that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,</i>

229
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:29,694
<i>would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire.</i>

230
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:33,031
<i>I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.</i>

231
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:36,701
<i>According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,</i>

232
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:39,538
<i>no money, no munitions of any kind.</i>

233
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:41,039
<i>But our intel was wrong.</i>

234
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:43,917
<i>The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.</i>

235
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:47,212
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

236
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:48,964
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

237
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:55,178
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

238
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:59,057
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Dr. Poison."</i>

239
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,685
<i>And for good reason.</i>

240
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:34,050
<i>From what I could tell, if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

241
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:37,262
<i>millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

242
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:40,015
<i>I was there to observe and report,
nothing more,</i>

243
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,560
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

244
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,941
<i>I'm so close.</i>

245
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:53,153
<i>I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask.</i>

246
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,530
I just... I need more time.

247
00:25:55,697 --> 00:25:57,577
Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time.

248
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,534
This work, this...

249
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:06,124
Get that man!

250
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,500
<i>There!</i>

251
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,933
But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,

252
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:08,270
it could stop millions more from dying.

253
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,189
It could stop the war.

254
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:13,483
War? What war?

255
00:27:15,694 --> 00:27:17,112
The war.

256
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:22,534
The war to end all wars.

257
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:25,578
<i>Four years,</i>

258
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,998
<i>27 countries,</i>

259
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:30,125
25 million dead,

260
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,711
<i>soldiers and civilians.</i>

261
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,796
Innocent people,

262
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:37,966
women and children slaughtered.

263
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:42,804
<i>Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.</i>

264
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,144
Weapons far deadlier than you can

265
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:53,565
ever imagine.

266
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:59,654
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

267
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,824
<i>It's like the world's going to end.</i>

268
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,328
Should we let him go?

269
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:09,080
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

270
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:11,333
We cannot hold him forever, my queen.

271
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:13,585
Mother. Excuse me,

272
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:17,589
but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.

273
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:19,116
What are you talking about, child?

274
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:22,177
Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it "a war without end."

275
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:25,263
Millions of people already dead.

276
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:27,682
Like nothing he's ever seen.

277
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,268
Only Ares could do such a thing.

278
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,357
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

279
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:38,336
I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenseless

280
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,402
to go and fight their war.

281
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,446
It is not their war.

282
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:44,783
Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate...

283
00:28:44,949 --> 00:28:47,369
That was a story, Diana!

284
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:48,975
There is much you do not understand.

285
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:50,080
Men are easily corrupted.

286
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:53,041
Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!

287
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:56,086
It is Ares who has
these Germans fighting.

288
00:28:56,252 --> 00:29:00,298
<i>And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance.</i>

289
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:02,884
As Amazons, this is our duty.

290
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,887
But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

291
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,390
So you will do nothing.

292
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:10,137
As your queen, I forbid it.

293
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:24,489
Strange.

294
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:28,284
Is it true you saved his life?

295
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:29,828
Who told you that?

296
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:30,995
He did.

297
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:55,353
Whoa! I...

298
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,524
I didn't see you come in.

299
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:07,699
Would you say you're a

300
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:11,119
typical example of your sex?

301
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:13,413
I am

302
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,376
above average.

303
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,131
What's that?

304
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,468
It's a...

305
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,512
Oh! Um...

306
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,641
It's a watch.

307
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:35,059
A watch?

308
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,227
<i>Yeah, it's a watch.</i>

309
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,812
It tells time.

310
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:40,815
My father gave it to me.

311
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:44,125
It's been through hell and back
with him.

312
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:48,448
Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking.

313
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:50,492
What for?

314
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,995
Because it tells time.

315
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,916
When to eat, sleep, wake up, work.

316
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,462
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

317
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,088
Yeah.

318
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,096
Can I ask you some questions?

319
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,933
<i>- Where are we?</i>
- Themyscira.

320
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:18,603
No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

321
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,332
What is this place?
Who are you people?

322
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,441
Why does the water do that?

323
00:31:23,608 --> 00:31:26,253
<i>How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?</i>

324
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:28,404
We speak hundreds of languages.

325
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,659
We are the bridge to
a greater understanding between all men.

326
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:35,954
Right.

327
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:42,627
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,

328
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:48,299
but thank you for dragging me
out of the water.

329
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:51,135
Thank you

330
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,805
for what you did on the beach.

331
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:02,939
So,

332
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,692
you're here to let me go?

333
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,655
I tried, but it's not up to me.

334
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,991
I even asked them to send me with you.

335
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:16,911
Or anyone.

336
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:18,121
An Amazon.

337
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:19,956
The Amazons.

338
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:21,583
The Amazons?

339
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,502
<i>It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.</i>

340
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:27,005
And I wish to go.

341
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:31,884
But my mother will not allow it.

342
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,305
Well,

343
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,850
I can't say I blame her.

344
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:40,057
<i>The way this war is going,</i>

345
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:43,104
I wouldn't want to
let anyone I care about near it.

346
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:45,189
Then why do you want to go back?

347
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:47,775
I don't think "want" is the word.

348
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:52,155
I guess I gotta try.

349
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,117
My father told me once,

350
00:32:56,284 --> 00:32:58,644
he said, "If you see something wrong
happening in the world,

351
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:01,497
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

352
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,376
And I already tried "nothing."

353
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,328
Nice outfit.

354
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:47,705
Oh, thank you.

355
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:51,459
Now, I will show you
the way off the island

356
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:53,586
and you will take me to Ares.

357
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,421
Deal.

358
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:05,973
I'm leaving in that?

359
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,391
We are.

360
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,812
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

361
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,438
Do you not know how to sail?

362
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:13,765
Of course I know how to sail.

363
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:15,658
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

364
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:17,944
It's been a while.

365
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:48,933
I'm going, Mother.

366
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,728
I cannot stand by
while innocent lives are lost.

367
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:58,025
If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must.

368
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:01,153
I have to go.

369
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,697
I know.

370
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:06,200
<i>Or at least I know I cannot stop you.</i>

371
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:13,666
There is so much...

372
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:15,918
So much you do not understand.

373
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:17,545
<i>I understand enough.</i>

374
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:21,257
That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

375
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,469
Like you once did.

376
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:28,055
You know that if you choose to leave,

377
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,142
you may never return.

378
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,979
Who will I be if I stay?

379
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:46,824
This belonged to
the greatest warrior in our history,

380
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:49,994
our beloved Antiope.

381
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:52,288
Make sure you are worthy of it.

382
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:55,124
I will.

383
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,713
Be careful in the world of men, Diana.

384
00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:04,634
They do not deserve you.

385
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:12,183
You have been my greatest love.

386
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,480
Today,

387
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:21,525
you are my greatest sorrow.

388
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:01,774
Should you have told her?

389
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,113
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

390
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,626
How long until we reach the war?

391
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,963
The war? Which part?

392
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,381
The Western Front in France

393
00:39:25,548 --> 00:39:27,925
is 400 miles long
from the Alps to the North Sea.

394
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:31,512
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

395
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,557
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

396
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,855
Ares? As in, the God of War?

397
00:39:41,022 --> 00:39:45,109
The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

398
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,611
With this.

399
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:50,239
And once I do,

400
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,408
the war will end.

401
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,625
Look, I appreciate your spirit,

402
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,336
<i>but this war is...</i>

403
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,714
It's a great big mess.

404
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,384
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

405
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:13,271
I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can.

406
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,389
I'm the man who can!

407
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:17,349
And once I find and destroy Ares,

408
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:20,144
the German armies
will be freed from his influence

409
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:23,314
and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better.

410
00:40:27,818 --> 00:40:28,819
Great.

411
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:30,821
You'll see.

412
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:35,326
What are you doing?

413
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:37,828
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to

414
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,372
get some sleep.

415
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:46,504
And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?

416
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,339
Does the average man not sleep?

417
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:55,596
Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh...

418
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:56,843
You don't sleep with women?

419
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:59,850
No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with...

420
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:02,603
Yes, I do.

421
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,231
But, out of the, uh,

422
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,817
confines of marriage

423
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:09,401
it's just...

424
00:41:11,862 --> 00:41:13,864
It's not polite to assume, you know?

425
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:19,078
"Marriage"?

426
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:21,163
Marriage. Do you not have that on...

427
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:23,791
You go before a judge

428
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:28,129
and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other

429
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:29,421
until death do you part.

430
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:32,550
And do they?
Love each other till death?

431
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:34,468
Not very often, no.

432
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:36,053
Then why do they do it?

433
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,306
I have no idea.

434
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:41,952
So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you.

435
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:44,296
I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

436
00:41:44,353 --> 00:41:45,437
<i>There's plenty of room.</i>

437
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:48,149
- Then, fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

438
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:50,877
I know it's up to me, I'm making
the choice. I will come sleep with you.

439
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:51,902
Okay.

440
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,948
Yeah, just...

441
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:58,450
Okay.

442
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:18,095
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

443
00:42:18,846 --> 00:42:21,056
You know, being a spy,

444
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:24,518
you have to show a certain amount of

445
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:27,771
vigor.

446
00:42:31,025 --> 00:42:34,278
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

447
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:36,197
I had no father.

448
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:38,490
My mother sculpted me from clay

449
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,784
and I was brought to life by Zeus.

450
00:42:44,163 --> 00:42:45,623
Well, that's neat.

451
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,628
<i>Sorry.</i>

452
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,632
Where I come from,

453
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:58,177
babies are made differently.

454
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:01,013
You refer to reproductive biology.

455
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,765
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

456
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:05,100
I know all about that.

457
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:08,103
I mean, I refer to that,
and other things.

458
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,314
The pleasures of the flesh.

459
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:15,110
Do you know about that?

460
00:43:16,278 --> 00:43:20,074
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
<i>Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.</i>

461
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:23,953
- All 12, huh?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

462
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:30,042
Did you bring any of those with you?

463
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:31,835
You would not enjoy them.

464
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:33,337
I don't know. Maybe.

465
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:34,630
<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>

466
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:36,173
Why not?

467
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,468
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,

468
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:41,512
but when it comes to pleasure,

469
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:43,764
unnecessary.

470
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:45,432
No, no.

471
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:51,063
Good night.

472
00:43:51,272 --> 00:43:52,523
Night.

473
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:06,662
How long until we are operational?

474
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:08,038
Two days, sir.

475
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:09,873
You have until tonight, Captain.

476
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,169
Sir, the men have had no food,
no sleep.

477
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:16,505
Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?

478
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:18,590
Do you hear me making excuses?

479
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:19,758
No.

480
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:21,385
Your men are weak, complacent.

481
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:24,513
You've let them forget that
an attack can happen at any time,

482
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,098
from any quarter!

483
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:27,545
So, let's you and I remind them,

484
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,600
shall we?

485
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:45,200
- Doctor.
- General.

486
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:46,368
Progress?

487
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:47,828
Not enough.

488
00:44:48,704 --> 00:44:50,664
It is over, General.

489
00:44:50,831 --> 00:44:52,708
Germany is giving up.

490
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:56,795
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the <i>Kaiser</i> sign the armistice.

491
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:59,006
We have run out of time.

492
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:03,427
As soon as the <i>Kaiser</i>
sees the newest weapon,

493
00:45:03,594 --> 00:45:05,304
he will not sign the armistice.

494
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:06,555
But, without my book...

495
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:07,973
We will get your book!

496
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,601
It is you that I believe in. Not it.

497
00:45:11,977 --> 00:45:15,022
I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm.

498
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:20,194
It is what you were put on this earth
to do.

499
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:27,242
Something did come to me last night.

500
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:29,411
A different type of gas.

501
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:31,413
For you.

502
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:33,957
<i>To restore your strength.</i>

503
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:06,407
<i>I've got it. I've got it!</i>

504
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,077
And if it's what I think,

505
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:13,080
it's going to be

506
00:46:14,665 --> 00:46:16,166
terrible.

507
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:38,647
<i>Morning!</i>

508
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:41,692
We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time.

509
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:44,194
<i>Welcome to jolly old London!</i>

510
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,988
It's hideous.

511
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,990
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

512
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:11,847
- Morning, darling.
- What a beauty.

513
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:13,015
Hello, beautiful!

514
00:47:13,182 --> 00:47:15,684
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

515
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:19,605
Come on! Come on.

516
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:22,733
Why are they holding hands?

517
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:25,777
Uh, probably because they're together.

518
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,074
No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way.

519
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,242
This way.

520
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:33,619
To the war!

521
00:47:33,785 --> 00:47:36,473
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first.

522
00:47:36,497 --> 00:47:37,998
And where are we going?

523
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:39,917
We gotta get this notebook
to my superiors.

524
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,168
Hey, hey, hey!

525
00:47:41,335 --> 00:47:44,463
No, no, no.
I let you go, you take me to Ares.

526
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,381
We made a deal, Steve Trevor.

527
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:47,925
And a deal is a promise.

528
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:49,927
And a promise is unbreakable.

529
00:47:50,677 --> 00:47:52,763
Oh, boy. Damn it. All right.

530
00:47:54,014 --> 00:47:55,849
You come with me first
to deliver this,

531
00:47:56,016 --> 00:47:58,310
and then we'll get you a ticket,
uh...

532
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,645
to the war.

533
00:47:59,937 --> 00:48:00,938
Deal?

534
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:03,565
- Let's go.
- Diana...

535
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:04,733
What are you doing?

536
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,003
You can't do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

537
00:48:07,027 --> 00:48:10,280
Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes.

538
00:48:10,447 --> 00:48:12,241
What do these women wear into battle?

539
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:13,784
They don't, uh...

540
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,577
A baby!

541
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,348
- No, no, no. No babies.
- Oh... Oh...

542
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:20,040
No, please. No babies.

543
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,000
That one's not made out of clay.

544
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:23,418
Come on.

545
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:25,587
Diana! Please.

546
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:43,313
Thank God! You're not dead!

547
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,441
Hoorah and huzzah!

548
00:48:46,608 --> 00:48:48,902
I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?

549
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:51,697
<i>He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.</i>

550
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:52,864
<i>Very unlike him.</i>

551
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:55,450
I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

552
00:48:55,617 --> 00:48:57,619
I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.

553
00:48:57,786 --> 00:48:59,121
What is a secretary?

554
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:00,664
Ooh! Well, I do everything.

555
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:03,271
I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do.

556
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,961
Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery.

557
00:49:06,128 --> 00:49:07,254
I really like her.

558
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:08,630
Fantastic. Ladies, after you.

559
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:09,965
Oh, I do, I like her.

560
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:12,050
And it does rather feel like that,

561
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:13,760
except the pay is very good.

562
00:49:13,927 --> 00:49:16,263
We've got our work cut out for us,
haven't we?

563
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:22,352
Is this what passes for armor
in your country?

564
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:25,188
"Armor." It's fashion.

565
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:26,815
Keeps our tummies in.

566
00:49:27,357 --> 00:49:28,609
Why must you keep them in?

567
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:31,028
Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question.

568
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:36,283
Conservative,
but not entirely un-fun.

569
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:38,910
Try it on, at least.

570
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,120
Very well.

571
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:42,998
- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
- No! No, no, no.

572
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:44,499
Ooh!

573
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:51,381
Come on! Oh!

574
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,893
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

575
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,144
Fight?

576
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:05,896
We use our principles.

577
00:50:06,063 --> 00:50:07,903
I mean, that's how
we're going to get the vote.

578
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:11,693
Although, I am not opposed to
engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,

579
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,612
should the occasion arise.

580
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:16,239
Lovely.

581
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:17,532
Oop!

582
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:20,160
It's itchy. It's choking me.

583
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:23,622
Can't say I blame it.

584
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,040
Etta.

585
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:26,208
Where is she?

586
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,752
Oh, she's trying on outfit number 226.

587
00:50:38,595 --> 00:50:41,723
Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

588
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,058
<i>distracting.</i>

589
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:46,395
May I?

590
00:50:51,108 --> 00:50:52,442
<i>Really? Specs?</i>

591
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:55,169
And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

592
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,619
Better.

593
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:15,090
Yeah, that's not going to work.

594
00:51:15,257 --> 00:51:16,967
Please put the sword down, Diana.

595
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:18,135
Diana!

596
00:51:19,386 --> 00:51:20,512
Let me try it by myself.

597
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:21,763
After you, sir.

598
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:32,315
Etta...

599
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:35,068
Why don't I meet you
back at the office

600
00:51:35,235 --> 00:51:37,320
and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping.

601
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:38,488
Oh, no, I don't think so.

602
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:40,407
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

603
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:41,968
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

604
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:44,619
Put the sword down, first of all.

605
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:50,625
Promise me you will protect it
with your life.

606
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:52,919
Yes... No.

607
00:51:53,295 --> 00:51:55,213
You can trust her. Just hand that over.

608
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,215
- Shield.
- And the shield to her.

609
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:58,383
There we go. Whoa!

610
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,551
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

611
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:01,636
This is easy.

612
00:52:03,013 --> 00:52:04,389
Oh. There we go.

613
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,251
What is it?

614
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:37,506
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

615
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:49,226
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on.

616
00:52:58,777 --> 00:53:00,445
Captain Trevor.

617
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:04,407
I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff.

618
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:08,703
Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention.

619
00:53:08,912 --> 00:53:11,414
Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.

620
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,542
Where did I put that thing?

621
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:17,003
Stand back!

622
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:28,723
Or maybe not.

623
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:45,949
Tough luck.

624
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:54,291
Is there anything else
you want to show me?

625
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:56,905
Where do you think you're going?

626
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:00,797
Oh!

627
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,261
I'm sorry. But you are
clearly under his control.

628
00:54:06,428 --> 00:54:09,139
- Diana...
- Let me help you get free.

629
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:10,849
Where will I find Ares?

630
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:20,483
- He's... He's dead.
- Hmm.

631
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,485
Cyanide.

632
00:54:31,328 --> 00:54:33,038
Stay here. I'll be right back.

633
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:35,999
<i>Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!</i>

634
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:40,629
The sad truth is, the majority of them
don't even know what they're fighting for!

635
00:54:40,795 --> 00:54:41,796
Let him speak!

636
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:44,132
Yes, thank you. Gentlemen...

637
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:48,720
Germany is an immensely proud nation.

638
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:51,848
They will never surrender.

639
00:54:52,265 --> 00:54:54,893
Now, look.
The only way to end this war...

640
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,396
Colonel,
I have to talk to you outside.

641
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:00,815
<i>...and restore world peace</i>

642
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:02,525
is to negotiate

643
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:05,946
an armistice.

644
00:55:06,529 --> 00:55:08,949
<i>- There's a woman in here.
- Um...</i>

645
00:55:09,115 --> 00:55:10,595
What's she doing in here?
Get her out.

646
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:13,703
Get her out.

647
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:15,413
Sorry.

648
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,874
Blind sister.
She got lost on the way to the bathroom.

649
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,043
I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys.

650
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:22,921
Um...
Our only aim at this time

651
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,715
must be to achieve peace,

652
00:55:25,882 --> 00:55:27,759
at any cost!

653
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,556
Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace.

654
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:35,225
Not right now. Sorry.

655
00:55:40,063 --> 00:55:42,917
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?

656
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:44,901
The intel that I brought back
is time-sensitive.

657
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:46,508
This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.

658
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:47,654
Notebook or not...

659
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:48,965
We need to get it to cryptography

660
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:50,716
and I need an immediate audience
with the generals.

661
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,052
You do not just barge in here
and demand an audience with the Cabinet.

662
00:55:53,076 --> 00:55:54,762
Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission

663
00:55:54,786 --> 00:55:55,972
could change the course of the war.

664
00:55:55,996 --> 00:55:57,414
<i>Captain Trevor!</i>

665
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:00,768
I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,

666
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,293
yet here you are,
back from the dead,

667
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,379
and I see you've
brought a friend with you.

668
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:06,065
Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir.

669
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,716
No, no, no. Nonsense.

670
00:56:07,882 --> 00:56:09,592
Thanks to this young woman,

671
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:13,263
the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in.

672
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,306
Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.

673
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:17,934
Diana, Princess of Themys...

674
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:19,936
"Prince." Diana Prince.

675
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,813
She is, uh...

676
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,981
And I...

677
00:56:23,148 --> 00:56:24,190
Are...

678
00:56:24,357 --> 00:56:25,358
Working together.

679
00:56:25,525 --> 00:56:27,628
<i>She actually helped me
bring this, uh, notebook back here.</i>

680
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:29,946
<i>That's from Dr. Maru's lab.</i>

681
00:56:30,113 --> 00:56:32,925
I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir.

682
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:34,784
My God.

683
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:37,787
- Dr. Poison, herself.
- Yes.

684
00:57:07,942 --> 00:57:08,985
<i>Yes.</i>

685
00:57:09,652 --> 00:57:11,071
<i>Intriguing.</i>

686
00:57:11,237 --> 00:57:12,530
Any further intelligence?

687
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:15,742
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck.

688
00:57:15,909 --> 00:57:17,827
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages,

689
00:57:18,036 --> 00:57:21,539
but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages.

690
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:23,333
Ottoman and Sumerian.

691
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:28,213
Surely, someone else in this room
knew that.

692
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:29,464
Who is this woman?

693
00:57:29,631 --> 00:57:31,341
<i>She's my, um,</i>

694
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:33,051
secretary, sir.

695
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:35,887
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

696
00:57:36,471 --> 00:57:37,931
She's a very good secretary.

697
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:39,516
See her out.

698
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:42,811
Sir, if this woman can read it,

699
00:57:42,977 --> 00:57:44,813
<i>we should hear what she has to say.</i>

700
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:46,689
Yes, very well.

701
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,364
It's a formula

702
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:56,407
for a new kind of gas.

703
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,495
Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.

704
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:01,746
Hydrogen-based...

705
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:04,541
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

706
00:58:04,707 --> 00:58:07,544
The book says they plan to
release the gas

707
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,045
at "the front"?

708
00:58:09,212 --> 00:58:10,213
When?

709
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,548
It doesn't say.

710
00:58:12,006 --> 00:58:13,299
Wait. "Front" of what?

711
00:58:13,466 --> 00:58:14,467
Sir,

712
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:16,427
that is the evidence we need.

713
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,197
You have to find out
where they're making that gas.

714
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,532
You have to burn it to the ground.

715
00:58:19,556 --> 00:58:20,557
Destroy it.

716
00:58:20,723 --> 00:58:23,268
Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.

717
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:27,564
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium

718
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,441
as we are negotiating their surrender.

719
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:32,360
Sir, I've seen that gas
with my own eyes.

720
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:35,280
If it is used,
it will kill everyone on both sides.

721
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:36,489
They will all die.

722
00:58:36,656 --> 00:58:39,576
That is what soldiers do, Captain.

723
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,162
<i>Send me in
with some logistical support.</i>

724
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:45,456
At least give me the chance
to take out Ludendorff's operation myself.

725
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:46,749
Are you insane?

726
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:49,210
I can't introduce rogue elements
this late in the game.

727
00:58:49,377 --> 00:58:50,378
Sir, I can...

728
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:51,754
<i>Now, more than ever,</i>

729
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:55,592
the armistice
is of paramount importance.

730
00:58:55,758 --> 00:58:59,387
It must be negotiated, it must be signed,
and this is...

731
00:59:00,263 --> 00:59:02,932
Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

732
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:05,101
Captain, you will do nothing.

733
00:59:05,268 --> 00:59:07,270
And that is an order.

734
00:59:08,229 --> 00:59:09,230
Yes, sir.

735
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,441
I understand, sir.

736
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,443
I don't!

737
00:59:13,902 --> 00:59:15,262
Diana, I know this is confusing...

738
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:17,590
<i>- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!</i>
- Who is this woman?

739
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:18,757
She's with me. She's with us, sir.

740
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:19,866
I am not with you!

741
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:23,119
You would knowingly sacrifice
all those lives,

742
00:59:23,286 --> 00:59:24,430
as if they mean less than yours!

743
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:26,265
- Diana, let's talk about this outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

744
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:29,626
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

745
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:31,952
- That's enough!
- They fight alongside their soldiers.

746
00:59:32,086 --> 00:59:33,630
They die with them on the battlefield!

747
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:35,316
- That's enough!
- You should be ashamed.

748
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,260
- My apologies. Diana...
- You should be ashamed.

749
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:38,982
<i>- Diana...
- All of you should be ashamed!</i>

750
00:59:40,136 --> 00:59:41,763
Please slow down!

751
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,264
That's your leader?

752
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:45,600
How could he say that?
Believe that?

753
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:47,185
And you!

754
00:59:47,352 --> 00:59:49,145
Was your duty
to simply give them a book?

755
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:50,313
No!

756
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,790
You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!

757
00:59:51,814 --> 00:59:53,417
Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!

758
00:59:53,441 --> 00:59:56,110
This is Ares, and he's not going to
allow a negotiation

759
00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:57,695
or a surrender!

760
00:59:57,862 --> 01:00:00,490
The millions of people you talked about,
they will die!

761
01:00:00,657 --> 01:00:02,116
We are going anyway!

762
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:06,246
You mean, you were lying?

763
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:08,623
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

764
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,630
How do I know
you're not lying to me right now?

765
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:17,006
I am taking you to the front.

766
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:19,717
We are probably going to die.

767
01:00:20,635 --> 01:00:22,679
This is a terrible idea.

768
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,310
We're going to need reinforcements.

769
01:00:39,696 --> 01:00:41,155
These are the reinforcements?

770
01:00:41,322 --> 01:00:42,740
Yup.

771
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:44,909
Are these even good men?

772
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:47,036
Hmm. Relatively.

773
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:52,041
Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

774
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:56,504
But the luxury that we have now...
It's like we can't stop making money!

775
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:58,923
So, my uncle, the prince, and I...

776
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,301
Boy! Which prince is that?

777
01:01:01,843 --> 01:01:04,071
I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers...

778
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:05,555
But, seriously, which prince?

779
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:09,392
Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,

780
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:11,227
<i>could I talk to you for a minute?</i>

781
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:13,730
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

782
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,481
"Bar." Well, a "pub."

783
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:18,901
You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you...

784
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:21,738
Oh, my goodness gracious.

785
01:01:22,613 --> 01:01:23,740
That's a work of art.

786
01:01:23,906 --> 01:01:25,533
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer.

787
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,869
Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please.

788
01:01:28,036 --> 01:01:29,037
"Sammy."

789
01:01:29,203 --> 01:01:31,414
Sameer, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

790
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:32,915
Sameer's a top undercover man.

791
01:01:33,082 --> 01:01:35,562
<i>He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can.</i>

792
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:55,355
Oh, you're done.

793
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:56,522
Where's Charlie?

794
01:02:00,443 --> 01:02:01,527
<i>Le voilÃ .</i>

795
01:02:04,697 --> 01:02:06,991
At least this "Charlie"
is good with his fists.

796
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,160
That's not Charlie.

797
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:18,127
That's Charlie.

798
01:02:22,465 --> 01:02:23,466
Steven!

799
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:26,469
May God put a flower
upon your head, son.

800
01:02:26,636 --> 01:02:27,929
Good to see you.

801
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,474
<i>So, what were you fighting about?</i>

802
01:02:32,433 --> 01:02:35,353
I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens.

803
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,105
This man is no fighter.

804
01:02:37,271 --> 01:02:39,148
Charlie is an expert marksman.

805
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:40,689
It means he shoots people.

806
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:42,485
From very far away.

807
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:44,278
They never know what hit them.

808
01:02:45,947 --> 01:02:48,533
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

809
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:50,868
I don't. Trust me, it's better that way.

810
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,412
You fight without honor.

811
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:54,622
Who gets paid for honor? Eh?

812
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:57,333
So, what's the job, boss?

813
01:02:58,835 --> 01:02:59,961
Uh, two days, tops.

814
01:03:00,128 --> 01:03:02,547
We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium.

815
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:03,798
And what's the going rate?

816
01:03:03,965 --> 01:03:05,007
Better be a good pay.

817
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:07,301
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

818
01:03:08,136 --> 01:03:10,304
Um, I told you it was going to be quick.

819
01:03:11,764 --> 01:03:14,308
And there's a lot to be gained by this.

820
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:16,352
So, it's for a great cause...

821
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:17,770
Uh, freedom...

822
01:03:17,979 --> 01:03:18,980
Hmm.

823
01:03:19,188 --> 01:03:20,565
Friendship,

824
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:24,294
uh, ending the war, friendship...

825
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:25,653
- Okay, you have no money.
- No.

826
01:03:33,327 --> 01:03:34,579
What?

827
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:35,872
What is this?

828
01:03:36,038 --> 01:03:37,638
We're going to drop her off
at the front.

829
01:03:37,665 --> 01:03:39,292
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

830
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,170
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm not going to get myself killed

831
01:03:42,336 --> 01:03:43,647
helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.

832
01:03:43,671 --> 01:03:45,715
- Know what I mean?
- Here's the little thief now!

833
01:03:45,882 --> 01:03:47,884
We don't need your kind around here.

834
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,312
She did it!

835
01:03:59,896 --> 01:04:02,773
I'm both frightened and aroused.

836
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:10,841
- Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
- Sir Patrick!

837
01:04:10,865 --> 01:04:12,465
Yes, that's what I was going to mention.

838
01:04:14,243 --> 01:04:16,037
- Sir Patrick.
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

839
01:04:16,204 --> 01:04:18,372
Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit.

840
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:24,795
I assume you're here
planning something

841
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:28,132
that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed.

842
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:30,176
And I assume you're here to stop us.

843
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:31,928
No.

844
01:04:32,094 --> 01:04:33,763
Not at all, in fact.

845
01:04:34,764 --> 01:04:35,765
Well, look.

846
01:04:35,932 --> 01:04:37,225
I was a younger man, once.

847
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:40,431
And, had I been in better health, I'd like
to think that I might do the same.

848
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:41,604
Hmm.

849
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:44,065
<i>It's a very,
very honorable thing you're doing.</i>

850
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:45,233
Therefore,

851
01:04:46,442 --> 01:04:47,777
I'm here to help.

852
01:04:48,444 --> 01:04:49,820
Unofficially, of course.

853
01:04:50,947 --> 01:04:52,156
What's your plan?

854
01:04:53,574 --> 01:04:56,619
If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it.

855
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,080
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

856
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:03,084
In that case, to allay suspicion,

857
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:07,880
the charming Etta, here,
could, uh, run the mission from my office.

858
01:05:08,464 --> 01:05:09,465
"Run"...

859
01:05:11,676 --> 01:05:12,677
Also,

860
01:05:13,636 --> 01:05:16,138
there's enough here for a few days.

861
01:05:21,644 --> 01:05:22,687
Thank you, sir.

862
01:05:22,853 --> 01:05:24,438
You're very welcome.

863
01:05:24,981 --> 01:05:27,024
Take great care, all of you,

864
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:28,192
<i>and good luck.</i>

865
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:40,538
Cheers!

866
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:51,507
Fresh ice cream, made today. Hello, miss.

867
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:53,074
Would you like to buy an ice cream?

868
01:05:53,175 --> 01:05:54,760
- Me?
- Are you hungry?

869
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:55,928
Yes.

870
01:05:56,137 --> 01:05:57,346
Thank you.

871
01:05:57,513 --> 01:05:58,556
Eight pence, please, sir.

872
01:05:58,723 --> 01:06:00,083
Here you go, pal. Keep the change.

873
01:06:00,182 --> 01:06:02,351
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Mmm.

874
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,040
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful!

875
01:06:04,186 --> 01:06:05,187
Yeah.

876
01:06:06,355 --> 01:06:08,816
- You should be very proud.
<i>- Thank you very much!</i>

877
01:06:08,983 --> 01:06:10,359
You should be very proud.

878
01:06:13,696 --> 01:06:17,033
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

879
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,578
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

880
01:06:20,745 --> 01:06:23,998
I hope our guy meets us here.
Chief's expecting us before dark.

881
01:06:24,707 --> 01:06:25,750
"Chief"?

882
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:28,377
Uh, yeah. A smuggler.

883
01:06:29,211 --> 01:06:30,671
Very reputable.

884
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:34,175
A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.

885
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:35,718
Lovely.

886
01:06:36,218 --> 01:06:37,511
Careful, I might get offended.

887
01:06:37,678 --> 01:06:39,221
I wasn't referring to you.

888
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,681
Really?

889
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:42,971
I went undercover
and pretended to be somebody else,

890
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:44,870
shot people on your beach,
and smuggled a notebook.

891
01:06:44,894 --> 01:06:47,396
Liar, murderer, smuggler.
Are you still coming?

892
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:08,042
It's awful.

893
01:07:09,418 --> 01:07:10,920
That's why we're here.

894
01:07:28,979 --> 01:07:30,773
The gas will kill everything.

895
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,651
What kind of weapon kills innocents?

896
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,653
In this war,

897
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,154
every kind.

898
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,162
You were absent
at the council meeting, General.

899
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:48,040
I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me.

900
01:07:48,207 --> 01:07:50,960
- On the <i>Kaiser's</i> behalf.
- And on your insistence!

901
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:54,588
We could easily win this war,
if only you had a little faith.

902
01:07:54,755 --> 01:07:56,048
<i>We don't.</i>

903
01:07:56,215 --> 01:07:57,883
<i>There are shortages of food,</i>

904
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,844
medicine, ammunition.

905
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,724
Every hour we delay
costs thousands of German lives.

906
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,560
One attack and the war can be ours!

907
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:12,064
As we speak, my chemist...

908
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:14,442
We stand against you and your

909
01:08:14,734 --> 01:08:15,735
witch.

910
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,070
Ludendorff, enough!

911
01:08:19,447 --> 01:08:21,407
Twenty-four hours from now,

912
01:08:21,574 --> 01:08:23,659
this war will end.

913
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:25,745
It is over.

914
01:08:26,954 --> 01:08:28,539
It is over for you.

915
01:08:32,168 --> 01:08:33,711
It is over for all of you.

916
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:51,937
But the mask won't help.

917
01:08:52,104 --> 01:08:53,981
They don't know that.

918
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:09,955
Let's go!

919
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:12,416
Time to stage a demonstration
for the <i>Kaiser!</i>

920
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:15,920
You're late.

921
01:09:16,086 --> 01:09:17,463
<i>Cowboy sneak-attack, Chief!</i>

922
01:09:18,464 --> 01:09:19,465
How are you?

923
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:21,859
- Good to see you, pal.
<i>- Okay, big man!</i>

924
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:26,472
- Good to see you.
- Ah, yes!

925
01:09:27,223 --> 01:09:28,724
Good to see you, my friend.

926
01:09:29,642 --> 01:09:30,893
You beauty!

927
01:09:31,644 --> 01:09:33,020
Who is this?

928
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:41,445
And I am Diana.

929
01:09:42,321 --> 01:09:43,364
Where did you find her?

930
01:09:43,906 --> 01:09:45,074
She found me.

931
01:09:45,658 --> 01:09:47,952
- I plucked him from the sea.
<i>- It's a long story.</i>

932
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:49,346
We don't have to
talk about that right now.

933
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,788
What's there?

934
01:09:51,956 --> 01:09:53,958
British tea for the Germans,

935
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:56,085
German beer for the British.

936
01:09:57,795 --> 01:10:00,172
And Edgar Rice Burroughs novels
for both.

937
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:01,382
And guns!

938
01:10:03,342 --> 01:10:06,262
Well, may we get what we want!

939
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:07,763
May we get what we need.

940
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,182
But may we never get what we deserve.

941
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:11,725
Bang!

942
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:19,984
Strange thunder.

943
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:23,028
German 77s.

944
01:10:23,362 --> 01:10:24,697
Guns. Big ones.

945
01:10:25,948 --> 01:10:27,283
It's the front, out there.

946
01:10:28,617 --> 01:10:29,994
The evening hate.

947
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,621
So, who do you fight for in this war?

948
01:10:32,788 --> 01:10:33,956
I don't fight.

949
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:36,125
<i>You're here for profit, then?</i>

950
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,502
No better place to be.

951
01:10:39,837 --> 01:10:42,107
Nowhere better to be than in a war
where you don't take a side?

952
01:10:42,131 --> 01:10:43,299
<i>I have nowhere else.</i>

953
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:45,443
The last war
took everything from my people.

954
01:10:45,467 --> 01:10:46,760
We have nothing left.

955
01:10:47,636 --> 01:10:48,846
At least here,

956
01:10:49,638 --> 01:10:51,056
I'm free.

957
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,517
Who took that from your people?

958
01:10:54,143 --> 01:10:55,477
His people.

959
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:01,525
<i>Don't go...</i>

960
01:11:02,234 --> 01:11:04,862
Don't go in. Don't go!

961
01:11:05,029 --> 01:11:07,323
<i>Don't! Boys, no!</i>

962
01:11:07,489 --> 01:11:08,490
Don't go in there!

963
01:11:08,657 --> 01:11:10,117
Shh. You're safe.

964
01:11:10,284 --> 01:11:12,453
You're safe. Are you okay?

965
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,954
Get off me, woman!

966
01:11:14,121 --> 01:11:15,664
Stop making a fuss!

967
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:17,166
God!

968
01:11:21,253 --> 01:11:23,631
He sees ghosts.

969
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:29,720
You're going to get cold.

970
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:31,013
Oh, I don't...

971
01:11:31,472 --> 01:11:33,849
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

972
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:51,450
<i>Get out of there, now.
We've got to move!</i>

973
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:54,036
You bloody animal, move!
Go on! Get on!

974
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:56,163
These animals,
why are they hurting them?

975
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,332
Because they need to move, quick!

976
01:11:58,499 --> 01:12:00,167
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

977
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:02,419
I could help them.

978
01:12:02,628 --> 01:12:03,908
<i>There's no time. Come on, woman!</i>

979
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:08,175
Mama!

980
01:12:12,972 --> 01:12:14,890
That man... He's wounded.

981
01:12:15,057 --> 01:12:17,101
<i>There is nothing you can do
about it, Diana.</i>

982
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:18,811
<i>We must keep moving!</i>

983
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:41,083
What is this?

984
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,293
You wanted me to take you to the war.
This is it.

985
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,837
So, where are the Germans?

986
01:12:45,004 --> 01:12:47,423
A couple hundred yards
across the field.

987
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:48,924
- Their trench is...
- Watch out!

988
01:12:51,552 --> 01:12:53,721
Chief! It's good to see you!

989
01:12:53,887 --> 01:12:56,098
<i>Oi! Chief's back! He's back!</i>

990
01:12:57,558 --> 01:12:58,726
All right, let's move!

991
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:17,119
- Diana, we have to go.
- We need to help these people.

992
01:13:17,286 --> 01:13:18,366
We have to stay on-mission.

993
01:13:18,454 --> 01:13:19,931
The next safe crossing
is at least a day away.

994
01:13:19,955 --> 01:13:22,517
- What are we waiting for?
- We cannot leave without helping them.

995
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,126
These people are dying.

996
01:13:24,293 --> 01:13:26,104
They have nothing to eat,
and in the village...

997
01:13:26,128 --> 01:13:27,689
- Enslaved, she said!
- I understand that.

998
01:13:27,713 --> 01:13:28,714
Women and children!

999
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:30,233
We need to make
our next position by sundown.

1000
01:13:30,257 --> 01:13:32,426
How can you say that?
What is the matter with you?

1001
01:13:32,593 --> 01:13:34,636
This is No Man's Land, Diana!

1002
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,097
It means no man can cross it,
all right?

1003
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:39,600
This battalion has been here
for nearly a year

1004
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,144
and they barely gained an inch.

1005
01:13:42,311 --> 01:13:45,606
Because, on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

1006
01:13:45,773 --> 01:13:48,013
pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

1007
01:13:48,108 --> 01:13:50,360
This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible.

1008
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:51,904
So what? So, we do nothing?

1009
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:53,822
No, we are doing something.
We are.

1010
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:55,282
- We just...
- Steve.

1011
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:56,867
We can't save everyone in this war.

1012
01:13:57,034 --> 01:13:58,243
<i>Steve, Steve...</i>

1013
01:13:58,952 --> 01:14:00,392
This is not what we came here to do.

1014
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:17,471
No,

1015
01:14:17,638 --> 01:14:19,640
but it's what I'm going to do.

1016
01:14:34,863 --> 01:14:36,198
Diana!

1017
01:14:58,387 --> 01:15:00,681
What the bloody hell
is she playing at?

1018
01:15:17,072 --> 01:15:19,449
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1019
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:25,038
Stay down! Stay down!

1020
01:15:25,205 --> 01:15:26,582
<i>That's an order!</i>

1021
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:20,636
Go, now!

1022
01:16:20,802 --> 01:16:22,721
<i>She's done it!
She's got them on the run!</i>

1023
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,810
Get down, get down! She's done it!

1024
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:43,951
Steve!

1025
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,244
Let's go!

1026
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:49,748
Come on, go!

1027
01:17:10,018 --> 01:17:11,603
Stay here. I'll go ahead.

1028
01:17:47,222 --> 01:17:48,598
- What the...
- Let's move!

1029
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:28,430
<i>We need more firepower.</i>

1030
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:45,632
Sniper!

1031
01:19:45,799 --> 01:19:47,092
Go!

1032
01:19:49,302 --> 01:19:50,303
Get in!

1033
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,930
Charlie, bell tower!

1034
01:20:00,147 --> 01:20:01,267
<i>Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!</i>

1035
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:04,359
Hey, it's okay.

1036
01:20:06,695 --> 01:20:07,696
<i>Huh.</i>

1037
01:20:09,489 --> 01:20:11,491
Follow me! Give me some cover!

1038
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,374
Right!

1039
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:22,252
We're going to put this on our backs,
and, when I say go,

1040
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:23,419
- lift hard!
- Okay.

1041
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:26,298
<i>Diana! Shield!</i>

1042
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:31,887
Go!

1043
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:35,617
<i>Stay very,
very still for me, my friends.</i>

1044
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:37,410
<i>Please. So important.</i>

1045
01:21:41,122 --> 01:21:42,415
Thank you very much.

1046
01:21:42,582 --> 01:21:45,293
This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph.

1047
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,503
Thank you so much.

1048
01:21:52,926 --> 01:21:55,220
<i>For all his talk of shooting,</i>

1049
01:21:55,387 --> 01:21:56,972
he cannot shoot.

1050
01:22:00,058 --> 01:22:02,602
Not everyone gets to be
what they want to be all the time.

1051
01:22:03,144 --> 01:22:05,564
Me, I am an actor.

1052
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,107
I love acting.

1053
01:22:07,274 --> 01:22:08,984
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1054
01:22:10,151 --> 01:22:11,611
But I'm the wrong color.

1055
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:14,906
Everyone is fighting their own battles,
Diana.

1056
01:22:16,324 --> 01:22:17,784
Just as you are fighting yours.

1057
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:25,625
It's too much.
I wish you well.

1058
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:26,793
Thank you, thank you.

1059
01:22:30,964 --> 01:22:32,507
I'm on the... On the phone...

1060
01:22:33,008 --> 01:22:35,510
Uh, it's "Veld." V-E-L-D.

1061
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:37,220
It's a tiny village.

1062
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:39,180
<i>It may not even be on the map.</i>

1063
01:22:39,347 --> 01:22:40,682
Ooh! I found it! I found it!

1064
01:22:41,224 --> 01:22:42,809
<i>Did you find Ludendorff's operation?</i>

1065
01:22:42,976 --> 01:22:44,811
No, no, no. But I located him.

1066
01:22:44,978 --> 01:22:47,439
And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,

1067
01:22:47,606 --> 01:22:49,441
at German High Command.

1068
01:22:49,858 --> 01:22:51,526
<i>German High Command, huh?</i>

1069
01:22:51,693 --> 01:22:53,320
So, intel reports

1070
01:22:53,486 --> 01:22:55,655
<i>that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.</i>

1071
01:22:55,822 --> 01:22:57,198
<i>A sort of "last hurrah"</i>

1072
01:22:57,365 --> 01:22:59,659
before the Germans sign the armistice.

1073
01:22:59,826 --> 01:23:02,537
And the <i>Kaiser</i> himself
is going to be there.

1074
01:23:03,038 --> 01:23:05,582
As well as Dr. Maru.

1075
01:23:06,207 --> 01:23:07,810
Actually, the gala could be
perfect cover.

1076
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:09,544
<i>- Captain Trevor.</i>
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:23:09,711 --> 01:23:12,297
<i>You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near</i>

1078
01:23:12,464 --> 01:23:14,507
that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1079
01:23:14,674 --> 01:23:16,676
<i>You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.</i>

1080
01:23:16,843 --> 01:23:19,179
<i>You cannot compromise the armistice.</i>

1081
01:23:19,346 --> 01:23:21,106
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1082
01:23:21,139 --> 01:23:22,979
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1083
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:24,142
Hold on one second, sir.

1084
01:23:24,309 --> 01:23:26,329
You shouldn't be bothered
about upsetting the peace accord.

1085
01:23:26,353 --> 01:23:28,188
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1086
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:29,648
What?

1087
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,191
What is it?

1088
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:33,693
Of course. It makes complete sense.

1089
01:23:35,195 --> 01:23:38,281
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1090
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:40,200
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1091
01:23:40,742 --> 01:23:42,160
I mean Ares.

1092
01:23:42,744 --> 01:23:44,162
Ludendorff is Ares!

1093
01:23:45,789 --> 01:23:47,540
Sir, this is our last chance,

1094
01:23:47,707 --> 01:23:49,467
our final chance
to find out where the gas is

1095
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:51,562
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1096
01:23:51,586 --> 01:23:53,338
No, no, no. I forbid it.

1097
01:23:53,505 --> 01:23:54,714
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1098
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:56,758
Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?

1099
01:23:56,925 --> 01:23:57,926
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sir...

1100
01:24:01,221 --> 01:24:02,931
How likely is he to respect my wishes?

1101
01:24:03,098 --> 01:24:05,266
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1102
01:24:11,564 --> 01:24:13,233
Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no.

1103
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,276
Sammy, I have to work.

1104
01:24:15,443 --> 01:24:16,754
I gotta rustle up a German uniform.

1105
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:18,214
I still have to plot the course
for tomorrow.

1106
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:19,864
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1107
01:24:20,031 --> 01:24:21,550
There is nothing we can do
until tomorrow.

1108
01:24:21,574 --> 01:24:22,694
You said it yourself, Steve.

1109
01:24:22,784 --> 01:24:24,786
So... <i>Madame, s'il vous plaÃ®t.</i>

1110
01:24:24,953 --> 01:24:25,954
<i>Incroyable!</i>

1111
01:24:26,705 --> 01:24:28,206
<i>Magnifique!</i>

1112
01:24:28,415 --> 01:24:29,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1113
01:24:29,582 --> 01:24:30,792
<i>Monsieur, s'il vous plaÃ®t.</i>

1114
01:24:32,919 --> 01:24:34,337
<i>- Et voilÃ !</i>
- Merci, <i>Sammy.</i>

1115
01:24:34,504 --> 01:24:35,505
<i>Et voilÃ !</i>

1116
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:49,144
You did this.

1117
01:24:51,438 --> 01:24:52,439
We did.

1118
01:24:57,402 --> 01:24:58,820
Do you have dancing on

1119
01:24:59,696 --> 01:25:00,989
Paradise Island?

1120
01:25:01,156 --> 01:25:02,949
Dancing, yeah. Of course.

1121
01:25:03,116 --> 01:25:07,162
But these people are just swaying.

1122
01:25:07,996 --> 01:25:11,374
Okay, if you're going to
be fighting the God of War,

1123
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,502
I may as well teach you how to dance,
you poor thing.

1124
01:25:14,669 --> 01:25:17,338
All right, probably without the gun.

1125
01:25:17,505 --> 01:25:18,757
<i>Madame.</i>

1126
01:25:21,509 --> 01:25:23,052
If you would.

1127
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,721
Well...

1128
01:25:26,473 --> 01:25:28,683
If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance.

1129
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:30,703
- You're not going to the gala.
- Of course I am.

1130
01:25:30,727 --> 01:25:32,604
- No, you're not.
- Why wouldn't I?

1131
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:34,773
Well, for one,
you don't know how to dance.

1132
01:25:35,315 --> 01:25:37,692
I would argue that
they don't know how to dance.

1133
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:39,152
Be polite, be polite.

1134
01:25:41,863 --> 01:25:44,282
All right. So, give me your hand.

1135
01:25:44,449 --> 01:25:45,492
Like so.

1136
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:49,412
And I'm gonna put my arm

1137
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:51,331
around you, like so.

1138
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:53,958
And we just...

1139
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:55,585
What did you call it? "Sway"?

1140
01:25:55,752 --> 01:25:56,878
Then you just sway.

1141
01:25:57,462 --> 01:25:58,963
You're awfully close.

1142
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:03,218
That's what it's all about.

1143
01:26:06,095 --> 01:26:07,305
I see.

1144
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:18,525
I haven't heard him sing in years.

1145
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:37,877
It's, uh... It's a snowfall.

1146
01:26:42,257 --> 01:26:43,258
Touch it.

1147
01:26:46,386 --> 01:26:47,887
It's magical!

1148
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,598
It is, isn't it?

1149
01:26:52,642 --> 01:26:54,060
It is, yeah.

1150
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:04,028
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1151
01:27:04,737 --> 01:27:05,738
Yeah.

1152
01:27:07,031 --> 01:27:10,118
Yeah, this and other things.

1153
01:27:10,285 --> 01:27:11,703
What things?

1154
01:27:13,621 --> 01:27:14,622
Um...

1155
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:20,628
They have breakfast.

1156
01:27:21,212 --> 01:27:22,839
They really love a breakfast.

1157
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:25,550
And, um, they love to wake up

1158
01:27:26,509 --> 01:27:28,720
and read the paper and go to work.

1159
01:27:29,804 --> 01:27:31,556
They get married.

1160
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:33,933
Make some babies,
grow old together.

1161
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:35,768
I guess.

1162
01:27:39,731 --> 01:27:41,232
What is it like?

1163
01:27:45,236 --> 01:27:46,738
I have no idea.

1164
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,126
The villagers gave them to us.

1165
01:29:24,043 --> 01:29:26,754
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1166
01:29:26,921 --> 01:29:27,922
You are.

1167
01:29:28,715 --> 01:29:30,508
Hey, fellas. I know that

1168
01:29:31,759 --> 01:29:33,428
I said this job was two days,

1169
01:29:35,638 --> 01:29:36,723
and a deal's a deal.

1170
01:29:38,975 --> 01:29:40,476
You'd get lost without us.

1171
01:29:41,394 --> 01:29:42,395
Yeah.

1172
01:29:43,187 --> 01:29:45,347
<i>We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.</i>

1173
01:29:45,565 --> 01:29:47,150
I'm worried that you won't make it.

1174
01:29:47,316 --> 01:29:48,609
There's no more money.

1175
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:50,194
We've been paid enough.

1176
01:29:50,778 --> 01:29:52,697
Maybe you're better off
without me, yeah?

1177
01:29:53,698 --> 01:29:55,283
No, Charlie.

1178
01:29:56,743 --> 01:29:58,828
Who will sing for us?

1179
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,748
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh, no, please.

1180
01:30:02,623 --> 01:30:03,875
Sing?

1181
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:05,793
You asked for it.

1182
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:09,088
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1183
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,967
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1184
01:30:13,134 --> 01:30:16,804
<i>The sweetest hours I e'er did spend</i>

1185
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:19,974
You must think
I was born yesterday.

1186
01:30:20,141 --> 01:30:22,018
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

1187
01:30:22,185 --> 01:30:23,352
Every word.

1188
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:25,104
Wait, wait, wait.

1189
01:30:25,271 --> 01:30:27,190
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1190
01:30:27,356 --> 01:30:29,150
And not a single man among them?

1191
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:31,402
How do we get there?

1192
01:30:31,694 --> 01:30:33,654
<i>And she thinks</i>

1193
01:30:33,821 --> 01:30:35,865
that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?

1194
01:30:36,032 --> 01:30:38,910
And only by killing him
will the war end? Don't be daft.

1195
01:30:39,077 --> 01:30:40,495
<i>You saw what happened out there.</i>

1196
01:30:40,995 --> 01:30:43,081
<i>The way she charged
that machine-gun nest?</i>

1197
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:45,041
The way she took out that tower?

1198
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:47,877
Maybe it's true.

1199
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:50,379
I think it's true.

1200
01:30:50,838 --> 01:30:51,881
I believe it's true.

1201
01:30:52,048 --> 01:30:53,049
<i>Et voilÃ .</i>

1202
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:57,011
Steven, son, you don't really
believe this rubbish, do you?

1203
01:31:20,201 --> 01:31:22,537
Diana! Diana!
Hiding, hiding.

1204
01:31:24,372 --> 01:31:25,790
How the hell do we get into that?

1205
01:31:26,874 --> 01:31:29,627
I see only a couple of guards
on the door to distract.

1206
01:31:29,836 --> 01:31:31,316
Yeah, it won't look suspicious at all

1207
01:31:31,379 --> 01:31:33,023
when I come sauntering
out of the woods on foot.

1208
01:31:33,047 --> 01:31:34,048
I could get in.

1209
01:31:34,215 --> 01:31:35,815
You're not going in. It's too dangerous.

1210
01:31:35,883 --> 01:31:37,468
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1211
01:31:37,635 --> 01:31:38,719
And you're too distracting.

1212
01:31:38,886 --> 01:31:41,347
So, look, I'll go in there,
and follow them

1213
01:31:41,514 --> 01:31:43,152
to wherever they're
working on the gas or,

1214
01:31:43,182 --> 01:31:44,118
better yet, where it is.

1215
01:31:44,142 --> 01:31:45,536
- Then I'm coming with you.
<i>- No, you're not!</i>

1216
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,396
What you're wearing
isn't exactly undercover.

1217
01:31:48,563 --> 01:31:49,564
I don't know.

1218
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:51,708
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1219
01:31:51,732 --> 01:31:53,776
<i>We just...
We can't get you in, okay?</i>

1220
01:31:53,943 --> 01:31:55,504
So, I'll scout it out, report back, and...

1221
01:31:55,528 --> 01:31:57,405
But as long as he's still alive,
it doesn't...

1222
01:31:57,572 --> 01:32:00,032
You cannot go into German
High Command and kill anyone.

1223
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:02,076
You just can't. You have to trust me.

1224
01:32:03,411 --> 01:32:05,246
- Oh, wow!
- Where did that come from?

1225
01:32:05,413 --> 01:32:07,456
Oh, can I drive it?
Please, let me drive it!

1226
01:32:07,623 --> 01:32:08,875
I'll be your chauffeur.

1227
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,251
Come on, come on.

1228
01:32:11,002 --> 01:32:12,003
Stay put!

1229
01:32:12,837 --> 01:32:13,838
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

1230
01:32:14,005 --> 01:32:16,174
A field over there. It's full of them!

1231
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:21,989
Chief, I say you and me
scope out the area

1232
01:32:22,013 --> 01:32:23,573
in case we need to
beat a hasty retreat.

1233
01:32:23,723 --> 01:32:26,100
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1234
01:32:30,605 --> 01:32:31,814
<i>Colonel.</i>

1235
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:38,362
Steve, they have invitations.

1236
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:42,158
Don't worry, play it cool.
You got this. You got this.

1237
01:32:46,454 --> 01:32:47,496
Your invitation, please.

1238
01:32:47,663 --> 01:32:48,664
<i>Dhanyavaad,</i> sahib.

1239
01:32:48,873 --> 01:32:50,473
The colonel and I
wish for many blessings

1240
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:52,745
and all manner of other things
to fall upon your head.

1241
01:32:52,877 --> 01:32:54,420
Your head must be empty.

1242
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:56,505
He wants my invitation, you idiot.

1243
01:32:56,672 --> 01:32:57,840
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1244
01:32:58,007 --> 01:33:00,468
I must apologize
a thousand, thousand times, my master.

1245
01:33:00,676 --> 01:33:03,638
I make the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1246
01:33:03,804 --> 01:33:05,073
I lost the colonel's invitation.

1247
01:33:05,097 --> 01:33:06,098
What?

1248
01:33:06,265 --> 01:33:08,976
Are you saying we drove all the
way through the mud and rain

1249
01:33:09,143 --> 01:33:10,871
- only for you to lose my invitation?
- I'm a snail.

1250
01:33:10,895 --> 01:33:11,979
No! I'm a bug.

1251
01:33:12,146 --> 01:33:14,023
Not even a bug.
I am the dung of a bug!

1252
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,441
And you're right, master...

1253
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,485
Blessing be upon us.

1254
01:33:28,204 --> 01:33:29,580
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1255
01:33:29,747 --> 01:33:31,916
<i>I'm not going to spend
the entire evening out here,</i>

1256
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,168
you stupid idiots! Move your cars!

1257
01:33:55,398 --> 01:33:56,899
What are you supposed to be?

1258
01:34:00,569 --> 01:34:02,196
What are you doing?

1259
01:34:27,013 --> 01:34:28,055
Excuse me.

1260
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:32,226
I don't drink.

1261
01:34:40,401 --> 01:34:41,569
Have we met?

1262
01:34:41,736 --> 01:34:43,571
No, but I've been watching you.

1263
01:34:44,572 --> 01:34:46,032
Following your career, I mean.

1264
01:34:47,408 --> 01:34:49,910
<i>You are Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

1265
01:34:50,077 --> 01:34:52,621
The most talented chemist
in the German Army.

1266
01:34:52,788 --> 01:34:54,415
I am a fan.

1267
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:07,428
I hope I am not crossing a line.

1268
01:35:08,929 --> 01:35:11,349
I know you
and General Ludendorff are

1269
01:35:11,515 --> 01:35:12,558
very close.

1270
01:35:12,725 --> 01:35:15,978
We work well together. Yes.

1271
01:35:16,812 --> 01:35:19,774
But having someone like me behind you,

1272
01:35:20,441 --> 01:35:22,068
I could provide a lot more.

1273
01:35:22,234 --> 01:35:24,111
And who are you?

1274
01:35:24,695 --> 01:35:26,803
A man who would show
you appreciation

1275
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:28,657
a genius like yourself deserves.

1276
01:35:35,122 --> 01:35:37,625
I love fire. Don't you?

1277
01:35:40,127 --> 01:35:41,796
It is like

1278
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,257
a living act of entropy.

1279
01:35:45,424 --> 01:35:47,802
The ultimate weapon of destruction.

1280
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,930
Reminding us that, in the end,

1281
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:54,809
everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1282
01:35:57,311 --> 01:35:59,772
There is something reassuring about it.

1283
01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:07,279
I see all of that in your eyes.

1284
01:36:10,741 --> 01:36:13,035
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1285
01:36:29,093 --> 01:36:30,594
<i>I hear it is...</i>

1286
01:36:32,847 --> 01:36:35,099
I hear it is extraordinary.

1287
01:36:35,891 --> 01:36:39,562
I appreciate your interest in my work,

1288
01:36:39,728 --> 01:36:42,022
<i>but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.</i>

1289
01:36:42,189 --> 01:36:43,190
<i>Besides,</i>

1290
01:36:43,732 --> 01:36:46,444
now I see your attention is

1291
01:36:49,613 --> 01:36:50,656
elsewhere.

1292
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,557
Enjoying the party?

1293
01:37:18,559 --> 01:37:21,562
I confess, I'm not sure what it is
we're celebrating.

1294
01:37:21,729 --> 01:37:24,482
A German victory, of course.

1295
01:37:24,648 --> 01:37:25,649
Victory?

1296
01:37:25,816 --> 01:37:28,027
When I hear peace could be so close.

1297
01:37:28,235 --> 01:37:29,236
Peace?

1298
01:37:29,403 --> 01:37:31,530
There's only an armistice

1299
01:37:31,697 --> 01:37:33,699
in an endless war.

1300
01:37:33,866 --> 01:37:35,242
Thucydides.

1301
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:37,411
Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.

1302
01:37:37,578 --> 01:37:39,413
They understood

1303
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,916
that war is a god.

1304
01:37:42,082 --> 01:37:43,751
A god that requires human sacrifice.

1305
01:37:43,918 --> 01:37:45,836
And in exchange,

1306
01:37:46,003 --> 01:37:47,755
war gives man purpose,

1307
01:37:48,339 --> 01:37:50,549
meaning, a chance to rise above

1308
01:37:50,716 --> 01:37:53,010
his petty, mortal, little self

1309
01:37:53,594 --> 01:37:54,887
and be courageous,

1310
01:37:55,638 --> 01:37:57,139
noble, better!

1311
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:01,435
Only one of the many gods
believed in that.

1312
01:38:01,852 --> 01:38:04,021
- Mmm.
- And he was wrong.

1313
01:38:05,231 --> 01:38:07,149
You know nothing of the gods.

1314
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:08,526
<i>Herr</i> General.

1315
01:38:11,445 --> 01:38:12,988
Enjoy the fireworks.

1316
01:38:18,536 --> 01:38:19,620
What are you doing?

1317
01:38:19,787 --> 01:38:21,227
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1318
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:23,130
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,

1319
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:24,518
we won't be able to stop anything.

1320
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:25,543
I will stop Ares!

1321
01:38:25,709 --> 01:38:26,794
What if you're wrong?

1322
01:38:28,462 --> 01:38:30,130
What if there is no Ares?

1323
01:38:31,924 --> 01:38:33,300
You don't believe me.

1324
01:38:33,842 --> 01:38:35,511
I can't let you do this.

1325
01:38:36,095 --> 01:38:37,388
What I do is not up to you.

1326
01:38:44,186 --> 01:38:45,271
Diana!

1327
01:38:49,692 --> 01:38:50,943
<i>Diana...</i>

1328
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:52,194
<i>It's the gas.</i>

1329
01:38:52,361 --> 01:38:54,405
The village... The village!

1330
01:38:57,366 --> 01:38:58,951
What are they cheering for?

1331
01:39:01,495 --> 01:39:02,663
Diana!

1332
01:39:05,082 --> 01:39:06,709
What did they fire?

1333
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:07,876
The gas.

1334
01:39:08,043 --> 01:39:08,605
It was Ludendorff.

1335
01:39:08,635 --> 01:39:09,729
I saw him. He was in the tower.

1336
01:39:09,753 --> 01:39:11,922
Wherever he goes, you follow.

1337
01:39:12,506 --> 01:39:13,757
How will you find us?

1338
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:15,551
I know how.

1339
01:40:33,337 --> 01:40:34,672
Diana!

1340
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,469
They're dead. They're all dead.

1341
01:40:41,303 --> 01:40:42,930
I could have saved them.

1342
01:40:43,263 --> 01:40:45,641
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1343
01:40:45,808 --> 01:40:47,768
You stopped me from killing Ares!

1344
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,437
- No!
- Stay away from me!

1345
01:40:50,604 --> 01:40:51,939
<i>I understand everything now.</i>

1346
01:40:52,106 --> 01:40:54,066
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1347
01:40:54,108 --> 01:40:55,275
It's you, too.

1348
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:57,027
All of you.

1349
01:40:58,153 --> 01:40:59,530
I will find Ares

1350
01:40:59,697 --> 01:41:01,323
and I will kill him.

1351
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:05,452
Diana!

1352
01:41:06,745 --> 01:41:07,996
That smoke,

1353
01:41:08,997 --> 01:41:10,124
<i>it's the Chief!</i>

1354
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,542
He followed Ludendorff.

1355
01:41:13,043 --> 01:41:14,628
Follow the smoke!

1356
01:41:40,779 --> 01:41:42,322
Hey! Diana, that way!

1357
01:41:58,714 --> 01:42:00,591
Come on! Let's go!

1358
01:42:22,154 --> 01:42:23,739
<i>What a surprise.</i>

1359
01:42:24,448 --> 01:42:25,657
Strange.

1360
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:29,119
Unfortunately, I have another matter

1361
01:42:30,412 --> 01:42:31,413
to attend to.

1362
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:38,879
What are you?

1363
01:42:39,046 --> 01:42:40,297
You will soon find out.

1364
01:43:14,706 --> 01:43:18,418
As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me.

1365
01:43:22,589 --> 01:43:24,383
We'll see about that.

1366
01:43:48,657 --> 01:43:50,784
I am Diana of Themyscira,

1367
01:43:52,494 --> 01:43:54,580
<i>daughter of Hippolyta,</i>

1368
01:43:55,455 --> 01:43:57,791
Queen of the Amazons.

1369
01:44:01,044 --> 01:44:03,797
And your wrath upon this world is over.

1370
01:44:20,606 --> 01:44:23,358
In the name of all
that is good in this world,

1371
01:44:23,525 --> 01:44:26,236
I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons

1372
01:44:26,403 --> 01:44:28,238
by ridding this world of you

1373
01:44:28,405 --> 01:44:29,489
forever!

1374
01:45:36,723 --> 01:45:37,724
<i>Diana?</i>

1375
01:45:43,814 --> 01:45:45,065
Diana!

1376
01:45:49,236 --> 01:45:50,487
I killed him.

1377
01:45:52,072 --> 01:45:54,241
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1378
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,620
You kill the God of War,
you stop the war.

1379
01:45:58,787 --> 01:46:00,872
Exactly what we have to do now.

1380
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:02,457
We need to stop the gas. Come on.

1381
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,060
No. All of this should have stopped!

1382
01:46:04,084 --> 01:46:05,085
Diana...

1383
01:46:05,252 --> 01:46:06,380
The fighting should have stopped.

1384
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:07,230
Why are they doing this?

1385
01:46:07,254 --> 01:46:09,256
I don't know! I don't know.

1386
01:46:09,423 --> 01:46:11,091
Ares is dead.

1387
01:46:11,258 --> 01:46:13,468
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1388
01:46:13,635 --> 01:46:15,262
Because, maybe it's them!

1389
01:46:15,804 --> 01:46:16,805
Maybe...

1390
01:46:18,765 --> 01:46:21,393
Maybe people aren't always good.

1391
01:46:22,269 --> 01:46:24,146
Ares or no Ares,

1392
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:28,817
maybe it's just who they are.

1393
01:46:31,653 --> 01:46:33,030
- Diana...
- No.

1394
01:46:33,196 --> 01:46:34,698
Diana, we can talk about this later.

1395
01:46:34,865 --> 01:46:36,092
- I need you to come with me.
- No. No.

1396
01:46:36,116 --> 01:46:38,035
After everything I saw, it can't be!

1397
01:46:38,201 --> 01:46:39,661
It cannot be!

1398
01:46:40,287 --> 01:46:42,039
They were killing each other.

1399
01:46:42,205 --> 01:46:44,958
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1400
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:46,668
Children!

1401
01:46:46,877 --> 01:46:49,296
No, it had to be him.
It cannot be them!

1402
01:46:49,463 --> 01:46:51,882
Diana, people... I...

1403
01:46:52,049 --> 01:46:53,550
She was right.

1404
01:46:54,134 --> 01:46:55,135
My mother was right.

1405
01:46:55,302 --> 01:46:57,220
She said,
"The world of men do not deserve you."

1406
01:46:57,387 --> 01:46:59,264
They don't deserve our help, Steve.

1407
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:01,631
- It's not about deserve!
- They don't deserve our help.

1408
01:47:01,725 --> 01:47:03,560
Maybe we don't!

1409
01:47:05,187 --> 01:47:07,439
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1410
01:47:08,482 --> 01:47:11,318
You don't think I get it
after what I've seen out there?

1411
01:47:13,487 --> 01:47:15,031
You don't think I
wish I could tell you

1412
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,367
that it was one
bad guy to blame?

1413
01:47:17,032 --> 01:47:18,533
It's not!

1414
01:47:20,911 --> 01:47:22,537
We're all to blame.

1415
01:47:22,829 --> 01:47:23,830
I am not.

1416
01:47:25,373 --> 01:47:27,167
But maybe I am!

1417
01:47:31,129 --> 01:47:32,214
Please.

1418
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:34,174
If you believe that
this war should stop,

1419
01:47:34,341 --> 01:47:36,093
if you want to stop it,

1420
01:47:36,259 --> 01:47:38,512
help me stop it right now.

1421
01:47:40,222 --> 01:47:43,058
Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more.

1422
01:47:43,683 --> 01:47:45,644
Please, please come with me.

1423
01:47:45,811 --> 01:47:47,354
I have to go.

1424
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:55,362
I have to go.

1425
01:48:07,207 --> 01:48:08,208
Hey! Hey!

1426
01:48:12,712 --> 01:48:14,131
- Where's Diana?
- We're on our own.

1427
01:48:14,297 --> 01:48:16,758
- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?

1428
01:48:17,467 --> 01:48:19,094
<i>Looks like a bunch of gas bombs</i>

1429
01:48:19,261 --> 01:48:21,888
but I can't see
where they're taking them.

1430
01:48:22,055 --> 01:48:23,390
<i>How are we going to get in there?</i>

1431
01:48:24,057 --> 01:48:26,101
I've got an idea. Come on, guys.

1432
01:48:26,268 --> 01:48:27,394
Come on!

1433
01:48:41,241 --> 01:48:42,784
Who's there?

1434
01:48:55,463 --> 01:48:57,007
Sir Patrick.

1435
01:48:57,757 --> 01:49:02,095
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1436
01:49:03,263 --> 01:49:07,225
They only deserve destruction.

1437
01:49:08,268 --> 01:49:09,686
You...

1438
01:49:11,605 --> 01:49:13,607
You're him.

1439
01:49:17,027 --> 01:49:18,445
I am.

1440
01:49:19,029 --> 01:49:23,950
But I am not what you thought I was.

1441
01:49:44,095 --> 01:49:45,680
What is it?

1442
01:49:46,973 --> 01:49:48,391
The future.

1443
01:49:52,979 --> 01:49:55,148
I am not your enemy, Diana.

1444
01:49:56,983 --> 01:50:00,820
I am the only one who truly knows you.

1445
01:50:00,987 --> 01:50:05,408
And who truly knows them, as you now do.

1446
01:50:07,827 --> 01:50:11,665
They have always been,
and always will be

1447
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:15,669
weak, cruel, selfish,

1448
01:50:15,835 --> 01:50:19,005
and capable of the greatest horrors.

1449
01:50:28,348 --> 01:50:29,849
All I ever wanted

1450
01:50:30,016 --> 01:50:34,980
was for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1451
01:50:36,898 --> 01:50:38,608
But they refused.

1452
01:50:38,775 --> 01:50:40,026
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1453
01:50:40,193 --> 01:50:41,194
So I destroyed them.

1454
01:50:41,361 --> 01:50:43,363
...daughter of Hippolyta,

1455
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:44,770
and I'm here to complete her...

1456
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:54,791
The Godkiller...

1457
01:50:57,836 --> 01:50:59,754
My dear child,

1458
01:51:01,131 --> 01:51:03,633
that is not the Godkiller.

1459
01:51:06,136 --> 01:51:07,679
You are.

1460
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:13,393
Only a god can kill another god.

1461
01:51:14,394 --> 01:51:18,315
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons

1462
01:51:18,481 --> 01:51:20,567
as a weapon to use against me.

1463
01:51:20,734 --> 01:51:22,569
No. You liar.

1464
01:51:24,279 --> 01:51:26,740
I compel you to tell me the truth.

1465
01:51:29,075 --> 01:51:30,785
I am.

1466
01:51:56,936 --> 01:51:59,314
I am not the God of War, Diana.

1467
01:51:59,481 --> 01:52:02,192
I am the God of Truth.

1468
01:52:03,485 --> 01:52:04,986
Mankind

1469
01:52:05,612 --> 01:52:07,781
stole this world from us.

1470
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:13,995
<i>They ruined it, day by day.</i>

1471
01:52:14,162 --> 01:52:18,333
<i>And I, the only one
wise enough to see it,</i>

1472
01:52:20,001 --> 01:52:22,754
<i>was left too weak to stop them.</i>

1473
01:52:23,463 --> 01:52:27,092
<i>All these years,
I have struggled alone,</i>

1474
01:52:27,258 --> 01:52:29,177
<i>whispering into their ears.</i>

1475
01:52:29,344 --> 01:52:34,182
<i>Ideas, inspiration for formulas,</i>

1476
01:52:34,974 --> 01:52:36,601
<i>weapons,</i>

1477
01:52:39,104 --> 01:52:41,606
but I don't make them use them.

1478
01:52:42,482 --> 01:52:44,567
They start these wars on their own.

1479
01:52:45,693 --> 01:52:49,489
<i>All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,</i>

1480
01:52:49,656 --> 01:52:52,200
<i>in the hope
they will destroy themselves.</i>

1481
01:52:53,952 --> 01:52:55,995
<i>But it has never been enough.</i>

1482
01:52:57,664 --> 01:52:59,416
Until you.

1483
01:53:01,459 --> 01:53:05,713
<i>When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you.</i>

1484
01:53:06,214 --> 01:53:09,467
<i>But I knew that
if only you could see</i>

1485
01:53:09,634 --> 01:53:12,470
what the other gods could not,

1486
01:53:14,848 --> 01:53:19,394
then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,

1487
01:53:19,561 --> 01:53:23,565
we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,

1488
01:53:23,731 --> 01:53:26,443
the destruction they bring.

1489
01:53:26,609 --> 01:53:31,906
And we could return this world
to the paradise it was before them.

1490
01:53:33,366 --> 01:53:34,993
<i>Forever.</i>

1491
01:53:37,871 --> 01:53:39,414
<i>I...</i>

1492
01:53:44,085 --> 01:53:46,963
I could never be a part of that.

1493
01:53:50,216 --> 01:53:52,844
My dear, I don't want to fight you.

1494
01:53:53,928 --> 01:53:55,305
<i>But, if I must...</i>

1495
01:54:04,772 --> 01:54:06,566
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1496
01:54:07,275 --> 01:54:08,401
<i>Sammy, let's go!</i>

1497
01:54:09,027 --> 01:54:10,695
Get this plane out of here!

1498
01:54:40,642 --> 01:54:45,063
Oh, my dear, you have so much to learn.

1499
01:55:10,171 --> 01:55:12,507
Oh, my God!

1500
01:55:12,674 --> 01:55:13,967
What are we gonna do?

1501
01:55:15,802 --> 01:55:18,012
There's not much we can do,

1502
01:55:18,471 --> 01:55:19,973
if that's who I think it is.

1503
01:55:25,979 --> 01:55:27,897
But we can stop that plane.

1504
01:55:40,952 --> 01:55:42,996
<i>If we can get on the radio,</i>

1505
01:55:43,162 --> 01:55:45,039
we can ask Flying Corps
to shoot her down.

1506
01:55:45,206 --> 01:55:48,334
No. If it crashes, it'll wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles!

1507
01:55:48,501 --> 01:55:49,502
We gotta ground it!

1508
01:55:49,669 --> 01:55:51,504
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1509
01:55:51,671 --> 01:55:54,048
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1510
01:56:01,014 --> 01:56:02,807
Is it flammable, Chief?

1511
01:56:02,974 --> 01:56:06,352
Yeah, she said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1512
01:56:13,401 --> 01:56:15,695
I need you guys to clear me a path
to that plane.

1513
01:56:15,862 --> 01:56:18,072
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1514
01:56:19,365 --> 01:56:20,366
Come on!

1515
01:57:03,743 --> 01:57:05,536
Come on! This way! Steve!

1516
01:57:15,922 --> 01:57:17,131
- Go, Steve, come on.
- Go!

1517
01:57:17,924 --> 01:57:19,300
Steve!

1518
01:57:22,136 --> 01:57:24,097
- Go, Steve. Come on.
- Run, run!

1519
01:58:02,218 --> 01:58:05,638
Let's see what kind of god
you really are.

1520
01:58:31,831 --> 01:58:34,500
<i>You will help me destroy them, Diana,</i>

1521
01:58:38,629 --> 01:58:40,506
<i>or you will die.</i>

1522
01:58:50,475 --> 01:58:52,727
<i>Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!</i>

1523
01:58:54,771 --> 01:58:57,023
- Move it, boys! Now!
- Let's go! Run!

1524
01:59:22,882 --> 01:59:25,593
Is that all you have to offer?

1525
01:59:41,818 --> 01:59:45,738
It is futile to imagine you can win.

1526
01:59:46,531 --> 01:59:48,157
Give up, Diana.

1527
01:59:48,324 --> 01:59:49,325
<i>Guys, I'm out.</i>

1528
01:59:52,328 --> 01:59:53,579
Chief! Anything left?

1529
01:59:53,746 --> 01:59:54,831
I got nothing.

1530
01:59:54,997 --> 01:59:56,040
- Anything!
<i>- No.</i>

1531
02:00:13,975 --> 02:00:15,142
Steve.

1532
02:01:01,522 --> 02:01:02,940
Steve...

1533
02:01:06,444 --> 02:01:08,821
No!

1534
02:01:43,773 --> 02:01:46,067
<i>Yes, Diana!</i>

1535
02:01:46,233 --> 02:01:48,945
<i>Take them all!</i>

1536
02:01:49,111 --> 02:01:52,073
<i>Finally, you see.</i>

1537
02:01:52,698 --> 02:01:55,117
Look at this world.

1538
02:01:56,035 --> 02:01:58,829
<i>Mankind did this, not me.</i>

1539
02:02:00,039 --> 02:02:01,958
<i>They are ugly,</i>

1540
02:02:02,124 --> 02:02:04,210
<i>filled with hatred,</i>

1541
02:02:04,377 --> 02:02:05,628
<i>weak,</i>

1542
02:02:05,795 --> 02:02:08,881
<i>just like your Captain Trevor.</i>

1543
02:02:09,048 --> 02:02:11,884
Gone, and left you nothing.

1544
02:02:12,718 --> 02:02:14,887
<i>And for what?</i>

1545
02:02:15,304 --> 02:02:16,597
<i>Pathetic!</i>

1546
02:02:18,432 --> 02:02:19,725
He deserved to burn!

1547
02:02:30,736 --> 02:02:34,448
<i>Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.</i>

1548
02:02:43,582 --> 02:02:47,586
<i>She is the perfect example
of these humans</i>

1549
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:53,175
<i>and unworthy of your sympathy
in every way.</i>

1550
02:02:54,427 --> 02:02:56,929
Destroy her, Diana.

1551
02:02:57,596 --> 02:03:01,017
<i>You know that she deserves it.
They all do.</i>

1552
02:03:04,603 --> 02:03:06,063
Do it!

1553
02:03:10,776 --> 02:03:12,445
<i>Diana!</i>

1554
02:03:15,823 --> 02:03:17,241
<i>Diana...</i>

1555
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,001
What?

1556
02:03:28,127 --> 02:03:29,795
I have to go.

1557
02:03:32,506 --> 02:03:33,966
What are you saying?

1558
02:03:34,341 --> 02:03:35,342
Steve,

1559
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:38,304
whatever it is, I can do it.

1560
02:03:38,471 --> 02:03:39,472
No. No.

1561
02:03:39,638 --> 02:03:41,265
- Let me do it.
- No.

1562
02:03:41,432 --> 02:03:42,975
It has to be me.

1563
02:03:43,142 --> 02:03:44,935
It has to be me.

1564
02:03:45,102 --> 02:03:48,105
I can save today.
You could save the world.

1565
02:03:56,947 --> 02:03:59,575
I wish we had more time.

1566
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:02,661
What? What are you saying?

1567
02:04:05,331 --> 02:04:06,499
I love you!

1568
02:04:18,511 --> 02:04:19,804
You're wrong about them.

1569
02:04:29,730 --> 02:04:31,482
They're everything you say,

1570
02:04:32,233 --> 02:04:33,984
but so much more.

1571
02:04:34,151 --> 02:04:35,528
Lies!

1572
02:05:01,762 --> 02:05:05,391
They do not deserve your protection!

1573
02:05:07,184 --> 02:05:08,352
It's not about deserve.

1574
02:05:13,232 --> 02:05:15,151
It's about what you believe.

1575
02:05:18,404 --> 02:05:19,905
And I believe in love.

1576
02:05:20,072 --> 02:05:24,368
Then I will destroy you!

1577
02:05:52,271 --> 02:05:53,939
Goodbye, brother.

1578
02:09:26,193 --> 02:09:28,529
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

1579
02:09:29,696 --> 02:09:33,450
<i>To end war and bring peace to mankind.</i>

1580
02:09:34,034 --> 02:09:37,871
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light</i>

1581
02:09:38,789 --> 02:09:41,125
<i>and learned that inside
every one of them,</i>

1582
02:09:41,708 --> 02:09:43,961
<i>there will always be both.</i>

1583
02:09:44,837 --> 02:09:47,714
<i>A choice each must make
for themselves.</i>

1584
02:09:47,881 --> 02:09:51,301
<i>Something no hero will ever defeat.</i>

1585
02:09:53,011 --> 02:09:54,012
<i>And now I know</i>

1586
02:09:54,972 --> 02:09:59,601
<i>that only love can truly save the world.</i>

1587
02:10:01,478 --> 02:10:03,147
<i>So, I stay,</i>

1588
02:10:03,313 --> 02:10:05,482
<i>I fight, and I give,</i>

1589
02:10:08,235 --> 02:10:10,237
<i>for the world I know can be.</i>

1590
02:10:14,992 --> 02:10:16,201
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1591
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:20,914
<i>Forever.</i>
