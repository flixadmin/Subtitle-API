1
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:40,319
- Yo.
- Yo.

2
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:41,779
What up?

3
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:43,114
Damn, bitch.

4
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:51,747
- You got something for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:59,881
- Is this a five or an S?
- Five, yo.

6
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,966
No, wait. S.

7
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:06,053
- No, no. Yeah, five.
- Yeah?

8
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:11,225
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:12,476
Hey, man.

10
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:15,730
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:18,691
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,401
Hey.

13
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,320
So they got names?

14
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:26,782
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

15
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,868
Him, they call Spooge.

16
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:34,290
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

17
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,542
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked

18
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:38,586
by a guy named Spooge?

19
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:40,421
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,217
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:47,177
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

22
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:49,555
- Did I say that?
- Because I'll go do it myself.

23
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:53,935
- It's just I'm on probation and all.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,812
So you gonna do it?

25
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,315
Yeah.

26
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:01,776
Good. Right on.

27
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:08,199
Because these two, they need to get got.

28
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:41,584
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

29
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,669
Where's my...?

30
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,716
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

31
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:52,053
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

32
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:53,846
Where's my money?

33
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:56,474
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

34
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,809
Come on.

35
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:05,650
I will mess you up.

36
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:08,819
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:11,572
Your funeral, jack.

38
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:17,578
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:20,581
<i>Yeah, mucho loco.</i>

40
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,918
Do not test me.

41
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:36,055
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

42
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,016
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,520
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:45,314
Looks like it's gonna be a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:48,568
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:52,905
- You have a great day.
- Right on. You too.

47
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:11,591
God. Shit.

48
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:47,793
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,633
Hello?

50
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:54,986
<i>Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery</i>

51
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,446
<i>tonight in the steel knock out.</i>

52
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:00,575
<i>Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

53
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:03,119
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>

54
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:06,330
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only...</i>

55
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,292
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,086
<i>Now, Terry put this one together...</i>

57
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,881
Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,008
<i>And I'm here to tell you...</i>

59
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:22,388
<i>Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...</i>

60
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,432
<i>Already done it.</i>

61
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,767
<i>Tonight, folks...</i>

62
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,111
<i>Do you realise how long it's been</i>

63
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,908
<i>since we've offered this sword
in this set?</i>

64
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:48,456
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.</i>

65
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,333
<i>It's no wonder...</i>

66
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,628
<i>It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now...</i>

67
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:54,962
What's your name?

68
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:58,466
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm...</i>

69
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:02,136
My name's Diesel.

70
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:04,305
<i>Eleven, 12, 13</i>

71
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:08,643
<i>sixteen, 17, 18, 19...</i>

72
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:11,401
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:15,233
<i>Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?</i>

74
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:19,612
<i>Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.</i>

75
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,782
<i>Folks, custom pieces...</i>

76
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:32,416
<i>Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess,</i>

77
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,877
<i>but there's a reason for that.</i>

78
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:40,341
<i>Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.</i>

79
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,178
<i>These knives possess edges like...</i>

80
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,275
So when are your folks coming home?

81
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:01,863
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,701
I'm hungry.

83
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:13,875
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

84
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,878
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

85
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:22,049
<i>We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...</i>

86
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:25,386
<i>Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.</i>

87
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:28,431
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

88
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,478
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz</i>

89
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,731
<i>calling to say hello.</i>

90
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:40,139
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both</i>

91
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:41,652
<i>hoping everything's well.</i>

92
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,947
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected,</i>

93
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,533
<i>so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

94
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:49,911
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

95
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,749
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

96
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:58,419
<i>This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

97
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:00,755
No. No, not at all.

98
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:03,424
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,009
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

100
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:09,722
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work,

101
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:13,267
<i>and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

102
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:15,376
And I really hope we didn't worry you.

103
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:18,522
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:20,107
That's wonderful.

105
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:25,154
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this,

106
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:29,283
and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:31,744
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant</i>

108
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:35,623
about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

109
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,931
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just...

110
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:44,257
<i>- What? What is it?
- I can't</i>

111
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:47,969
begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:52,431
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

113
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:56,269
It saved us.

114
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,357
I don't know if I...

115
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:04,366
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,737
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,408
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,286
So I just

119
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:17,748
finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,754
<i>Anyway...</i>

121
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,382
End of speech.

122
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,260
So I do... I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:34,348
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:39,395
<i>- How about this afternoon?
- Yeah, okay.</i>

125
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:45,693
Monoalkenes, diolefins

126
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:49,488
trienes, polyenes.

127
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:53,159
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,411
But when you start to feel overwhelmed,

129
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,872
and you will

130
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,210
just keep in mind that one element

131
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,670
carbon.

132
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,382
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

133
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:12,345
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:15,056
Nowhere that we know of in the universe.

135
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:22,188
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

136
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,024
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,196
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,407
No. Okay.

139
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:37,036
I like to think of it...

140
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,541
I like to think that the diamond,

141
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,917
and the woman who wears it on her finger

142
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,213
are both formed from the same stuff.

143
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:53,386
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,931
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,851
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:06,148
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:11,279
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process,

148
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,906
for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,284
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

150
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:21,664
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling

151
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:26,586
electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

152
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:30,381
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,553
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:42,977
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,482
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,621
Anyway...

157
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:05,958
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper

158
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,767
paid to a carbon-based man,

159
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,591
for something he made out of carbon.

160
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,451
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

161
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:21,349
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:26,062
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,524
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

164
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:32,026
That's a great look for you.

165
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:39,450
- But you're feeling good?
- Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,827
It's...

167
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:43,496
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:48,584
I'm glad to... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,795
We're happy too.

170
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,674
And I just...

171
00:14:56,551 --> 00:15:00,846
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

172
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:07,895
Is everything okay?

173
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:14,277
Just please feel comfortable coming to me

174
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:19,240
with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

175
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:22,368
You know, completely confidential.

176
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:24,495
Okay?

177
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:31,752
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

178
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,506
Oh, man.

179
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,937
Let me see it.

180
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,026
- Dad, let me see it.
- Don't worry about it.

181
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:01,574
Hey, let's go.

182
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:37,652
<i>Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...</i>

183
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:40,988
Hey.

184
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:45,117
Peekaboo.

185
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,055
No?

186
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,478
Peekaboo.

187
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,067
Oh, man.

188
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,238
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:12,327
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,011
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching

191
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:19,000
I gave you advice, take it or leave it.

192
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:27,217
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,190
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

194
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,818
- You shut up, you...
- You shut up!

195
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,737
- You're the one who dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

196
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,947
I didn't drop...

197
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,490
- Shit! You dropped it.
- Shut the hell up about it.

198
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:52,974
- You shut up!
- You shut up.

199
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,623
Get up.

200
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:04,296
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:27,944
- You know who might have done it?
- I have an idea.

202
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:33,325
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:37,996
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads

204
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:43,376
we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked

205
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:48,965
then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,636
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,724
You with me?

208
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,854
Scorpions?

209
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:08,026
Scorpions are good.

210
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:10,320
Yeah.

211
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,204
Nice.

212
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:36,888
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

213
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:39,683
Who is this?

214
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:01,580
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,915
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

216
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:06,501
- Mom.
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

217
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,337
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

218
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,382
- Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
- Nice to meet you too.

219
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:13,758
Oh, Walt.

220
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,387
Look who's here.

221
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,597
- Gretchen.
- Hi.

222
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:21,850
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

223
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:24,603
Look at you. You're looking good.

224
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,861
Though a bald head is a bit of a shocker.

225
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:28,523
I know it was for me.

226
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:32,319
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

227
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:33,903
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

228
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:37,324
- For good luck, right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

229
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:39,282
- We could use some of that.
- Yeah.

230
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:43,622
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:49,628
- It was a really good thing.
- You're very welcome.

232
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:52,964
- We're gonna find a way to repay you.
- No, no, no.

233
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:56,301
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:57,677 --> 00:21:00,639
You know, I hate to say it,

235
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:03,975
but I really need to get going.

236
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:05,810
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,187
- You can't stay for dinner?
- I wish I could,

238
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:11,608
but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

239
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:12,817
Okay. Okay.

240
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:17,822
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

241
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,324
Yeah, hopefully.

242
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:22,369
Gretchen, your purse.

243
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,456
Well, good to see you.

244
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:31,419
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

245
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:35,924
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

246
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:38,260
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

247
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:42,389
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

248
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:46,476
- Okay. Bye, now.
- Drive safely.

249
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:51,230
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

250
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:53,149
I'll be right back.

251
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:58,655
Gretchen.

252
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:00,657
Hey.

253
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,206
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

254
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,250
What did you...?

255
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:14,629
We need to talk.

256
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:18,883
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

257
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:23,138
Please. Please.

258
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,990
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

259
00:22:42,198 --> 00:22:46,328
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

260
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:49,873
- I just wanna say, man...
- What? What do you wanna say?

261
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,631
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,170
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:57,678
- Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
- Shut up!

264
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:59,674
Jesus.

265
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:03,219
- Serious, I might have a concussion.
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

266
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,428
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

267
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:08,099
Shut up.

268
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,435
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:13,021
Turn them out, everything on the table.

270
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:14,439
Do it!

271
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:20,946
All right, turn around.

272
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:22,405
Turn around.

273
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,200
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

274
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:33,959
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,557
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any...

276
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,309
- We shot it all.
- Yeah?

277
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:54,813
- Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
- Yeah.

278
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:57,148
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:57,357 --> 00:24:01,152
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now,

280
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:05,323
or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

281
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:07,450
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,664
There you go.

283
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,877
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:22,095
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,341
Division of labour.

286
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,722
All right, there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,016
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:33,643
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,729
- You shut up.
- You shut up, skank.

290
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:38,773
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:42,652
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

292
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:46,364
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:49,743
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial,

294
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,746
for being such a pussy.

295
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:58,710
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,797
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:09,763
All right.

298
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:13,391
You two are never getting high again.

299
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,186
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:19,064
Not another needle, not another ball

301
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:23,318
not one toke, not till I get what's mine.

302
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,572
Yeah, we got you covered, man, sure.

303
00:25:27,781 --> 00:25:30,951
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:32,785
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,372
- Where?
- Back yard.

306
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,332
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

307
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,586
- Hurting. Painful.
- Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:45,507
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:48,718
Hey, don't move.

310
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,765
Come on.

311
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:57,435
See?

312
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:00,897
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,942
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,944
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:09,114
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:11,616
Get high.

317
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:17,497
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,916
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,627
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,486
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

321
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,997
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

322
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,593
<i>In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

323
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:33,096
<i>What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumb-ass?</i>

324
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,473
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

325
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:38,018
<i>All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

326
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:40,478
<i>- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?</i>

327
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:45,358
<i>- For real?
- I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

328
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:56,011
Oh, my God.

329
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:00,098
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:03,893
- It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
- You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,521
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:08,774
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:10,942
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,944
At least I got persistence.

335
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:16,031
The law of averages, lucky number seven.

336
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:20,786
- Don't listen to that skank.
- Stop calling me that.

337
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,080
I ain't no skank!

338
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,624
- Skank, skank, skank...
- Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:27,334
Sit, sit.

340
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:31,630
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,424
Now, chill.

342
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:37,928
You, get that thing open.

343
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:42,307
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,772
Where's the kid?

345
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:51,817
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:54,986
What are you asking me for?

347
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:14,840
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:16,448
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,413
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:27,227
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,980
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:32,982
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,526
Are you serious?

354
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:37,985
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,571
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, Diesel

356
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:42,806
this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

357
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,121
Get out of the way.

358
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:48,957
Get out of the way!

359
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:06,183
So you didn't tell anyone.

360
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,770
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

361
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:14,232
- Well, what does that mean?
- That means exactly what it means.

362
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:17,736
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,742
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,077
All right.

365
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:30,582
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

366
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,751
This was...

367
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,797
This entire thing was unfortunate.

368
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,257
Unfortunate?

369
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:43,804
And I apologise deeply.

370
00:29:44,388 --> 00:29:45,931
Thank you.

371
00:29:47,474 --> 00:29:50,769
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:56,358
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:29:56,692 --> 00:30:00,612
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:06,075
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it

375
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,619
how are you paying for it?

376
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:12,582
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

377
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:16,085
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:18,880
You tell your wife and son

379
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:21,339
that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:24,136
Why are you doing this?

381
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:28,807
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:32,352
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes

383
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:34,187
thanking me for saving your life.

384
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:38,358
- Why would you do that to her?
- As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:43,280
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

386
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:44,489
All right?

387
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:47,325
I will explain the whole thing to them.

388
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:49,995
And while you're at it, explain it to me.

389
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:55,250
I don't owe you an explanation.

390
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:59,087
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologised.

391
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:02,090
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

392
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,260
There. I've apologised twice now.

393
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:08,347
I'm humbly sorry.

394
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:10,015
Three times.

395
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:12,184
Let me just get this straight.

396
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,770
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment

397
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,438
no strings attached.

398
00:31:16,646 --> 00:31:18,857
An offer which still stands, by the way.

399
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:21,735
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever,

400
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:26,365
and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

401
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:28,533
Without our knowledge, against our will

402
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,619
you involve us in your lie.

403
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:36,708
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,673
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:47,552
What happened to you?

406
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,557
Really, Walt.

407
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:54,559
What happened?

408
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:57,562
Because this isn't you.

409
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:04,486
What would you know about me, Gretchen?

410
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:09,116
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

411
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:11,660
That I should go begging
for your charity?

412
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,706
And you waving your chequebook around

413
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:19,459
like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget

414
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:20,868
how you and Elliott...

415
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:24,089
How you and Elliott cut me out?

416
00:32:24,297 --> 00:32:26,091
What? That can't be how you see it.

417
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:29,886
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

418
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,888
That cannot be how you see it.

419
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:34,140
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left...

420
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:36,142
You are always the picture of innocence.

421
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:38,770
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

422
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:42,524
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

423
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:44,734
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

424
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:47,946
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room,

425
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:50,741
and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

426
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:53,618
What? Did I dream all of that?

427
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:56,329
That's your excuse

428
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:59,332
to build your little empire on my work?

429
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,793
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

430
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:05,047
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

431
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,966
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

432
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:15,974
I don't even know what to say to you.

433
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:19,728
I don't even know where to begin.

434
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:30,364
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,494
Fuck you.

436
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:13,031
Hey.

437
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:19,621
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:34,970
Hey.

439
00:34:57,784 --> 00:35:00,662
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:03,647
No, what are you doing?

441
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,961
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,838
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:13,592
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,719
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:35:19,598 --> 00:35:20,682
Bedtime.

446
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,980
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:34,613
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:36,698
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:39,576
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:42,412
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:15,445
Oh, hey.

452
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:18,073
Should I ask where you've been?

453
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,870
Never mind.

454
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,082
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,001
Skyler.

456
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:35,552
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,648
Walt.

458
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:50,818
We need to talk.

459
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,456
Just say it.

460
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:17,136
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:31,859
What did she say, exactly?

462
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:39,199
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:43,245
She said something like:

464
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:48,667
"I'm sorry to have to do this,

465
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:53,464
but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,759
I wish you the very best."

467
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,804
And that was it.

468
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:08,062
Yeah.

469
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:12,983
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:15,235
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,821
I was so stunned, but...

472
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,951
I called her back and she didn't pick up.

473
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:34,171
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,929
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon,

475
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:45,766
and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave,

476
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:49,269
and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:55,067
Walt.

478
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,778
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,119
Where were you tonight?

480
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,580
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,501
I was with Gretchen.

482
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,963
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:21,719
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

484
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:24,805
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:28,142
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing,

486
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,227
and beating around the bush...

487
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:34,315
Okay, what...? Tell us what?

488
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:37,818
Well...

489
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:40,828
There was a lot of

490
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:44,491
business phraseology being tossed around.

491
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,247
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"

492
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:52,540
"quarterly decline," yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:56,962
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

494
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:02,426
They're broke.

495
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:06,013
- You are kidding me.
- No.

496
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:09,600
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:14,438
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

498
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:17,316
Well, apparently, Gray Matter

499
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:21,362
is no more immune than anyone else.

500
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:24,406
That is...

501
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,285
Jesus, that's...

502
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,040
Yeah.

503
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:49,390
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:54,561
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:58,816
Listen.

506
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:02,528
Not to sound selfish,

507
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:05,739
but as far as we go

508
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:09,410
we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:16,375
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,085
Hey.

511
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:26,885
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

512
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:29,054
Okay.

513
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:41,650
And yet

514
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:45,988
she still drives a Bentley.

515
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:55,289
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:10,638
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:14,558
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:17,686
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,229
Nowhere.

520
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:22,358
I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:24,652
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,987
You put your weak spot on the bottom.

523
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:31,909
Oh, baby, that H is bringing me down.

524
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:34,411
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,623
I need to... I need to even out.

526
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:41,167
- Let me get a hit of that crystal.
- Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:42,544
Come on, baby.

528
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:45,756
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:49,885
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:51,929
I ain't no skank.

531
00:42:52,763 --> 00:42:56,517
I would appreciate an apology.

532
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:01,271
What?

533
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,191
I am trying to take the high road here.

534
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,734
Are you gonna do right?

535
00:43:05,943 --> 00:43:07,027
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:10,739
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:43:10,948 --> 00:43:14,702
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole,

538
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,414
and assist me and shut up.

539
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:24,044
I ain't no skank.

540
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,213
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

541
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:29,883
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

542
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:31,901
You listening to me, skank?

543
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:33,762
You hear me, skank?

544
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:38,058
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

545
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:42,146
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

546
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:45,524
I ain't no skank.

547
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:48,319
No, no, no. Don't. No.

548
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:07,421
I ain't no skank.

549
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:08,482
<i>911.</i>

550
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,248
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

551
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:27,668
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:30,712
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:33,096
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:36,677
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

555
00:45:49,106 --> 00:45:51,025
Here you go.

556
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:55,863
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

557
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:59,700
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

558
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:04,705
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

559
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:07,833
You stay right here. Okay?

560
00:46:14,715 --> 00:46:18,344
You have a good rest of your life, kid.
