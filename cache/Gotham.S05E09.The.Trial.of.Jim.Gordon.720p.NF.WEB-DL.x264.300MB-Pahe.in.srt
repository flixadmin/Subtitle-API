1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,050
[indistinct chatter]

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,177
Come on, people. Time's a wastin'.

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,224
[Lee] The filtration system
that Lucius designed is working.

4
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,852
What you're doing is both unnecessary
and it's reckless.

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,730
Our supplies of drinking water
are at critical levels.

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,732
Every day the gangs grow
more aggressive.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,151
If I can get a ceasefire,
even a temporary one,

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,278
then when reunification does happen,

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,530
at least there will be
people left to save.

10
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,489
They deserve that much.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,199
And does your child deserve a father?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,410
You have no problem
taking care of the entire city.

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,328
What about focusing on just one life?

14
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,373
Why are you always so ready
to put yourself in the crosshairs?

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,626
It's like you won't be satisfied
until you sacrifice yourself.

16
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,045
-You really believe that?
-I do.

17
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,797
And it scares me.

18
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,967
How is this gonna work?

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,596
Am I supposed to just stay at home
and raise this child with Barbara

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,848
while you go cowboying off all the time?

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,516
It won't always be like this.

22
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,269
-After reunification--
-Nothing will be different.

23
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,646
-Unless you stop being--
-Me?

24
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,024
[Harvey] Hey, Jim.

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,570
-I have to go. We'll talk after.
-If there is an after.

26
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,790
[yelling]

27
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,637
[Barbara] Oswald, where the hell is Nygma?

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,305
Shouldn't we have left the city already?

29
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,518
Miss Kean, this may come as a surprise,

30
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,855
but building a submarine from scratch
by yourself takes time.

31
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,941
-Patience.
-Easy for you to say.

32
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,567
You're not a walking egg timer.

33
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,444
Tell 'em to get a move on.

34
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,573
And why exactly are you hosting
Gordon's gangland get-together?

35
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,077
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer, my dear.

36
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,288
If we're really going to leave Gotham,
we need to keep Gordon happy.

37
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,125
You know all about that, don't you?

38
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,418
It was a momentary slip.

39
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,379
The world was on fire.

40
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,588
[banging on door]

41
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,888
Jim, it's your show.

42
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,765
[speaking Spanish]

43
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,770
I'll make this short.

44
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,565
Gotham is running dry.

45
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,069
Our supply of clean water
will only last a few more months.

46
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,030
So you have a choice.

47
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,411
You can keep killing each other,
fighting over what little water is left,

48
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,663
maybe eke out a few more months, then die.

49
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:50,003
Or we can all agree right now
to an immediate ceasefire.

50
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,921
[clamoring]

51
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,887
Government will not annex a war zone.

52
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,682
If we can show them that
we deserve to rejoin the mainland,

53
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:07,437
the supply chain will be restored and
we will all survive until reunification.

54
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,565
That's the choice.

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,151
Life or death.

56
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,694
Your call.

57
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,031
[man] No way!

58
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,366
[all clamoring]

59
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,619
-[woman 1] Yeah?
-[woman 2] Yeah.

60
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,245
-[woman 1] All right.
-[woman 2] All right, do it.

61
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,208
[gunshot]

62
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,335
Weapons down!

63
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,628
Get back!

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,130
Jim, you see where the shooter was?

65
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,632
Jim!

66
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,304
Oh, my God!

67
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,776
[gasping]

68
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,861
[Harvey] Get back!

69
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,988
You're gonna be all right.

70
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,865
It's bad. We gotta move him, now.

71
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,283
Clinic's too far.

72
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,910
ME's office. Alvarez, come on, help.

73
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,203
[Alvarez] On it.

74
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,040
[groans]

75
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
[Harper] All right, get back.

76
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,210
[crowd clamoring]

77
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,336
[Harvey] Get back!

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,801
Well, did not see that coming.

79
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,982
[Selina] What made you choose this,
of all places, for a scavenging mission?

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,859
Just trust me, okay?

81
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,492
[Selina] What the hell?

82
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,000
[ballroom music playing]

83
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,674
[Bruce] Sit.

84
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,011
[scoffs]

85
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,728
[chuckles softly]

86
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,570
Wow. Candles.

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,991
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this was a date.

88
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,124
Maybe it is.

89
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,922
That okay with you?

90
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,759
Maybe.

91
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,351
Good.

92
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,230
So, let's eat.

93
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,407
[Harvey] Lee, it's Jim.

94
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,159
He's lost a lot of blood.
Can you save him?

95
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,872
Come with me.

96
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,923
Doc says he's gonna be okay.

97
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,342
He's gonna pull through.

98
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,804
But until then, I'm acting captain.

99
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,182
Now, the gangs in this city

100
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,685
think this is their time,
that they can run wild.

101
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,896
They are dead wrong.

102
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,942
I want us to take to the streets.
It is show of force time.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,944
We ain't gonna give them an inch.

104
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,073
Harper, I want you
to organize patrol teams.

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,116
What are you gonna do?

106
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,868
I'm gonna find out who shot my partner.

107
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,288
[Lee] The bullet shattered against a rib.

108
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,168
We have to get all the fragments out.

109
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,673
I haven't done general surgery
since med school.

110
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,052
There.

111
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,473
There's an exit wound,
so the rest must have gone through.

112
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,184
I need to sew him up. Can you get my kit?

113
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,144
[woman] Right away.

114
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,357
[Lee] Come on, Jim.

115
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,444
You can do this. You have to fight.

116
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,237
You hear me?

117
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,240
You have to fight.

118
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,794
[gavel pounding]

119
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,296
[judge] Order in the court.

120
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,756
James Gordon.

121
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,386
You have been brought here
to be judged for your many crimes,

122
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,055
and your very life hangs in the balance.

123
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,475
Do you understand?

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,476
No, I--

125
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:01,564
The defendant understands
and waives his right to appeal.

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,904
The trial of James Gordon will now begin.

127
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,614
No! Wait!

128
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,586
That was the best canned meal
I have ever had.

129
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,422
And if this was a date,

130
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,258
I don't know how you're gonna top it
when everything gets back to normal.

131
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,640
I don't think things
are ever gonna be normal.

132
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,600
For me, anyways.

133
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,560
What do you mean?

134
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,355
Wayne Manor is gone.

135
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,817
And I know that a lot of people
lost a lot more,

136
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,486
but part of me wonders if it wasn't fate.

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,323
[sighs] It wasn't. It was Jeremiah
blowing up your house.

138
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,326
Maybe it's time to move on.

139
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,081
You mean, like, leave Gotham?

140
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,377
Bruce, forget Wayne Manor.
This city is your home.

141
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,172
And how many terrible things have
happened to it because of me?

142
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,218
Galavan,

143
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,137
Ra's al Ghul...

144
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,478
If this city really is my home,

145
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,732
then maybe the best thing I can
do for it is leave.

146
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:28,985
I have to say,

147
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,114
I kind of agree with you on that one...

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,449
Billionaire Boy.

149
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,703
[Penguin] Jim Gordon's blood on my floor.

150
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:44,375
Ugh. Olga! Why is the help never around
when you need them? [chuckles]

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,421
This could be good for us. You especially.

152
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,506
Are you serious?

153
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,552
Your baby daddy is the top cop in Gotham.

154
00:09:55,303 --> 00:10:00,349
A dead Jim Gordon is the only way you can
hold on to your little bundle of joy.

155
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,436
Harvey, how is our dear--

156
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,562
[groans]

157
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,064
Who the hell did it?

158
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,525
If I find out it was you, I swear to God--

159
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,612
It wasn't me! I merely supplied the venue.

160
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,363
At your boss's request!

161
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,656
That doesn't mean squat.

162
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,701
Fine! You wanna know who's to blame?

163
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,244
James Gordon!

164
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,496
He invited every criminal in Gotham.

165
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,582
What did he think was gonna happen?

166
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,375
[groans and coughs]

167
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,629
How about you, huh?

168
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,673
When did you two become so buddy-buddy?

169
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,469
Maybe when you hatched up a plan
so you could keep that baby for yourself.

170
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,929
Harvey, whatever you think of me,

171
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,766
I did not plot to kill my child's father.

172
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,309
Well, someone here did!

173
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,728
Someone in this room shot Jim Gordon,

174
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,147
and I'm not leaving
till I find out who it was.

175
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,484
Wrong! The shooter was not here.

176
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,737
Look at the window, stupid.
The shot came from outside.

177
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,036
If the shooter was there,

178
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,247
the trajectory was here,

179
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,124
Jim was...

180
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,793
Then the bullet...

181
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,882
Uh-huh.

182
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,804
I'm gonna find out who this was.

183
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,598
And when I do,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

184
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,559
Harvey...

185
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,230
Is there anything I can do?

186
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,025
Yeah. You can keep the gangs
from tearing the city apart.

187
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,946
[door closes]

188
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,284
-What do you want?
-You, I will deal with later.

189
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm here for you.

190
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,541
I need you to come with me.

191
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,084
Why would I do that?

192
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,294
Because you love me so much.

193
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,381
Not yet, but you will.

194
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,717
-Don't mess with him, Ivy.
-[Ivy] Protecting your boyfriend?

195
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,719
That's cute.

196
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,556
But I thought that might happen, so...

197
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,933
I brought a friend.

198
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,937
I stumbled across this charming man
on the way over here.

199
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,940
And apparently, you two know each other.

200
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,025
[Bruce] Leave her out of this!

201
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,616
I know I heard you talking
about the future of Gotham.

202
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
But Gotham will be what I decide.

203
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,831
A green world.

204
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,835
Won't that be beautiful?

205
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,213
[softly] Gorgeous.

206
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,882
[Ivy chuckles softly]

207
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,011
Bruce and I have to go.

208
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,141
You always did think
you were better than me.

209
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,480
But without my plants,
you never would have left your bed.

210
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,065
I made you strong again.

211
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,109
Think about that

212
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,737
while my friend is cutting out your heart.

213
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,791
There are so many things I wish
I could say to you.

214
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,836
[monitor beeping]

215
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
So many things I wish we could do.

216
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,471
This can't be the end.

217
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,389
Come on, Jim.

218
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,433
Talk to me.

219
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,770
Say something.

220
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,440
<i>Speak...</i>

221
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,608
[gavel pounding]

222
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,567
No.

223
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,904
This isn't right. I shouldn't be here.
You have to listen to me.

224
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,072
-[chains clanging]
-[judge] Silence!

225
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,991
The prosecution will now
give its opening remarks.

226
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,665
Your Honor, Jim Gordon's crimes are
a matter of public record.

227
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,293
He's failed Gotham at every turn.

228
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,213
He failed to clean up the city.

229
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,259
Failed to stop the bridges
from being destroyed.

230
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,096
Failed to protect those
poor, innocent souls

231
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,099
in the refuge he himself created.

232
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,976
Haven.

233
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,477
I tried.

234
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,437
-I did the best--
-[judge pounds gavel] Silence!

235
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,359
One more outburst
and you will be held in contempt.

236
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm hurt.

237
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,742
I need help, please!

238
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,911
Continue.

239
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,372
The issue here

240
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,002
is not how many people have died
because of Jim Gordon,

241
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,882
but how many more must die in order
to satisfy his need to be a hero.

242
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,510
Therefore, we pose one simple question.

243
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,848
Are the people in Jim Gordon's life

244
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,018
better off with him alive,

245
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,103
or dead?

246
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,106
I think I'm dying.

247
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,985
[Gordon 2] Prosecution would like to call
its first witness, Your Honor.

248
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,198
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

249
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,790
[irregular beeping]

250
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,170
Come on, Jim. Hold on.

251
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,755
[door opens]

252
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,381
[Harvey] How is he?

253
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,758
Touch and go.

254
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,719
He's stable for now.

255
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,556
I removed all the bullet fragments,
but something keeps pulling him down.

256
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,224
Where are the fragments?

257
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,653
What is it?

258
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,613
[Harvey] "VZ."

259
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,324
Victor Zsasz.

260
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,371
Okey dokey.

261
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,290
Time to boogie.

262
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,637
Hey, I'm only here for Gordon.

263
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,264
All of you, stay down.

264
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,185
I see anyone, and, you know...

265
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,355
Bang.

266
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,898
-[shouting]
-[groans]

267
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,945
Now, I heard you were
looking for Jim Gordon.

268
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,279
[Zsasz] Uh-huh.

269
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,576
[Selina] Listen, I know we have history.

270
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,454
Let's just let bygones be bygones.

271
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,872
Yeah, right.

272
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,333
You did this to my face.

273
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,292
Whatever.

274
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,087
It's not like you were
much of a looker before anyway.

275
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,714
[grunts]

276
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,550
Ivy says you hurt her feelings.
Why would you do that?

277
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,927
She's so sweet.

278
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,429
[roars]

279
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,057
Ivy didn't make me strong.

280
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,142
I made me strong.

281
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,226
[grunts]

282
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,978
Tell me where she took Bruce.

283
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,318
[Harvey] The only reason
I'm not ending you right now

284
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,406
is the thought of the look on your face
when Jim Gordon walks through that door,

285
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,783
because he's alive, you son of a bitch.

286
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,452
[exclaims in disgust]

287
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,745
What did you eat?

288
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,288
You smell like a butcher.

289
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,123
You know, I'm vegan now.

290
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,292
Why kill Jim now?

291
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,712
Makes no sense.
He saved your miserable ass.

292
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,174
He prevented Penguin from executing you.

293
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,385
If anyone, you should be
going after Cobblepot.

294
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,680
Yeah, that's a good point.
Maybe I'll do him next.

295
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,850
It's kind of not up to me.

296
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,894
You're working for someone.

297
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,190
Sorry.

298
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,942
[grunts]

299
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,653
-I want a name!
-[exhales deeply]

300
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,863
What's in a name?

301
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,949
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.

302
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,578
You know, I'm really taking the time
to stop and smell the roses these days.

303
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,288
Like, actual roses.

304
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,248
They're great.

305
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,793
-Are you high?
-On love.

306
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,711
But like I said,

307
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,671
my lips are sealed.

308
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,093
[snaps fingers] Ivy Pepper.

309
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,887
You said it, not me.

310
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,765
Uh, I'm technically not allowed
to say it, her name.

311
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,810
Which is such a bummer, because it's
the most beautiful name in the world.

312
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,270
-You watch him.
-I could say it all day.

313
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,980
Maybe I will say it all day.

314
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,233
Ivy. Ivy Pepper.

315
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,612
Mrs. Ivy Pepper Zsasz.
Oh, that sounds good.

316
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,705
[Alfred] Here you are, Ms. Thompkins.
Careful. It's a little bit hot.

317
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,336
Forgive me, but I heard on the grapevine

318
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,422
that you and Captain Gordon had a rather
heated exchange this morning.

319
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,632
[Lee] Oh, God.

320
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,509
Was it that bad?

321
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,886
Apparently, it was like a session
at the Italian Parliament.

322
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,304
[sighs]

323
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,314
You have misgivings about the arrival
of this child, don't you?

324
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,485
What am I getting myself into, Alfred?

325
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:19,408
How am I supposed to raise a child
alongside a psychopath like Barbara Kean?

326
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,743
I mean, how the hell is this gonna work?

327
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,621
But that's not all of it.

328
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,458
If Jim and I are gonna do this,
then we have to do it together.

329
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,751
You know how he is.

330
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,713
I don't know what's going on inside
that man's head sometimes.

331
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,216
I think you'll find that he needs you
a lot more than he's letting on.

332
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,844
Well, I need to hear it from him.

333
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,183
I never thought that this was how
my life was gonna be.

334
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,312
I had no interest
in being a father myself.

335
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,274
I always presumed that I was
unfit to be one.

336
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,235
And then I found myself,

337
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,114
one night, staring down an alley
at this little boy

338
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,491
quite literally shaking with fear.

339
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,120
I don't know,
it's funny what life throws at you.

340
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:10,209
I'm keenly aware that I am not
Master Bruce's flesh and blood,

341
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,835
but it's the moments,

342
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,047
the little things like...

343
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,675
Like when he uses a skill
that I once taught him.

344
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,761
Or we laugh at a joke
that only he and I share.

345
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,015
Those have been some of the most
ecstatic moments of my life.

346
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,685
Nothing can possibly
prepare you for that joy.

347
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,396
The hows and the whats,

348
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,107
you'll figure that stuff out.

349
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,777
What matters is this.

350
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,404
You'll be an exquisite mother.

351
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,243
And that child, he or she,
will be extraordinary,

352
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,037
because of you.

353
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,043
[sniffles]

354
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,336
Thank you, Alfred.

[inhales sharply]

356
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,849
Jim, can you hear me?

357
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
I'm right here, right next to you.

358
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,359
<i>Can you feel me?</i>

359
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:23,282
-Lee...
-Dr. Lee Thompkins.

360
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,618
You suffered at this man's hands
more than anyone.

361
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,954
Broken heart,

362
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,665
broken engagement,

363
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,167
a lost child.

364
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,671
And yet, you're still with him.

365
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,132
I love him.

366
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,509
[Gordon 2] For all the pain
he's caused you,

367
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,639
would your life be better,
could it not still be better,

368
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,017
without Jim Gordon?

369
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,687
Answer the question.

370
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,814
-Lee?
-[Gordon 2] I'll ask it a different way.

371
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,650
Would you, Dr. Lee Thompkins,

372
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,737
be better off if Jim Gordon were dead?

373
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,740
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,327
Everything he touches dies.

375
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,288
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

376
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,667
You made her say that.

377
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,586
[Gordon 2] I didn't make her say anything.

378
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,962
Ask them.

379
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,549
[Gordon] Who are they?

380
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,509
[Gordon 2] More people who trusted you.

381
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,888
Who believed you when you said
you would protect them.

382
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,349
They're from Haven.

383
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,436
I think I'm dying.

384
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,898
And isn't it about time?

385
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,277
The verdict's in.

386
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,613
You're guilty.

387
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,873
Hey, Jeff, listen to me.

388
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,459
One day you're gonna meet someone
who's gonna totally change your life.

389
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,461
And it's gonna make you happy.

390
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,546
And you deserve it.

391
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,467
Or not.

392
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,262
Is she here? She's here, isn't she?

393
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,350
Sweetie...

394
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,020
All I asked of you

395
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,564
was to kill Jim Gordon.

396
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,110
You're not angry, are you?
'Cause I'll do it. I'll do it right now.

397
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,239
I'll do it.

398
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,825
You keep the cops busy.

399
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,412
Luckily, the other part of my plan
is coming together nicely.

400
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,189
[Bruce] Lucius!

401
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,399
[Lucius] Bruce!

402
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,068
I had no idea you were stopping by.

403
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,738
I wanted to check on your progress.

404
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,325
[Lucius] Well, the toxicity levels
in this river continue to drop.

405
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,495
At this point, we'll be under
the threshold mandated by the government

406
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,454
sooner than expected.

407
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,332
It's not glamorous work,
but we are helping to save the lives

408
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,584
of thousands of people.

409
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,544
People. Ugh.

410
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,173
I'm sorry, did you just say,
"People. Ugh"?

411
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,843
Lucius, what if I were
to tell you I have in my possession

412
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,470
the most intoxicating perfume
you'll ever smell?

413
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,806
I would tell you that's
an abrupt change of topic.

414
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,850
Can we go back to the part where
you said, "People. Ugh"?

415
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,728
[clears throat]

416
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,062
Mmm.

417
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,193
[distorted] Oh, my goodness!

418
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,696
Lucius, Ivy sent me here
to get you to shut down the plant.

419
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,198
Can you do that for her?

420
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,991
[distorted] For Ivy?

421
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,451
Anything.

422
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,453
She is so great.

423
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,918
[rock music playing]

424
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,597
Raise your glasses.

425
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,478
I called you all here today
because Jim Gordon is at death's door.

426
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,231
[cheering]

427
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,816
For years, he has hounded us, beaten us,

428
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,736
shot us, and today he got his due.

429
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,073
To Jim Gordon. May he rot in hell!

430
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,908
[cheering continues]

431
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,913
What exactly are you doing?

432
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,332
I'm trying to keep the city
from ripping itself apart.

433
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,461
So, this has nothing to do
with your feelings for Jim?

434
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,297
What if Ed fails and we are stuck here?

435
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,967
This will put us in Gordon's good graces.

436
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,052
Consider it a backup plan.

437
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,431
[Barbara] Listen up.

438
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,309
Now to the real reason
I brought you all here.

439
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,398
I want you to agree to an immediate truce.

440
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,733
[all snickering]

441
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,320
And what if instead, we shoot you
and take your club?

442
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,864
I don't think so.

443
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,492
See, those drinks I just gave you?

444
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,785
They're poisoned.

445
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,622
And you had two shots before
everyone got here.

446
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,166
So that should be taking effect around...

447
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,793
[choking]

448
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,758
Now.

449
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,304
The rest of you have 48 hours
before you'll need the antidote,

450
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,849
which I will deliver to you,
provided you go back to your territories,

451
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,768
play nice, and send me all your guns.
Deal?

452
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,772
I said, deal?

453
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,316
[mumbling in agreement]

454
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,900
Now get out of here!

455
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,740
[Penguin] Hmm.

456
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,658
Jim will be so pleased.

457
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,870
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

458
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,372
Isn't that right, Pengy?

459
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,096
Once I reverse the system,

460
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,682
all the toxin we pulled from the river
will be re-released,

461
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,976
and the overload
should destroy the filters.

462
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,522
In a matter of minutes,
the entire facility will be inoperable.

463

[alarm buzzing]

464
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,151
Perfect.

465
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,904
Ivy's gonna be so happy.

466
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,655
You think so?

468
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,827

[Bruce] Selina.

470
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,009
I'll take care of her.

471
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,886
Okay.

00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,806
All right, listen up.

I know you're probably familiar
with Ivy Pepper.

474
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,939
In fact, you were probably here when she
hypnotized the whole freaking precinct.

475
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,941
Okay? She is on the loose,

476
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,610
and we've got to find her
and take her down.

477
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,738
Actually, fellas, she's already here.

478
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,372
That's right. Ivy came to free me.

479
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,958
That is true love for you.

480
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,796
She really understands what makes me tick.

481
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,005
Don't worry, though.

-[officer screams]
-I'm just a distraction

483
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,343

You know, that's how great couples work.

Oh, well.

00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,061
To return to what it was,

532
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,732
before people ripped down the trees
and paved over the earth.

533
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,943
He's trying to reunify with the mainland
to save all these people.

534
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,278
A return to filth.

535
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,280
Pollution.

536
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,032
He's fighting for death.

537
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,618
While I promise life

538
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,995
in its purest form.

539
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,958
[shrieks] Is that your plan?

540
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,377
To have the plants take over Gotham
by killing Jim?

541
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,504
Killing Gordon's just the first part.

542
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,424
Bruce Wayne is taking care of the rest.

543
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,677
-For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
-For what?

544
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,347
[gasps]

545
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,687
This pain is nothing

546
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,148
compared to what you are about to feel.

547
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,986
Say goodbye to Jim Gordon for me.

548
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,864
No, no, no! No!

549
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,201
Jim!

550
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,541
Selina, you're wasting your time.

551
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,628
Bruce, you have to snap out
of Ivy's spell. This is not you.

552
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,005
You're wrong. Ivy's given me a purpose.

553
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,215
[Selina grunts]

554
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,759
Stop! Stop! I don't wanna fight you.

555
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,012
What are you gonna do?
Kill everything in Gotham?

556
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,431
The toxins will only kill all the people.

557
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,266
The plants will adapt. They always do.

558
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,851
Can you hear what that sounds like?

559
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,520
Yeah. It sounds great!

560
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,729
[grunts]

561
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,275
[coughs]

562
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,198
[breathing heavily] I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

563
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,826
You don't care about Gotham.
You're gonna leave anyway.

564
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,497
What about the rest of us, huh?

565
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,542
The ones who are gonna be
stuck here without you?

566
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,751
Selina.

567
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,337
[both panting]

568
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,590
Selina, I'm okay.

569
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,967
Bruce, I'm so sorry.

570
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,928
-We gotta stop Lucius. Come on.
-Okay.

571
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,725
Lucius, you have to stop the shutdown.

572
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,854
Oh, no, I can't do that.

573
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,439
Ivy would be so mad.

574
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,984
Listen to me.
I used Ivy's perfume to hypnotize you.

575
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,445
-She's using you.
-No!

576
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,364
Ivy would never do that.

577
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,450
We're perfectly bonded,

578
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,370
like carbon and oxygen,
or hydrogen and oxygen.

579
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,289
We do not have time for this.

580
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,457
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,209
[grunts]

582
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,213
There.

583
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,758
-Ugh, you kicked me in the head!
-I didn't have a choice, Lucius.

584
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,468
Bruce, where's Ivy?

585
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,140
She was headed to the GCPD.

586
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,771
I wonder what Ivy's doing right now.

587
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,607
[Harvey] Hey, lover boy.

588
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,987
Are you serious right now?

589
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,655
[Harvey] As a heart attack.

590
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,872
[laughing fiendishly]

591
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,831
What an idiot.

592
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,793
-[Harvey yells]
-Oh...

593
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,048
[Harvey grunts]

594
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,844
[exhales] Oh, that felt good.

595
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,098
[Lee] Come on, Jim! You fight for
everyone else, you never give up.

596
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,933
Fight for yourself, Jim. Come on.

597
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,108
[thunder cracking]

598
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,665
It's time.

599
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,682
[Lee] Jim.

600
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,482
[Gordon] Lee.

601
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,069
-Is that...
-Yes.

602
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,906
Do you wanna...

603
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,288
I don't know.

604
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,958
I don't know that I can.

605
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,295
Oh, I see.

606
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,297
No!

607
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,423
Goodbye, Jim.

608
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,967
No, I wanna live! I wanna live!

609
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,178
I wanna live!

610
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,137
It's too late.

611
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,890
No, I wanna live!

612
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,145
[baby crying]

613
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,938
[gasps]

614
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,819
-Lee...
-[Lee] Don't move.

615
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,529
Don't move.

616
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,240
How do you feel?

617
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,743
Like I almost died.

618
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,871
Well, you didn't.

619
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,416
-You're fine. You came back to me.
-'Cause I need you.

620
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,588
Lee, this child...

621
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,797
It's okay.

622
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,300
It's okay to be scared.

623
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,890
The only thing scarier than doing this
is doing it without you.

624
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,979
Can I ask you something?

625
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,362
[inaudible]

626
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,552
-[Bruce] He seems nervous.
-[Selina] I know.

627
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,304
He should be thrilled.

628
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,600
Marrying a woman who's smarter
and better looking than him.

629
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,022
Selina, while we were fighting,

630
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,400
when I was hypnotized,
you talked about me leaving Gotham--

631
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,401
Quiet.

632
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,486
Here she comes.

633
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,887
You may sit.

634
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,180
[chuckles]

635
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,229
I'm just gonna say, this isn't gonna be
some long, drawn-out tearful affair

636
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,439
like you all are used to. Okay?

637
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,816
This is gonna be a short wedding.
I'm gonna try and make it quick,

638
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,527
-so we can all get to the bar. Okay?
-[all laughing]

639
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,699
I first met a young Jim Gordon when he was

640
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,745
a pain in the ass, moralistic
rookie detective.

641
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,121
[Lee chuckles]

642
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,415
In the years since, he'e evolved into

643
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,335
a pain in the ass, moralistic captain.

644
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,586
[Gordon chuckles]

645
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,297
[Harvey] I'd say he's my best friend.

646
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,258
But in truth, he's my only friend.

647
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,554
So we'll skip that.

648
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,390
Uh, on to Lee.

649
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,768
Lee's always had his back.

650
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,813
Except for the time when she was infected
with the crazy-making virus

651
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,732
and she tried to kill him.

652
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,858
But that's love.

653
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,443
[laughing]

654
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,778
[Harvey] But I will say,

655
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,158
if there's one beautiful thing that's
happened over these last few crazy years,

656
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,995
it's that these two people met each other.

657
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,999
And that truly is a beautiful thing.

658
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,711
Jim, will you please take Lee's hand?

659
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,923
[clears throat]

660
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,760
Do you, Jim Gordon,
take Lee Thompkins to be

661
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,512
your lawfully wedded wife,

662
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,389
to have and to hold,

663
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,349
from this day forward,

664
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,434
for better, for worse,

665
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,686
for richer, for poorer,

666
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,232
in sickness and in health,

667
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,902
to love and cherish
till death do you part?

668
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,279
I do.

669
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,034
And you, Lee Thompkins?
Do you do the same?

670
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,620
Sure, Harvey.

671
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,872
I do.

672
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,752
By the power vested in me

673
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,131
by absolutely no one,

674
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,090
[people laughing]

675
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:31,053
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

676
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,472
[cheering]

677
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,453
What?

678
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,059
And now Jim Gordon and Lee Thompkins

679
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,353
are man and wife.

680
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:28,569
Thank God you held this city together so
that this blessed event could take place.

681
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,199
It was never gonna work.

682
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:35,993
What?

683
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,704
Controlling the gangs
was not a backup plan.

684
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:44,043
You saw a chance to convince James Gordon
that you had changed.

685
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,547
But he will never see you as anything

686
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,218
but a dangerous woman
keeping his child from him.

687
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,263
Then I'd best be long gone before
he can do anything about it.

688
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,686
He will hunt you
till the ends of the earth.

689
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,938
[snickers]

690
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,526
Let him.
