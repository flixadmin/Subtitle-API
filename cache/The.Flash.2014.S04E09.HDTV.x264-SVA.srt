1
00:00:00,072 --> 00:00:01,460
Previously on "The Flash."

2
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:03,601
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,243
I think it's time you
introduced these guys

4
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:06,726
to your mean roommate.

5
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:08,281
Tell Amunet I'm done.

6
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,242
Nobody walks away from me, Frost.

7
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,879
So you think DeVoe and his
wife are super villains?

8
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:14,848
Who are you really?

9
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:17,585
I was born on the same evening you were.

10
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:20,520
I know every answer to
every question ever asked.

11
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:21,789
Incredible!

12
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:22,718
Clifford!

13
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:24,088
Your body's deteriorating

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,570
faster than the chair can handle.

15
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:27,340
It will survive long enough.

16
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:36,577
What are you doing?

17
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,046
Tinsel.

18
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:41,249
Your tinsel to surface
ratio is terrible.

19
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,583
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

20
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,127
I've done extensive research

21
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,771
to make sure that this tinsel

22
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:47,361
is properly proportioned for the tree.

23
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:48,885
- It's terrible.
- It's terrible?

24
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,224
- I'll tell you what's terrible.
- What?

25
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:51,926
Your Scrooge to Grinch
ratio is terrible.

26
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,292
You're a mean one. I wouldn't touch you

27
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:54,673
with a 39 1/2-foot pole.

28
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:56,247
- Haven't heard that one before.
- Yeah.

29
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,132
Hey, Cisco, where's Gypsy?

30
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:00,276
She had to work the holiday shift.

31
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,346
But I think I got her the perfect gift.

32
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:05,306
A Gulag-class mech knife
forged in the unholy

33
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,174
blood fires of Earth-22
by none other than...

34
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:10,026
West 2.0.

35
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:13,330
Of course, Gypsy should have
sent something for me by now.

36
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,384
Awkward. I'm sure it's fine.

37
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,019
Yikes. Did, uh, Rudolph just

38
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,121
- diarrhea all over your tree?
- Cool, cool.

39
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,023
Two humbugs. It's a Festivus miracle.

40
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,961
No, don't get me wrong.
Ralphie loves Christmas.

41
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,698
I ring in every holiday
season with my nana.

42
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:26,654
She never remembers me,

43
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:28,529
but I am getting that inheritance.

44
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,232
- You are just incorrect.
- Well, if you don't want

45
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,800
to spend Christmas conning your grandma,

46
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,535
you're more than welcome
to join your friends

47
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:37,205
at the West family party.

48
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,114
Extremely obvious. I saw that.

49
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:41,284
And by the way, that
sounds like a snoozefest.

50
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:45,179
Unless, of course, you're
serving baking soda.

51
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,349
Baking soda!

52
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:50,752
Wha... Uh, sorry, what's that about?

53
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:53,588
Uh, well, it's a...
Bit of an inside joke

54
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,256
actually concerning Killer Frost.

55
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,024
- Classic Killer Frost.
- Mmm-hmm.

56
00:01:57,026 --> 00:02:00,184
You guys were hanging
out with Killer Frost?

57
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,521
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,558
Yeah.

59
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,534
- I hope you had a great time.
- Oh, we had the best time.

60
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,035
I mean, you're great, Snowcone.

61
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:10,037
But my girl Frostbite, ai yi yi.

62
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,673
- Ah, ah.
- Come on.

63
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,042
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

64
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,677
Caitlin!

65
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,379
Hey, if you see my girl K-Frost later,

66
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:21,048
tell her what I said
about the baking soda!

67
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,383
Dibny!

68
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,919
Too much?

69
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:29,790
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

70
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:34,595
Okay, from Oliver and Felicity.

71
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:38,933
We have an espresso machine. All right.

72
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:40,768
Okay. Not on the registry,

73
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,437
but I guess getting
married during our wedding

74
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,407
wasn't on the registry,
either. So, yeah, sure.

75
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,242
- I'm not bitter.
- I'll put this

76
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:49,710
in the return pile.

77
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,096
Well, I guess that's everything.

78
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,749
No, we got one more. There's no card.

79
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:57,919
Um...

80
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:01,022
Great. It's another set of knives.

81
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:03,885
It's not even a full
set. Yeah, it's one knife.

82
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:05,793
- That's just shoddy gifting.
- Let me see.

83
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,529
I'm gonna clean up.

84
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,744
So, what, so no speed cleaning today?

85
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,804
No, we're not in a rush.

86
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:19,807
Barry, you barely used
your powers in Bali, either.

87
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,676
I mean, not even to
put on suntan lotion.

88
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:25,846
- It was a spray-on bottle.
- What is going on, Bar?

89
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:27,015
Nothing.

90
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,971
I mean, I don't know. I
have been thinking recently

91
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:34,021
that, you know, when
I first got my powers,

92
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,390
I would use any excuse to use them.

93
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:37,858
It would just be me and the road,

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,494
and everything around
me would disappear.

95
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,996
It's like the first time in my life

96
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:45,666
I really felt like I was at peace.

97
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:50,104
I just feel like that all the time now.

98
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,706
I don't have to run when I'm with you.

99
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:57,111
Aww. That's so sweet.

100
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,349
I love you, Iris West Allen.

101
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:03,551
I love you, too.

102
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,451
Let me.

103
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:30,578
The atrophy of my fine
motor skills is accelerating.

104
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,346
I'm so sorry, my love.

105
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:36,584
Oh, the pain is but fleeting.

106
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:40,688
- After all, today is the day.
- How fitting.

107
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,391
You'll share a birthday
with the Messiah.

108
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:48,729
The Nazarene wasn't born until spring.

109
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:51,599
You can check the constellation
patterns to verify that.

110
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:59,273
Oh, you've heard this
lecture before, haven't you?

111
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,309
Maybe. But I will never grow tired

112
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:03,711
of hearing your voice.

113
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:10,299
The words are still mine.
Even if the voice isn't.

114
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:17,558
- Do you have any doubts?
- No.

115
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,693
Of course not.

116
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,598
It will just take some getting used to.

117
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:37,812
Don't be afraid, my love.

118
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:40,681
This is the great work.

119
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:45,820
I swear I will stand
beside you in no time.

120
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:57,231
Hoho-ho!

121
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:06,774
Well, it's the dark
roast? The light roast?

122
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,577
What are you having,
the self pity roast?

123
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,445
I wish.

124
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:17,284
- Oh, the Killer Frost.
- Finally got a drink, woo hoo.

125
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:19,653
I'm thrilled that she helped
everybody fight the Reichsmen,

126
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,622
but now it's like I can't escape her.

127
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,824
Everybody keeps saying,
"Killer Frost is so funny."

128
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:26,227
"Killer Frost is so badass."
I spent so long worried

129
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,729
that she was gonna hurt people, but now,

130
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,331
turns out people would rather hang out

131
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,433
with my villainous alter ego.

132
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:35,202
Look, I... I get it.
I know what it's like

133
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:38,639
to have the evil doppelganger.
But you're not like me anyway.

134
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:42,843
No, you're different. You're... special.

135
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:46,380
And your friends would much rather

136
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:49,483
be with you than with her.

137
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:50,885
- Thanks, Harry.
- You're welcome.

138
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,401
Ho, ho, ho.

139
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,872
This is, like, a lifetime
supply of store credit.

140
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:14,308
Why would Rory think that
we needed 40 toasters?

141
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,185
He said that there was
some kind of fire sale.

142
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,034
- He stole them.
- He definitely stole them.

143
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:19,880
Yeah.

144
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,154
Barry!

145
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,661
- Caity!
- That's Amunet.

146
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:36,096
Hide, hide, hide!

147
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,734
- Ooh!
- I blocked your glock.

148
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:46,373
Hello, Iris. My deepest congratulations

149
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,408
on your wedding.

150
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,888
No, no, dear.

151
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,893
Frosty melted away.
I've come for you, Caity.

152
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:10,097
- You okay?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,233
I'll be right back.

154
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,811
Barry!

155
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,471
DeVoe. He attacked us on the street.

156
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,341
- He took Barry.
- What?

157
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,578
- Are you kidding me?
- What happened to you?

158
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,633
Amunet Black abducted Caitlin.

159
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:36,527
Two people go missing

160
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,601
at the same time. That's
quite a coinkie-dink.

161
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,381
Yeah, that's a great
observation, Captain Obvious.

162
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:41,783
Can you set the satellite to look

163
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,284
for Caitlin's cryokinetic energy

164
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:44,919
or Barry's Speed Force signatures?

165
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:46,654
No, no, we've gotta
look for both of them.

166
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,090
Cisco, I need you to vibe Barry.

167
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:52,160
I need to know that he's alive.

168
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,200
Holy poltergeist!

169
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:02,670
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just not gonna

170
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,211
- be vibing again for a while.
- What about Allen?

171
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:09,377
Wherever he is, I've never experienced

172
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,014
anything like it.

173
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,368
Hello?

174
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:00,829
Here we are.

175
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,363
Really moving up in the world.

176
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:06,201
You know, a sprinkle of enthusiasm

177
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:08,012
- would not kill you.
- Listen, Amunet,

178
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,637
whatever it is you have planned,

179
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,940
I guarantee you Killer Frost
wants nothing to do with it.

180
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:14,042
So right, darling. I don't need her.

181
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,410
I need you.

182
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,951
- Meet your patient.
- What have you done?

183
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:25,353
Oh, there's no need to be over dramatic.

184
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:27,856
He's alive. And I'm sure he'd be happy

185
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:31,659
to meet you just as soon as
that tranquilizer wears off.

186
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:33,728
Why do you have him? What is he to you?

187
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,331
My golden goose. You see,

188
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:41,536
Dominic here is a delightful
new meta that I... found.

189
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:43,338
And I'd intended on selling him,

190
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,707
but unfortunately he did
not want to go so gently

191
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,828
into the good night. And, um...

192
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,581
- I shot him.
- Uh, he's...

193
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,183
In desperate need of medical attention.

194
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,551
I know. And now you know

195
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:58,519
why I need you, Caity, M.D.

196
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:01,022
You're talking about an
intricate cranial foreign body

197
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,558
retraction at best. At
worst that's an endoscopic...

198
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,426
I'm gonna stop you there,
'cause I've absolutely

199
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,795
no idea what you're saying. But you see,

200
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,265
it does not matter,
because I knew that you

201
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,600
would understand what needed to happen.

202
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:17,203
Amunet, I won't. I can't.

203
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,640
This environment isn't sterilized.

204
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:20,708
The equipment is ancient.

205
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:26,090
I suppose I could just
yank it out myself.

206
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,482
And risk him bleeding out,

207
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:29,417
or a dozen other brain deficits.

208
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:32,520
Right. Good point.

209
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:34,489
Well, there's only one way to find out.

210
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:36,190
No, no.

211
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,529
I'll do what I can.

212
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:42,964
Excellent.

213
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:48,202
Oh, I almost forgot.

214
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:51,840
Should he die, you die as well.

215
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:57,465
This Killer Frost iced
mocha is really delicious.

216
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,558
Hello, Mr. Allen.

217
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:24,405
Not exactly S.T.A.R. Labs.

218
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,446
- Who are you?
- My name is Caitlin Snow,

219
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:32,914
and you're in St. Andrew's Hospital.

220
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,649
At least, I think that's where we are.

221
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:36,884
This place has been
closed down for a while.

222
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,320
Please, you have to
help me get outta here.

223
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,923
- Easier said than done.
- That blonde lady?

224
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:45,593
She took you, too?

225
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,396
God, I don't understand
why this is happening to us.

226
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:51,332
Dominic, do you know
what a meta human is?

227
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,668
Listen, I... I didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,269
I didn't rob a bank or something.

229
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,271
No, I know. People with abilities...

230
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:00,274
People like you... They're a commodity.

231
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:04,245
- Especially...
- Especially to Amunet.

232
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,647
Yeah.

233
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,950
Listen, I'm gonna be honest with you.

234
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:12,153
It would be very difficult
to fix what she did to you,

235
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,755
even under the best of circumstances

236
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:15,456
with the right equipment.

237
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,817
But I feel fine. My
head doesn't even hurt.

238
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,828
Which is a minor
miracle. But if that shard

239
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,739
- were to fracture...
- It could cause permanent

240
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,233
motor skills and
parallel brain deficits.

241
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,638
How did you...

242
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,207
You have telepathic abilities.

243
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,243
Can you hear what I'm
thinking right now?

244
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,980
When did I get my powers?

245
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,648
A couple months ago.

246
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,352
Uh, I took the bus to
my job at the airport.

247
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:46,421
TSA. But when I got there,

248
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:49,891
it was like everyone was
yelling at me screaming mad.

249
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:52,026
But their mouths weren't moving.

250
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:56,230
It only works when I'm
close enough to see someone.

251
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:59,567
You don't think we're
getting out of here?

252
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,535
I'm gonna do everything
I can to fix you,

253
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,239
but I can't get you away from her.

254
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:06,207
Not on my own.

255
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,044
Caitlin. I'm scared, too.

256
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,384
Wow. What an entrance.

257
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:21,289
So, where are we?
This is your sanctuary?

258
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,658
What gave that away?

259
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,460
DeVoe, if you wanted to kill me,

260
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,695
you could have just
electrocuted me on the street.

261
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:32,200
- So I'm here for a reason.
- Yes, Mr. Allen.

262
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,902
So that I may teach
you. I am, after all,

263
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:36,838
first and foremost, a teacher.

264
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,907
Oh, God.

265
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:44,712
All right. Fine.

266
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:47,081
Teach me. But first I wanna make sure

267
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,017
I'm all caught up.
You sent your Samuroid

268
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,455
after me. You arranged to pull me

269
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,624
out of the Speed Force.

270
00:14:56,626 --> 00:15:01,059
You made sure that we turned
all those people on that bus

271
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:04,599
into meta humans. Why?

272
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:07,268
You see, the finer points of my agenda

273
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,137
is not part of today's syllabus.

274
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,471
Oh, come on. We can squeeze it in.

275
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:13,074
- I'm a fast learner.
- Please.

276
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:15,176
You're about as capable
of seeing the breadth

277
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,078
of my machinations as an infant

278
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,621
mastering multivariable physics.

279
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:25,520
The lesson I have prepped
for today is much more simple.

280
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:28,189
Life 101.

281
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:31,792
There are no happy endings.

282
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:34,362
Oh.

283
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,563
We have a guest.

284
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,806
- DeVoe?
- You should learn to lose

285
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,409
every once in a while, Bar.

286
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,345
A little humility will prepare
you for what lies ahead.

287
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:54,248
Now, if you will excuse me.

288
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,450
DeVoe!

289
00:15:56,452 --> 00:16:00,354
If you hurt him... If
you put a hand on him...

290
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:01,889
DeVoe!

291
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:03,109
DeVoe!

292
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,607
It's open.

293
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,513
Good evening, detective West.

294
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:15,549
Something tells me you're
not here for more of my wife's

295
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:18,952
- world-famous lemonade.
- Where's my son?

296
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,321
Mr. Allen, has he gone missing?

297
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:23,357
He's not missing. He was taken.

298
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,726
By someone I am eager to meet.

299
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:28,972
Thinly veiled threats aside, Mr. West,

300
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:31,932
I'm afraid I have not a clue
as to Barry Allen's location.

301
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,802
I do know, however, that
your colleague is located

302
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:38,372
behind my front porch
carrying an ionic sub-repeating

303
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:42,776
pulse firearm.

304
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:45,479
The bird bath has a much
better vantage point.

305
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:48,082
A smart man would have
taken up position there.

306
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,184
A smarter man would
understand that this gun

307
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:52,319
has no safety, and my finger is still

308
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:56,023
on the trigger.

309
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:57,825
Is there something you find funny?

310
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,294
Well, it has occurred to
me that there is an amusing

311
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:03,430
irony at play. You being
a detective and all,

312
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,933
yet you fail to acknowledge
the most basic result

313
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:10,104
- in missing children cases.
- And what would that be?

314
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:13,807
Well, perhaps your son just ran away.

315
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,542
- Don't.
- Now, I do have

316
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:17,811
a restraining order against your son.

317
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:19,313
Shall I add you to the list?

318
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:20,652
If something happened to Barry,

319
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,403
there ain't a restraining order on Earth

320
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,831
that would keep me from getting you.

321
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,519
I'm coming back with a search warrant.

322
00:17:26,522 --> 00:17:28,589
Completely unnecessary, Detective.

323
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:32,326
If you desire to search my abode,

324
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,961
by all means.

325
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,205
You're not as smart as you think.

326
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:46,306
Yes, I am.

327
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:57,751
Come on!

328
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:00,320
You're only hurting yourself.

329
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:04,324
Running faster than sound,
vibrating through walls,

330
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:06,426
even throwing lightning.

331
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:08,461
None of that can destroy this barrier.

332
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,869
You know a lot about my abilities.

333
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,672
Is that why I'm here?

334
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,031
DeVoe wants my powers?

335
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,946
You don't have to do this.

336
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:28,749
Whatever he has planned,
you don't have to help him.

337
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:32,352
A helper? Is that what you think I am?

338
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:35,889
A mindless minion carrying
out her master's bidding?

339
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:38,992
- Some sort of evil secretary?
- You tell me.

340
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,727
No, Mr. Allen.

341
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:46,700
I am now and forever will
be my husband's partner.

342
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,804
I understand that.

343
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,539
You're not the only one who promised

344
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,842
to stand by your loved one
for better or for worse.

345
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:58,412
In sickness and in health.

346
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:00,380
If you go down this path with DeVoe,

347
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:02,816
can't you see that you
risk sacrificing everything

348
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:04,751
that you have together?

349
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:07,654
- Your entire marriage?
- You're missing the point.

350
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:10,657
I am willing to sacrifice
everything for my marriage.

351
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,379
I'd ask if you could do the same,

352
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:14,294
but there's no need.

353
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:17,130
My husband already knows.

354
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:19,600
His body may be human,

355
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,935
but his brain is smarter than yours.

356
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:35,782
- Sark me!
- What happened?

357
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:37,684
Well, the satellite's trying to search

358
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:39,086
for Barry's Speed Force energy

359
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,926
and Caitlin's cryokinetic signature,

360
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,690
so the bandwidth
limiters are overheating.

361
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:46,026
Well, that's what you get
when you rely on machines

362
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,761
rather than a master private eye.

363
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:49,463
I've had a ton of missing person cases.

364
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:50,875
There was this wife once.

365
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,145
Turns out she faked her own death.

366
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,968
She was just living in Arizona.

367
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,569
Are you saying Barry faked his own death

368
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,137
and moved to Arizona?

369
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:00,140
- Well... no.
- Well, then shut up.

370
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,676
Oh, boy.

371
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,378
Tell me you got something.

372
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,779
Got nothing.

373
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:07,214
Searched the DeVoe house thoroughly.

374
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:08,982
It's clean. Your father's gone

375
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:11,551
to check the scene from
where Barry was taken.

376
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:13,257
You know, there was
this other case once.

377
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,559
Woman couldn't find her husband.

378
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,156
Turns out she just had amnesia.

379
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,791
He was home. She just
didn't recognize him.

380
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,950
And I still got paid. Twice.

381
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,163
Ralph. Please.

382
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,992
Shut. Up.

383
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:29,143
You got something you
wanna say to me, Ramon?

384
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,803
Yeah.

385
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:33,106
Yeah, I got something to
say to you, Ralphie boy.

386
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,865
Caitlin's been kidnapped.

387
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,777
Of course, she wouldn't
have been at Jitters

388
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,378
in the first place if you hadn't acted

389
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,480
like such a jackass
today, but of course,

390
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:43,150
in true Ralph Dibny
fashion, you drove her away

391
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:45,052
- with your fat mouth!
- Maybe I should have

392
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:46,794
turned my hand into a fat fist.

393
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:47,920
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh, yeah?

394
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:49,656
Guys, cool it.

395
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,458
Listen, the people
we love are in danger,

396
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,560
and you can't get it together?

397
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:54,928
Really?

398
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,664
Whatever.

399
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,066
I'll be in my lab.

400
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:04,171
And I will be in whatever
room is farthest from that.

401
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:05,639
Speed lab.

402
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,979
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

403
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,447
What is wrong with those two?

404
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:14,815
You.

405
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,353
Excuse me?

406
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:20,954
You know what's wrong.

407
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:22,889
You're the team leader.

408
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,392
Team leader's supposed
to make the tough call.

409
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:26,677
I made a call.

410
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,244
I said we would look for both of them.

411
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,263
No. Looking for both of them

412
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:32,466
is not a choice. We're
overtaxing our resources,

413
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:34,034
our people, because you won't face

414
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,669
the hard truth. And the hard truth is,

415
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,371
we can't look for both.

416
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,340
We can only look for one.

417
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,676
Harry,

418
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:46,179
I just made a vow to
love and protect Barry.

419
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,781
To stand by him through thick and thin.

420
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:49,316
And now you're asking me to choose

421
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:52,386
between my husband's
life and my friend's?

422
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:54,018
I can't. I... I can't do that.

423
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,023
You have to.

424
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:58,025
Or we risk losing them both.

425
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:02,129
You have to choose.

426
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,109
Damn it.

427
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,714
Who's Killer Frost?

428
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,517
Sorry, she's just on your mind a lot.

429
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,753
With a lot of cursing.

430
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:30,190
She is my meta power.

431
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,557
Whenever I get scared
or angry, she takes over.

432
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,263
She is violent and
dangerous and unpredictable,

433
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:39,416
but she's a whole lot
more useful than I am.

434
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,435
No, thanks.

435
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:43,980
I'm already scared to death
of one psychotic woman.

436
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,916
I'll take my chances with you.

437
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,944
Dominic, I'm sorry.
It's too risky to perform

438
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,380
this surgery here. And
I don't have any powers

439
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,415
to save us.

440
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,150
But you do.

441
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:15,335
Take a right.

442
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:17,671
Caitlin, get back.

443
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:38,738
Somebody's made my naughty list.

444
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:49,396
Gentlemen, can you
please take Dominic in?

445
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,315
I need to have a word
with Caity in private.

446
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:57,406
Thank you.

447
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:03,945
Why can't you just appreciate
how nice I've been to you?

448
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,013
I don't think you understand
the meaning of the word nice.

449
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,748
Now, now. It's not about words.

450
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,085
It's about actions. And
I have not stabbed you

451
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:15,923
or punched you or shot a deadly
piece of metal at you once.

452
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,225
Today.

453
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:21,395
So why did you run away from me?

454
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:24,932
Tried. Tried and failed.

455
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,934
Killer Frost would
have been able to do it.

456
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:31,238
Ah.

457
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,107
I see.

458
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,477
Caity, do you know what I
was doing before I became

459
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:40,815
the successful entrepreneur
you see before you today?

460
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,050
Mean British nanny?

461
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,685
Hmm. No.

462
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:48,456
I was a stewardess.

463
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,358
You see, unlike you,
I did not have fancy

464
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,927
scientists for parents. I
did not collect scholarships

465
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:57,798
or attend fine institutions.
My career options were...

466
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,167
Limited.

467
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:02,349
So I spent my days in
a quaint little skirt

468
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:04,438
in there serving
coffee to handsy pilots,

469
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,141
powerless to stop them.

470
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:10,811
But then the particle
accelerator exploded.

471
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:14,782
And I was powerless no more.

472
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:21,522
I showed those pilots
the error of their ways.

473
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:28,562
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because.

474
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:31,654
Obtaining my powers was quite
literally what made me me.

475
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,291
But the same cannot be said about you.

476
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:36,437
There are any number of
doctors I could have come to

477
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,805
for this procedure. I did not.

478
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:39,273
I came to you. Because you,

479
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:43,021
Caitlin Snow, are and have always been

480
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:45,279
remarkable.

481
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,185
You are bright. Resourceful.

482
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:55,022
Resilient. And I am more than certain

483
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:56,724
you can do this.

484
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:02,096
So, with that said,
unless you want to spend

485
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:03,731
the rest of your medical
career in the morgue,

486
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,800
I suggest you buck up, darling.

487
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:09,970
You know, pull on your big girl
pants and do the bloody thing.

488
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:16,510
Find Caitlin and Barry.

489
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:19,447
Come on, you bum! Do it!

490
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:20,815
Do it!

491
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:23,350
Are you yelling at my satellite?

492
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:25,619
No, I was just encouraging it.

493
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:28,756
Although Sally here clearly
doesn't wanna be encouraged.

494
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,005
Okay. One, her name isn't Sally.

495
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,160
Two...

496
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,031
I'm sorry. Barry and Caitlin.

497
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:40,901
We've lost them both before,
and it just feels like

498
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:43,070
we just got them back.

499
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,974
- Well, sorry I was a dick.
- You weren't a dick.

500
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:50,344
I'm the dick. Private and public.

501
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:52,980
You were just being
honest. If it wasn't for me,

502
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:55,349
Caitlin would be right here
with you, me, and Sally.

503
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,884
- Not Sally.
- The truth is,

504
00:26:56,886 --> 00:27:00,435
I... haven't had friends in a while.

505
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,256
I'm sure you find that hard to believe,

506
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,119
given my good looks
and winning personality.

507
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,529
- Mmm-hmm.
- But I'm out of practice.

508
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:11,232
I suck at being a friend.

509
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:14,075
Now Christmas is ruined.
Everyone is kidnapped.

510
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:18,873
And it's all my fault. You're here.

511
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,908
And you're helping.

512
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:28,349
Caitlin's in a vulnerable
state right now.

513
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:30,104
And Barry can take care of himself.

514
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:36,590
So let's turn off the
Speed Force satellite.

515
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:38,993
We're going after Caitlin.

516
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:40,895
We're on it.

517
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,696
Let's go get our girl.

518
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:48,402
I used some equipment that
I found in the basement

519
00:27:48,404 --> 00:27:52,306
to jerry-rig and MRI machine
so that I don't hit an artery.

520
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:54,742
Now that's ingenuity.
You know, I knew you were

521
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,577
the right doctor to kidnap.

522
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:58,412
This is a very delicate procedure.

523
00:27:58,414 --> 00:28:00,047
Do you mind giving me some space?

524
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,383
Right, sorry. I'll just, um...

525
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:04,485
I'm gonna leave this right here.

526
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:07,755
You know, medical insurance and all.

527
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:08,889
Great.

528
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,525
- Ready?
- I trust you.

529
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,100
Now I need you to hold still.

530
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:27,308
You might feel some pressure.

531
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:35,049
Extracting the foreign object.

532
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,594
Foreign object extracted.

533
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,762
Applying some surgical glue.

534
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,668
- He's going into shock.
- So unshock him!

535
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,971
I don't know if I can.

536
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:04,947
That is not the rhythmic tune

537
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,541
of a steady heartbeat!

538
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:08,410
I need to hear a "beep,
beep, beep," dearie,

539
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,205
or Dominic won't be the
only flatliner in the room.

540
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:16,618
Oh.

541
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:20,922
Oh, you're good.

542
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,561
We're clear.

543
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:29,431
They're all out?

544
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,099
40 PSI of inhalation anesthetic?

545
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:32,729
That'll keep them out, but not for long.

546
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:33,935
Let's go.

547
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,599
The satellite's pinging

548
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:38,773
Caitlin's latent cryokinetic signature.

549
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:39,774
Where is she?

550
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:43,077
East wing of St. Alexander Hospital.

551
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,646
That place has been closed for years.

552
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:46,614
We'll breach over. You got your suit?

553
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:48,116
Never leave home without it.

554
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:51,453
Caitlin!

555
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:56,393
Damn it! I was aiming for your head.

556
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,935
So pointy!

557
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,437
That is not very nice, lady.

558
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:14,909
Are you a time traveler?
'Cause those white girl dreads

559
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,494
came straight from the '90s.

560
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,455
Yeah, what he said.

561
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:29,316
Although, if you wanna
give me your phone number,

562
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:31,326
we could Netflix and chill, or...

563
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:42,136
Impossible.

564
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:44,506
Well, that's the thing.

565
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:45,940
I am the impossible.

566
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:52,213
We built that cell so you
couldn't run your way out.

567
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,183
I didn't run. Just stood still.

568
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:57,652
- Really fast.
- You vibrated faster

569
00:30:57,654 --> 00:31:00,355
- than the eye can process.
- Like your wife said,

570
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,268
your brain may be smarter than mine,

571
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:05,560
but your body is still human.

572
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:09,397
It's over, DeVoe. Far
from it, Mr. Allen.

573
00:32:01,482 --> 00:32:04,351
Flotation mode activated.

574
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:20,201
Life raft was a good call, Cisco.

575
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:33,482
Barry!

576
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,497
- There's no sign of DeVoe.
- The house is empty.

577
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,756
Facial recognition's not
picking up him or his wife.

578
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,142
So, what? He just drowned?

579
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:50,069
Or went back to wherever
he was holding Barry.

580
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:52,338
- Why do you think he took you?
- I'm not sure.

581
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,074
But I think that he's
interested in my powers.

582
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,243
Great. We got evil Mary Poppins

583
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:58,711
collecting metas, too.

584
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:00,546
Yeah, and Amunet won't back down.

585
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:02,181
Nothing like a lingering
threat to put us all

586
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:04,050
- in the Christmas spirit.
- Speaking of which,

587
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:06,386
with all this DeVoe stuff
and Cecile being out of town,

588
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:08,132
I didn't have a chance
to decorate the house.

589
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:10,256
If you guys still wanna do Christmas.

590
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,798
Yeah, of course. We
have a lot to celebrate.

591
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,455
Do you mind if I invite Dominic,

592
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,329
- that meta we just saved?
- The more the merrier.

593
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:17,664
Let's get some nog.

594
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,736
So everything worked out, huh?

595
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:26,139
Yeah, but what if it didn't?

596
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:30,109
What if he killed you because
of a decision that I made?

597
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:32,478
Honestly, Barry, I don't
know if I can keep doing this.

598
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,108
Wells told me about the tough
call you had to make yesterday.

599
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:38,718
You're gonna have to make
a lot more in the future.

600
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,453
But you made the right call.

601
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:42,021
I'm proud of you for making it.

602
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:45,591
So, what now?

603
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:48,272
Now we have ourselves a
merry little Christmas.

604
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:51,064
Let's go.

605
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,438
What the...

606
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,640
Wow.

607
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:01,952
Ho, ho, ho.

608
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:05,378
Oh, wait.

609
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,111
- Like a bowl full of jelly.
- Ralph, what is all this?

610
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,015
Well, Joe said he didn't
have any time to decorate,

611
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:16,789
and I wanted to do something
nice for my friends.

612
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,892
I realize that I don't usually
say or do the right thing.

613
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:22,228
So I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

614
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,631
Well, you... you really
went all out, Ralph.

615
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,533
- Thanks.
- Yeah, it looks great, man.

616
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:29,759
Thank you. Well, I'm glad you like it.

617
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:32,845
- Oh, wow.
- Uh, Caitlin.

618
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:35,408
Uh, it was wrong of me
to say that Killer Frost

619
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:40,646
is better than you.
Because the truth is...

620
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:43,916
- No one is better than you.
- Thank you.

621
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,618
And, I know. I'm the one who saved

622
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,165
- the day this time.
- You know, Cisco,

623
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,021
a gift came for you through
one of those death holes

624
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,524
- that you call a breach.
- Oh, well.

625
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,760
Looks like Gypsy came through, I guess.

626
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:55,862
- Um...
- Wait.

627
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:57,883
This is a break up cube.

628
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:59,775
I thought things were going
so well with you and Gypsy.

629
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:00,782
That makes two of us.

630
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:01,934
Ramon, that's not a break up cube.

631
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:03,184
You should open that when you're alone.

632
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,261
No, no, no, if she's gonna

633
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:05,925
break up with me, I wanna hear why.

634
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:07,194
No, Ramon, I wouldn't... Okay.

635
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,347
Cisco, somebody told me

636
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,766
you've been a very naughty

637
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:10,738
boy this year.

638
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,069
Why don't you come over
and jingle my bells, huh?

639
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:14,816
- Sweet baby Jesus.
- Wanna jingle my bells?

640
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:16,277
Told you, not a break up cube.

641
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,719
- And I promise...
- Use the same button to...

642
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:21,687
It's not gonna be a silent night.

643
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:25,291
- Joe, do you mind if I...
- Take that to your house.

644
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:26,830
Yeah.

645
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,466
No Wally?

646
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:29,635
He couldn't make it.

647
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:31,297
He still in Blue Valley?

648
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:32,565
Cambodia.

649
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,204
Dominic, I'm so glad you came.

650
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,939
Come on in. This is Joe.

651
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,974
Uh, thank you.

652
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:43,743
This house is...

653
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:46,112
- Bitchin'?
- Festive.

654
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:47,747
Thanks for the compliment, but, uh,

655
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,081
who the hell are you again?

656
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,340
He's the guy you just helped save.

657
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:52,008
Yeeh, a meta who can read your mind.

658
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:53,753
Oh, good. Then he
knows that I'm thinking

659
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:56,455
that there's only room for
one new guy in this group,

660
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,291
- and that's me.
- I'm not here to fight crime

661
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:01,561
or get a code name.
Just to brainstorm ideas

662
00:36:01,563 --> 00:36:03,095
about my powers.

663
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,808
I hereby christen thee "Brainstorm."

664
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,744
Oh, come on, man! I've
been here for months,

665
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:09,001
and I don't have a name yet.

666
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,406
- Uh-oh.
- What, what is it?

667
00:36:13,408 --> 00:36:15,675
Security at the loft.

668
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,877
Um, it's probably just
more gifts being delivered.

669
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:20,379
I'll be right back.

670
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,391
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Allen.

671
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,761
- Dominic?
- You really have

672
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:37,730
an acute sense of detection. And wit.

673
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:41,267
But like I said, Mr. Allen.
You are incapable of seeing

674
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:43,069
the breadth of my machinations.

675
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:47,406
DeVoe?

676
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:49,609
You really should have
listened to your teacher.

677
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:51,511
How is this possible?

678
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:13,566
I told you I have a very
important buyer, Dom.

679
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,937
- As promised.
- Always a pleasure

680
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,907
doing business with another savvy woman.

681
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,259
Please, don't do this to me.

682
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,828
I won't be doing anything to you.

683
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,335
Pleased to meet you, Dominic Lance.

684
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:52,004
Or should I say Subject Six?

685
00:37:57,412 --> 00:38:00,746
Oh, I have created many meta humans,

686
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:06,352
but only your unique
abilities allow me to do...

687
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,224
This.

688
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:55,067
You see, Mr. Allen, three
months ago you emerged

689
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,036
from the Speed Force a new man.

690
00:38:57,038 --> 00:39:00,139
And in order for you and the
world to experience my plan,

691
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,675
I, too, needed to be reborn.

692
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:04,477
If you hurt my family...

693
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:10,839
I have no interest in your family.

694
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:13,019
Besides, you're gonna
need someone to miss you

695
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:14,253
when you're gone.

696
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:15,521
What did you do?

697
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:18,658
I merely left something for you.

698
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,160
It's a re-gift, as it were.

699
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:24,997
I don't have need for it anymore.

700
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:48,687
Allen?

701
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,714
CCPD. Open up.

702
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:53,859
Open up in there.

703
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,661
Breach, breach, breach.

704
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,748
Don't run.

705
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,416
Move, move, move, move, move!

706
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,351
Keep your hands where
I can see them, Barry.

707
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:23,189
Check the corners!

708
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:26,277
Clear!

709
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:28,494
Clear.

710
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:36,635
Barry Allen, you're under
arrest for the murder

711
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,903
of Clifford DeVoe.

712
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:45,945
Excuse me. I have to go.

713
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:48,290
- But thank you so much.
- Of course.

714
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:49,699
Thank you for coming.

715
00:40:49,702 --> 00:40:51,672
- Merry Christmas to you all.
- Merry Christmas.

716
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,360
I told you I'd stand beside you.

717
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,950
Always.

718
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:27,553
Now let's bring about the enlightenment.

719
