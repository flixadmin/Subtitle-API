1
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:23,775
There’s no respect.
I couldn’t even grab the cigarettes.

2
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:28,780
I’m gonna shoot every fucking hostage
in the head. That’s right.

3
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,072
Who’s doing this?

4
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,951
Carrillo and Search Bloc,
I’m sure of it.

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,204
—In the middle of our negotiations?
—Either Gaviria is trying to catch me …

6
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:45,504
or Carrillo doesn’t give a shit
about the negotiations.

7
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,884
You know what we have to do, Pablo.
We have to close the deal fast …

8
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,219
before they find us and kill us.

9
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,642
Not before we build our own jail.

10
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:03,272
And that fucking pussy president
will have to agree to that,

11
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,233
even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass.

12
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:10,237
It’s so fucking cold.
Is there a jacket there for me?

13
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,740
—Check it out, fag.
—What’s up?

14
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,370
It’s a miniskirt with your name on it.

15
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,665
—“Gustavo Gaviria.”
—Give me that.

16
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,587
All right, let’s call the boys.

17
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,803
And what about you?
Are you all right?

18
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,193
OK, boys, we’re in the clear.

19
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,030
Pick us up at El Mariano pass.

20
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,924
Search Bloc, we are registering the
latitude and longitude at a fixed point.

21
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,593
The subject appears
to have stopped moving.

22
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,848
You’ve gotta be shitting me.

23
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,907
How nice to see
that you have made friends.

24
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,911
Careful, son.
This woman is very clever.

25
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,955
She can grab your gun
and shoot you in the head.

26
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,582
My apologies, boss.

27
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,637
How do you feel?

28
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,309
As well as one might expect.

29
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:54,105
I need you to record another tape for me.

30
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,275
No.

31
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,903
No, not until you free more hostages.

32
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,075
Maruja is very ill.
Ricardo has an ulcer.

33
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,953
I’m the only one you need to negotiate.

34
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,414
Then why does the Colombian government
keep trying to capture me?

35
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,085
Look …

36
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,756
I admire your bravery very much.

37
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,720
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,
with all due respect, so is your father.

38
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,680
And what did you expect?

39
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,600
To get into Congress like it was nothing?

40
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,021
Without it mattering that you,
in fact, traffic drugs?

41
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,942
I expected respect.

42
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,614
You had respect
when you built homes for the poor.

43
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,495
But when you didn’t get that respect
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

44
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,331
you threw a tantrum.

45
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:01,213
I was going to do marvellous things
for this country.

46
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:08,179
If I have made myself into a monster,
like all of you say,

47
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:12,016
that is the fault of people
like your father …

48
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,977
and those politicians “of always.”

49
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,314
Those oligarchs and those people

50
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:22,401
were never going to tolerate
that little paisa from Medellín

51
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:28,324
who had more money
and was more intelligent than all of them.

52
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,285
Yes.

53
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,997
You would have done marvellous things.

54
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,376
And that is the saddest part.

55
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:45,049
Mr Escobar has promised
to free two more hostages.

56
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:50,429
But in exchange, he has asked that you
continue negotiations with transparency.

57
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:55,309
President Gaviria …
he knows what you are doing.

58
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,728
He knows.

59
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,149
If you insist on trying to capture him
with the help of the Americans …

60
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,404
they’re going to kill us all.

61
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,952
You are risking my daughter’s life!

62
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,497
No, Nydia. With all due respect,
we are not risking anyone’s life.

63
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,377
Our priority is the life of your daughter
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

64
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,089
But our priority
is also to capture Escobar.

65
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,758
You cannot have both things at once.

66
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,928
Negotiate with Escobar
while trying to capture him?

67
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,638
Do you know what he is demanding?

68
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,978
That we call a constitutional referendum
to abolish extradition.

69
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:45,359
That he only plead guilty
to having trafficked drugs one time.

70
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,987
And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

71
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,450
and have his own guards
to watch over him.

72
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,910
This is a deal with the devil.

73
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:59,457
You are the president of a country
that became a living hell some time ago.

74
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,876
With whom else did you expect
to be making a deal?

75
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,272
Hello. It’s Gorilla.

76
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,451
Forgive me, Gorilla,
I don’t feel well.

77
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,746
Miss Diana …

78
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,583
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

79
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,380
You are loyal like a sheep,
aren’t you?

80
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:56,347
That man is your kidnapper … and mine,
and that of the whole nation.

81
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,015
Here, you go first.

82
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,258
Hide in here, quickly!

83
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,780
Mr President!

84
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,324
You killed my daughter.

85
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,826
Let her pass.

86
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,537
Wait …

87
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,833
If you had accepted his terms,
my daughter would still be alive!

88
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,256
Give him whatever he wants.

89
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,009
Don’t let others go through the suffering
we’ve had to endure.

90
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,638
Mr President … we need to leave.

91
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,354
God be with you, Nydia.

92
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,958
There’s something
I want to make very clear.

93
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:35,088
You are not to blame for Diana’s death.
OK? That has to be clear.

94
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,551
Escobar has the resources
for this to go on forever.

95
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,386
Yes, and so do we.

96
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,096
We are the state.

97
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,017
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

98
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,687
We have options.

99
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,649
For instance, why don’t we allow
the American military to come in?

100
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,569
I know-- We don’t like it.
I personally don’t like it.

101
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,447
But if it’s a specific, clear mission--

102
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,740
—No.
—Something covert.

103
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,949
No!

104
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,748
It’s time to end all of this.

105
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,463
Give Escobar what he wants.

106
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,218
Let’s go.

107
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,245
Well … at this time,
our friend, Fernando,

108
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,081
is going to tell us a little something.

109
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,337
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

110
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:45,385
accepting only one simple charge:
drug trafficking.

111
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,596
And …

112
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,973
they are going to let him build a jail

113
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:56,020
which the police
cannot be within three kilometres of.

114
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,524
At last …
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

115
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,985
Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.

116
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,155
Fernando …

117
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,785
thank you very much.

118
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:15,791
And do you know when Congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

119
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,711
Yes, it’s--
It’s a matter of … of weeks.

120
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:23,590
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

121
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,177
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

122
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,431
No, brother. Now is when I am going
to need your services the most.

123
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,188
—How-- How’s that?
—Fernando …

124
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:45,863
now it’s time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

125
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,159
Right?

126
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,559
And what does this mean for us, huh?

127
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:21,523
It means, my love …
that now I have a jail.

128
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:28,822
And for you,
visiting days will be …

129
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,533
every day.

130
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,203
—I’m serious, Pablo.
—So am I.

131
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,291
The problem, Pablo, is that …

132
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,795
now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

133
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,424
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

134
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,640
So then …

135
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:05,024
now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist … is that it?

136
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,279
You understand what I’m saying.

137
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,323
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

138
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:19,957
I think that it’s time for me …

139
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,751
to set you free, so that …

140
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,004
you can find a boyfriend
who’s honest …

141
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:32,343
so that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

142
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,763
—little dogs …
—Don’t joke around, Pablo.

143
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,807
No, I’m not joking.

144
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,686
I just want you to know …

145
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,189
that you, Valeria …

146
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,736
are a bandit, just like me.

147
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,952
So don’t come to me with bullshit.

148
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,887
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

149
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,690
Shit, I’d thought you’d gone crazy.

150
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:39,118
Geniuses …
are always branded as crazy.

151
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,039
—Am I right?
—Yeah.

152
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,129
—The Ochoas …
—The Ochoas what?

153
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,133
You can bet
they’re going to be pissed off.

154
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,094
Because of the treaty?

155
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,139
Or because you’re fucking their sister?

156
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,655
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

157
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,873
Let’s hope they don’t
make you pay for it later.

158
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,445
The soccer field will be over here.

159
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:43,660
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for Manuela,

160
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:49,166
and downstairs,
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

161
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,793
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

162
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:56,047
I’m going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

163
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,092
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls’ asses.

164
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:04,055
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

165
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:09,352
—What can we do to help you, Pablo?
—Well …

166
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,563
while we’re in prison,
Gustavo and me,

167
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:18,486
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,
Galeano, to oversee operations.

168
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,823
Thank you, Pablo.

169
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:27,078
We’re privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

170
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,874
We’ve already spoken about the operational
plan and everything’s clear, right?

171
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,084
Yes. We won’t let you down, Pablo.

172
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,419
Did you tell them about the tax?

173
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,882
—No, I didn’t.
—The tax?

174
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,925
What tax is this?

175
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,429
Who paid for the war we fought?

176
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,015
You.

177
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,145
—You, Don Pablo.
—That’s right.

178
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,066
We have peace now.

179
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,819
You’re going to directly
benefit from that.

180
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,201
It’s only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

181
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,037
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

182
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,749
And about how much will that be?

183
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:17,461
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

184
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,714
Yes, 200 grand.

185
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,050
200 grand?

186
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:26,054
That’s a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

187
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,014
But consider it done.

188
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:32,393
And again … thank you
very much for this responsibility,

189
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,979
—and for considering us.
—All right, then.

190
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,494
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

191
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,457
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

192
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,376
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

193
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,131
I agree with you.

194
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:06,552
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

195
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,806
And what?
You don’t think I inspire loyalty?

196
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,268
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

197
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,478
But I’m not sure about everyone else’s.

198
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,191
You know, the thing is, Pablo …
you won.

199
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,568
There’s no arguing that.

200
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,487
But you gave in.

201
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,158
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

202
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:33,163
We’ve gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

203
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,127
Thank you.

204
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,132
It’s great to see you again, Valeria.

205
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,803
Likewise, Pacho.
I’m very happy to see you.

206
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:53,266
Although I must say …
it was a little unexpected.

207
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,894
We are worried about you.

208
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:01,065
And … why are “we” worried?

209
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,485
Pablo’s cutting a deal
with the government.

210
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,529
He’s going to have
to admit to certain things.

211
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:10,992
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

212
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:18,749
If I’m good at anything,
it’s protecting my reputation.

213
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,919
Listen, this time it’s different.

214
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:28,385
Look … you helped create
that “Robin Hood Paisa” bullshit.

215
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:33,056
And when it all goes to shit, you’ll have
to take responsibility for that.

216
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,017
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

217
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,186
You have enemies, see?

218
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,146
They’re not gonna
let you get away with it.

219
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,523
Look, Valeria …

220
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:49,030
we have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

221
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:52,325
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

222
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,784
And leave Colombia.

223
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,038
There are a million Colombians there.

224
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,874
A new audience.

225
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,002
And they don’t care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

226
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,217
Just for a while.

227
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,387
When this is all over, you’ll be able to
come back here with your head held high.

228
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,555
I guarantee it.

229
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:20,561
And not only that, you’ll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

230
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,525
—Betrayal is not my style.
—What betrayal?

231
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,362
And what would you be betraying?

232
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,656
Your role as his mistress?

233
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:39,914
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you good enough to be his wife.

234
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,583
His wife? Me?

235
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,544
No, no, no,
you’re very much mistaken, my dear.

236
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,380
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

237
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,675
Besides …
do you think I’d want to be his wife?

238
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:58,182
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

239
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,059
while he’s out with …

240
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,729
with me?

241
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:06,857
No.

242
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,986
That’s too boring.

243
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,997
I missed you so much.

244
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,833
I missed you, too.

245
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,886
No, it was terrible.

246
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,389
It was terrible.

247
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,184
Every day in a different house …

248
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,021
worried about you …

249
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,107
the kids …

250
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,490
The truth is …

251
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,995
it’s very good to be home.

252
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,624
—You look happy.
—Of course.

253
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,921
That time has passed.

254
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,802
It’s the happiest face I’ve ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

255
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,311
The kids!
The kids, Pablo!

256
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,770
—The kids!
—No, Tata!

257
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,981
—I have to go to them!
—Stay here!

258
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,609
—My children!
—Stay here!

259
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,861
I’ll go get them. Stay here.

260
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,323
Juan Pablo!

261
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,826
Juan Pablo!

262
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,786
—Are you OK?
—Yes.

263
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,163
Come on.

264
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,837
Go to your mother.
Go to your mother.

265
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,634
Come on, come on.

266
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,555
Don’t worry, cousin.

267
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,976
We’re going to kill them all.

268
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:15,754
Hello?

269
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:19,383
Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.

270
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:24,305
—Just now?
—Yes, a few minutes ago. A car bomb.

271
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,725
—Who was inside?
—We don’t know.

272
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,936
What other information do you have?

273
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,981
That’s all the information
we have right now.

274
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,816
OK, thanks.

275
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,801
He always takes her to the same motel.

276
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,974
—Marina.
—Where are you going?

277
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,478
I’m going to the city.

278
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,772
I have to get out of this prison.

279
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,568
—Come here, Marina.
—Yes?

280
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,156
Have a good time.

281
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,075
Be safe.

282
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,494
Thanks.

283
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,340
You know what he’s going to do, right?

284
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,884
He’s going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

285
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,471
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

286
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,433
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

287
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:54,562
Well … all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

288
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:58,107
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

289
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,317
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

290
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,986
especially General Jaramillo.

291
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,656
Can you talk to him for us?

292
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,158
Yes, of course.

293
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,828
But I don’t think it will be enough.

294
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,204
What are you saying?

295
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:15,458
That you’re going
to have to offer something more,

296
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,295
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

297
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,840
Gustavo Gaviria.

298
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,636
He is the key to Pablo’s business.

299
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,012
If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

300
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,768
Indeed, that could work.

301
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,687
That could work.

302
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,966
Follow me.

303
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,133
Kiss me.

304
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,738
—You look pretty, baby.
—Yeah, sure.

305
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,866
What I mean is
you’ve always looked pretty.

306
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,343
What’s happening?

307
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,846
Nothing.

308
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,767
Nothing is happening here.
Isn’t that right, Colonel Carrillo?

309
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,727
That’s up to you.

310
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:46,108
—Say goodbye.
—No.

311
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,485
No, no, no.
Gustavo, look at me.

312
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,320
Does your family know where you are?

313
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,114
—Gustavo!
—Calm down, Marina.

314
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,371
You’re making a big mistake, Carrillo.

315
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:04,543
We’re already in negotiations
with the government.

316
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,964
—You have no reason to be doing this.
—You’re right.

317
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,467
That’s why I’m not here.

318
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,472
Then what the fuck do you want?

319
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,267
Don’t act stupid.

320
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:25,397
Give me your cousin …
and I’ll let you live.

321
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,864
All right.

322
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,952
Kill me, then, motherfucker.

323
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,997
I won’t do that myself.

324
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:47,127
But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

325
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,298
This guy? This is Lastia.

326
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:58,221
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá
in a bombing you coordinated.

327
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,349
She was 17 years old.

328
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,268
And this guy here …

329
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,649
this is Trujillo.

330
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:15,322
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

331
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,369
—That has nothing to do with me.
—No?

332
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:27,459
You know …
if you support evil, you are evil.

333
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,337
Look at them.

334
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,923
I just want you to look at their faces.

335
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,259
A few of the victims
you’ve left in your wake.

336
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,013
Tell me …

337
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,476
have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

338
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:51,233
Give me your cousin …

339
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,987
or I’ll let these men show you
that vengeance with their fists.

340
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,421
Do it, then …
you sons of bitches.

341
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,214
OK, then.

342
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:21,847
We’ll see how you feel …
after ten minutes.

343
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,516
Do it.

344
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:53,253
Tell me where your cousin is.

345
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,840
It doesn’t have to end like this.

346
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,113
Tell me where your cousin is.

347
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,870
We …

348
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,918
are bandits …
not snitches, motherfucker.

349
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:54,106
You’re--
You’re all gonna die, motherfuckers!

350
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,984
You’re all dead, motherfuckers!

351
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,695
You’re all dead, motherfuckers!

352
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:05,742
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

353
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,036
You’re all dead!

354
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,043
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

355
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,753
Colonel, they’re going
to make us pay for this.

356
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:23,010
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

357
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,762
Make sure you report that he fired first.

358
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,931
But Colonel, he’s all beat up.

359
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,606
That work for you?

360
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:54,583
There is nothing … more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

361
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:59,755
We’re all here together … united.

362
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,469
Now let’s eat and enjoy
this marvellous food.

363
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:12,392
—Wait, wait.
—Oh, yeah, the beets.

364
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,853
Boss?

365
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,191
Hello, son. Have a seat.

366
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,236
—Sit down--
—Boss, I don’t know how to say this.

367
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,573
Tell me like a man.

368
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,743
—Gustavo is dead.
—What?

369
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,416
They found his body on the outskirts
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

370
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,418
How’s that?

371
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,045
They also shot him, boss.

372
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:43,257
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

373
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,468
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

374
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:50,264
You … you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

375
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,934
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo …
Go on! Get out of here!

376
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,813
It’s OK.
Everything’s going to be fine.

377
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,826
Are you sure about this?

378
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,911
Yes, boss.

379
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,960
I want you to take him
to the funeral home …

380
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,132
and guard his body the entire time
until it’s buried.

381
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,926
—All right.
—Go on.

382
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,315
How are you doing, son?

383
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,896
I’m going to miss him so much, Mama.

384
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,527
When …

385
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:36,745
you were nine … or ten …
do you remember?

386
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,957
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

387
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:48,173
You’d go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

388
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:52,094
The whole day would go by …

389
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,934
And we would call you …

390
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:05,065
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place …

391
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,737
until finally you would appear.

392
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,157
Oh, my God.

393
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,369
“Where were you?”

394
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,664
“Where have you been, son?”
I would yell out.

395
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,752
“In the mountains, Mama.”

396
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:33,343
“Higher than the clouds, Auntie,”
Gustavo would say, laughing.

397
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,102
He …

398
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,771
He always wanted to go farther.

399
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,152
He always did.

400
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,195
But with you.

401
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,698
Only with you.

402
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,581
I didn’t think it would end this way.

403
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,576
Good afternoon.

404
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:43,663
Boss?

405
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:47,334
Someone came all the way out here
to see you.

406
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,672
Miss Valeria.

407
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,147
Good day, ma’am. Pablo.

408
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,525
What’s she doing here?

409
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:14,528
I’m here only because
I have important information.

410
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,071
I hope it’s very important.

411
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,740
It’s about Gustavo.

412
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,701
Tell us, then.

413
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:26,456
I’ve been told the Ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

414
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,709
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

415
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,463
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

416
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:34,881
How do you know that?

417
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,551
You know me, Pablo.

418
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:40,303
I have my sources.

419
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,648
Who in Cali?

420
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,569
Pacho Herrera.

421
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,986
“Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

422
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:42,073
Will your wrath burn like fire?

423
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,201
Remember how fleeting is my life,

424
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:49,914
for what futility
you have created the children of men.”

425
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:41,424
As you know, I come on behalf
of President César Gaviria,

426
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,676
and the Colombian government.

427
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:47,389
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

428
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,198
All right, then.

429
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:09,494
Let me hand over my gun.

430
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:16,543
—You won.
—We both did.

431
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:21,005
Now Gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

432
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:25,385
Except that’s not so true.

433
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,721
You and I know it’s a huge lie.

434
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:37,647
Lies are necessary … when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

435
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:44,088
So, Lagarto …
are we gonna party tonight or what?

436
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,719
La Dispensaria.

437
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,950
All right.
