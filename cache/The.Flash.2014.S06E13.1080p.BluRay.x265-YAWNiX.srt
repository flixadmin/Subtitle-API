1
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:57,392
Guys, I saw the alert.
Meta attack downtown. I'm on my way.

2
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:01,104
- <i>Sounds good, Flash.</i>
- Kamilla? Is that you?

3
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,399
- Uh, yeah.
- And Chester P. Runk, sir.

4
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,026
Ready to assist you
in all your superhero needs.

5
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,921
<i>Why are you two on comms?</i>

6
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,281
- Uh, Kamilla let me in.
- We're the only ones here.

7
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:13,366
Frost is at A.R.G.U.S.,
checking on Bloodwork.

8
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,827
Cisco's off the grid
cataloging post-Crisis metas.

9
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,287
Iris is on a story.

10
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,682
<i>And Ralph is who knows where
tracing down Sue Dearbon.</i>

11
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:23,084
<i>- Okay, no worries. I'll do this solo.</i>
- Are you sure you don't want some help?

12
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:26,713
'Cause, I mean, I am... I am ready,
willing and caffeinated, sir.

13
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,299
- Put me in, coach.
- Thanks, Chester, but I'm good.

14
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:58,286
Hartley Rathaway.
Since when are you a diamond thief?

15
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,538
It's Pied Piper, Flash.

16
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,665
And you're really gonna ask me that

17
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,389
after what you and your friends
did to me?

18
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,670
Uh, what did we do?

19
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:12,717
Wow, Flash, my brother.
That is epically cold.

20
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,136
How do you not remember?
It was really bad.

21
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,972
Oh, great. Another Crisis change.

22
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,391
Apparently, there's something else
you don't remember.

23
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,229
The gauntlets are
just my backup singers.

24
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,521
Wait. What...

25
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,363
Great. He can fly now.

26
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:36,032
No worries, Flash.
P-Runk is all over it.

27
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,284
That sonic boom had
a specific frequency.

28
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,995
If I scan for the same wavelength,
I think we can...

29
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,667
<i>- Voil√†!</i>
- Flash, Rathaway's at 52nd and Palm.

30
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,517
All right, I'm on it.
I'll take Broadway.

31
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,547
- Uh, I wouldn't do that, sir.
<i>- Why not?</i>

32
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,650
<i>Because there's a...</i>

33
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,765
- Since when was there a train here?
<i>- Since always.</i>

34
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,332
<i>System update complete.
Is there anything else, Barry Allen?</i>

35
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,958
Uh, just one more tweak.

36
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,801
In the meantime, I wouldn't mind knowing
everything that Crisis changed

37
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,199
before I run back into the field.

38
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,300
<i>Calculating. Calculating.</i>

39
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,970
<i>Calculating.</i>

40
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,146
Barry Allen is the Flash.

41
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,858
- Yeah, I already knew that.
- What?

42
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,506
Actually, you know what? When I think
about it, it does kind of make sense.

43
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,574
The whole S.T.A.R. Labs super-facility.

44
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:04,037
Plus the same voice every time
the Flash came to visit me at the MAC.

45
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,666
And that jawline, though?
Very distinctive.

46
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,836
Hmm. Listen, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm kinda... I'm kinda busy right now.

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,397
- Well, what are you working on?
- Uh...

48
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,298
Analysis complete, Barry Allen.

49
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:19,469
I've calculated
approximately 3.725 trillion changes.

50
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,930
Would you like to hear them
in order of causality?

51
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,733
Is this a mobile interactive
artificial intelligence unit?

52
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:28,394
Uh, yeah, it is. I'm...
I'm just trying to upgrade it.

53
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,896
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

54
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,024
You know, if you just flip
the positronic solenoid right...

55
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,610
Hey! Please. Um, don't mess with that.

56
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,739
It's, uh, sensitive stuff
and you're not on the team, Chester.

57
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,074
Yeah, totally. Uh...

58
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,954
I guess I'll cross the whole
"superhero tech support"

59
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,002
off my list of career possibilities.

60
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,961
Anyways, uh, if you'll <i>excusez-moi,</i>
I'm Jitters-bound.

61
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:00,468
- He's just trying to help.
- I know. I know. I just...

62
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,722
So much has changed after Crisis.

63
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,786
You know, this morning
when I got the meta-alert,

64
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,605
I was trying to find my parents' graves.

65
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,401
But there's not even
a cemetery there anymore.

66
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:22,073
I've searched every graveyard in
Central City. I still can't find them.

67
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,578
Just feels like a piece of me
is missing.

68
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,792
And friends like Hartley Rathaway
are enemies now.

69
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,837
Just everything is so different.

70
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,776
I'll bet hearing different voices
on comms doesn't help either.

71
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,054
You want something familiar.
That's not us.

72
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:49,350
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's okay, Barry. I understand.

73
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,645
Just maybe take it easy on Chester.

74
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,608
If he seems a little over-eager,
it's because he idolizes the Flash.

75
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:58,984
You're his hero.

76
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:03,281
I'll, uh, let you get back to it.

77
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,373
There's gotta be
some sort of logic to it.

78
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,335
Walk me through the night of the
particle accelerator explosion again.

79
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,212
What were you doing?

80
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,966
Like I told you...

81
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:28,765
<i>I was starting R-CEM tests that night.
I'd just finished the prototype.</i>

82
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,808
<i>My life's work was ready.</i>

83
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,895
Wait. You'd finished
building your machine?

84
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,648
- Yeah.
- Can you build one here?

85
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:41,527
- I did, but we can't use it.
- Eva, we at least have to try.

86
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,241
What are you so afraid of?

87
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,994
I...

88
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,666
Eva, I get it.

89
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,962
I do. But I've read your research.

90
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,218
You were brilliant.
You were the best in your field.

91
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,097
And that is good enough for me.

92
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,724
You're so brave.

93
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,229
I guess we'll be brave together then.

94
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:24,153
So, this is a Residual Particle Catcher.

95
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:29,575
It can detect and detain
molecular afterglow of things.

96
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,577
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

97
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,162
And you need me to do what?

98
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,432
Oh, I need you to help me charge it,
so I can catch him.

99
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:39,085
Them. The particles.
Catch the particles.

100
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,586
Why are you so nervous?

101
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,564
And what are these "particles"
you're trying to catch?

102
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,298
They're just... They're...

103
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:48,219
They're scientific anomalies.
You wouldn't understand.

104
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,931
There's the Nash Wells we know
and can barely stand.

105
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,394
And I'm guessing anomalies
because of Crisis?

106
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,231
Boss lady told me.

107
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,776
You never did like being kept
in the dark, did you?

108
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,488
Why do you always act like
you've known me forever? It's weird.

109
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I...

110
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,747
don't know what you're talking about.

111
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,140
Well, that's not true, is it?

112
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:23,921
You're such a liar.

113
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,926
What? I mean... It's... Yes.

114
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,221
The Residual Particle Catcher is ready.
Thank you.

115
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,475
So, if you would...
Please, can you, uh, help me charge it?

116
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,437
Just blast it with
an ultra-powered UV ray right there.

117
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,856
- Where?
- There. Right...

118
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,943
Just aim for the absorption panel

119
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,227
on the front pylon. Thank you.

120
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:51,824
- Okay. Keep your panties on.
- That contraption is not going to work.

121
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:53,848
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

122
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,519
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Who the hell is she?

123
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,355
She...

124
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,544
That's... It's just someone
I used to know.

125
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,862
Well, she looks a lot
like my doppelganger.

126
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,965
- Why do you have a picture of her?
- It doesn't... it doesn't matter.

127
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,743
It does to me. Dude, this is too weird.

128
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,914
You know, I had a feeling something
was off with you from the beginning.

129
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,417
But I kept ignoring it, because I was
just happy to find another person

130
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,794
who actually believed in me.

131
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:45,795
Okay...

132
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,382
But this whole time,
when you looked at me,

133
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,341
you saw this other person.

134
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,552
God, that is messed up, you know?

135
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,356
Okay. All right.

136
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,317
Let's try this again, Gideon.

137
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,385
What the hell?

138
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:53,362
- Oh, good. You're awake.
- Oh, Caitlin.

139
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,032
Thank God. What the hell is going on?

140
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,302
One minute
I'm in the speed lab fixing Gideon,

141
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,536
the next thing I know I'm here.
My speed's gone.

142
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,748
Quite the little chatterbox today,
aren't we?

143
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,583
What?

144
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,504
Why are you talking to me like that?
And why am I in a cage?

145
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,259
Caitlin. Let me out of here.

146
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:18,846
Easy, killer.

147
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,438
- Thawne.
- You're quite the specimen, aren't you?

148
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,276
Go to hell. I don't know how you
managed to drag me back to the past.

149
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,947
Whatever all this is, I will stop you.

150
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:41,369
Cranky.
Why, did you offer him the B-word?

151
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,955
Hmm. Maybe he just needs some privacy.
I'm gonna go check on Ronnie.

152
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,079
He's working on a new space
he's very excited about.

153
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,251
He's calling it The Pipeline.

154
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,335
Hmm.

155
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,171
The Pipeline.

156
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,508
- I like the sound of that.
- Caitlin?

157
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,551
- I'll come with you.
- Caitlin?

158
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,346
Caitlin! Do not trust him!

159
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,144
Hey, baby girl.

160
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,648
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

161
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,650
- Well, a good lead, hopefully.
- Mmm.

162
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,487
I am working on our Black Hole story
and I have reached a major dead end,

163
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,507
and I was hoping
that maybe you found something new

164
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,800
on Joseph Carver that could help.

165
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:25,788
Ah, as a matter of fact, I have,
but I can't share it with you.

166
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,586
Are you being serious?

167
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,966
Look, this Carver case
has become a RICO investigation.

168
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,260
I have to report directly
to Chief Singh.

169
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,823
We have to do everything by the book.

170
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,073
Barry told me that you were the one
that gave him the advice

171
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,992
to trust me with the Mirror Gun, and now
you can't even trust me with this?

172
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,311
Oh, Iris, that weapon
was Team Flash territory.

173
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,440
This is C.C.P.D. business
and it has to stay that way,

174
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,942
otherwise Carver could skate
with a collusion charge.

175
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,236
Dad, Carver is mine.
You can't just shut me out.

176
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,899
Ooh.

177
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,492
I didn't... I didn't mean that.
I, um...

178
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,538
This just...
It really means a lot to me.

179
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,081
I can see that.

180
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,378
But, baby girl, there is nothing
I can do. My hands are tied. I'm sorry.

181
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,425
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

182
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,513
We both have a job to do
and I respect that.

183
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:25,597
Hmm.

184
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,435
I, um... I'm about to get some lunch.

185
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,521
Do you maybe wanna join me for some
Big Belly Burger? My treat.

186
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,567
Now that, I would love.
But I got few things to finish, okay?

187
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,611
Yeah, no worries.
You wanna meet me there at noon?

188
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,030
That's perfect. See you there.

189
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,323
- Okay.
- All right.

190
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,870
Oh, come on. Come on, just one game.

191
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,831
I just spent the last two hours
at A.R.G.U.S. talking to Ramsey.

192
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,458
I do not want to play pinball.

193
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,811
Besides, I know the only reason
you're hanging around

194
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,438
is 'cause you want to
work things out with Barry.

195
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,131
- So just go do it.
- I'm working my way up to it.

196
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:02,301
It's just, you know, up until today,
the worst thing I'd ever done before

197
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,470
was drown my grandmother's car.

198
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,308
Uh, don't try to build a hovercraft
at age 11. Doesn't work out.

199
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:13,646
Didn't you create
a literal black hole over Central City?

200
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,066
Wait. You think Barry's
still mad about that, too?

201
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,318
Would you stop?

202
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,546
No, no. I wasn't even awake
when that happened.

203
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,050
I mean, it's not like you killed him.

204
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,202
Barry.

205
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:30,828
Barry?

206
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,254
I can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

207
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,173
- Use your signs.
- What are you doing?

208
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,177
Nothing?

209
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,103
Well, everybody's got good days
and bad days. Gorillas are no different.

210
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,783
This isn't the past.

211
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,536
It's a mindscape.

212
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,415
- I'm in...
- That's right, Barry Allen.

213
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,793
You're in Grodd's mind now.

214
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,531
What's the matter, Grodd?

215
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,267
Get lonely at A.R.G.U.S., so you decided
to break out, come visit me?

216
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,936
Grodd is still in his prison,

217
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,689
in the mental coma
you and your team put him in.

218
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,733
Hmm.

219
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,070
So what, the cage is payback?

220
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,322
What, you want vengeance?

221
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,534
Not vengeance. Understanding.

222
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,413
Grodd wants Barry Allen
to see what it's like to have nothing.

223
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,168
No powers. No freedom. Only captivity.

224
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,463
Caitlin used neural inhibitor

225
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,714
to shut down Grodd's cerebrum.

226
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,217
Caitlin betrayed Grodd.

227
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:12,348
But you gave her the authority.
This is your doing, Flash.

228
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,393
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
Your mind is a weapon.

229
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:20,105
You take a weapon
from a man, he is still a man.

230
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,026
You took Grodd's mind.
Grodd's greatest gift.

231
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,029
That is not punishment.
That is cruelty. Pure cruelty.

232
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,491
No. No. Not from where I'm standing.

233
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,371
Does that great mind of yours remember
how many people you've hurt?

234
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,498
Huh?

235
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,212
You marched an army of gorillas
through Central City.

236
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,132
<i>You forced me
into a gladiator arena with Solovar.</i>

237
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,552
<i>You weaponized
King Shark's telepathic crown</i>

238
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,888
<i>so you could control
thousands of innocent people.</i>

239
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,517
Face it, Grodd.
You got what you deserved.

240
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,467
You are right.

241
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,278
It took Grodd
a year to find the strength

242
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,072
to think intelligently again.

243
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:16,495
And in that time,
Grodd had many primitive thoughts.

244
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,182
And without
the power of higher thinking,

245
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,625
Grodd could no longer lie to himself,

246
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,462
and was forced to confront
the truth of his actions,

247
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:29,133
his wrongdoings, his crimes.

248
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,511
Your accident
allowed Grodd to enter your mind.

249
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,099
Not to harm Flash,
but to ask for Flash's help.

250
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,328
The neural inhibitor put a Gatekeeper

251
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,395
in Grodd's mind.

252
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:46,191
The portal that Gatekeeper guards
is the only way out of this prison.

253
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:48,986
Help Grodd.

254
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:54,616
Grodd is sorry. Grodd has changed.

255
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,955
Says the super-intelligent gorilla
who just kidnapped me.

256
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,001
Who won't even show his face.

257
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,222
Grodd wants Flash to trust him.

258
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,728
Your powers are returned.

259
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,692
Please, Flash,
help Grodd defeat the Gatekeeper.

260
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,209
Nice try, Grodd.

261
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,711
But you'll never change.

262
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,672
You're exactly where you belong.

263
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,304
That's one crazy
cappuccino maker.

264
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,305
Close.

265
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,308
Sherloque's machine was developed
to put one person's mind

266
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,810
into another person's memories.

267
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,312
Wait. You think Barry is in
someone else's mind?

268
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,314
I mean, we've had experience
with this before.

269
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,400
Based on Barry's pulse,
his rapid eye movement and his vitals,

270
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,278
and the two brainwaves
are a dead giveaway.

271
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,951
This is so awesome. Awesome, awesome...

272
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,040
I mean, this is just awful.

273
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,001
- We should fix that.
- Yeah.

274
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,255
When Ramsey decided to take
a little vacation inside Barry's brain,

275
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,508
Cisco and I decided to work
on the Memory Machine

276
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,676
just in case Bloodwork
decided to resurface.

277
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,959
How's this all work?

278
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,764
In a mindscape,
the host transmits neural signals

279
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,808
to the guest's primary motor cortex.

280
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,519
If we can sync up
with those neural transmitters,

281
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,396
I think we can communicate with Barry.

282
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,148
- Like sliding into his mind DMs.
- Sweet.

283
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,030
Come on, Barry.

284
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,951
Frost. You and me. Outside. Let's go.

285
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,709
- Harrison Wells is alive?
- That's a really long story.

286
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,503
Okay.

287
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,505
Make it fast or I'm out.

288
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,465
So, it turns out that Allegra,

289
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,887
through a, you know, series of
unfortunate events, she has discovered...

290
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,570
That she's your daughter's doppelganger?

291
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,449
Not my daughter exactly.
More like an employee, right?

292
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,913
An ex-employee.
How do you know that?

293
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,685
Whatever. I'm guessing it didn't go well

294
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:30,022
because she found out
rather than you explaining it to her.

295
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,292
So now it's time
for some good old-fashioned honesty.

296
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,232
Oh, come on.

297
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,086
Whatever happened between
you and your daughter...

298
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,528
Not my daughter exactly, okay?

299
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,756
More like an employee.
An ex-employee who made a bad call.

300
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,032
Just explain it to her.

301
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,843
Yeah, but she said
it was too late for that.

302
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,287
Well, as my life coach, Ralph,
would say, you can't let that stop you.

303
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,335
Ralph is your life coach?

304
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,092
Oh, finally, there it is.

305
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,056
Time to get out of here.

306
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,310
Solovar?

307
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:10,978
You're the Gatekeeper?

308
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:25,160
Solovar, listen.
We do not have to fight.

309
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,622
As far as I'm concerned,
Grodd can stay in this coma forever.

310
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,917
I am the warden
of this prison, Flash.

311
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,879
None shall escape. Not even you.

312
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,506
Great.

313
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,370
Barry's body is reacting to
whatever's happening in the mindscape.

314
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,270
So, if he dies in there,
he dies out here, too?

315
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,082
- Correct.
- Do you have any sedatives?

316
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:57,275
- No. Those don't work on speedsters.
- No. I meant for me.

317
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,592
Uh, Frost,
you've got that look Cisco has

318
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,445
before he throws
a bunch of science words at us

319
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,697
that basically means we're fracked.

320
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,890
The signals traveling to Barry's cortex
are moving at a hyper-neural speed.

321
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,352
We've only seen one other brain
whose neurons can fire this fast.

322
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,316
- Barry's in Grodd's mind.
- Gorilla Grodd?

323
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,820
Damn. Yo, he is, like,
my favorite supervillain ever.

324
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:45,449
He's, like, super strong
and super smart,

325
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,827
and Barry's super trapped in his mind.

326
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,370
Which is very bad.

327
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:54,166
We modified Grodd's telepathic crown
to keep him in a coma at A.R.G.U.S.

328
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,462
<i>But its neural inhibiting capabilities
can only sustain one mind.</i>

329
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,007
<i>Before long, the mindscape
will overload and crumble.</i>

330
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,885
If that happens
and Barry's still inside...

331
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,011
He would die.

332
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,906
Well, can't we just call A.R.G.U.S.
and ask them to shut it off?

333
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,643
Uh, no. If we do that while Barry's
still connected to Grodd's mind,

334
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,103
he'll be trapped in there forever.

335
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,869
I still don't understand
how this happened.

336
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,443
How did Grodd get inside Barry's mind?

337
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,028
Because of me.

338
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,949
When I tweaked this earlier,
I adjusted its hypothalamic connection.

339
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,619
By a factor of 900%.

340
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,830
Okay, well, that's more
than enough signal

341
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,499
for another brain to piggyback on.

342
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,918
And Barry was wearing that
when he was whammied.

343
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,382
I am so sorry. I...
I never should have came here.

344
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,426
This is all my fault.

345
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,102
Hey.

346
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,815
How is you running away gonna
help us get Barry out of Grodd's mind?

347
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,085
Because if I'm not around,
at least I can't make things worse.

348
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,860
Look,
I hate to break it to you,

349
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,987
but accidentally putting
Barry's life in danger

350
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,989
is kind of a rite of passage
around here.

351
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,700
We've all done it. Cisco, me, Ralph.

352
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,283
Even that janitor who put
too much wax on the floor.

353
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,413
But then,
after we put his life in danger,

354
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,457
we figure out a plan
to get him out of it.

355
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,667
So now it's your turn.

356
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,631
You know, in the sixth grade
I got into the science fair

357
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,301
with a <i>Millennium Falcon</i> that I built
out of used vacuum parts.

358
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,514
I mean, it flew
and everything, like a drone.

359
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,560
But on the day of the fair,
it didn't fly.

360
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,398
Uh, rust in the intake manifold
was preventing air

361
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,041
from getting into the combustion,
which was then causing it to...

362
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,612
Sorry.

363
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,614
Anyway...

364
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:55,579
I had begged my teacher to let me fix it
and then fly again the next day.

365
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,083
He said no. You know why?

366
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,256
He was an old-school brother,

367
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,844
and he said that in the real world...

368
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,055
people like us...

369
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,517
we don't get a second chance.

370
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,815
Hold on.

371
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,449
I'm not gonna pretend like I have
any idea what your life has been like,

372
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,327
and I know that some
of the stuff we do in here

373
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,329
has nothing to do with the real world,

374
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:42,375
but... I am offering you
a second chance.

375
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,881
Because you deserve one.
Because we all do.

376
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,037
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I don't know how I made that mistake.

377
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,146
I... I thought I said 12:30.

378
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,815
<i>Not a problem.
I'll order you the usual.</i>

379
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:09,361
Yeah, that sounds great.
I will be there soon. Love you.

380
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,172
- Ready to do this?
- Yes.

381
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,883
No. I don't know.

382
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,886
Eva, look at me.

383
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,975
- Trust yourself. You can do this.
- It's the machine I don't trust.

384
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,561
The subatomic particles this emits
will penetrate the mirror's surface,

385
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,982
but it won't pierce the barrier
between the worlds. It will fail.

386
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,984
Then we're no worse off
than we are right now.

387
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,878
I made the mirror pieces move.
Let's just go back to trying that.

388
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,157
Eva, we should be trying everything
we can to get out of here, right?

389
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,891
There's another reason why you don't
want me to use this machine,

390
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:04,833
isn't there?

391
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,752
No.
I better go lie down.

392
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,922
- Eva, what are you hiding?
- Nothing.

393
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,675
Why don't I believe you?

394
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,929
Trust me. We can't use it.

395
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,765
- Why can't we use it?
- Because of this!

396
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:29,607
Eva.

397
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,537
- You're Joe now?
- Hmm.

398
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,791
When Flash sees Grodd,
he sees an enemy from his past.

399
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,377
Grodd wants Flash
to see a face he can trust.

400
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,109
And having me fight Solovar
was supposed to make me trust you?

401
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,008
Grodd thought Flash could beat him.

402
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,969
You were wrong! He almost killed me.

403
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,349
- But that was your plan, wasn't it?
- No.

404
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,937
What's that?
What's happening? Is that Solovar?

405
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,898
This world is crumbling.

406
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:15,028
The neural inhibitor can no longer
take the strain of two minds.

407
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,531
What happens
to this mindscape if it fails?

408
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,035
Both Grodd and Flash die.

409
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,870
Together.

410
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,081
You wanted revenge so badly

411
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,375
that you were willing to die
just to take me with you?

412
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,626
No.

413
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,674
Grodd has changed.

414
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,677
Nothing could ever make you change.

415
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,098
Not even the Crisis of infinite worlds?

416
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,186
How do you know about Crisis?

417
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:53,149
Grodd's mind wasn't affected
by the merging of the multi-verse,

418
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:58,113
but Grodd can still sense
changes in this reality.

419
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,281
Changes like Gorilla City.

420
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,700
City is here now.

421
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,746
The gorillas are here now.
Grodd knows this.

422
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,458
- Grodd wants to return home.
- Why?

423
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,270
So you can create another army
to attack Central City?

424
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:14,796
Just destroy everyone in your path?

425
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:19,259
That is who Grodd used to be.
That Grodd wanted power.

426
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,222
Power didn't bring happiness.

427
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,307
It brought pain.

428
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,603
New Grodd wants a new path.

429
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,360
Grodd wants to live...

430
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,324
in peace, with his own kind.

431
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:51,916
Gorilla City is the only place
Grodd ever, ever felt happy.

432
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,337
You're telling the truth.

433
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,632
You really have changed.

434
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:05,013
Flash didn't believe Grodd before,

435
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,766
but why does Flash believe Grodd now?

436
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,563
You let go of the past.

437
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,942
Maybe I should do the same.

438
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,990
Crisis has changed so much.

439
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:29,954
I've been obsessed with trying to
keep things the way they were before...

440
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,500
but I can't.

441
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,293
Those things don't matter.

442
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,924
If Flash can't beat Solovar,
there's no escape.

443
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:46,471
This world collapses, we both die.
That's our fate.

444
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:49,224
No. We decide our fate.

445
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,977
Grodd, Solovar beat me
because I tried to fight him

446
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,480
the exact same way
I fought him three years ago.

447
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,435
To get out of here,
we just have to try something new.

448
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,031
- We have to run forward. Not backward.
- How?

449
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,705
By fighting together.

450
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:22,549
There's our way out.

451
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,472
You ready?

452
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,558
We can do this, Grodd. Together.

453
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,060
Grodd is ready.

454
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,453
What is it?

455
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,206
Barry and Grodd,
their cerebral activity is syncing.

456
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:00,044
Okay, forget sync.
Their neural pathways just merged.

457
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,339
Their brainwaves are literally the same.

458
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,573
<i>How does it feel?</i>

459
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,474
It feels impossible.

460
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,894
<i>I know. Now, get ready.
This time, we're on the same team.</i>

461
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,028
Grodd will never leave.

462
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,240
<i>You have my powers, Grodd,
and my knowledge of how to use them.</i>

463
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,076
<i>- Now get us out of here.</i>
- Grodd understands.

464
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,797
The neural comm link is working.

465
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,966
- Barry, can you hear me?
<i>- Frost?</i>

466
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,636
Yes. We've been trying
to get in contact with you.

467
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,430
You're in Grodd's mind.
Is he trying to hurt you?

468
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:55,558
<i>No. We're on the same team.
Grodd and I merged our minds.</i>

469
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,962
<i>Sort of like the mindscape version
of the Firestorm Matrix.</i>

470
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,771
Wait. So you're half gorilla now?

471
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,499
<i>Uh, I'll explain later. We're fighting
a Gatekeeper in Grodd's mind.</i>

472
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,775
<i>We need to beat it to escape.</i>

473
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,139
<i>- And the only way to do that...</i>
- Is by working together.

474
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,630
<i>There isn't much time.
The world is gonna split apart.</i>

475
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,954
<i>Grodd thinks
lightning can save him.</i>

476
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,956
<i>Nothing can save Grodd.</i>

477
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,293
Uh, Barry, we've got bigger problems
than Solovar right now.

478
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,629
<i>I know.
Grodd's mindscape is falling apart.</i>

479
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,713
Actually, this is worse.

480
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,112
<i>What could be
worse than this?</i>

481
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,932
According to my scans,

482
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,644
if you exit the mindscape
with your brainwaves still merged,

483
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,063
you will end up in one body.

484
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,315
Brundle-Flash. Gross.

485
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,945
Yeah. And what's worse
is the resulting physiological conflict

486
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:52,031
will cause every brain cell
to shut down,

487
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,659
- and the resulting form would...
<i>- We'd both die.</i>

488
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,702
Yeah.

489
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:57,583
Wait. So we have to somehow
separate their minds

490
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,163
at the exact moment they escape.

491
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,209
And I'd have to be accurate to
the millisecond, which isn't possible.

492
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:07,004
Not for us, but it's very possible

493
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,549
for a mobile interactive
artificial intelligence unit.

494
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,676
If we sync Gideon's
quantum intelligence network

495
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,428
to Barry and Grodd's bio-analytics,

496
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,722
it'll perfectly time
the neural de-splicing.

497
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:21,144
But I'd have to do
some more augmenting to this puppy,

498
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,397
and my augmenting
is what got Barry into this mess

499
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,358
and I just really don't want
to mess up again, so...

500
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,653
<i>Chester, listen to me.
That tweak you made to Gideon earlier?</i>

501
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,537
<i>In two seconds,
you improved her functionality</i>

502
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,032
<i>more than I did in two hours.
You're a genius.</i>

503
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,452
<i>Maybe it didn't work out
exactly how you planned,</i>

504
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,454
<i>so here's round two. Try again.</i>

505
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>I need you now, Chester. Please.
You can do this. I believe in you.</i>

506
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,254
- Flash believes in me?
- We all do.

507
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,382
Go ahead. Take your second chance.
Show us your moves.

508
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,216
Right.

509
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,054
It's time for the LeBron James
of the junkyard to do his thing, baby.

510
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,182
Oh, watch out, brothers and sisters,

511
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,185
'cause Chester P. Runk
is back.

512
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,479
<i>Great. Now all we have to...</i>

513
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:06,565
Flash?

514
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,609
Grodd!

515
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,321
There is no escape.

516
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,410
Solovar's winning. Come on, Barry.

517
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,062
- How's it going, Chester?
- Please let this work.

518
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,213
Grodd stinks of fear.

519
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:35,051
Grodd knows Solovar brings him death.

520
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,271
<i>Don't listen to him, Grodd.
You have too much to live for.</i>

521
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,640
<i>You hear me? Don't let the past win.</i>

522
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:43,726
<i>Put it all behind you
and show Solovar what you're made of.</i>

523
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:50,608
<i>That's it. Get the hell up
and run, Grodd. Run.</i>

524
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:57,656
Almost there.

525
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,830
<i>Whatever you guys are doing,
do it now.</i>

526
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:29,896
Here goes.

527
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Yes!

528
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,369
Come on, Barry. You got this.

529
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,459
- Thank Rao.
- You're back.

530
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,086
Yeah, I'm back.

531
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,714
Thanks to the team.

532
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,519
So, do you think Grodd
has gone, like, full hero?

533
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,813
Or is this more of, like,
a Captain Cold,

534
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:14,108
former-villain-turned-sorta-good-guy
situation?

535
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,777
Uh, we'll see, I guess.

536
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,989
Lyla had A.R.G.U.S. embed
a tracking polymer in his cerebellum.

537
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,366
She agreed to let him out on probation

538
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,170
as long as we know
where he is at all times,

539
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:28,164
so if he does break bad again,
I'll find him.

540
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,047
Which reminds me.
I'm gonna check in with Lyla

541
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,084
and make sure I understand
A.R.G.U.S.'s protocols.

542
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,062
I want to make sure
they give Grodd a real chance.

543
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,505
- Yeah.
- Hey, babe.

544
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,593
You're kidding? That's great. When?
Cisco's coming home.

545
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,227
Hey, um...

546
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:55,900
I wanted to say, uh,
I'm sorry I wasn't more welcoming.

547
00:37:57,026 --> 00:38:00,571
I mean, I was dealing
with this family thing.

548
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,616
I felt like everything
in my life was changing,

549
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:07,620
and I took that out on you.
And I'm sorry.

550
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,205
No, it's...

551
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,582
it's all good, Flash.

552
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,461
Um...

553
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,254
By the way...

554
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,740
Kamilla told me about your parents,

555
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:28,224
and I kinda hacked every cemetery
database within a 700-mile radius.

556
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,524
I found them.

557
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,654
I don't remember...

558
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:50,746
Thank you, Chester.

559
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,336
Do you mind manning the comms?

560
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,257
I thought you'd never ask.

561
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:07,388
According to our satellites,
it is Rathaway.

562
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,641
Pied Piper's back, baby.

563
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,911
Okay, I'm gonna need all the help
I can get to take him down.

564
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:15,146
- Are you ready?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

565
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,230
All right.

566
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,067
Oh, that's never gonna get old.

567
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,214
Eva, I'm so sorry.

568
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,150
Why didn't you tell me
that the machine could hurt you?

569
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:32,913
I wanted to prove I wasn't lying.
Words are worthless.

570
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,792
Evidence... evidence is irrefutable.

571
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:40,504
My colleagues ridiculed
my reflective theory.

572
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,258
Even though my research
was bleeding edge,

573
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,762
no scientific journal would publish it
because I hadn't shown it to be true.

574
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,722
I just...

575
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,267
I couldn't have you doubt me like that.
I just...

576
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,813
- I just needed you to believe me.
- Eva, of course I believe you.

577
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:03,027
I saw you move those mirror pieces.
You're capable of great things.

578
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,156
Look, when you're feeling better,
we will...

579
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,494
- We'll find another way.
- Yeah.

580
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,542
I think I have some more, uh,
bandages in the storage room.

581
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,420
- Could you get them?
- Yeah, of course.

582
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,190
What did you do to us?

583
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:45,069
I bought us time.
But there's no need for you to suffer.

584
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,174
Hmm.

585
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,027
All right. Easy-peasy.

586
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:41,125
He is...

587
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,794
coming.

588
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:51,818
