you never would have come after me.

479
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,882
- I love her more than you ever did.
- Drop the knife.

480
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,401
It won't be me that slits her throat.

481
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,762
Detective, that's gonna be you.

482
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,242
- Drop it.
- Jim, please.

483
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,727
Just leave us alone.

484
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,404
Hey. Jerk-o.

485
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,126
Barbara? Barbara?

486
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,131
- He's dead?
- Yeah. He's dead.

487
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,850
It's gonna be okay.

488
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,962
Look at me. Barbara.

489
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,651
It's gonna be okay.

490
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,127
Alfred, I never asked you...

491
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,241
how was it yesterday, seeing Reggie?

492
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,609
Not really an experience I'd
care to repeat, Master Bruce.

493
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,570
But then again,
the Reggie I knew died years ago.

494
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,566
Alfred, I haven't been honest with you.

495
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,562
After you were hurt...

496
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,491
Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

497
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,847
We found him.

498
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,682
Did you, now?

499
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,486
He didn'tjump or fall.

500
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,806
Selina pushed him.

501
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,448
And why did she do that?

502
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,331
Reggie was sent here by a man
named Sid Bunderslaw.

503
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,207
Bunderslaw works for Wayne Enterprises.

504
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,606
Reggie gave us the name...

505
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,604
but said he was gonna tell Bunderslaw
what we were doing.

506
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,444
I see.

507
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,810
And the rest?

508
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,845
The charity ball?

509
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,162
Presumably to have access
to Mr. Bunderslaw.

510
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,044
Selina stole the key to his office safe.

511
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,131
I went there today. It was empty.

512
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,569
But Bunderslaw was waiting for me.

513
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,963
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

514
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,247
But he said that my
father and grandfather...

515
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,564
knew about the illegal things that
the company was doing, and chose...

516
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,367
They chose to stay quiet.

517
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,725
[SIGHS]

518
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,446
Your father was a good man.

519
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,085
I know.

520
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,490
But even good men have secrets.

521
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,370
MAN 1: Good job.
MAN 2: Yeah.

522
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,369
MAN 1: Very well deserved.
MAN 3: Well done.

523
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,006
- Man of the hour.
- Please.

524
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,404
MAN 3: Very well.
MAN 4: That guy right there.

525
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,528
Congratulations. You're a hero.

526
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,445
It won't last.
Tomorrow they'll go back to hating me.

527
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,090
Well, then I'll remind them.

528
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,845
Yesterday you were trying to help.
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

529
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,131
I would never try to change you, Jim.

530
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,965
Your sense of mission,
it's part of what I love about you.

531
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,521
I thought it was my devastating good looks.

532
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,727
That's a joke.

533
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,246
I was scared.

534
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,604
Scared that Barbara would get hurt...

535
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,923
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first...

536
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,447
and then whatever we had would die.

537
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,124
It wasn't heroic. It was selfish.

538
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,960
Lee, I love you.

539
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,161
Not her.

540
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,169
If I had to do it again,
I'd still protect you first.

541
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,404
What did you do?

542
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,404
Grabbed a knife by the blade.

543
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,851
Of course you did.

544
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,327
- Let me see.
- Agh.

545
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,844
Ms. Kringle?

546
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,331
Are you okay?

547
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,681
I got a letter from Officer Dougherty.

548
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,924
He left town.

549
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,851
"Don't wait around for me.

550
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,083
Go have some fun, and maybe
I'll give you a call when I get back."

551
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,211
Blah-blah-blah.
Couldn't even tell me to my face.

552
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,284
I mean, why do I keep picking creeps?

553
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,884
Sometimes with men,
you need to read between the lines.

554
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,368
Sometimes with men, you need a drink.

555
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,561
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

556
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,524
Read between the lines.

557
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,926
Everybody listen up.

558
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,729
Just got wind of three attacks on Falcone
businesses in different parts of town.

559
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,123
Word is it's Maroni.

560
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,645
As of right now, all leaves are canceled and
all units are called in for active duty.

561
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,804
We're in a shooting war, people.
