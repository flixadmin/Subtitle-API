I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,640
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

Oh, look, Zazu.

You've made me lose my lunch.

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,440
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,960
I quiver with fear!

70
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,640
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
Help!

-Scar?
-Mm-hmm?

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Drop him.

74
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,880
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,080
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,320
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,280
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,320
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

85
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,440
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,200
I shall practice my curtsy!

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,320
Oh, no, Mufasa.

89
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

(ROARS)

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,240

92
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
Temper, temper.

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,040
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

94
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,040
Pity. Why not?

95
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,440
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

96
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,880
But when it comes to brute strength,

97
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,480
There's one in every family, sire.

99
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,120
Two in mine, actually,

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,360
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,400
What am I going to do with him?

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,200
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
Zazu!

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,880
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

105
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,040
you could take him out and beat him.

106

Dad! Come on, Dad.

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,200

Yeah!

00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
MUFASA: Look, Simba.

122
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

123
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
Wow.

124
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,440
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

125
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,440
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,960
and will rise with you as the new king.

127
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,720
-And this'll all be mine?
-Everything.

128
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,680
Everything the light touches.

129
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,920
What about that shadowy place?

130
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,160
That's beyond our borders.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,600
You must never go there, Simba.

132
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

133
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,200
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

134
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,600
-There's more?
-(LAUGHS) Simba...

135
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,800
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

136
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,840
As king, you need to
understand that balance

137
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,640
and respect all the creatures,

138
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,560
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

139
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,520
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

140
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

141
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,200
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

142
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,960
and the antelope eat the grass.

143
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,360
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

144
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,640
-Good morning, sire!
-Good morning, Zazu.

145
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Checking in with the morning report.

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
Fire away.

147
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
Well! The buzz from the bees

148
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,440
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

149
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,680
Really?

150
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
What are you doing, son?

151
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,720
Pouncing.

152
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,080
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

153
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

154
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,080
-Zazu, would you turn around?
-Yes, sire.

155
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

156
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,960
Stay low to the ground.

157
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
Cheetahs never prosper...

158
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,480
(WHISPERING) Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

159
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,760
-What going on?
-A pouncing lesson.

160
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Very good. Pouncing.

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,560
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

162
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
This is so humiliating.

163
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,080
Try not to make a sound.

164
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,360
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

165
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,680
Mufasa? Simba?

166
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
(MUFASA LAUGHS)

167
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
That's very good.

168
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,760
-Zazu!
-Yes!

169
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,440
-News from the underground.
-Now, this time...

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,800
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

171
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,360
Zazu, take Simba home.

172
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,640
Aw, dad, can't I come?

173
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,800
No, son.

174
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.

175
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,280
Oh, young master,
one day, you will be king.

176
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

177
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,320
from dawn until dusk.

178
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,760
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

179
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,960
I despise guessing games.

180
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,120
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

181
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,360
Oh, goody!

182
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,280
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

183
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,320
and I'm gonna rule it all!

184
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,280
Bad back, you know.

186
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,520
Hey, Uncle Scar.

187
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,960
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

188
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,320
A monkey's uncle.

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,160
-You're so weird.
-You have no idea.

190
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,480
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

191
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,600
Everything.

192
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,280
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

193
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,760
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

194
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
And he's absolutely right.

195
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
It's far too dangerous.

196
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,840
Only the bravest lions go there.

197
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,520
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

198
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

199
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
Why not?

200
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favorite nephew.

201
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,640
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

202
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,240
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

203
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,520
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

204
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,280
An elephant what? Whoa!

205
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,440
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

206
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,360
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

207
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,440
you being so clever and all.

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
Just do me one favor.

209
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,920
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
No problem.

211
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
There's a good lad.

212
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,960
You run along now and have fun.

213
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
And remember,

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,160
it's our little secret.

215
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,240
-Hey, Nala.
-Hi, Simba.

216
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

217
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,080
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

218
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,240
SARABI: And it's time for yours.

219
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,400
Mom!

220
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,360
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

221
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,200
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

222
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,600
So, where are we going?

223
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,200
It better not be anyplace dumb.

224
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,120
No, it's really cool.

225
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,720
So, where is this really cool place?

226
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,240
Oh.

227
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,960
-Uh, around the water hole.
-The water hole?

228
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,840
What's so great about the water hole?

229
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,080
I'll show you when we get there.

230
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,320
Oh.

231
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,240
Uh, mom, can I go with Simba?

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Hmm, what do you think, Sarabi?

233
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,720
Well...

234
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,200
BOTH: Please?

235
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,440
It's all right with me.

236
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,600
-Yeah!
-All right!

237
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,640
As long as Zazu goes with you.

238
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,560
No, not Zazu.

239
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,840
ZAZU: Step lively.

240
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,920
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

241
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
So, where are we really going?

242
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,400
An elephant graveyard.

243
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,480
Wow!

244
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,080
Shh! Zazu.

245
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,840
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

246
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,800
Oh, just look at you two.

247
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,000
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

248
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,280
Your parents will be thrilled,

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,760
what with your being betrothed and all.

250
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Be-what?

251
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,680
Betrothed. Intended.

252
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Affianced.

253
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,800
Meaning...

254
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,920
One day, you two are
going to be married.

255
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
-Yuck!
-Eww!

256
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,360
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

257
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

258
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
Sorry to bust your bubble,

259
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,360
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

260
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,840
It's a tradition going back generations.

261
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,520
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

262
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,440
-Not so long as I'm around.
-Well, in that case, you're fired.

263
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,880
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, he's the future king.

265
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,040
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

266
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,560
Not yet, I don't.

267
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,120
And with an attitude like that,

268
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

269
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,680
Not the way I see it.

270
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,880
(SINGING) <i>I'm gonna be a mighty king</i>

271
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,000
<i>So enemies beware</i>

272
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,720
<i>Well, I've never seen</i>
<i>a king of beasts</i>

273
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,960
<i>With quite so little hair</i>

274
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,640
<i>I'm gonna be the main event</i>

275
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
<i>Like no king was before</i>

276
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,480
<i>I'm brushin' up on lookin' down</i>

277
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,680
<i>I'm workin' on my roar</i>

278
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,400
<i>Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing</i>

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

280
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

281
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,080
<i>-No one sayin', "Do this"</i>
<i>-Now, when I said that...</i>

282
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
<i>-No one saying, "Be there"</i>
<i>-What I meant was...</i>

283
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,960
<i>-No one sayin', "Stop that"</i>
<i>-You don't realize...</i>

284
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,880
<i>-No one sayin', "See here"</i>
<i>-Now, see here!</i>

285
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,280
<i>Free to run around all day</i>

286
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,960
Well, that's definitely out.

287
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
<i>Free to do it all my way</i>

288
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,400
<i>I think it's time that you and I</i>

289
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,520
<i>Arranged a heart-to-heart</i>

290
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,400
<i>Kings don't need advice</i>

291
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,040
<i>From little hornbills for a start</i>

292
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,600
<i>If this is where</i>
<i>the monarchy is headed</i>

293
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,840
<i>Count me out</i>

294
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,400
<i>Out of service, out of Africa</i>

295
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
<i>I wouldn't hang about</i>

296
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,440
<i>This child is getting</i>
<i>wildly out of wing</i>

297
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,040
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

298
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,320
<i>Everybody, look left</i>

299
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,240
<i>Everybody, look right</i>

300
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,800
<i>Everywhere you look, I'm</i>

301
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,480
<i>Standing in the spotlight</i>

302
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,280
Not yet!

303
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,120
<i>Let every creature</i>
<i>go for broke and sing</i>

304
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,080
<i>Let's hear it in the herd</i>
<i>and on the wing</i>

305
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,800
<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>King Simba's finest fling</i>

306
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,800
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

307
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,720
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

308
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,640
<i>Oh, I just can't wait</i>

309
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,960
<i>To be king</i>

310
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,920
ZAZU: (MUFFLED)
I beg your pardon, madam, but

311
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,000
get off!

312
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,680
Simba?

313
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Nala!

314
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,360
(LAUGHING)

315
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,760
All right! It worked!

316
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,360
-We lost him.
-I am a genius.

317
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

318
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,760
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

319
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,800
-With me!
-Oh, yeah?

320
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,120
-Pinned ya.
-Hey, let me up!

321
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,880
(LAUGHING)

322
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,960
Pinned ya again.

323
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,680
This is it. We made it.

324
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,480
Whoa!

325
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,920
NALA: It's really creepy.

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,080
Yeah.

327
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,400
Isn't it great?

328
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,680
-We could get in big trouble.
-I know!

329
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

330
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,840
There's only one way to know.

331
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,680
Come on, let's go check it out.

332
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,440
Wrong! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

333
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,760
Oh, man!

334
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,360
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

335
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,000
Look, banana beak is scared.

336
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,920
It's Mr. banana beak to you, fuzzy,

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,400
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

338
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
Danger? Ha!

339
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
I walk on the wild side.

340
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,360
I laugh in the face of danger.

341
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,960

Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

344
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,520
I don't know, Shenzi.

345
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,920
What do you think, Ed?

(CRAZY LAUGHTER)

347
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,960
Just what I was thinking.

348
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,040
A trio of trespassers!

349
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,400
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

350
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
A simple navigational error.

351
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

352
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,400
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

353
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,760
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

354
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,480
And that would make you...

355
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,800
The future king.

356
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,520
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

357
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,320
Huh! You can't do anything to me.

358
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,640
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

359
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,000
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

-My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,040
-It's time to go!
-What's the hurry?

363
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,000
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

364
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,520
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around!

365

Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!

Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

369

No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

Yes, sire?

-I know.
-You could've been killed.

You deliberately disobeyed me,

and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

I was just trying to be brave, like you.

I'm only brave when I have to be.

Simba, being brave

416
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,040
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

417

But you're not scared of anything.

418

-You were?

that my father told me.

Look at the stars.

438

The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

-Really?
-Yes.

just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,160
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

647
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,840
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

648
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,320
-Can we keep him?
-Pumbaa, are you nuts?

649
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,680
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

650
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,200
-But he's so little.
-He's going to get bigger.

651
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,440
Maybe he'll be on our side.

652
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

653
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,960
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

654
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,360
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

655
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,520
So we're keeping him?

656
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,840
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

657
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,560
-Uh...
-My point exactly.

658
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,920
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

659
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,720
-You okay, kid?
-I guess so.

660
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,080
You nearly died.

661
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,800
-I saved you.
-(SNORTS)

662
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

663
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,960
Thanks for your help.

664
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,400
Hey, where you going?

665
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,720
Nowhere.

666
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,120
Gee, he looks blue.

667
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,480
-I'd say brownish gold.
-No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

668
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Kid, what's eating you?

669
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,320
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

670
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,280
The food chain!

671
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,280
Ahem.

672
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,800
So, where you from?

673
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
Who cares? I can't go back.

674
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,400
Ah, you're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

675
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,920
-What'd you do, kid?
-Something terrible.

676
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
-But I don't want to talk about it.
-We don't want to hear about it.

677
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,240
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

678
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,000
Not unless you can change the past.

679
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,320
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

680
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,920
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

681
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,600
No, no, no.

682
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,040
-I mean...
-Amateur.

683
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,280
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

684
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,480
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

685
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,600
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

686
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,720
-Right.
-Wrong!

687
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,400
When the world turns its back on you,

688
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,200
you turn your back on the world.

689
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,200
Well, that's not what I was taught.

690
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,480
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

691
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,880

It is beautiful.

But I don't understand something.

978
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,840
You've been alive all this time.

979
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,240
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

980
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,120
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

981
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,080
And I did, and it's great.

982
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,280
We've really needed you at home.

983
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,560
-No one needs me.
-Yes, we do. You're the king.

984
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,720
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

985
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,640
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

986
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,720
-What?
-Everything's destroyed.

987
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,480
There's no food, no water.

988
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,240
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

989
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,560
-I can't go back.
-Why?

990
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,920
-You wouldn't understand.
-What?

No, no, no. It doesn't matter.

It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

Simba...

995
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,600
...and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

996
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,200
-Because it's your responsibility.
-Well, what about you? You left.

997
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,120
I left to find help, and I found you.

998
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,680
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

-Sorry.
-What's happened to you?

1000
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,600
-You're not the Simba I remember.
-You're right. I'm not.

1001
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,280
-Now are you satisfied?
-No. Just disappointed.

1002
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,200
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

1003
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,240
Good. At least one of us does.

1004
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,600
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

1005
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,720
You don't even know
what I've been through.

1006
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,160
I would if you'd just tell me.

1007
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,080
-Forget it!
-Fine!

1008
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,760
She's wrong. I can't go back.

1009

What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

You can't change the past.

1011

You said you'd always be there for me!

But you're not.

1013

you can either run from it

1118
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,960
-It's awful, isn't it?
-I didn't want to believe you.

1119
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,960
What made you come back?

1120
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,920
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1121
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,320
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1122
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,040
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1123
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,160
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1124
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,280
-I will.
-It's gonna be dangerous.

1125
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,800
Danger? Ha!
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha!

1126
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,680
I see nothing funny about this.

1127
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,760
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

1128
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,040
At your service, my liege.

1129
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,720
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle
for this?

1130
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,520
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1131
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,960
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

1132
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,520
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1133
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,160
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1134
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,680
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1135
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,160
-Live bait.
-Good idea. Hey!

1136
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,040
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1137
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,760
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

They're not doing their job.

1154

Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

No, you're just not

It's over. There is nothing left.

1157

We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

-We're not going anywhere.
-You have sentenced us to death.

-Then so be it.
-You can't do that.

1160

I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

No. It's me.

Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

1169

It doesn't matter. I'm home.

Simba?

1171

Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you

1172
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,480
alive.

1173
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,600
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1174
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,680
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

1175
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,120
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1176
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,440
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1177
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

1178
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,000
However, there is one little problem.

1179
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,880
You see them?

1180
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,880
They think I'm king.

1181
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,720
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1182
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,720
The choice is yours, Scar.

1183
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,320
Either step down or fight.

1184
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,840
Oh, must this all end in violence?

1185
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:44,120
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1186
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,480
-Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
-That's not gonna work, Scar.

1187
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,120
I've put it behind me.

1188
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,000
But what about your faithful subjects?

1189
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,080
Have they put it behind them?

1190
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,200
Simba, what is he talking about?

1191
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,520
Ah, so you haven't told them
your little secret.

1192
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,000
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1193
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,240
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1194
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,520
I am.

1195
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,400
It's not true.

1196
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,200
Tell me it's not true.

1197
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,840
-It's true.
-You see? He admits it!

1198
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,960
-Murderer!
-No! It was an accident.

1199
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,720
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

1200
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,440
-Do you deny it?
-No.

1201
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,640
-Then you're guilty.
-No, I'm not a murderer!

1202
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,080
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

1203
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,160
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1204
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,520
and now everyone knows why!

1206

Now, this looks familiar.

1207
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,840
Hmm.

1208
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,880
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think. Hmm.

1209
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,600
Oh, yes. I remember.

1210
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,880
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1211
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,440
And here's my little secret.

1212
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,040
(WHISPERING) I killed Mufasa.

1213
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,800
No! Murderer!

1214
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,040
-No, Simba, please.
-Tell them the truth.

1215
