1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,240
<i>Previously, on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,880
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.
I'm your new boss.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
Sid Bunderslaw.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm the Director
of Physical Operations.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,200
I've been expecting you.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Garrett, Pinkney, Josie, Martinez.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,240
Congratulations.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
You are now Unit Alpha
of the G.C.P.D Strike Force.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,080
Time to take down the Penguin.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Mother.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,800
You'll pay for this.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,320
They die, your mother lives.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,160
And I'm gonna need you
to take a crack on me also,

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,440
and miss, of course.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Get down!

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
If the bad guys
want to stop me running,

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,720
well then, I guess, I got no choice.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
I will run for mayor.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
Thank you for the trunk, old friend.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,120
I'll call you when I need you.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm glad you call me a friend.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Figure of speech.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,160
But do go on.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,920
I can't help feeling...

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,480
when I'd be so much more
useful to you as a friend,

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,640
best of colleague and ally?

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,280
As opposed to the tool
you are at present?

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Good question.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
No.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,480
I would be a much more
effective tool for you,

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,080
if I wasn't so worried
about my mother.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,440
If you let her come home
I would still do your bidding.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Trust me.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
I know who's boss now.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Lord have mercy.

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
No need to rub it in.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,040
Yes, sir.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,440
We all know who's boss.

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
What do you think, Tabitha?

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
I wasn't listening.

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,520
You know how I love
the big macho type.

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,720
- Leave him alone.
- Yeah, leave me alone.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,000
The answer is no, old friend.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Off you go.

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
Stay by the phone.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
I wish you wouldn't freak out
the help.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,400
Got a mayoral campaign to run.

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,920
I need to know you're gonna
handle this part of the business.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,280
- I get bored.
- I hate it when you say that,

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,480
you have plenty to do.

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,160
You have Mayor James
to play with it.

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,640
He's been here nearly a month,
he's getting old fast.

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,040
You have Barbara to hang out with.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Yeah, she's cool,
but she sleeps a lot.

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,720
- She's gone crazy.
- That's the best part about her.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,440
Galavan, what the hell is going on?

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,600
Mr. Bunderslaw, welcome.

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,840
Well, what do you want with me?

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,880
You are the garbage man
for Wayne Enterprises, correct?

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,080
Every nasty little thing
the company has done,

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,520
you know all about it.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
- No.
- Yes.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,560
And you're gonna tell us
everything that you know.

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
And if I refuse?

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Torture.

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
But that's for later.

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Right now, there is something
of yours we need to borrow.

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
Sister, if you don't mind.

69
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
- Left or right?
- Either one.

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,880
Everybody who doesn't want to
get shot raise your hand.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Get down!

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,280
{\an5}A damn rocket launcher?

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
{\an5}Welcome to Gotham, Cap.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,360
{\an5}I can fit my yearly salary
in my hands.

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,920
{\an5}Don't get any ideas
about that cash, son.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
{\an5}Just bag it up.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
{\an5}Don't worry, sir,
ideas aren't his strong suit.

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
{\an5}Did some rough calculations, sir.

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,560
{\an5}It's somewhere around
two million dollars here.

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
{\an5}That's a strong body blow
to Penguin.

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,160
{\an5}- He'll feel it.
- Sir.

82
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,920
They're asking for their pants.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
{\an5}Read them their rights.
Doesn't say squat about pants.

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Wait.

85
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
{\an5}Tell them whoever gives up where
they got the damn rocket launcher

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
{\an5}gets to wear pants.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,960
The rest can go naked for all I care.

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,440
Captain, a word.

89
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
{\an5}There's a place called the Merc.

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,960
{\an5}It sells most of the heavy
weapons in town.

91
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,440
{\an5}They haven't been hit because
they pay off half the city council.

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
{\an5}Merc, huh?

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
{\an5}City council can suck my tailpipe.

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
{\an5}We're gonna hit this Merc tomorrow.

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,040
{\an5}Pinkney.

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
{\an5}Belay that order.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
{\an5}No one gets pants.

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an5}We grab him up!

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,120
{\an5}We grab him and we hurt him
till he tells us where she is

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
{\an5}and then we hurt him more!

101
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,920
{\an5}- Okay, is that a good idea?
- Do you have a better one?

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,680
{\an5}- We can get the sister.
- And then what?

103
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
{\an5}He's still out there!

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,640
{\an5}And does he love his sister
as much as I love my mother?

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,080
{\an5}I don't think so!

106
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
{\an5}There's a pickle.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Mr. Penguin, sir.

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
The cops just hit the count house.

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,040
They took everything, every dollar.

110
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,680
Did you enjoy giving me that news?

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,200
Butch, I have an idea.

112
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,120
- Hey, you.
- Good morning.

113
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
How's your day look?

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
Strike Force is going out
on another raid.

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,400
Strike Force. I hate that name.

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah, I'm not wild about it myself,

117
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,200
but Barnes gets things done,
he can call us what he likes.

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,480
All right, so you go strike
with your force,

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
- and what are we doing tonight?
- Sleep.

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,000
- It's date night, mister.
- With who?

121
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
- Morning, Ed.
- Detective, Ms. Thompkins.

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,000
As you may have heard, I've recently
been seeing Ms. Kringle.

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,960
Kristen.

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,000
And she mentioned
that it might be nice

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
to go out with other people along.

126
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,080
So I thought perhaps

127
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,920
the two of you would enjoy
joining us for dinner tonight.

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
- We can't.
- We'd love to.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,120
Sure.

130
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Great.

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,760
As a matter of fact, I just
bought some new fondue pots.

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
Why don't we do it at my house?

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
Excellent.

134
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
Excellent. I'll go tell Kristen.

135
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,160
I know. I know.

136
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
But it was the decent thing to do.

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Fondue?

138
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,560
Have you ever tried it?
It's delicious.

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,600
It's at your place.

140
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,200
We can't leave, we're already home.

141
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,880
- Trapped.
- Don't be mean.

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
I'll make it fun.

143
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,880
Detective Gordon. Good morning.

145
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,840
I wonder if we could talk alone.

146
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Of course.

147
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Thank you for giving me
some of your valuable time.

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Not a problem.

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,040
That night at the gala, I...

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just keep going through it.

151
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Me too.

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
I never killed a man before.

153
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,720
Fear, blood...

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,080
I relive that moment over and over.

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,840
Do those thoughts ever go away?

156
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,040
No.

157
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
But over time they lose their power.

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
You did the right thing.

159
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
I guess I did.

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm kind of amazed at myself.

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,640
But you doing the right thing
is what you do everyday.

162
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,120
It's why people speak
so highly of you.

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,440
You're a symbol
to the people of this city,

164
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
of hope, of honor.

165
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
That's why I'm here.

166
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,880
I would be honored
if you would consider

167
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
endorsing me for mayor.

168
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
Endorsement.

169
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm flattered but I'm afraid
policeman and politics don't mix.

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
Maybe not for a cop on the street

171
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,040
but your president
of the policemen's union.

172
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Where you lead, officers will follow.

173
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,760
That's more power than the kind
that comes out of a gun.

174
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,160
You seem like a good man.

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,160
But, I'm afraid
my answer has to be no.

176
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
I don't do endorsements.

177
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,040
I know better than to push.

178
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
But think about it.

179
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
We could really help each other.

180
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Hi, Penguin.

181
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
- What do you want?
- Why so glum?

182
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,520
I just lost all my money.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
Poor sad little brat head.

184
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,920
The money is immaterial.

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,560
Someone must have betrayed me.

186
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Someone close.

187
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
You don't know that, boss.

188
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Oh, don't I?

189
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,480
- Don't I?
- Whoa, chill, birdman.

190
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,120
- I got a job for you.
- What's that?

191
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,360
Addresses of places
you're gonna burn to the ground.

192
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Starting tonight.

193
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Arson now.

194
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,960
Sure. Fine. Whatever.

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,280
If I can find a trustworthy arsonist.

196
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
Paranoid, huh?

197
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,960
Get your head together,
little man, and get it done.

198
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,560
Oh, and whoever starts a fire
is gonna need this.

199
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Nice place.

200
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
What's up?

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
I need you to take me
to the Pike brothers.

202
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,640
The firebugs from the Narrows?

203
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,360
I used to hang with their sister
Bridgit when I was a kid.

204
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,840
- Why do you need me to take you?
- To vouch for me.

205
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,360
The Pikes are the best arsonist
in town...

206
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
but they're also a Fish loyalists.

207
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,880
The idiots think
she's coming back someday.

208
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
She might come back.

209
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
- I was there, darling.
- She might.

210
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,960
Whatever.

211
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
The Pikes hate me and Penguin
for obvious reasons.

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,200
But everyone knows Fish loved you.

213
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,120
They do?

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
Your face will open doors, babe.

215
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,000
- Six hundred.
- Three-fifty.

216
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Fine.

217
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,600
Just let me do the talking.

218
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
You just smile and make
it look like we're friends.

219
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Friends?

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's a hundred extra.

221
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Chisler.

222
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,920
So everybody knows she loved me?

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,040
That's what they say.

224
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
She loved me too once.

225
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,040
- I loved her.
- Then you shot her.

226
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Well...

227
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
it was complicated.

228
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Got that right.

229
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Hi, Bridgit.

230
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
Hey, Selina.

231
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
It's been a while.

232
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,560
Me and my pet gorilla
are here on business.

233
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Your brother's home?

234
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Yeah.

235
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Hey, boys.

236
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,240
What are you doing
with this rat, Selina?

237
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,120
He's okay. I vouch for him.

238
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,960
What do you mean "okay"?
The bastard shot Fish Mooney.

239
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
It was complicated.

240
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,960
He loves her just like you do.

241
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,160
- And if she ever comes back...
- When she comes back.

242
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,280
When she does
he will be right by her side.

243
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,080
If she comes back. Sure. But she...

244
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,880
But right now,
he got a nice job for you guys.

245
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Business is business, right?

246
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,640
Hey, bygones, huh?

247
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,640
We need the best
and you guys are the best.

248
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Easy.

249
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,080
- It's a lot of work.
- A lot of pay.

250
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
You up for it?

251
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
For sure.

252
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
We'll need more gear.

253
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,760
I'll hit the Merc and stock up.

254
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,080
Got enough gear
to burn down Gotham twice.

255
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,480
There's always room for more napalm.

256
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Thanks.

257
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Hey, sis.

258
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,560
What are you, a slop?
We have company.

259
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
What do we do
when we have company?

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,160
Get them a glass.

261
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,840
Ding, ding, ding. Go and do it.

262
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Thank you, Bridgit.

263
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
You're gonna need this.

264
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Looks like rain.

266
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,960
Yeah, it does.

267
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
I don't mind it.

268
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,600
Cleans the streets anyhow.

269
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
That's true.

270
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Anyway.

271
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,120
Take care of yourself, Bridgit.

272
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Be strong.

273
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,200
<i>Yeah, can we get a price check
on brass knuckles in toxic green?</i>

274
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,680
Three hundred gets it done.

275
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,600
And ten percent surcharge
for soiled bills.

276
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,400
Thank you kindly.

277
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,960
<i>Try our Whiff-Away.
On sale now in Aisle Seven.</i>

278
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,240
<i>Welcome to Merc, your one-stop shop
for machetes, night-vision goggles,</i>

279
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,240
<i>and all of your personal
defense needs.</i>

280
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Robbery.

281
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,920
- G.C.P.D!
- Everybody on the ground.

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is a raid!

283
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Spread!

284
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I got him!

285
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Stop! Stop right now!

286
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,280
What the hell are you packing?

287
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,200
When cheese melts
the protein matrix relaxes,

288
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,400
and the fats flow more like liquid.

289
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,760
It creates this low friction
mouthfeel

290
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,360
- which is why melted cheese is so...
- Ed.

291
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
Well, it's delicious.

292
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Yes, it is.

293
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Oh, no.

294
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
Lee, we should be eating
without Jim here.

295
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,800
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, please.

296
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Eat. It's fine.

297
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,120
- There he is.
- Hello there.

298
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,360
- Hey, Jim, nice to see you.
- Sorry, I'm late.

299
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,640
Really sorry. Long story.

300
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,560
I hope it hasn't been going too bad.

301
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
I know, it's the weirdest thing.

302
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,800
But Nygma's actually maintaining
this strange sort of cool.

303
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,280
- No.
- Seriously.

304
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,760
There's a lid for every pot.

305
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,040
Pardon me,
since Detective Gordon is here.

306
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,280
I'd like to propose a toast.

307
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,920
The less you have
the more they're worth.

308
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
To friends.

309
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Hear hear.

310
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
I can't believe he's dead.

311
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,400
Biggest job of our lives
and this happens.

312
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,440
So, what do we do?

313
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,040
For sure we do the job.

314
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,640
How? We're screwed.

315
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,560
Who's our entry man now?

316
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,680
Crawling to rear vents,
climbing fire escapes.

317
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,240
We need a little skinny guy.

318
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You think.

319
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,680
Hey, Bridgie.

320
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,200
You just got a promotion.

321
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,560
- No.
- Yes.

322
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,520
Please, you know I don't like fire.

323
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
You don't like fire?

324
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,960
Fire is our bread and butter.
It's our family business.

325
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,800
You don't wanna let down
your family, do you?

326
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
You're not my family.

327
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,720
What's that?

328
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
We're not your family?

329
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
- You got anybody else?
- My mother...

330
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
Your mother was a hoe.
And she's dead.

331
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,920
Who feeds you? Who puts a roof
above your head, huh?

332
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
We do. That's family.

333
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
I won't do it.

334
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,280
Fine, be like that.
But if you're not family,

335
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,280
well, that changes things
around here, though.

336
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,720
See, I'm a decent guy.

337
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,520
I would never put family
on the street.

338
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,720
But if you're not family...

339
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,160
well, why not make a buck.

340
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,560
Yo, that's a kick-ass idea.

341
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
So, what are you gonna do?

342
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,920
Do you wanna be turned out?

343
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Or do you wanna be family?

344
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Which?

345
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Family.

346
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,840
He wanted me
to endorse him for mayor.

347
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,920
Wow. What did you say?

348
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
I said no.

349
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,400
- You don't like him?
- I do actually.

350
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,840
But I know better
than to let that matter.

351
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,920
Endorsing politicians, that's not me.

352
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,480
Still, he asked you,
that's very flattering.

353
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,160
You're a respected figure
in this town.

354
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,080
The way people look at you,
see you differently.

355
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,160
You treat it like it's a burden.

356
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,400
It could be a source of pride
or happiness even if you let it.

357
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Thank you, Doctor.
Same time next week.

358
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Don't tempt me.

359
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,440
I could psychoanalyse
a heck out of you.

360
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
But I'm gonna resist the urge.

361
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Gee, thanks.

362
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,720
Be strong, Bridgit.

363
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Okay.

364
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,120
- It's on.
- Now.

365
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
You gonna want to cut yourself
about a foot and a half of fuse.

366
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
Okay.

367
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,840
Push the wick
into the plastic explosive.

368
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
Okay.

369
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Now get out the flame.

370
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,160
You got about a minute and a half
to get out of there

371
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
once that fuse is light.

372
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Spark it up.

373
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,600
- It's lit.
- Okay, great. Look.

374
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Sorry, there's one more thing to do.

375
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,480
- But it's lit.
- Well, you better hull ass.

376
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,760
Do you see a safe on your right?

377
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,240
- Yeah.
- Get to it.

378
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Okay.

379
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,040
- Okay.
- Okay, now grab the box

380
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,640
at the bottom of the bag
and open it up.

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, my God.

382
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,000
Grody, right?

383
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,480
Okay, put it to the center
next to the door.

384
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
<i>Welcome, Mr. Bunderslaw.</i>

385
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,640
Okay. It's open. Now, what?

386
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Joe?

387
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Joe, where are you?

388
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,520
- Joe, what's wrong?
- I'm just messing with you.

389
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
Okay, so there should be
an old knife there. Grab it.

390
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
- Okay. Got it.
- Okay.

391
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,520
Now, scram.

392
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,880
Attagirl.

393
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
You did good, sis.
Get in the van. Chop-chop.

394
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,600
I burned my leg.

395
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,880
Well, you play with fire,
you get burn, all of that.

396
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,640
We got four more of this
to do tonight,

397
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,840
so get in the damn van.

398
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,600
Five locations,
all burned to the ground.

399
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,280
- Yeah, Garrett?
- Excuse me, sir.

400
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,880
Lab called in said the fires
were started with termite

401
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
and high-end accelerants.

402
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,600
So we're looking
for a professional arsonist.

403
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,920
Thanks.

404
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And, Garrett, nice work yesterday.

405
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Thank you, sir.

406
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Strange.

407
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,080
Why would a pro do five jobs
in one night?

408
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,200
- What's the rush?
- And what if they're not done?

409
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
Find a pattern to these fires,

410
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,920
before they burn down
the whole city.

411
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
What are you doing?

412
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,680
Hi. Making a suit.

413
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,600
So I won't get burned again.

414
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,560
Why would you get burned again?

415
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,840
So they're making you
start the fires?

416
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I guess.

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
Sit down.
You want a soda or something?

418
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,600
No. I, I can't. I'm suppose
to take that to Penguin.

419
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Okay.

420
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,880
You know you're gonna get
yourself killed.

421
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,080
I'll be careful.

422
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,920
Well, careful ain't enough.
Look what happened already.

423
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,440
It was exciting, Selina.
I actually kind of enjoyed it.

424
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,720
Yup, you're gonna be bacon.

425
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,080
My brothers said I did a good job.

426
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,000
- It's the family business.
- They're not your family.

427
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Your mom used to bang
their old man.

428
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
Is all.

429
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,720
You don't need them.

430
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,120
You don't need anybody.
Look at me. I'm free.

431
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
I remember when I was little
and you showed up at the Narrows.

432
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,480
You looked for your mom everyday.

433
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,640
Snot all down your face from crying.

434
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,560
So don't act like
you don't want a family.

435
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,160
- Don't talk about my mom.
- Who cares if you're free.

436
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,080
What good is freedom if you're alone?

437
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,520
What good is a family
if you're a slave?

438
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Whatever.

439
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,800
I don't even know
why you think I care.

440
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Doesn't make any sense.

441
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,320
This is the Wayne family crest.

442
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
So what?

443
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,520
Why does Galavan want an antique
knife that belong to the Waynes?

444
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
There's something here.

445
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,160
Something to understanding Galavan.

446
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
To beating him.

447
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,360
Well, if you wanna know
about old-time Gotham,

448
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
talk to Edwige.

449
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,320
Edwige?

450
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,440
Yeah. She runs the antique shop
in my old neighborhood.

451
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,520
Trust me. She knows things.

452
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,360
You can pick it up if you like.

453
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
That's okay.

454
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Sorry.

455
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,480
I can't help you.

456
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Edwige.

457
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,280
I can see that you know this knife.

458
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,200
You're scared of this knife.

459
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Why?

460
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,240
- Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

461
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Madame.

462
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,400
If there's one thing I know,
it's a liar.

463
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,360
Now, tell me about this knife.

464
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,720
Or I will use it.

465
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,840
This knife has a cursed history.

466
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,840
Almost 200 years ago,
it was used in a terrible crime.

467
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,880
Back then, five families
ruled Gotham High Society.

468
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,400
The Elliots, the Canes,
the Crowns, the Dumont,

469
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,160
and the most powerful
of them all, the Waynes.

470
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,800
They called Celestine Wayne,
the Crowned Jewel of Gotham.

471
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,680
A real beauty.

472
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,080
She was promised to the eldest son
of the Elliot family.

473
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,800
But there was another
who coveted her.

474
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Caleb Dumont.

475
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
One night...

476
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,000
it was during an Easter party
at the Wayne Manor.

477
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,600
Celestine and Caleb went missing.

478
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,920
The Wayne men found them,
together, in an illicit embrace.

479
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,080
Caleb insisted
that they were in love and...

480
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Celestine swore
on her mother's grave,

481
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,800
that Caleb had forced himself on her.

482
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,760
Justice, if that's what it was,
was swift.

483
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,120
Celestine's brother Jonathan Wayne,
delivered the punishment.

484
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,680
The Waynes, they were mad with rage.

485
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,760
They ceased the Dumont Holdings
and banished them socially.

486
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,920
Destroyed them.

487
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,680
Caleb Dumont went into exile overseas

488
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
to a penitentiary
of a religious sect,

489
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,440
founded by his family's patron saint.

490
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,640
Celestine died an old maid.

491
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,080
The Waynes forbade the press
from even mentioning the Dumont.

492
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,320
They renamed streets and buildings.

493
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,440
The remnants of the Dumont family
were forced to change their name.

494
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,480
The Waynes wiped the Dumont
out of our city's history.

495
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,240
Those remnants
of the Dumont family...

496
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
to what did they change their name?

497
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,440
Aren't you quick?

498
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Galavan.

499
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,600
They changed their name to Galavan.

500
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,840
Just like that fellow
running for mayor.

501
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,480
And that's why I am scared
of this knife!

502
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,680
You're in deep waters, Mr. Penguin.

503
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Thank you, Edwige.

504
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,960
That is where penguins thrive.

505
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,680
You hear anything about
any fires, you come see me,

506
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
earn yourself a "get out of jail"
free card, all right?

507
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,840
You got a look on your face.

508
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,120
It's well hidden behind
a bunch of corporate aliases.

509
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,880
But all the buildings
that burned down last night,

510
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
they have one landlord.

511
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Wayne Enterprises.

512
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,120
The arsonist moved east to west.

513
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,920
They come out tonight,
and stick to pattern,

514
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
there's one obvious target.

515
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,720
An old building also owned
by Wayne Enterprises.

516
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,560
Gotham City Book Depository.

517
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,440
Yay! Stakeout. I'll buy the donuts.

518
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Oh, just not chili dogs
this time, huh?

519
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
I'll let Barnes know the plan.

520
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,400
Sent the knife to Galavan.

521
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Your favorite, isn't it?

522
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,120
Cross white 20 year.

523
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
That's the stuff, all right.

524
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Have a taste.

525
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,400
No, I'm good right now. But thanks.

526
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Have a drink, Butch.

527
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,440
Your conditioning
is still working nicely, hmm?

528
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,120
You can't refuse me.

529
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,880
You're the only man
I can truly trust right now.

530
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,280
You're starting to sound
a little paranoid, boss.

531
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,160
Am I?

532
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Am I going mad?

533
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,400
How could I not? When that feign
has my mother in his clutches.

534
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Have another drink, Butch.

535
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,400
Maybe I am going mad.

536
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,920
Or maybe I found Galavan's weakness.

537
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
You did?

538
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
The knife, Butch.

539
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,280
The knife that maimed his ancestor.

540
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,880
This is a blood feud for Galavan.

541
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
He wants revenge against the Waynes.

542
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,640
He's acting out of emotion.

543
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,400
And that can be manipulated.

544
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Have another drink.

545
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,440
You are going to go to Galvan.

546
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,560
You're going to tell him I went nuts

547
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,160
and that I accuse you of setting
up the count shop raid.

548
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,960
You are in fear for your life
and you need a job. Got that?

549
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Yes, boss.

550
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,840
Once you're inside his organization

551
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,440
you will find my mother
and rescue her.

552
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,480
Yes, boss.

553
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,280
But, Galavan's a smart guy.

554
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Not to basic play.

555
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,640
No way is he gonna buy
a turned traitor.

556
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
No.

557
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,160
But he will buy that I think
you turned traitor.

558
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,680
He'll buy it if we sell it right.

559
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Drink up.

560
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,840
- How do we sell it?
- I already sold him my paranoia.

561
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,640
But you're the closer.

562
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
How do we sell you?

563
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,400
How do we make him
trust and feel for you?

564
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
I wasn't sure.

565
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,320
But then Celestine and Caleb
told me how.

566
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
How?

567
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,560
It's the onions
that bring it together.

568
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,120
The sweetness and the acid,
am I right?

569
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,240
I hate stakeouts.

570
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,240
Half of good police work

571
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,920
is the ability to sit on one's ass
when it's called for.

572
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,720
If that were true,
you'd be commissioner.

573
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,160
Hardy har har.

574
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Heads up.

575
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,040
All units standby.
We may have something.

576
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
<i>Roger.</i>

577
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,600
So, it's all old books in there,
so this one's easy.

578
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,600
Just spread the napalm around,
spark that thing up,

579
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,080
and go to town. Zero sweat.

580
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
This thing scares me.

581
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,440
Yeah, it's a flamethrower.
It's meant to be scary.

582
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,360
Get suited up. And get this done.

583
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,720
We got three more spots to hit.

584
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,240
All units converge
in our location now.

585
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
<i>Moving in.</i>

586
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,480
- G.C.P.D!
- Run.

587
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,200
Go, go, go!

588
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
Gray van leaving the alley.

589
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,720
Get back!

590
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,360
Please! Get back!

591
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
Drop it!

592
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
Put down the weapon.

593
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,400
Drop your weapon.

594
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,720
- I got her! Drop it!
- No!

595
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
No!

596
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Drop it!

597
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,520
No! Let me go!

598
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,080
Garrett!

599
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
I got him. I got him.

600
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
I need an ambulance. Officer down!

601
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,240
Bridgit! Bridgit!

602
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
Come on. Hurry!

603
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,800
Quick! Follow me!

604
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,240
- Were are we going?
- Home.

605
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Thanks.

606
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,040
- Any news?
- Not yet.

607
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,440
But he's a tough kid,
I bet you he makes it.

608
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,560
Your buddy's here.
Can't stop pressing the flesh.

609
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,120
A real publicity hound.

610
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
There's no cameras here.

611
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Your attention, please.

612
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Captain.

613
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,360
Luke Garrett passed away at 5:23.

614
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,120
- Damn it, man.
- It ain't right.

615
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,200
Burned to death in an alley
by some weirdo.

616
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,440
He was gonna be a great cop.

617
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
He was a great cop.

618
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
And we will mourn him.

619
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
But not now.

620
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,160
There's a cop killer on the loose.

621
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,200
I cannot abide that.

622
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,240
We will find the person
who killed our brother,

623
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,880
and we will put a stop to him.

624
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,560
Using any legal methods
at our disposal.

625
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Excuse me.

626
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,440
Your fellow officer is dead,
I can see it in your face.

627
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,960
He is.

628
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I'm sorry to hear that.

629
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,600
The bad guys in this town
are changing.

630
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,360
They're not playing by the old rules.

631
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Or any rules.

632
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,880
We need every method
at our disposal.

633
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,760
And I'm not just talking about
more guns.

634
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,400
You need to go where you need to go.

635
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Press who you need to press,
and have the city back your play.

636
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Correct.

637
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
I don't know how bad it's gonna get.

638
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,720
But if you can give me your word,

639
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,480
then we won't have to face it alone.

640
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
You'll have my endorsement.

641
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,160
I promise you,
you will have whatever you need.

642
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Father Creel.

643
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Theo.

644
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
It's been a long time.

645
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
You look well.

646
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
As do you.

647
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,680
You've surrounded yourself
with luxury.

648
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,680
Well, I have to play the part,
Father, and...

649
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
as you'll see...

650
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
it's paying off.

651
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,160
Still sharp after all these years.

652
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Do you have the Wayne boy?

653
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,600
Not yet.

654
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,800
There are some practical matters
I have to resolve first.

655
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,200
A few pieces to arrange
on the board before the checkmate.

656
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
But soon.

657
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,240
After almost 250 years
we can be patient.

658
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,400
The day of atonement is at hand.

659
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,200
Our brothers are crossing
the ocean even now.

660
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,080
Warriors like this city
has never known.

661
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,600
Gotham will be redeemed in blood.

662
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,480
And Bruce Wayne will die.
