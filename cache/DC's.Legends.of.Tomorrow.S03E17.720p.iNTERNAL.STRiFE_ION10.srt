1
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:10,789
Code 1-3-1! All hands on the bridge!

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,357
- What's going on?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,129
I gotta get back to "Lord of the Rings."

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,727
You read?

5
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,662
Code 1-3-1.

6
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,397
Come on, guys, I wrote
a whole a whole memo.

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,732
Yeah, nobody read it.

8
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:22,467
- I did.
- Thank you, Ray.

9
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,325
- Pancakes for breakfast.
- No, 1-3-1 is not... is it?

10
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:26,872
Yeah. Does that mean no pancakes?

11
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:29,374
Anyway, I wrote a song to
help us remember all the codes.

12
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:31,243
It goes like this. From the top!

13
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,629
♪ If the code is 1-1-1 ♪

14
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,148
♪ Mallus escaped the time dungeon ♪

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,083
♪ If the code is 1-1-2... ♪

16
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:39,417
All right, Nate, just tell us.

17
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,253
Someone stole the jumpship.

18
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,689
Where's Amaya?

19
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,659
Uh, according to the jumpship logs,

20
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,728
Zambesi, 1992.

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,597
Right before the warlords
destroyed her village.

22
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,599
And she dies.

23
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,668
The old her, that is.

24
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,772
Whoa, the temporal zone
is getting real choppy.

25
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:02,374
Yeah, the timeline was
crumbling even before Amaya

26
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:03,742
decided to change history.

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,143
If that happens, the Darhks will be able

28
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:06,678
to free their demon.

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,447
Oh, well, I'd better
get back to my movie.

30
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,949
And we'd better stop Amaya

31
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,507
before she does something reckless.

32
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,325
- Gideon, plot a course for...
- Pardon me, Captain Lance.

33
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,056
But we are receiving an
urgent call from Mr. Hunter.

34
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:20,117
- You good?
- Gideon, put him on.

35
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,194
The Bureau needs backup.

36
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:24,796
Grodd's going after Barry.

37
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,551
Well, that explains the time turbulence.

38
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:29,935
The Flash is always in trouble.

39
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,470
- It's kind of his thing.
- Not that particular Barry.

40
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,997
Barack Obama.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,860
It will almost be an honor to kill you.

42
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:02,997

43
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,371
All right, people, we're dealing with

44
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:09,341
two anachronisms now,
Zambesi and young Obama.

45
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,642
Wally, Nate, I want you guys

46
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,077
to go talk some sense into Amaya.

47
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,466
You mean, convince
her to stand down while

48
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,180
her village and family is torn apart?

49
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:18,650
What if I use my temporal
simulator to find some loophole

50
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:21,386
that Amaya can use to help save Zambesi?

51
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:24,522
All right, do it.

52
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:27,058
The rest of us, we're on Obamacare.

53
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,499
You will not escape.

54
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,602
- Grodd will complete his mission.
- Whoa.

55
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:42,007
Time to make America Grodd again.

56
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,575
Clearly, you have some grievances.

57
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:47,178
But perhaps we can look
for a common ground.

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,980
Whoa!

59
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:51,950
Or not.

60
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:02,200
I can feel his arrival.

61
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,664
Oh, goodie.

62
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,017
Yes, resist.

63
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,953
You will only prolong your suffering.

64
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:38,430
Should have wasted
your hairy ass in 'Nam.

65
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,402
Run, Barry, run!

66
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:51,076
A hairless ape who fights with fire.

67
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,977
How primitive.

68
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:09,194
Nora. Nora, honey.

69
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:12,130
- You okay?
- We were so close.

70
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,432
My master was escaping his bonds.

71
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,446
What happened?

72
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,202
Grodd's mission must have failed.

73
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:18,670
Maybe that could be a good thing.

74
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:19,826
It gives you and me
time to figure out what

75
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:21,806
the big guy's arrival really means.

76
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,910
It means the end of history.

77
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,246
A chance for us to live as gods.

78
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:30,982
As gods?

79
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,884
Man, that sounds fantastic and all.

80
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:34,285
But what I just saw, it seems like

81
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:36,588
there won't be a "you" anymore.

82
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,857
It'll just be him.

83
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:42,994
That's what we always wanted.

84
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:46,231
Isn't it?

85
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:49,484
Totally. 100%.

86
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,645
You know, I'm just gonna
check on our grumpy gorilla

87
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,238
and see how he screwed this thing up.

88
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:59,444
I'll see you later.

89
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,781
No, you won't.

90
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:05,517
Of course.

91
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,252
'Cause once I complete Grodd's mission,

92
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:11,723
you will be gone.

93
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,759
What I meant to say was,

94
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,494
I'll see Mallus later.

95
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:26,359
Goodbye, Nora doll.

96
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,753
Grodd will destroy you. You're dead!

97
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,155
Nice work. Let's get
him back to the ship.

98
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,391
Yeah. Come on, teeny-tiny Grodd.

99
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,193
I think we still have
some chew toys left over

100
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:49,661
from the saber-toothed tiger.

101
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:50,728
Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,130
I'm a PhD student

103
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,632
doing history research, Andy Watkins.

104
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,267
No one cares about the cover story.

105
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,136
Shut up, Darren Applebottom,

106
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,737
talent scout for the New York Knicks.

107
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,041
What are you doing here?

108
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,444
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,317
Preventing the genocide
of my people tomorrow.

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,415
We know. We're here to stop you.

111
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,023
Peacefully.

112
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:15,086
Look, Amaya, I know you're
upset about what happened

113
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,989
to Kuasa, and all I can say is I am...

114
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,593
I'm truly sorry.

115
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:21,829
I don't blame you for

116
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:24,800
my granddaughter's death, Nathaniel.

117
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,932
I blame the warlords who
draw closer by the minute.

118
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:32,136
And I intend to stop them,
so stay out of my way.

119
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:36,641
I must say, it has been
such an honor, Barack.

120
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:40,311
- Oh, I go by Barry.
- I really like Barack.

121
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:43,047
Well, Barack is what it
says on my birth certificate.

122
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,849
Yeah, you might want to hold on to that.

123
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,688
So, what's the backup plan?

124
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,892
Well, according to Ray's
song, this is a code 2-2-2.

125
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,293
What's that?

126
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,362
It means we're screwed
no matter what we do.

127
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,898
All right. Crisis averted.

128
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,368
And a new one's just begun.

129
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,007
You're not getting Obama.

130
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,710
I'm not here for him.

131
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:09,613
I'm here for my daughter.

132
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:11,234
And I need your help.

133
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:19,156
I assure you, this is
completely unnecessary.

134
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:21,830
I come, as they say, in peace.

135
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,395
And I, as they say,
think you're full of crap.

136
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:25,629
I'm a changed man, Sara.

137
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:26,997
The only change I want to see

138
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,766
you go through is from alive to dead.

139
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:30,868
Ray, how we doing with
Constantine's spell?

140
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,304
Just need one more splash of bat spleen.

141
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:34,305
Sorry, bat.

142
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:35,573
And that should do it.

143
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:39,076
Mm.

144
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,578
Maybe I missed an ingredient.

145
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,513
Your Ankh symbol,
it's... it's upside down.

146
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:43,714
Uh...

147
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,182
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

148
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,684
- No, it's not!
- Ooh.

149
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:48,815
I knew it'd be difficult
to get you guys to trust me.

150
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:50,220
Hmm. Try impossible.

151
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:52,890
Which is why I brought
this gesture of good faith.

152
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,658
The Water Totem.

153
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,327
I borrowed it from my daughter after

154
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:58,796
she ripped it from Kuasa's chest.

155
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:00,151
Sorry about that, by the way.

156
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,570
Do you guys mind if I
give you a hand with this?

157
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,672
You seem to be struggling a bit.

158
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:10,506
Yeah? Okay, great.

159
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:17,848
Cool. Uh, now, uh, try to choke me.

160
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,484
- Really?
- Yeah.

161
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,486
You... you can't.

162
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,457
- Satisfied?
- Yeah.

163
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,359
That Water Totem's
gotta be worth something.

164
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,094
With all six, you guys might actually

165
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,411
have a chance against Mallus.

166
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:32,592
You mean the same demon you've been

167
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,130
creating anachronisms to release?

168
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,366
That was before I realized

169
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,967
what our partnership would cost me.

170
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,202
Nora...

171
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:40,651
Dies the moment the demon escapes.

172
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,474
Now, I know this might
rankle you a bit, Sara,

173
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,542
but our interests are aligned.

174
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,579
We can save Nora and stop
Mallus from being freed,

175
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:51,215
together.

176
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:52,736
- No.
- Excuse me?

177
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,518
Rory, kill him.

178
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,500
Wait, nono-no.

179
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,794
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, look.

180
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,088
I... I know Damien has done
terrible things in his past

181
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:00,635
which cannot be forgiven,

182
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,926
but I know that he loves his daughter.

183
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,231
- We can't just kill him.
- He was already dead.

184
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,268
Killing him would be
repairing an anachronism.

185
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,500
Yeah, so would incarcerating
him in the Bureau.

186
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:11,101
I agree with Rip.

187
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,444
We need to think through
this situation rationally.

188
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,713
Boss?

189
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,877
Stand down.

190
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,712
I'm glad to see you came to your senses.

191
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:24,081
Think this makes us
straight, you're wrong.

192
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,622
What are we even doing here, man?

193
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,359
We need to stop Amaya,
not party with the village.

194
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,630
There she is.

195
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:42,299
Okay, great, well, let's
get her out of here.

196
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,835
Not our Amaya.

197
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:46,437
That Amaya.

198
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,608
What's wrong?

199
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,511
Nothing, it just means...

200
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:57,347
my Amaya comes back to Zambesi

201
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,718
and we don't grow old together.

202
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,387
For thousands of years,

203
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,791
the Anansi Totem has been in my family.

204
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,093
And tonight,

205
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:13,797
it is my great joy...

206
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,469
to pass this totem
down to my own daughter.

207
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,638
Make way

208
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,177
for the new protector of Zambesi, Esi.

209
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:42,926
Kuasa, where is Esi, child?

210
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:46,797
I'm sorry, Nana Baa, but

211
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,866
Mother isn't coming.

212
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:57,207
My daughter has chosen

213
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:02,045
to reject her destiny and her duty.

214
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,148
I am sorry.

215
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,650
We have come here for nothing.

216
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,929
Amaya. What just happened?

217
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,931
My daughter rejected the totem.

218
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,729
You sound more excited
than I thought you'd be.

219
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,368
Esi never bonded with the totem.

220
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,471
This is why the warlords were
able to destroy my village.

221
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:31,385
You think you can convince
Esi to be a totem bearer.

222
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:33,510
She'll protect the village tomorrow.

223
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:36,651
She'll protect Kuasa.
Everything will change.

224
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,037
That's the problem.

225
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,083
I saw what happened with
Barry Allen when he went back

226
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:41,495
and stopped his mother's murder,

227
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,754
a little thing called Flashpoint.

228
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:45,889
We can't change history. I'm sorry.

229
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:48,826
Tell her, Nate.

230
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,529
Nate?

231
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:52,029
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

232
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,597
t screw history for once.

233
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,768
Okay, so you go talk to your daughter,

234
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,303
and I go talk to you,

235
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,104
the older you.

236
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,473
Hmm.

237
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:05,642
You always had a way with her.

238
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,478
Come on.

239
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,115
Wait, we doing what?

240
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,349
So, listen...

241
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:17,521
Are you okay?

242
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,323
The hardest thing I
ever had to do in my life

243
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:21,291
was let Darhk live.

244
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:24,194
And now he's back, and it is taking

245
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:29,314
every ounce of self-control
not to kill him.

246
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:35,205
And I keep asking myself, "Why?"

247
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:37,241
For the good of the mission.

248
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,942
"For the good of the mission."

249
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,170
Listen to yourself.

250
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:41,779
You sound like some government...

251
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:44,615
- Clone?
- I was gonna say "stiff."

252
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,216
You know, Rip thought I could
talk some sense into you,

253
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:48,485
- but maybe...
- Wait.

254
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:50,621
You're here because of Rip?

255
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:53,891
Why would you do anything for that man?

256
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,331
Ava, he lied to you.

257
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,129
He implanted false
memories into your head.

258
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,765
He hired actors to
pretend to be your parents.

259
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,300
I mean, what more is it gonna take

260
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:04,456
to get you to confront him?

261
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,768
I am prioritizing the mission

262
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,362
over my own personal baggage.

263
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,065
You and your team
should try it sometime.

264
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:14,444
No, that's not what you're doing.

265
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:16,037
You're covering,

266
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,221
because you're afraid of
what you might find out.

267
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,924
What else is there to find out, Sara?

268
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,527
I'm one of thousands.
I was grown in a lab.

269
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,253
There has to be more to the story, Ava,

270
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:25,589
and you deserve to know.

271
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:27,691
Look, you need...

272
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,294
You need to talk to Rip now.

273
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,767
Ah.

274
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,237
Could do with a wee nip myself.

275
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,239
Everything good, Director Sharpe?

276
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,565
Peachy.

277
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,235
Are we good to

278
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:48,339
transport Mr. Darhk back to the Bureau?

279
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:51,715
No, Rip, we're not.

280
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:52,928
Where are you going?

281
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,784
To go talk to someone
who can think straight

282
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,054
when the whole world has gone crazy.

283
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:59,289
So what you're saying is

284
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,909
you won't aid the man
that killed your sister,

285
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:04,440
even if it will prevent
Mollusk from escaping...

286
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,862
"Mallus."

287
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:08,832
From escaping his
inter-dimensional prison

288
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,972
and wreaking havoc across time?

289
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,542
Yeah, when you put it that way,

290
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:13,737
it does sound kind of petty.

291
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:16,239
Not at all. It sounds...

292
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,432
It sounds human.

293
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:19,743
Okay. But then what?

294
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:22,284
I'm just supposed to
hand Darhk over to Ava

295
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,045
and let the Time Bureau deal with him?

296
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:27,551
Your ex is clinging to
rules and regulations

297
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,386
in the face of the startling revelation

298
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,355
that she is...

299
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,124
I'm sorry... a clone, was it?

300
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:36,693
But here's the thing.

301
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,930
I'm not convinced the
Bureau is best equipped

302
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,366
to stop a demon.

303
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:45,102
No, it sounds like that calls for

304
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:48,972
a much more unorthodox approach.

305
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,077
I really miss you.

306
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,386
Oh, hi guys.

307
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,454
I do hope you're not feeling all

308
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,356
killy-killy, stabby-stabby.

309
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:09,726
I want you to listen to me carefully.

310
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:12,429
I don't believe for a
second that you've changed.

311
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:15,198
You're still the same
cowardly son of a bitch

312
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,167
that put an arrow in my sister.

313
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:19,536
But I will work with
you to defeat Mallus

314
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,171
under one condition.

315
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:22,839
After this is over,

316
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:26,209
I'm putting you back in
the ground where you belong.

317
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,344
Deal.

318
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,294
Huh.

319
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:44,540
Is... so, do any of
these flashing screens

320
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:45,574
actually do anything?

321
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:46,840
Focus, Damien.

322
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,900
How do we capture your demon daughter?

323
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,520
Um, if we coordinate a strike

324
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,214
between the Legends and the Time Bureau,

325
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,316
we might be able to take her down.

326
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,519
How did that work for
you in Victorian London?

327
00:15:56,521 --> 00:16:00,623
Besides, my little angel's
only gotten more powerful since.

328
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,958
What if we just ask Nora nicely?

329
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,761
I did have a bit of a
connection with her in Berlin.

330
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,596
Not that kind.

331
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,462
All right, maybe she'll
listen to her dear old dad.

332
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,935
Not anymore. Nora only
listens to Mallus now.

333
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,171
He's always in her ear.

334
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:18,140
That's it. What if I got inside Nora?

335
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,709
Not like that.

336
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,511
What if I shrunk down,

337
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:25,915
flew into her ear and
pretended to be Mallus?

338
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,316
Okay, new guy on the team here.

339
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,817
Is that a joke plan or a real plan?

340
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,126
- We are so screwed.
- No, this could work.

341
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,689
We just have to convince
her that it's actually him.

342
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:37,226
This is how you would serve your city.

343
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,162
You would risk its utter ruin.

344
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,564
That's it.

345
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,866
I did what I judged to be right.

346
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:47,303
What you judged to be right?

347
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:50,470
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor,

348
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,970
in the hands of a witless halfling!

349
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:56,908
Whoa, the vocal similarity
to Mallus is uncanny.

350
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:59,215
- Quiet!
- Gideon?

351
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:00,849
Who is that actor?

352
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,385
And how can we get him
without dealing with his agent?

353
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,012
Red leather, yellowl eather. Yeah?

354
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,656
- Mis... mister Noble?
- What?

355
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,825
Uh, we have some, uh,
last-minute rewrites.

356
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,894
No worries! We'll fix 'em in post!

357
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:16,465
Tell Peter Jackson
no more chickens, huh?

358
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,634
I ate four this morning, eh?

359
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,236
- So what's up, mate?
- Yeah, so.

360
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:21,837
Rewrites, uh, from Peter.

361
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
And he'd like me to,
uh, run lines with you.

362
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,441
You're kidding.

363
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:28,644
Okay. Uh, let's see.

364
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:30,913
"Nora, you must heed my command."

365
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:32,281
That's good. That's good.

366
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,916
- Who's Nora?
- Nora.

367
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,951
Nora, she's a new character that, um,

368
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:39,121
well... they wanted to beef up
the female presence in the film.

369
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,422
You can't do that, mate.

370
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:42,024
It's Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings."

371
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,193
I know... But it's a studio note.

372
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,368
Oh, studio note. Very
good note, yeah, all right.

373
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:49,431
- Yeah, from the top?
- Hmm.

374
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,667
"Nora, you must heed my command."

375
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,369
Uh, "What is it, Master?"

376
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,524
"Go to the Waverider, Nora."

377
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:57,493
"I cannot go to the Waverider."

378
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:00,643
"The totems are ripe for the picking."

379
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,048
This is crap, isn't it? Aye?

380
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:03,779
- Oh, well...
- I mean, who wrote this?

381
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:05,314
- I mean, somebody...
- Don't... don't worry about it.

382
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:06,649
- Took a lot of time...
- Don't worry about it.

383
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,350
"The totems are ripe for the picking.

384
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:10,319
Your father will lead you to them."

385
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,553
"My father?"

386
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,826
Esi.

387
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,696
Who are you?

388
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:23,032
I am a distant cousin.

389
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,167
I came for the ceremony.

390
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:26,969
Sorry to disappoint you.

391
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,607
I love it here.

392
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,965
When I was a child,

393
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:36,612
I'd come here and lose
myself in the stars,

394
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:40,149
think about where my life would lead.

395
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:43,952
For as long as I can remember,

396
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:47,890
the Anansi Totem has been my destiny.

397
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,325
But now,

398
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:53,996
I'm not sure I want it.

399
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,632
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

400
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,706
My mother is the great Amaya Jiwe.

401
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,509
She's protected our
village her entire life.

402
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,645
She never doubted, never wavered.

403
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,847
That's not true.

404
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,886
Every totem bearer starts
their journey with doubt.

405
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,155
Even your mother.

406
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:22,462
I will never live up to her legacy.

407
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,126
You have her strength

408
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:27,730
and the strength of all
others who've come before her.

409
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,176
But there is danger coming,

410
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,835
and your people need
you to stand up for them.

411
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:51,854
All right, you fathwoom
into Amaya's hut,

412
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,922
grab the totem, and we'll
give it to her daughter.

413
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:56,525
Nate, I... now that you
have some space from her,

414
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,260
I need you to come to your senses.

415
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,048
Amaya can't see this, she's too close.

416
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,964
But she's going to
cause more harm than good

417
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,098
if this releases Mallus.

418
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,666
- We don't know that.
- We do.

419
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:05,801
You do.

420
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:14,042
I can't not help her, Wally.

421
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:16,211
I love you, man, but I will stop you

422
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:19,915
if you take this too far.

423
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:33,695
Like stealing candy
from a very old baby.

424
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,551
Ow! Oh, Amaya, wait.

425
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,441
It's me.

426
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:05,194
You know, I didn't think
this would do it for me,

427
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,562
but it actually kind of does.

428
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:07,729
- Who are you?
- Oh!

429
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:09,665
- It's me, Nate.
- Who?

430
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,777
Nate.

431
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,026
I know it's been a while,

432
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,801
but we used to travel
through time together.

433
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:16,171
You know, do other things...

434
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:17,707
If this is some kind of a joke...

435
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,806
It's not a joke.

436
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,109
I have pictures of us

437
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,811
on my phone.

438
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:25,180
Ow.

439
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:34,696
This is me.

440
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:37,466
Of course.

441
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:39,027
You really don't remember, do you?

442
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,395
How is this possible?

443
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:41,964
We were part of a bitchin' team

444
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,502
that travelled through time together...

445
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,200
I mean, the 1942 you.

446
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:49,004
Why are you here, time traveler?

447
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:52,875
To keep my promise to you,

448
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:55,310
by making sure your daughter Esi

449
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:58,013
gets the Spirit Totem tonight.

450
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,450
She didn't even show
up to her own ceremony.

451
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:05,420
Her head is always somewhere else.

452
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,823
She doesn't know what she wants.

453
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,493
Yeah, you had a hard time

454
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,462
figuring that out too
when you were her age.

455
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,235
But, look, if Esi believed
you were truly in her corner,

456
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:22,538
she wouldn't doubt herself.

457
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,607
She would accept the
totem and be unstoppable,

458
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,488
just like you.

459
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,485
Uh, hey there, Nora doll.

460
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:38,313
Why am I still here?

461
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,355
Why is the Master still in prison?

462
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:41,590
You failed me!

463
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,958
I know, it's terrible.

464
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,582
The Legends captured Grodd,

465
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:46,528
and this whole Obama
thing is just not working,

466
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,765
so perhaps Mallus can advise us

467
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,867
as to what to do next.

468
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:59,007
Mallus only speaks when he desires.

469
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,058
I can't just "summon" him.

470
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,277
Well, maybe we'll just, uh...

471
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,813
Wait here until he

472
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,448
gets the itch.

473
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,407
Nora.

474
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,321
You must heed my command.

475
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,456
It's him. He's speaking to me.

476
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,358
Very loudly.

477
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,102
Really? Mallus is speaking to you?

478
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:22,364
Shh! I need to concentrate.

479
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,767
Go to the Waverider, Nora.

480
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,236
The Waverider, why?

481
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:32,074
The totems are ripe for the picking.

482
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,242
Your father will lead you to them.

483
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:35,544
My father?

484
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:38,313
What... what... Mallus has plans for me?

485
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:39,514
I... I wonder what those are.

486
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:41,462
The... the... the Legends' ship.

487
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,251
The Master wants you to take me there.

488
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:46,121
Oh, I would in a heartbeat,

489
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,156
but we are hopelessly
outnumbered, honey.

490
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:49,458
There's just no way...

491
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,892
He must take you there now, Nora.

492
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:51,994
Just do it!

493
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:53,923
God, do it! Don't be a fool!

494
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,797
No problemo. Let's go.

495
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:03,939
Those totems should be
around here somewhere.

496
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:13,815
You.

497
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:19,921
What is this?

498
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:20,989
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

499
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,157
but it's for your own good.

500
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,358
No.

501
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:27,896
No!

502
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:35,761
I get it.

503
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:36,980
You think that I failed you

504
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,478
because I joined with the Legends

505
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:39,747
and trapped you here.

506
00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:41,783
Well, you're right.

507
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,184
I did fail you.

508
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:44,719
But that's not how.

509
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,288
I was a terrible father.

510
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,892
I was obsessed with world domination.

511
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:53,428
Because of that...

512
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,963
I died,

513
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:58,700
leaving you all alone as a child,

514
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:03,504
trapped with my name
and my foolish dreams.

515
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:06,574
Oh, I turned you into a
demon long before Mallus did.

516
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,811
It's why I'm begging you,

517
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:13,214
do not let him take you away from me.

518
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,684
Your daughter is long gone.

519
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:17,986
No!

520
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:20,253
I know you can hear me. Fight him!

521
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:22,823
Oh, there was no fight.

522
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:27,028
Her soul...

523
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:29,999
her flesh...

524
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:33,401
were freely given.

525
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,203
You sick son of a bitch.

526
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:39,198
One more alteration to the timeline

527
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,475
and my cage crumbles.

528
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:52,320
Can't believe that worked.

529
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:53,521
I can.

530
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:55,556
Sara knows what she's doing.

531
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:57,592
I may have my flaws, but I do know

532
00:25:57,594 --> 00:26:01,162
how to pick the best people for the job.

533
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:02,563
So why did you pick me?

534
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,265
What? Come on.

535
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:07,201
Brilliant mind, calm
demeanor, incredible strength.

536
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:11,105
And, unlike the Legends,
you actually follow rules.

537
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:14,142
It almost sounds like
I was made for the job.

538
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,011
What are you getting at?

539
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:19,047
I know I'm a clone, Rip.

540
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,753
I see.

541
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:23,990
So why me? Hmm?

542
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,921
Of all the clones in
2213, why did you pick me?

543
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:28,623
You're special.

544
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,725
So why'd you erase my memory?

545
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:33,194
- I thought it would be easier.
- Easier?

546
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:35,063
Easier for you or easier for me?

547
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:36,651
Don't lose focus, Ava.

548
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:38,699
You are too critical to this mission.

549
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:41,002
Well, the good news is if I die,

550
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:43,638
you can just skip off to 2213,
and get yourself another clone.

551
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:48,710
Oh, my God.

552
00:26:48,712 --> 00:26:50,311
I wasn't even the first one, was I?

553
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:52,213
We both know how hard it is

554
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,649
to find agents as talented as you.

555
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:57,618
And to find one who is also
replaceable is invaluable...

556
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,191
How many?

557
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,955
How many?

558
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:04,525
You're the 12th.

559
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:07,128
The 12th?

560
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:08,831
So I wasn't even your first choice?

561
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,133
Or your second or...

562
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:12,099
You don't understand.

563
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:15,236
- You are exceptional.
- Don't, Rip.

564
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,372
Just don't.

565
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:26,080
Nora's gone.

566
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,416
It's just Mallus now.

567
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:29,851
You must be enjoying this,

568
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:32,120
seeing your nemesis with a broken heart.

569
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:35,490
I didn't know you had a heart to break.

570
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:39,660
Where was it the night
you murdered my sister?

571
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:41,737
Look, what I did was unforgivable.

572
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,731
But back then, I hadn't
loved anyone enough

573
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:46,701
to understand the pain that I caused.

574
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:50,338
Not that it's any comfort, but
if I could take it all back,

575
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,240
I would.

576
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:54,542
We all have regrets.

577
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:57,745
But we can't undo the
things that we've done.

578
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:00,448
True.

579
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,284
But even the worst of us
can be made whole again.

580
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:05,319
You, for example.

581
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,394
League to Legend to killer to captain.

582
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:08,889
That's not a bad makeover, is it?

583
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:11,097
- It's not good enough.
- Why?

584
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,693
Because you put on the Death Totem

585
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:14,228
and almost killed your entire team?

586
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,347
- Yes.
- But you didn't, did you?

587
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,800
And you know why?

588
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:19,634
The same reason I'm spilling my guts to

589
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:22,103
a woman who's imagined
my death 1,000 times over.

590
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,671
More like 10,000.

591
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,308
Love! Sara.

592
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,110
'Cause without it, people like us,

593
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:32,613
we're left alone with the darkness.

594
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:34,248
That's not good for anyone, is it?

595
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:56,103
I'm so proud of you, my child.

596
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:58,072
Esi's embraced her destiny.

597
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:00,642
Tomorrow when the marauders
come, she'll be ready.

598
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:02,019
And if she's not, we'll be right there

599
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:03,281
to fight alongside her.

600
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,313
You don't have to stay, Nathaniel.

601
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,148
I know that what I did was selfish.

602
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,885
You couldn't be selfish if you tried.

603
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:14,589
Now, you see that
boomin' granny over there?

604
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:17,525
She doesn't remember me,

605
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:19,260
or the Legends.

606
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:22,597
You know why that is?

607
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,633
I must have erased my memory.

608
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:28,536
And why would you do that?

609
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:30,972
Because if I chose to come back here,

610
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:34,142
after everything we've
been through, then

611
00:29:34,144 --> 00:29:35,944
erasing you would be the only way

612
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:38,813
that I could be the
protector my people deserve.

613
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:42,550
Otherwise, I'd always be split in two.

614
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:46,654
And part of me would
be in love with you.

615
00:29:46,656 --> 00:29:48,809
I tried to reason with
them, but they won't listen.

616
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,473
Amaya is dead set on saving her village.

617
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:51,526
And Nate? He's just...

618
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:52,994
- Whipped.
- I was gonna say "in love."

619
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:53,999
But, yeah, same thing.

620
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,054
Zari, please tell me that

621
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:56,364
you found a loophole that allows

622
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,632
Amaya to save her village.

623
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,167
There is no loophole.

624
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,028
I've tried billions of variations,

625
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:03,098
but this event has too
many ripple effects.

626
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,672
The village has to be destroyed.

627
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:05,840
Or Mallus is freed.

628
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:09,577
And we're all doomed.

629
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:11,312
What if we're not?

630
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:13,014
Hmm?

631
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,616
We have the six totems,

632
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:17,585
the only thing that Mallus is afraid of.

633
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:20,121
But you can't fight what you can't see.

634
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:23,293
What if the only way to kill
Mallus is to let him out?

635
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:26,060
Are you really suggesting
that we allow Mallus to escape

636
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:27,962
because you have a
collection of magical stones?

637
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:30,676
Look, we have two choices: we
fight Amaya or we fight Mallus.

638
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,034
And I know it sounds crazy
to let a time demon out,

639
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:34,996
but it's a hell of a
lot easier to stomach

640
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,366
than turning on a friend.

641
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,574
Okay, yes, but didn't
the original totem bearers

642
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:40,491
try and face Mallus and... and blow it?

643
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:42,710
Constantine said the only
reason they couldn't kill Mallus

644
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:45,281
was because the Death
Totem betrayed them.

645
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:47,081
And that's not gonna happen this time.

646
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,416
How can you be so sure?

647
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,784
I needn't remind you what happened

648
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:51,138
the last time you tried to wield it.

649
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,154
She won't have to wield it.

650
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:55,723
I will.

651
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,925
The Death Totem was
attracted to Captain Lance

652
00:30:57,927 --> 00:30:59,994
because of a unique
quality we both share.

653
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:02,030
We were both brought back from the dead.

654
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:04,065
Plus, I have a personal stake

655
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,034
in wanting to send
Mallus straight to Hell.

656
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:08,523
He took my little girl.

657
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,104
True as that may be,

658
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:11,706
there is no chance that Captain Lance

659
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,949
would trust you with
such a dangerous weapon.

660
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:18,379
Death Totem's all yours.

661
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:19,981
Sara, you can't be serious.

662
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,593
Ava, we don't have a choice.

663
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:24,018
Our only choice is to stop
Amaya and stop the anachronisms.

664
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,219
This is insanity.

665
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:27,522
Insane is what we do best, Ava.

666
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:29,157
I will not condone this behavior,

667
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,192
and the Bureau certainly
does not stand behind you.

668
00:31:31,194 --> 00:31:32,960
Rip, let's go. We have work to do.

669
00:31:32,962 --> 00:31:34,629
Remember when I told you
that we would need the Legends

670
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,230
before this was through?

671
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:39,667
Perhaps it is time that
we set aside the scalpel

672
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:43,738
and let them be the chainsaw.

673
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,241
I will consider that your resignation.

674
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:49,410
Ava.

675
00:31:49,412 --> 00:31:51,012
Ava, wait.

676
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:58,319
This plan can work and you know it.

677
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:00,288
You just need to trust your gut.

678
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,923
My gut?

679
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,124
You mean the one that was

680
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,093
manufactured to factory settings?

681
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:06,360
That's the same gut that

682
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:07,995
11 other Avas used and got killed?

683
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:10,574
Ava, please. Just trust me.

684
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:11,899
You don't understand.

685
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:13,901
This plan breaks every
rule in every book,

686
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,771
and all I have right
now are the rules, okay?

687
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:18,940
You have me.

688
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,016
What are you doing?

689
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:33,287
I'm admitting something
that could save us both.

690
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,858
I love you.

691
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:41,629
There is no "me" to love.

692
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,194
She looks good out there,

693
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:57,962
ready.

694
00:32:57,964 --> 00:33:01,232
Like mother, like daughter.

695
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:04,235
The warlords are early.

696
00:33:04,237 --> 00:33:05,636
Hey! Oh, no.

697
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:07,469
- Don't puma-pounce us.
- Really, Wally?

698
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:09,310
- You're gonna do this?
- It's not like that, Nate.

699
00:33:09,312 --> 00:33:12,101
- I know why you're here.
- No, no, you really don't.

700
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:14,544
Short version: Nora's on the
ship, tripping on Mallus juice.

701
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:15,947
Damien Darhk gave us the Water Totem

702
00:33:15,949 --> 00:33:17,181
after they saved Barack Obama.

703
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:18,816
And, uh, we are here to help you

704
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,685
create the anachronisms
so we can release Mallus,

705
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,578
and then we can kill him.

706
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,481
Oh, and I met John Noble.

707
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:28,758
So you're working with Damien Darhk?

708
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,228
Please, don't rub it in.

709
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,740
And you're letting him
wield the Death Totem.

710
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,898
In order to do justice
for someone I love.

711
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:35,148
Sure you can understand that.

712
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:37,067
Thankfully that is our only similarity.

713
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,537
- Hm.
- So.

714
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,338
Who gets Earth? Who gets Water?

715
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,407
Well, as a man of steel,
which is an element,

716
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:45,509
I always felt a strong
connection to the earth.

717
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:47,678
Actually, steel is an
alloy of iron and carbon.

718
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,512
Also, I've watched every single episode

719
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:50,781
of "Planet Earth" on Blu-ray,

720
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:52,583
and I was only stoned all of the time.

721
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:54,285
Can I just please have the damn totem?

722
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:55,653
- Thank you.
- All yours.

723
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:57,388
And Water? Anyone?

724
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,757
Actually, water is really powerful.

725
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,659
It... it's crucial to life on Earth.

726
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:03,561
And did you know that we
are made up of 60% water?

727
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,662
- If...
- All right, I think we get it.

728
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:05,468
Take a totem.

729
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:06,951
Oh, I wasn't making a pitch for one.

730
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:07,986
Just take the totem!

731
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,233
Okay, cool.

732
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:10,635
All right, so is there, like,

733
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:12,703
an instruction manual? A YouTube video?

734
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,005
You better figure it out.

735
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:16,173
Warlords are coming, and that means

736
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:18,109
Mallus is about to make his debut.

737
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:24,249
Dad?

738
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,349
Nora.

739
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:29,287
You're here but... how?

740
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:32,356
The totem means you're dead.

741
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:35,960
No, not yet.

742
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:40,364
Mallus is trying to take me,
but I'm still fighting him.

743
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,432
For now.

744
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:44,568
But Dad?

745
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,171
I made a mistake.

746
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:48,851
I'm sorry.

747
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,547
I don't want him to take me.

748
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,076
Please don't let him
take me. I'm scared.

749
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:55,246
You ready?

750
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:03,921
Yeah, let's do this
before it's too late.

751
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,368
This place has been sacred to my people

752
00:35:14,371 --> 00:35:15,603
since the dawn of time.

753
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:17,133
The totems will be strongest here.

754
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:18,320
Well, they'd better be,

755
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:19,836
'cause mine's not turning on.

756
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,841
It's time.

757
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,977
As soon as Esi defeats the warlords,

758
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:27,812
our fight against Mallus begins.

759
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:43,828
Should we help your daughter?

760
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,696
Esi's got this.

761
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:47,598
Nono-no! No-no-no!

762
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,934
Looks like it's time
to meet our monster.

763
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,135
Or our maker.

764
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,503
I'm not dying today.

765
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,208
Here's Mallus.

766
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,205
Why isn't she transforming?

767
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,218
Rip, what gives?

768
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:06,932
The historical record is showing
that Zambesi's still destroyed.

769
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:08,135
That doesn't make any sense.

770
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:09,720
The battle's over. The good guys won.

771
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:15,159
- Rip, what's going on?
- Oh, my God.

772
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:16,921
The warlords don't destroy the village.

773
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,163
The village was destroyed by

774
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:21,265
an angry gorilla.

775
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,549
I had to. She's my daughter.

776
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:30,785
You released Grodd.

777
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,689
I need history to run its course.

778
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,881
Your time must end.

779
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,492
This way! Quick.

780
00:36:47,494 --> 00:36:49,293
You should go too, Maame.

781
00:36:49,295 --> 00:36:51,229
I can handle this beast.

782
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:54,065
I believe in you, Obabaa.

783
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,286
Esi.

784
00:37:15,288 --> 00:37:16,587
No.

785
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,427
Amaya! Amaya!

786
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:24,762
Hey, hey, are you okay?

787
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,198
I'm okay.

788
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,136
Nate, my family...

789
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:33,538
I won't let them die.

790
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,206
I promise.

791
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,953
Damien, Mallus is coming.
This won't save Nora.

792
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,811
If there's a chance in
hell, I'm gonna take it.

793
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:41,245
I'll handle this.

794
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:48,619
"Always incapacitate
your speedster first."

795
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:49,966
That's day one stuff.

796
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,817
Let him go.

797
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,365
I'm warning you, don't stand in my way.

798
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:03,534
I was powerful before
I had this trinket,

799
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,236
but now I'm unstoppable.

800
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:06,938
Yeah, we've heard that one before.

801
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:13,678
I don't want to kill you.

802
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,413
I want to kill them to save my daughter!

803
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,348
Why can't you understand that?

804
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,174
Can't move.

805
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:44,475
What is happening?

806
00:38:44,477 --> 00:38:46,244
Foolish human.

807
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:49,280
You are now mine to control.

808
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:51,082
You will not harm my village!

809
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,451
Maame! Get away from him!

810
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:06,430
It worked!

811
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,767
Amaya.

812
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,276
Nathaniel.

813
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:24,289
I... I didn't take
you for a totem bearer.

814
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,551
That makes two of us.

815
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:32,657
Nora.

816
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,467
I'll find you. I promise.

817
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,637
Go.

818
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:48,836
Go!

819
00:39:51,244 --> 00:39:54,912
Hey!

820
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:58,282
Performance anxiety, Raymond?

821
00:39:58,284 --> 00:39:59,817
You're only proving my point that

822
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:02,820
this plan was never gonna work.

823
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:05,923
Do this.

824
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,194
It's too bad, really.

825
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:13,264
I was just beginning to
like you after Berlin.

826
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,610
You literally stabbed me in the back.

827
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:27,244
It only seemed fitting.

828
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:29,352
You're lucky I wasn't
aiming for your heart.

829
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,582
I am not gonna let Nora be taken by him.

830
00:40:31,584 --> 00:40:33,050
Nora's gone, Damien.

831
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:48,766
Finally, I am free.

832
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:07,952
No.

833
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:10,655
- Nora.
- You can't help her, Ray.

834
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:12,289
Oh, my God.

835
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:21,332
I am so much more than a god.

836
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:36,285
