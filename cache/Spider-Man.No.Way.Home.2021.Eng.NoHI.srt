00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,472
We come to you now with revelations

2
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,702
about last week's attack in London.
An anonymous source provided this video.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,576
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,580
You may find this video disturbing.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,174
I managed to send the Elemental
back through the rift,

6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,533
but I don't think I'm gonna
make it off this bridge alive.

7
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,715
Spider-Man attacked me.

8
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,314
He has an Army of drones, Stark technology.

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,055
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man. No one else.

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,391
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,363
There will be significant casualties.

12
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,400
Do it. Execute them all.

13
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,665
This shocking video was released earlier today

14
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,734
on the controversial news website
TheDailyBugle.net.

15
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,109
There you have it, folks:
Conclusive proof

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,173
that Spider-Man was responsible
for the brutal murder of Mysterio,

17
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,687
an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet

18
00:00:54,755 --> 00:01:00,319
and who will, no doubt, go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time.

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,586
But that's not all, folks.

20
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,095
Here's the real blockbuster.

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,893
Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit down.

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,263
Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is...

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,430
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

24
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,866
What the fuck?

25
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,708
That's right, folks. Peter Parker.

26
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,578
A 17-year-old high school delinquent...

27
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,310
- She knows him.
- Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

28
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,886
Is, in fact...

29
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,150
- Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
- the vile vigilante villain Spider-Man.

30
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,190
- Yo, it's him.
- Whoa, whoa.

31
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,420
- Please don't touch her.
- You're just a kid?

32
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,926
You murdered Mysterio?

33
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,621
- You helped him?
- I didn't...

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,789
Come on, kid, let me see your face.

35
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,628
- He hit me. Spider-Man hit me.
- Come on.

36
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,565
He hit me.

37
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,128
All this time, people looked up
to this boy and called him a hero.

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,231
Well, I'll tell you what I call him,
public enemy number one!

39
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,573
I told you I never wanted to do this ever again!

40
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,978
MJ, I'm so sorry, but I can't see anything
with your hand in my...

41
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,607
Sorry. Where are we gonna go?

42
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,481
- I don't know. Your house?
- No!

43
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,848
My Dad will kill you.

44
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,978
What? You said your Dad really liked me.

45
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,818
Yeah, well, not anymore.

46
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,588
- Dude.
- Dude.

47
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,719
- Dude!
- Dude!

48
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,785
Dude!

49
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,922
- Dude!
- Dude!

50
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,898
[Spider-Man gasps] I'm so sorry, Are you okay?

51
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,936
- No, not really. Uh...
- Yo, Peter!

52
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,938
[Talking Heads' "I Zimbra" playing]

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,919
We should go. We should go. Come on.

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,378
- You said you don't want to swing.
- You should just swing me.

55
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,903
- Okay. We can take the subway.
- Okay.

56
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:35,853
No.

57
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:42,956
Look out!

58
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,298
That was so much worse. Okay. It's okay.

59
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,968
- Are you okay?
- 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,844
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:10,988
Okay.

62
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,456
Okay.

63
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,287
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,956
I just feel so dumb.
I didn't realize you were miserable.

65
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,400
No, it was really fun, right?
That's why they call it a fling.

66
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:26,098
- And we flung.
- It was fun. I could've been more fun.

67
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,607
- We'll hang out again.
- Like, when do you think?

68
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,172
- I should see what that is.
- No, no, no.

69
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,683
- It's what I do. Peter?
- He's always coming and going.

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,013
- Peter?
- Oh! Oh, no.

71
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,246
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

72
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,980
- I don't know what to do.
- Peter?

73
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,551
- Oh..
- I didn't see anything.

74
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,421
Um, this isn't what it looks like.

75
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,221
- No, no, no, May.
- Practice safe...

76
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,058
Oh, hey. You must be MJ!

77
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,792
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

78
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,562
- Wait, have you been crying?
- We broke up.

79
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,601
- Oh. Oh! Uh...
- Hey, Spider-Man!

80
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,134
Thank you. I didn't know you broke up.

81
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,109
I thought you were in love, May.
Can we talk about this in the kitchen?

82
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,839
I should probably leave.

83
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,882
I thought you guys were such a handsome couple.

84
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,043
It's really about boundaries.

85
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,280
- Let me answer the door.
- Let's go in here.

86
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,877
- Is that the door?
- Hey. Is it true?

87
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,049
- I was gonna go, but...
- Not now.

88
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,094
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

89
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,253
This has nothing to do with sex.

90
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,821
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean... What's that sound?

91
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,831
Uh...

92
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,596
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, my God.

93
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,230
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it if you want to.

94
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,173
You take care of your side,
I'll take care of mine.

95
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,609
What is up with this phone?

96
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,044
Will you get off your phones for five minutes?

97
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,412
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

98
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,315
Peter?

99
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,454
What?

100
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,158
- Is that...?
- Is that here?

101
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:53,860
Um...

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,138
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

103
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,177
Maybe it's not such a big deal.

104
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,575
Spider-Menace!

105
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,639
Governments around the world
launch investigations

106
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,845
into the murderer known as Spider-Man,
aka Peter Parker,

107
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,786
aka the web-headed war criminal

108
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:27,225
who, for years, has been terrorizing
the decent citizens of New York.

109
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,991
Well, now this city and the world see him
for what he truly is.

110
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,158
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

111
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:37,363
New details from last week's
devastating attack in London have emerged.

112
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,168
For more, we go now
to Joint Intelligence headquarters.

113
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,936
Authorities, just a short while ago, confirmed

114
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,274
that the deadly drones used in the London attack

115
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,643
were designed by Stark Industries.

116
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,705
Federal agents! Open up!

117
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,512
Federal agents? You stay here.

118
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,709
Department of Damage Control.

119
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,781
We have a warrant for the arrest of Peter Parker.

120
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,587
- You know the Fourth Amendment?
- Sure.

121
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,251
- Unreasonable search and seizure?
- Get in here, guys. Let's go.

122
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,857
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

123
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,763
- The drones that are yours.
- No.

124
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,164
Nick Fury was there the entire time.

125
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,930
He can explain everything.

126
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,836
Nick Fury has been off-planet for the last year.

127
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,806
- What?
- Peter! Hey.

128
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,003
MJ! Uh... They have nothing to do with this, Sir.

129
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,172
Don't say anything without a lawyer.

130
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,805
I want a lawyer.

131
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,849
- Ms. Jones-Watson.
- Jones. I don't go by Watson.

132
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,183
- Ms. Jones, why do you want a lawyer if...?
- If I have nothing to hide?

133
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,690
Exactly. Unless...

134
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,454
- I'm actually guilty of something?
- Uh-huh.

135
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,689
I'm very aware of your tactics and my rights.

136
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,228
Just answer my questions.

137
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,026
I've seen your file.

138
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,228
You're a smart young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

139
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,861
Why would you risk it all

140
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,339
by getting involved
with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

141
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,537
So sorry to keep you waiting.

142
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,170
- Can we get Ned a snack?
- Absolutely.

143
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,543
- He's been waiting.
- I got you.

144
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,241
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

145
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,613
- I'm not supposed to say anything to you.
- Not even a thing.

146
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,587
I just have one question.
When MJ told you Peter was Spider-Man...

147
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

148
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,953
- What's up?
- I knew way before MJ did.

149
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,551
- I was Spider-Man's "guy in the chair."
- I know about those.

150
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,893
- Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair.
- Exactly.

151
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,366
You would know.
I literally helped him find the Vulture.

152
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,698
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

153
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,238
and helped him get to space.

154
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:22,435
So in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism,
you were his main accomplice.

155
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,477
I would like to have
my words stricken from the record.

156
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,109
With all due respect,
and I mean that very insincerely,

157
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,281
unless you have
some real specific charges to throw at us,

158
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,824
legally, you can't hold us here.

159
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,519
- You should definitely lawyer up.
- Excuse me?

160
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,755
Child endangerment's a nasty rap.

161
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,591
A boy was entrusted to you,

162
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,066
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

163
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,093
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself, you encouraged it.

164
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,832
Who does that?

165
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,931
I wanna see Peter right now.

166
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,670
Stark Industries was caught in the web

167
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,440
of the Spider-Man/Mysterio controversy today,

168
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,006
when federal agents opened an investigation

169
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,813
into missing Stark technology.

170
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,446
Agents wanna know exactly what was taken...

171
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,617
- At least they used a good picture.
- What is happening?

172
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,655
That's great.

173
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,752
Thank you.

174
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,525
I have some good news, Peter.

175
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,260
I don't believe any of the charges
against you are gonna stick.

176
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,666
- Wait, seriously?
- Oh.

177
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,702
- I knew it.
- Nice.

178
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,363
Mr. Murdock, thank you.

179
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,133
- Thank you.
- That's amazing.

180
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,868
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

181
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,466
- However, Mr. Hogan...
- Yes?

182
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,741
The feds are investigating
that missing technology.

183
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,179
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,649
but if you were involved...

185
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,482
- If I was?
- I advise securing a lawyer.

186
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:42,579
I need a lawyer because I'm...?
I thought he was...

187
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,852
You said there's no charge.
I could say under advisement of counsel,

188
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,985
I refuse to answer the question respectfully

189
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,029
because the answer can incriminate me...

190
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,589
It's in Goodfellas.
What's the thing they say in Goodfellas?

191
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,930
I know that's what you think. Calm down.
Let's hear what he has to say. Matt?

192
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,868
You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

193
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,367
You may have dodged your legal troubles,
but things will get much worse.

194
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,342
There is still the court of public opinion.

195
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,345
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

196
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,309
How did you just do that?

197
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,714
I'm a really good lawyer.

198
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,686
We'll need a safer place to live.

199
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,065
Oh. Aah!

200
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,004
How do we...? How do we...?

201
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,566
Alarm system deactivated.

202
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,272
It looks nice. And this is safe.

203
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,415
Welcome to the spiritual oasis.

204
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,578
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

205
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,556
Ugh!

206
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,957
Nicky, from Jersey City, you're on the line.

207
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,655
Hi. I'm not saying
I don't want to honor the Avengers,

208
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,130
but, you know, not doing it this way.

209
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,464
Putting the Captain America shield
on the Statue of Liberty?

210
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,401
Nah, that will look ridiculous.

211
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,530
Leave the Statue of Liberty alone.

212
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,632
Oh, Happy.

213
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,406
- Did you send in your applications?
- I finished my MIT one.

214
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,469
- You?
- Same.

215
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,378
Can you imagine
if we both got in? And Ned?

216
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,317
Yeah, but we'd have to get scholarships
so we could actually go.

217
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,717
You got the scores and the grades.

218
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,256
You think I'm being too pragmatic.

219
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,757
No, no, no. Well...

220
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,587
Kind of. It's okay.
It's one of my favorite things about you.

221
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:29,959
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,895
What are your other favorite things?

223
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,902
- Your relentless optimism.
- I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.

224
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,597
- I really like how you're a people person.
- I love people.

225
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,141
- I love them so much.
- You like sports.

226
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,370
I think the Mets are gonna go
all the way this year.

227
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,536
- Really?
- What's that noise?

228
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,977
Oh!

229
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,640
It's... It's Happy. Look.

230
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,548
Gave his room to May, so he's sleeping down here.

231
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,856
I have a weird question. Um...

232
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,389
Does any part of you feel relieved about this?

233
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,232
Ever since I got bit by that spider...

234
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,299
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

235
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,838
Or kind of normal, I guess.

236
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,274
And...

237
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,279
that was when you found out.

238
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,977
<i>Because then everyone that was in my fife
that</i> I <i>wanted to know knew.</i>

239
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,109
And it was perfect.

240
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,279
But now everybody knows and...

241
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,488
lam the most famous person in the entire world.

242
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,155
And I'm still broke.

243
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,064
I'm...

244
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,062
excited to see you tomorrow.

245
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,437
Yeah. Me too.

246
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,769
Wrap it up.

247
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,934
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

248
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,535
There's no new ground being broken.
I need my eight hours.

249
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,911
- Have you been listening this whole time?
- Hi, Happy.

250
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,210
Uh, not by choice.

251
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,680
- MJ says hi.
- Hello.

252
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,881
We're covering the first day of senior year

253
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,355
for Midtown High's most famous student,

254
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,788
Peter Parker.

255
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,419
Go get them, tiger!
Or should I say "spider"?

256
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,988
The crowd has continued
to grow here all morning long

257
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,056
<i>at the Midtown School of Science...</i>

258
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:18,105
The crowd seems evenly
divided between supporters of Spider-Man

259
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,195
and protesters.

260
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,002
MJ!

261
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,338
MJ! MJ! We love you!

262
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,845
MJ, are you gonna have his spider-babies?

263
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,007
Back up. Back up. Back up!

264
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,213
MJ, you know he's a murderer, right?

265
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:32,912
Peter, do a TikTok with me.

266
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,045
Mysterio forever!

267
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,180
Do a flip!

268
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,850
- Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!
- Back off.

269
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,087
Who are you?

270
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,925
- Ned Leeds. Spider-Man's best friend.
- I'm Peter Parker's best friend.

271
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,490
You come at my boy, you come at Flash Thompson.

272
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,624
If you wanna read about our inspiring friendship,

273
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,793
you can in my new book, Flashpoint.

274
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,600
One spider, two hearts,
a million crazy-ass memories.

275
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:53,936
Check it out.

276
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,133
- Go.
- No, I gotta wait...

277
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,577
- No. Go.
- I'll see you inside, okay?

278
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,444
Keep watching Midtown News all year

279
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,509
as we bring you up-close and personal coverage

280
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,681
of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet:

281
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,315
College admissions.

282
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,487
Peter,

283
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:20,966
we would love to welcome you
back to Midtown High,

284
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,661
where we shape heroes.

285
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,635
- Uh-huh.
- Or murderers.

286
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,728
- Stop it.
- Huh?

287
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,470
- It's an honor to serve you, Sir.
- It's not.

288
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,907
Mysterio was right.

289
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,673
- Stop. That's all.
- Mysterio was right.

290
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,408
Some students put this together for you.

291
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,281
- No, you did that.
- I helped a little bit.

292
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:41,287
And I tried to stop you
so many times, but you powered through.

293
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,915
- He did all of that.
- Did a great job.

294
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,324
I hope you have time to check it out.

295
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,123
Feel free to walk or swing through the hallway.

296
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,459
Or crawl on the ceiling to avoid everybody.

297
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,966
- We all know you can do it.
- I'm just gonna...

298
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,468
- I know what you did.
- Stop. You're embarrassing yourself.

299
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,163
He's a conspiracy theorist.

300
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,145
Can we just stay up here all day?

301
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,951
- It is so crazy down there.
- This one's good.

302
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,118
"Some suggest that Parker's powers
include the male spider's ability

303
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,820
to hypnotize females,

304
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:25,297
which he used to seduce Jones-Watson
into his cult of personality."

305
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,060
Stop. Stop.

306
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,726
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

307
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,974
Finally, some privacy.

308
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,741
It is so crazy down there.

309
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,207
So I was thinking...

310
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,218
when we get into MIT, we should live together.

311
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,255
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

312
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,752
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes. Minus the Frisbee and the smiling.

313
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,591
MIT's obviously the dream,

314
00:14:56,697 --> 00:15:01,066
but if we match up our backup schools,
then either way, we'll be in Boston.

315
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,126
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

316
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,399
- They have crime in Boston, right?
- Yes.

317
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,100
- Wicked crime.
- It'll be like a fresh start.

318
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,073
What's up?

319
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,779
I don't know.
I just feel like, if you don't...

320
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,381
If you expect disappointment,

321
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,942
then you can never really get disappointed.

322
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,178
Come on.

323
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,552
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

324
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,424
Yeah. No, you're right. Fresh start.

325
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,360
Yeah.

326
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,391
Fresh start.

327
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,298
First one's here!

328
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,638
It's okay. It's a backup.

329
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:45,944
Peter.

330
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,113
No?

331
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,784
Last one.

332
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:55,622
MIT?!

333
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,185
Uh... Okay.

334
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,968
- Okay.
- Whew.

335
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,476
- Ready?
- Jones,

336
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,171
I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

337
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,613
- Actually, that was Sasha, so...
- Enough attitude. Just do it.

338
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,648
On it.

339
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:27,478
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

340
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,182
Don't, because he will just make me clean it.

341
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,850
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

342
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,019
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay. You ready?

343
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,097
- Yeah.
- Okay, on three.

344
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,530
One, two, three.

345
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,049
No.

346
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,184
No.You?

347
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:11,738
"In light of recent controversy, we are unable

348
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,228
to consider your application at this time."

349
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:16,864
This is so not fair.

350
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,897
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

351
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,066
You guys definitely didn't do anything wrong.

352
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:25,703
Expect disappointment
and you will never get disappointed.

353
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,145
♫ No sleep till ♫

354
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,345
<i>♫ Bom, bom, tsk, bom, bom ♫</i>

355
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,682
♫ Boston! ♫

356
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,026
You didn't get in?

357
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,585
Yeah, because we're actually friends
with Spider-Man.

358
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,160
Uh, yeah. I better get going.

359
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,260
There's a mixer for new admissions and...

360
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,769
Sorry guys.

361
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,272
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

362
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,808
Yeah, I'm coming.

363
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,808
Know what?

364
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,373
I wouldn't change a thing I did.

365
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:02,614
Me neither.

366
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,755
Although I do need
to show this letter to my parents.

367
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:20,388
Um, hi.

368
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,461
Hi?

369
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,530
I'm, uh...

370
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,202
[Wong] The most famous person
in the world. I know.

371
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:35,441
Wong. Try not to slip.
We don't have liability insurance.

372
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,147
- Is all this for a holiday party?
- No.

373
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:44,310
One of the rotunda gateways connects to Siberia.

374
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,785
A blizzard blasted through.

375
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:50,784
Because someone forgot
to cast a monthly maintenance spell

376
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,189
to keep the seals tight.

377
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,489
That's right, he did, because he forgot
I now have higher duties.

378
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,688
Higher duties?

379
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,993
The Sorcerer Supreme has higher duties.

380
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,228
Wait, I thought you were the Sorcerer Supreme.

381
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:04,828
No, he got it on a technicality
'cause I blipped for five years.

382
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,602
- Oh. Congratulations.
- If I'd been here, then...

383
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,903
You'd burn the place down.

384
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,341
You two, no one said stop shoveling.

385
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:14,006
So, Peter, to what do I owe the pleasure?

386
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,744
Right. Um, I'm really sorry
to bother you, Sir.

387
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,785
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

388
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,517
- Think we're beyond you calling me "Sir."
- Okay, uh, Stephen.

389
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,183
That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

390
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,093
Uh...

391
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:28,892
When, um...

392
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,924
When Mysterio revealed my identity,

393
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,666
my entire life got screwed up,
and I was wondering...

394
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,672
I don't know if this would actually work,
but I was wondering if...

395
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,669
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

396
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:50,112
Peter, we tampered
with the stability of space-time

397
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,015
to resurrect countless lives.

398
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,350
You wanna do it again now
just 'cause yours got messy?

399
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,786
It's not about me.

400
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,948
This is really hurting a lot of people.

401
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:01,050
My aunt May. Happy.

402
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:02,562
My best friend, my girlfriend,

403
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,629
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

404
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,724
and they've done nothing wrong.

405
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,791
I am so sorry...

406
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:11,234
but even if I wanted to...

407
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,473
I don't have the Time Stone anymore.

408
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,800
That's right.

409
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:25,143
I'm really sorry if I wasted your time.

410
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:27,277
- You didn't.
- Just forget about it.

411
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:30,187
Oh, he will.
He's very good at forgetting things.

412
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,727
Wong, you've actually generated a good idea.

413
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:35,785
What?

414
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,955
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

415
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:39,624
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

416
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,065
It's just a standard spell of forgetting.

417
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,106
Won't turn back time, but people will
forget you were ever Spider-Man.

418
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:47,106
- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

419
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:50,769
That spell travels the dark borders
between known and unknown reality.

420
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,073
It's too dangerous.

421
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,775
We've used it for a lot less.

422
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,976
Do you remember the full-moon party at Kamar-Taj?

423
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,609
- No.
- Exactly.

424
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,614
Come on, Wong.

425
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,889
Hasn't he been through enough?

426
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:15,559
Just leave me out of this.

427
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,301
Fine.

428
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:19,536
Fine.

429
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,151
So, what is this place?

430
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:38,022
The Sanctum's built at the intersection
of cosmic energy currents.

431
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,718
We weren't the first to seek them out.

432
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:42,862
Some of these walls are thousands of years old.

433
00:22:43,831 --> 00:22:47,495
And they shot an episode
of The Equalizer here in the '80s.

434
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,660
Well, I, um...

435
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,336
really appreciate you doing this for me, Sir.

436
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,232
Don't mention it.

437
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,636
And don't call me "Sir."

438
00:22:58,745 --> 00:22:59,644
Right. Sorry.

439
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,642
You ready?

440
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:03,514
I'm ready.

441
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,220
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

442
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:12,858
Wait, excuse me?

443
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:18,296
The entire world's about to forget
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

444
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,525
- Including me.
- Everyone?

445
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:24,963
- Uh, can't some people still know?
- That's not how the spell works.

446
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,940
And it's very difficult and dangerous
to change it mid-casting.

447
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,136
So my girlfriend's gonna forget everything?

448
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,735
Is she even gonna be my girlfriend?

449
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:35,214
Was she your girlfriend
just 'cause you were Spider-Man?

450
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,751
- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

451
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:43,281
Everyone's gonna forget
you're Spider-Man except your girlfriend.

452
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,516
Thank you so much.

453
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,125
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

454
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,129
What is a Ned?

455
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,063
He's my best friend,
so it's important to me that Ned knows.

456
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:01,932
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell any more

457
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,806
- while I'm casting it.
- Okay, I'm done.

458
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:05,106
I swear, I'm done. I'm done.

459
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,843
- Ah, but my aunt May should really know.
- Peter, stop tampering with the spell.

460
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,350
When she found out I was Spider-Man,
it was really messy.

461
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,647
I don't think I could go through that again.

462
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,081
- So my aunt May?
- Yes.

463
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,681
On. Thank you. Happy?

464
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,986
No, I'm annoyed.

465
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:21,026
No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

466
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,256
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

467
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,991
Would you just stop talking?

468
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,026
[grunts]

469
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:37,442
Basically, everyone that knew
I was Spider-Man before should still know!

470
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,193
- Did it work?
- No.

471
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,360
You changed my spell six times.

472
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,096
- Five times.
- You changed my spell.

473
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,505
You don't do that! I told you.
And that is why.

474
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:10,236
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

475
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,676
something catastrophic could have happened.

476
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:15,374
- Stephen, listen, I am so...
- Call me "Sir."

477
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,147
Sorry, Sir.

478
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,250
After everything we've been through,

479
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,553
somehow I always forget you're just a kid.

480
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,655
Look, Parker, the problem is not Mysterio.

481
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,994
It's you trying to live two different lives.

482
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:34,534
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

483
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:35,830
Believe me.

484
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:39,737
I'm so sorry about you
and your friends not getting into college,

485
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,471
but if they rejected you and you tried
to convince them to reconsider,

486
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,707
there's nothing else you can do.

487
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,817
When you say "convince them,"

488
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,513
- you mean, I could have called them?
- Yeah.

489
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,148
I could do that?

490
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,556
You haven't called the...?

491
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,389
I got their letter. I assumed that was...

492
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:02,587
I'm sorry.

493
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,426
Are you telling me

494
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,763
that you didn't even think
to plead your case with them first

495
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:11,600
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

496
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,270
When you put it like that...

497
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:25,711
Come on, pick up, pick up.

498
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:27,151
Dude, what? I'm busy.

499
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,813
Flash, where's the MIT mixer?

500
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,754
- Why?
- Because I need to talk to someone.

501
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:33,144
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

502
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,389
What's in it for me?

503
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,156
I'm risking a lot just talking to you.

504
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,288
Okay, I will, um...

505
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,964
pick you up and swing you to school for one week?

506
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:42,900
Fora month.

507
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,201
- For a week.
- Two weeks.

508
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,536
- Flash, please. Help me.
- You know what I want.

509
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,611
Okay, I'll tell everyone you're my best friend.

510
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:53,646
- Flash, please, help me.
- Cool.

511
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,739
There's the assistant vice chancellor.
You can plead your case with her.

512
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,546
- Okay, perfect. Where is she?
- She left.

513
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,449
- To go where?
- To the airport.

514
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:09,496
Stark network unavailable.

515
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,065
Facial recognition unavailable.

516
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,292
Hi.

517
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,138
Yeah, I can see you.

518
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,341
Oh, my God!

519
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,314
- That's Peter Parker.
- Mom.

520
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:36,982
- Mom, look.
- Mommy.

521
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,650
No, it's Peter Parker.

522
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,166
Hey!

523
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:50,768
Okay.

524
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:02,772
Yeah.

525
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,713
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

526
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:07,344
- You do know you're in the street, right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

527
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,617
I really needed to talk to you and I know
you're on your way to the airport.

528
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:14,218
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are
the two smartest people I've ever met,

529
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:16,695
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

530
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,698
but if I didn't, millions would've died,

531
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,894
so please don't let MIT be dumb like me.

532
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:21,991
MIT is dumb?

533
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:25,004
No, I'm saying, don't let MIT be dumb.

534
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:29,600
I mean, like the dumber version of me
that wouldn't have let them help.

535
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:34,508
You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter?

536
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,174
Basically, what I'm trying to...

537
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,453
Why are you running?

538
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:50,553
Oh, my God.

539
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,193
Uh, Ma'am, you should get out of the car.

540
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,429
Everybody get off the bridge!

541
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:58,429
The door's locked.

542
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,200
Door's... Hey!

543
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,386
Hello, Peter.

544
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,417
Hi? Do we...? Do I know you?

545
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,759
What have you done with my machine?

546
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,664
I don't know what you're talking about.
What machine?

547
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,600
The power of the sun in the palm of my hand.

548
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,103
It's gone.

549
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,265
Listen, if you stop smashing cars,

550
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,968
we can work together
and I can help you find your machine.

551
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,566
You want to play games?

552
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:41,510
Catch!

553
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:00,833
It's okay.
You're safe. Get out of here.

554
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,631
You think your fancy new suit's gonna save you?

555
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,489
Should've killed your little girlfriend
when I had the chance.

556
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,858
What did you just say?

557
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,122
Looks like we got competition.

558
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,813
Peter! Help!

559
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,675
Don't worry, Ma'am!
I'm coming!

560
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,570
Peter!

561
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,528
[Whimpers]

562
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:47,131
Ma'am, just stay calm.

563
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,402
Just take a deep breath.

564
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,136
- Are you okay?
- No!

565
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:55,072
I promise, I've got this all under control.

566
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,455
- Whoa!
- Suit compromised.

567
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,559
Nanotechnology.

568
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,557
Ah, you've outdone yourself, Peter.

569
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,427
I underestimated you.

570
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,102
But now you die.

571
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:24,634
[groaning]

572
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:36,956
You're not Peter Parker.

573
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,425
I am so confused right now.

574
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,254
What's happening?

575
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,855
New device detected.

576
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,161
Pairing new device.

577
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,940
You don't listen to him. You listen to me.

578
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:01,679
Hey.

579
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:11,284
Whoa!

580
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,523
Hey. Hey!

581
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,756
Listen to me.

582
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:20,466
No, not him. Me!

583
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,638
Ma'am, you okay?

584
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:32,202
- You can still make your flight.
- Peter.

585
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:35,006
You're a hero.

586
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:36,345
No. Well, I'm...

587
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,509
No, I'm...

588
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,349
I'm gonna talk to Admissions about your friends.

589
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:41,901
And I'm gonna talk to them about you.

590
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,152
But, Ma'am, this isn't about me.

591
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:49,184
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

592
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,856
Okay?
"Really?

593
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,923
And if you keep your noses clean,
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

594
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,866
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

595
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,598
Hey. You. I see you. Come here!

596
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,002
That was not okay.

597
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:01,165
Unbelievable.

598
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:03,839
Who are...?

599
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,072
Hey, Hey, hey, hey.

600
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,046
Until you stop trying to kill me,
I'm in control, buddy,

601
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:11,812
of this whole tentacle situation
you got going on here, okay?

602
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,876
Now, who are you? What is going...?

603
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,162
No.

604
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:32,400
Osborn?

605
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:57,764
Doctor...?

606
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:08,235
Be careful what you wish for, Parker.

607
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,867
Let me out of here!

608
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,968
Can you please explain to me what is going on?

609
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,706
That little spell that you botched

610
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:16,580
where you wanted everyone
to forget that Peter Parker's Spider-Man,

611
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,585
it started pulling in everyone
who knows Peter Parker's Spider-Man

612
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:22,315
from every universe into this one.

613
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:26,394
- From every universe?
- Who are you? And where am I?

614
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,952
I think it's better we don't engage
with them because, frankly,

615
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:33,159
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.

616
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,269
The multiverse is real?

617
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,770
This shouldn't be possible.

618
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,102
- I thought you stopped the spell.
- No, I contained it.

619
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:42,438
It would appear a few of them squeaked through.

620
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,807
After you left,
I detected an otherworldly presence.

621
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:47,643
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

622
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,716
slimy, green son of a gun.

623
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:53,116
Spell? As in magic?

624
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,621
What is this, a birthday party?

625
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:58,181
Who is this clown? What is this madness?

626
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:01,660
Watch this. Do you know
a Peter Parker who's Spider-Man?

627
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,197
- Yes.
- Is that him?

628
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,787
- No.
- See?

629
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:07,926
Here's what we gotta do.

630
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,333
I don't know how many visitors we've got...

631
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,963
I saw another one on the bridge.

632
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,499
He was like a flying green elf.

633
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,601
He sounds jolly. Start with him.

634
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,341
I need you to capture them,
bring them here while I figure out

635
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:25,112
how to get them back
before they destroy the fabric of reality,

636
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,983
or worse, Wong finds out.

637
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:29,147
Uh, Doctor Strange?

638
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:30,054
What?

639
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:33,959
My friends and I just got
a second chance to get into MIT,

640
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,827
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters...

641
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:38,617
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- I'm sorry, but...

642
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,895
Are you seriously still talking about college?

643
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:42,526
Whoa...

644
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:48,937
- Hey, what did you just do?
- This.

645
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,670
Hey. you can't just... on!

646
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,850
- How did you do that?
- Lots of birthday parties.

647
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,879
Whoa!

648
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,521
Hey.

649
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:08,559
Whoa.

650
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,858
One shot, send them here, move on.
You're welcome.

651
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,558
- Get to work.
- Sir?

652
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,431
Now what?

653
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,266
This is my mess, and I swear that I'll fix it,

654
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:19,897
but I'm gonna need help.

655
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,208
Whoa.

656
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:25,540
I can't believe I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

657
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,841
Neither can I.

658
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:30,040
So how did you know you were a man of magic?

659
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:32,279
Because my Nana says
that we have it in our family,

660
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:35,412
- and I get these tinglings in my hands...
- Talk to your physician.

661
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:36,853
- Peter.
- Hey.

662
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,722
- Hey. Hey.
- "Hey. Hey.

663
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,317
Sorry for dragging you into this.

664
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:43,226
- Help me find these guys.
- You don't have to apologize, okay?

665
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,391
You got us
a second shot at MIT. It's fine.

666
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:48,060
So how did the bad guys get here?

667
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:51,264
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

668
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:54,103
- You did it with magic?
- I thought it was the MIT lady you saved.

669
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:57,439
Uh, no, that was after.
Let's just focus on the good news, okay?

670
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,240
No, let's just focus on the bad news.

671
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:03,409
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

672
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:07,751
so get on your phones, scour the Internet, and...

673
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:09,152
Scooby-Doo this shit.

674
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:14,116
You're telling us what to do, even though
it was your spell that got screwed up,

675
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:16,287
meaning that all this is your mess.

676
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:21,130
I know a couple of magic words myself,
starting with the word "please."

677
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:26,564
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

678
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:29,140
You can work in the undercroft.

679
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:32,008
The undercroft?

680
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:37,941
Badass.

681
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:41,986
Oh...

682
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:47,662
- About this whole spell thing...
- It's totally okay.

683
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:50,322
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I get it.

684
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:54,630
You were-just trying to fix things, and so...

685
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:57,399
Maybe just run it by us next time, you know?

686
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,973
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

687
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,702
that could break the universe,"

688
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,041
we could, like, help you workshop something or...

689
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,308
brainstorm ideas.

690
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:12,283
Deal.

691
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:14,878
Ned?

692
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:19,524
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal. Um...

693
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:20,856
Oh!

694
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,055
A torture rack.

695
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,458
That is a Pilates machine.

696
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,565
- That is...
- The crypt.

697
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,831
Okay, so we get the rest of the guys,

698
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,895
you zap them, Doctor Magic will send them back,

699
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:37,000
and when we get into MIT,
round of stale doughnuts, my treat.

700
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,806
Let's catch some multiverse men.

701
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:41,849
Hey! Who the Hell are these two?

702
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,441
- My friends. This is MJ. And this is Ned.
- Hey.

703
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:45,382
Hello.

704
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:49,355
- Uh, sorry, what was your name again?
- Dr. Otto Octavius.

705
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,056
Seriously, what's your actual name?

706
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,620
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

707
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,055
If the paint won't come off, I'll get it out.

708
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:24,853
No, no, no, May.
We gotta find these guys first.

709
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:27,019
Finish your mission and then come by.

710
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,562
We're having a canned-food drive.

711
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,391
- That could work.
- I got one!

712
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:32,762
- I gotta go-
- Okay.

713
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:34,925
I mean, you can take the guy out of the chair,

714
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:37,197
but you can't take the chair out of the guy.

715
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,603
- What'd you find?
- There's a...

716
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:43,371
A disturbance near a military
research facility outside of the city,

717
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:47,244
and witnesses say that they saw
a monster flying through the air.

718
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,674
It's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge.

719
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,081
That's impossible.

720
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:55,850
You know him, don't you?

721
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:59,015
On the bridge, you said his name.

722
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,691
Norman Osborn.

723
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:05,827
Brilliant scientist. Military research.

724
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:09,832
But he was greedy, misguided.

725
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:14,167
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

726
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:16,772
Okay. Um...

727
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:21,079
- I gotta go. Where am I going?
- It can't be him.

728
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,311
Why?

729
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:27,854
Because Norman Osborn died years ago.

730
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,285
So either we saw someone else...

731
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,764
or you're flying out
into the darkness to fight a ghost.

732
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:03,919
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

733
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:09,825
I genuinely don't know
how you do this without throwing up.

734
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:30,509
- [whispering] Did you see that?
- [MJ over comm] Um...

735
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:32,575
- No.
- It's really dark.

736
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,760
Okay, okay, okay.

737
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,869
What's happening?

738
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:56,103
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

739
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,038
Are you getting the tingle thing?

740
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,549
Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?

741
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,559
- Are you guys seeing this?
- Yeah.

742
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:16,661
- Osborn?
- No. He was green. This guy's blue.

743
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:21,560
Uh, you wouldn't happen
to be from another universe, would you?

744
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,634
What's he doing?

745
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:26,900
- I don't know. Looks like he's charging.
- I don't like this. Just web him.

746
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:43,118
Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!

747
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:47,091
What are you talking about? Right.
Go to the right! Right! Right!

748
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:50,927
- He means right. Don't listen to him.
- This is not helping!

749
00:43:57,438 --> 00:44:00,203
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter'? Peter.

750
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:07,175
[gasping]

751
00:44:07,848 --> 00:44:08,838
Whoa!

752
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:13,443
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko. You remember?

753
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,720
- Uh, I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter.
- What do you mean, you're not my Peter?

754
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:20,784
- What the Hell is going on?
- I'll explain, but first, can you help me?

755
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:22,761
- Okay.
- You try to surround him,

756
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,855
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

757
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:41,878
I can't hold him much longer.

758
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,477
I got it, I got it!

759
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,377
Different Peter. Weird.

760
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:17,509
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

761
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:27,260
I got my body back.

762
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,220
Hey. Um...

763
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,696
This is gonna sound really crazy,
but, uh, this isn't your universe.

764
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,394
- Another universe?
- Uh-huh.

765
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:37,163
- What?
- That's what I was feeling.

766
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,099
The power, it's different.

767
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:42,865
I like it.

768
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,447
- Easy, buddy.
- It's actually my fault that you're here.

769
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:51,610
Like, the universe or the woods?

770
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:53,386
I hate the woods.

771
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:55,388
I meant the universe, Sir.

772
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:58,824
So, what, you all just gonna stand here
and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

773
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:01,122
- I am.
- Uh, no, no. Uh...

774
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:02,218
I, uh...

775
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:05,931
[gasping]

776
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:16,836
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

777
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,639
- No. It's okay.
- Did you kill him?

778
00:46:18,746 --> 00:46:21,113
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I can explain everything. Trust me.

779
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,946
- Please, just trust me.
- I don't trust you. I don't know you.

780
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:28,147
Ugh. What is this?

781
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,083
You picked the wrong side.

782
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:34,922
Connors?

783
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,592
Wait. You know this creature?

784
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,727
No, no, no.
Not a creature. A man.

785
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,998
Whoa. The same universes.

786
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:48,132
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist
at Oscorp when I worked there.

787
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:50,267
A brilliant scientist.

788
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:51,971
Until he turned himself into a lizard.

789
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,173
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

790
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,682
- It was crazy.
- It wasn't crazy, Max.

791
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:58,878
It was the next step in human evolution.

792
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,045
- The dinosaur can talk. Right.
- Lizard.

793
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,714
What happened to you?

794
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:06,555
Last I recall, you had bad teeth,
glasses and a comb-over.

795
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,458
Did you get a makeover?

796
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:11,788
You know I can give you a real makeover.

797
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:13,230
Let me guess, into a lizard?

798
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,893
- Exactly.
- Would you two just shut up?

799
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,698
- Where are we?
- It's complicated.

800
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,399
- A Wizard's dungeon.
- Wizard's dungeon?

801
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:24,171
There's no real way to sugarcoat that.
It's literally the dungeon of a wizard.

802
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:25,734
You can keep your magic.

803
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:29,542
I want a taste of that energy I just felt.

804
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,990
- Oh, Peter, hey.
- Did those guys come through yet?

805
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:38,047
There should be an electric guy and a sand guy.

806
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:40,684
Yeah, they're all here and locked up.

807
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:43,695
Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here
and try and fix some of this damage

808
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:45,526
so they don't blame it on me again.

809
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,965
- Okay.
- But, hey, I, uh...

810
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:51,666
I couldn't do any of this without you,
so thank you.

811
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:52,570
Of course.

812
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,968
Hey, ask him if this is like a tree monster

813
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,410
or like a scientist that turned into a tree.

814
00:47:58,512 --> 00:48:00,139
It's just a tree, man.

815
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,011
Just a tree.

816
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:22,433
Coward. We have a new world to conquer.

817
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:25,873
You make me sick.

818
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:27,737
Leave me alone, please.

819
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:30,436
Hiding in the shadows.

820
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,242
Hiding from who you truly are.

821
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:36,874
- No.
- You can't escape yourself.

822
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:55,096
- Hey, May.
- Hey, Peter. I'm at work,

823
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:58,536
and, um, one of the guys
you're looking for just walked in.

824
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:10,073
May? Where's May? Thank you.

825
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:14,285
May.

826
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,156
Ah. Hey, here he is.

827
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:21,489
Norman, this is my nephew.

828
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,624
Norman Osborn? I thought that you were...

829
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:29,294
I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place.

830
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:32,137
And I thought he could help me.

831
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:34,070
But you're not him.

832
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,473
Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?

833
00:49:36,577 --> 00:49:38,272
He just wandered in.

834
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,081
I didn't know where else to go.

835
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:46,610
Someone's living in my house.

836
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,187
Oscorp doesn't exist.

837
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:53,184
My son...

838
00:49:57,264 --> 00:50:00,199
Sometimes I'm not myself.

839
00:50:01,635 --> 00:50:04,798
- I'm... someone else.
- Mm-hm.

840
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:07,341
And every time he's in control, I can't remember.

841
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:09,706
- Who's in control?
- And now I'm here...

842
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,973
- Who's in control?
- I don't know what's going on.

843
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:16,641
- Okay, it's okay.
- And I don't... Doesn't make sense.

844
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:19,516
He's lost.

845
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:23,147
And I don't mean just in the cosmos.
I mean in his mind.

846
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,321
Are they all like this?

847
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:29,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

848
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:32,764
They all have their own mental
or physical issues.

849
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,767
Oh, well, he needs help, and maybe they all do.

850
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:39,901
Wait, you don't mean...?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

851
00:50:40,007 --> 00:50:41,907
Peter, not your problem?

852
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:42,840
Hmm?

853
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,403
May, their chance of getting help is
way better back where they came from.

854
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:51,348
Sending them home, that's the best thing
that we can do for them.

855
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,682
For them? Or for yourself?

856
00:50:56,757 --> 00:51:00,022
Look around you. This is what we do.

857
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:03,928
- We help people.
- This is what's best for them.

858
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:05,889
Trust me.

859
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:12,400
But the fact remains, Spider-Man is a menace.

860
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:17,540
We'll be right back after a brief word
from Daily Bugle Supplements.

861
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:20,410
The only other daily fix you need.

862
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:21,539
And we're out.

863
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:25,383
What?

864
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:29,783
I got eyes on him.

865
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,086
- He's with his aunt and some guy.
- You sure?

866
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,992
- They're just leaving the shelter.
- Okay. Don't lose him.

867
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:49,035
Thanks, May. Hope to see you again.

868
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:53,046
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

869
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:56,444
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

870
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:58,550
See you later.

871
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:03,887
- Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's "doctor."

872
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:06,221
Sorry. Dr. Osborn, these are my friends.

873
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:07,624
This is Ned and MJ.

874
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:11,959
- Mary Jane?
- It's Michelle Jones, actually.

875
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:14,865
Fascinating.

876
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,198
Do you think there are other Ned Leedses?

877
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:35,952
Octavius?

878
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:41,256
Osborn?

879
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:43,492
What happened to you?

880
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:44,689
What happened to...?

881
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,931
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

882
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,528
You died, Norman.

883
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,198
Years ago.

884
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,767
You're insane.

885
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:56,833
God, I love it here.

886
00:52:56,944 --> 00:53:00,278
What are you talking about?
He's standing right there.

887
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:01,439
- He's not...
- Dead.

888
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:05,213
They both died, fighting Spider-Man.

889
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,121
It was all over the news.

890
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:16,027
Green Goblin, impaled
by the glider you flew around on.

891
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:20,725
And a couple of years later, you, Doc Ock,

892
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:23,860
- drowned in the river with your machine.
- Nonsense.

893
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:29,165
Spider-Man was trying to stop
my fusion reactor, so I stopped him.

894
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,505
I had him by the throat, and then I...

895
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,850
And then I was here.

896
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,014
Ah, please.
Let me tell you something.

897
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:44,148
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

898
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:46,751
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

899
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,056
I was stuck in the grid, absorbing data.

900
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:51,530
I was about to turn into pure energy, and then...

901
00:53:51,598 --> 00:53:52,531
And then, uh...

902
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:55,660
And then... Oh, shit.

903
00:53:57,037 --> 00:54:01,406
- I was about to die.
- Max, do you know? Do I die?

904
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:06,943
- Oh, great. You caught another one.
- No, wait, Strange.

905
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:08,708
He's not dangerous.

906
00:54:10,684 --> 00:54:12,049
It's okay. Um...

907
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:15,755
What is that?

908
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:19,054
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina Di Kadavus.

909
00:54:19,126 --> 00:54:22,426
I've trapped your corrupted spell inside,
and once I finish the proper ritual,

910
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:26,558
it'll reverse the spell and send
these guys back to their universes.

911
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:29,125
And then what? We perish?

912
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:30,931
No. No, thanks. I'll pass on that.

913
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:33,996
Let me out of here. Peter!

914
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:37,908
Strange, we can't send them back. Not yet.

915
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:39,477
Why?

916
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:44,750
- Well, some of these guys are gonna die.
- Parker.

917
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,147
It's their fate.

918
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:49,620
Come on, have a heart.

919
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:54,486
In the grand calculus of the multiverse,

920
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:58,929
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives.

921
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:05,796
I'm sorry, kid.

922
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,339
If they die, they die.

923
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:24,314
Peter!

924
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:38,905
Don't.

925
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:43,971
- What are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go!

926
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:45,044
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

927
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:49,145
This is why I never had kids.

928
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:04,962
- Give me the box.
- No.

929
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,300
Whoa!

930
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:24,782
Oh, my God, I'm dead.

931
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:27,786
You're not dead, you've just been
separated from your physical form.

932
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:29,856
My physical... What?

933
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:32,590
How are you doing that?

934
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:36,254
- I have no idea.
- You should not be able to do that.

935
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:37,797
This feels amazing.

936
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:50,844
One of the coolest things that's happened to me,

937
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,379
but don't ever do that again.

938
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:00,520
Hey! Get off of me!

939
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,079
♫... La, La, La ♫

940
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:30,845
♫ Tis the season to be jolly ♫

941
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,147
♫ Fa, La, La, La, La, La, La... ♫

942
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,126
What is this place?

943
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:53,071
The Mirror Dimension, where I'm in control.

944
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:04,741
Strange, stop!
Can we just talk about this?

945
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:07,810
Parker, don't you realize that in the multiverse,

946
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:12,484
there are an infinite number of people
who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?

947
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:15,460
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

948
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:18,294
I know, I get it,
but we can't just send them home to die.

949
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:19,594
It's their fate.

950
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:23,269
You can't change that any more
than you could change who they are.

951
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:26,534
What if we could?
What if we could change their fate?

952
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,700
Whoa. What are you doing?

953
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,681
I'm not giving you the... Whoa!

954
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:48,757
Give me that back!

955
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,980
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

956
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,487
The dimension is just geometry?
You're great at geometry.

957
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:16,148
You can do geometry.

958
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:19,925
Square the radius. Divide by pi.

959
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:22,724
- Plot points along the curve.
- It's over, Parker.

960
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,857
I'll come pick you up when it's done.

961
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:28,759
Hey, Strange.

962
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:31,195
You know what's cooler than magic?

963
00:59:35,276 --> 00:59:37,574
- Math.
- Don't do this.

964
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,549
- Ow.
- I'm sorry, Sir, but...

965
00:59:47,154 --> 00:59:48,417
I have to try.

966
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:51,887
- What happened?
- I had a fight with Strange and I won.

967
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:54,092
- What happened?
- I had a fight with Strange and I won.

968
00:59:54,161 --> 00:59:55,993
- What?
- I stole his ring thing.

969
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:56,995
Whoa.

970
00:59:57,097 --> 01:00:01,056
I was swinging, and then I went
through this massive mirror thing,

971
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,762
- and then I was back...
- Where is he?

972
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,702
He's trapped, but I'm not sure for how long.

973
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:06,763
You could have left us to die.

974
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:08,308
Why didn't you?

975
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:09,876
'Cause that's not who he is.

976
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:15,272
I think I can help you guys.

977
01:00:15,382 --> 01:00:18,079
If I can fix what happened to you,
then when you go back,

978
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:21,588
things will be different,
and you might not die fighting Spider-Man.

979
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:23,953
- What do you mean?
- Our technology is advanced,

980
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:28,495
I can help you. You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

981
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:32,363
Octavius knows what I can do.

982
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,992
Fix? You mean like a dog?

983
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:36,433
I refuse.

984
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:39,165
I can't promise you guys anything,
but at least this way,

985
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:41,469
you get to go home and have a chance.

986
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:42,703
A second chance.

987
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:45,209
Isn't that worth trying?

988
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:48,942
Trust me, Peter, when you try to fix people,

989
01:00:49,016 --> 01:00:51,713
there are always consequences.

990
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:55,016
You don't have to come.
I also didn't know that you could talk.

991
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:56,556
But if you stay here...

992
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:59,024
you'll have to deal with the wizard.

993
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:03,620
Ah. So we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

994
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:05,131
I just wanna go home.

995
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:08,931
I, myself, don't wanna be killed,
especially by a guy dressed

996
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:12,496
like Dungeons & Dragons, so, what's your plan?

997
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,635
I have it all under control.

998
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,179
[whispering]
What are we gonna do about this thing?

999
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:23,807
Uh, we need to find somewhere safe for it, right?

1000
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:26,114
- You gotta take it.
- Wait, what?

1001
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:29,520
If something bad happens,
you just push this and then it's over.

1002
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:31,387
We're not gonna leave you.

1003
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:32,721
You can't. It's dangerous.

1004
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:34,817
- You have done enough.
- We're in this together.

1005
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:38,422
I know we're in this together, Ned,
but I can't do this if you're in danger.

1006
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:41,263
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1007
01:01:44,238 --> 01:01:46,172
- Please.
- Fine.

1008
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:48,070
- Thank you.
- But, Peter,

1009
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:50,405
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1010
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:52,707
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it.

1011
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,842
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

1012
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:58,783
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

1013
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:01,514
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely, she will.

1014
01:02:02,923 --> 01:02:05,756
- Okay. See you later.
- Be safe.

1015
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:07,054
- You too.
- Okay.

1016
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,019
Whoa.

1017
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:12,096
Okay.

1018
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,869
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

1019
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:24,675
So, uh...

1020
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,577
who's coming with me?

1021
01:02:31,886 --> 01:02:32,717
Well, I'm in.

1022
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,821
But if this goes sideways...

1023
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:39,082
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

1024
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:54,405
- Where's Connors?
- He wants to stay in the truck.

1025
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:57,274
- Okay.
- Alarm system deactivated.

1026
01:02:58,412 --> 01:02:59,277
Hey, May-

1027
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:02,978
- Yeah?
- I feel bad using Happy's place like this.

1028
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,074
No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1029
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:09,048
New Yorkers oppose
the Statue of Liberty renovation...

1030
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:09,954
Oh, sorry.

1031
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:13,085
So this is your plan, Peter? Hmm?

1032
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,491
No lab, no facilities?

1033
01:03:14,595 --> 01:03:17,292
Just performing miracles
in a condominium? Hmm?

1034
01:03:17,398 --> 01:03:20,595
What, you gonna cook us some cures
and some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1035
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:23,659
- I could go fora burrito.
- He's gonna kill us all.

1036
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:25,068
Well, let's hope not.

1037
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,934
- You're up first, Doc.
- What?

1038
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,601
Hey, I told you, I don't need fixing.

1039
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:32,436
I don't need fixing!

1040
01:03:32,513 --> 01:03:36,848
Especially by a teenager using scraps
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1041
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,510
Nah, nah, nah. He got something back there.

1042
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:42,385
I can feel it. That weird energy.

1043
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:46,383
- What the Hell is that?
- It's a fabricator.

1044
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:50,520
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1045
01:03:51,532 --> 01:03:53,796
I thought that was the tanning bed Happy broke.

1046
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,694
Look at that.

1047
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:06,642
He's gonna kill us all.

1048
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:15,781
Oh!

1049
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:17,187
What's going on there?

1050
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:20,988
So the chip in the back of Doc's
neck was designed to protect his brain

1051
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:25,123
from the Al system that's controlling
these tentacles, but if you look here...

1052
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:27,998
the chip is fried.

1053
01:04:28,068 --> 01:04:30,332
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1054
01:04:30,404 --> 01:04:32,498
the tentacles are now in control of him.

1055
01:04:32,573 --> 01:04:37,670
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1056
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:46,884
Thirsty?

1057
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,589
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1058
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:53,793
Fresh water or salt?

1059
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:56,627
You know, because you're an octopus.

1060
01:04:58,532 --> 01:04:59,693
What?

1061
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:02,466
Fresh water it is.

1062
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:04,765
Look at this place.

1063
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:08,870
- And all the possibilities.
- What, this condo?

1064
01:05:08,942 --> 01:05:12,037
Yeah, yeah, the condo.
I love the whole open floor plan. No.

1065
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:14,342
Nah, man, I'm talking about the world.

1066
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,213
I kind of like who I am here.

1067
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:20,713
And all that power back there...

1068
01:05:21,889 --> 01:05:23,379
I could be so much more.

1069
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:25,854
So Why'd you come along?

1070
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:28,725
I have a daughter, and I want to see her.

1071
01:05:28,796 --> 01:05:30,924
But he's not gonna send anyone home

1072
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:33,864
till he's finished
his little science project back there.

1073
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:35,630
You trust him?

1074
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:37,033
I don't trust anyone.

1075
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:40,598
- How'd you end up like that, anyway?
- Oh.

1076
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:43,773
The place where I worked at,

1077
01:05:43,844 --> 01:05:48,611
they were experimenting with electricity
created by living organisms, and then...

1078
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,813
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

1079
01:05:51,919 --> 01:05:54,911
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1080
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:55,820
Damn.

1081
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:58,618
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1082
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:00,824
Remarkable.

1083
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:04,696
The technology and you.

1084
01:06:07,534 --> 01:06:08,865
When all this is over,

1085
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:14,131
if you need a job and you're willing
to commute to another universe...

1086
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:23,649
It worked. That totally worked!

1087
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,948
- I got it. I did it. Will you send him up?
- Here we go.

1088
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:30,157
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1089
01:06:30,257 --> 01:06:32,817
Oh, will these humiliations never cease?

1090
01:06:32,926 --> 01:06:35,918
You, keep your science-fair project away from me!

1091
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,623
It'll work. Have faith.

1092
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:40,690
Says the reckless fool
who turned himself into a monster.

1093
01:06:41,936 --> 01:06:43,836
Please stop moving your head.

1094
01:06:43,904 --> 01:06:47,363
- Hold still.
- Don't you dare.

1095
01:06:51,312 --> 01:06:55,545
I swear, when I get out of this,
we're gonna rip you a new...

1096
01:07:00,054 --> 01:07:01,044
Doc?

1097
01:07:06,994 --> 01:07:07,825
Doc?

1098
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:10,761
Doc?

1099
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:15,002
Dr. Octav...

1100
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:21,235
It's so quiet.

1101
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:28,012
Those voices inside my head...

1102
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:34,684
I'd almost forgotten.

1103
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:37,190
Otto.

1104
01:07:38,525 --> 01:07:40,254
Yes. Norman.

1105
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,795
It's me.

1106
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,401
Would you look at that?

1107
01:08:11,992 --> 01:08:15,121
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1108
01:08:15,229 --> 01:08:16,526
Yeah, you're welcome.

1109
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:18,354
How can I help?

1110
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:21,227
This is Peter. Leave a message.

1111
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:25,765
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy.
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1112
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:28,069
Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg?

1113
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:30,543
You bring a cyborg with robot legs into my house?

1114
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:33,103
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1115
01:08:42,323 --> 01:08:43,813
How does it feel, Norman?

1116
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,650
You're about to become whole again.

1117
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:49,789
No more darker half.

1118
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:51,629
Just you.

1119
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:53,857
Just me.

1120
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,368
Okay. Um...

1121
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,447
It just goes right here. This...

1122
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:10,773
That should be drawing power now.

1123
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:14,549
I'll come back in a second to check on it,
but keep an eye on the lights.

1124
01:09:14,655 --> 01:09:17,556
When they're all green,
the electricity in your body's dissipated.

1125
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:21,424
Well, not all of the electricity. You need
electricity for your brain to function.

1126
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:22,860
Your nervous system is...

1127
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:25,778
I'm not really sure
why I'm explaining electricity to you.

1128
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,666
- Hmm. Yeah, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1129
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:29,861
Are these your Legos?

1130
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:34,167
Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back.

1131
01:09:40,047 --> 01:09:42,539
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1132
01:09:43,784 --> 01:09:46,048
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1133
01:09:46,153 --> 01:09:49,987
The sooner you guys get through this,
the sooner we go home.

1134
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:00,095
- Well, where is he?
- He's inside.

1135
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,861
And yet here we are, outside.

1136
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:03,927
Did you not hear me say, "Don't lose him"?

1137
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:05,938
I want incriminating footage of Spider-Man.

1138
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,008
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1139
01:10:08,075 --> 01:10:09,600
And so it begins.

1140
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,610
Place is about to be swarming with cops.

1141
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:32,062
Peter'?

1142
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,365
What's wrong?

1143
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:36,567
I don't know.

1144
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:38,569
May?

1145
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:45,936
What is it, Peter?

1146
01:10:52,953 --> 01:10:54,785
What's happening?

1147
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:02,888
Why are you looking at me like that?

1148
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:23,379
That's some neat trick, that sense of yours.

1149
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:26,943
- Norman?
- Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1150
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:29,917
- The Hell?
- The Goblin.

1151
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:35,924
"No more darker half"? Did you really
think that I'd let that happen?

1152
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:40,290
That I'd let you take away my power
just because you're blind

1153
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:43,769
-to what true power can bring you?
- You don't know me.

1154
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:45,067
Don't I?

1155
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:51,074
I saw how she trapped you,

1156
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:53,773
fighting her holy moral mission.

1157
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:58,679
We don't need you to save us.

1158
01:11:58,786 --> 01:12:00,811
We don't need to be fixed.

1159
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:06,326
These are not curses.

1160
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:09,323
They're gifts.

1161
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:12,689
- Norman, no.
- Quiet, lapdog.

1162
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,360
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- I've watched you

1163
01:12:15,469 --> 01:12:19,235
from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1164
01:12:19,907 --> 01:12:25,243
Struggling to have everything you want

1165
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:28,873
while the world tries to make you choose.

1166
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:34,316
Gods don't have to choose.

1167
01:12:36,457 --> 01:12:37,891
We take.

1168
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:39,460
May, run.

1169
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,876
Oh, my God.

1170
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:07,847
- What have you done?
- I liked you better before.

1171
01:13:17,264 --> 01:13:20,199
Up here! He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1172
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:44,282
Did you see that?

1173
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:11,943
No, you don't!

1174
01:14:21,362 --> 01:14:23,694
Strong enough to have it all.

1175
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:28,466
Too weak to take it!

1176
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:46,110
[groaning]

1177
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:05,368
Now I got you.

1178
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,873
I told you, there would be consequences!

1179
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:31,554
Your weakness, Peter, is morality.

1180
01:15:32,099 --> 01:15:36,002
It's choking you. Can't you feel it?

1181
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:45,675
It didn't work.

1182
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,709
Norman was right.

1183
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:52,480
He got it from you, that pathetic sickness.

1184
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:58,818
You tried to fix me.

1185
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:00,854
May, go.

1186
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:03,158
Now I'm gonna fix you.

1187
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:08,259
May, run, please.

1188
01:16:11,772 --> 01:16:13,103
- [May yells]
- [Peter] May!

1189
01:16:19,713 --> 01:16:21,738
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1190
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:24,910
No good deed goes unpunished.

1191
01:16:25,486 --> 01:16:27,648
You can thank me later.

1192
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,789
No!

1193
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:05,556
- May?
- Peter.

1194
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,025
May, May, I'm here.

1195
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:11,796
May.

1196
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:13,456
May, I'm here.

1197
01:17:14,535 --> 01:17:16,833
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1198
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,105
[gasping]

1199
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:25,168
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1200
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:26,974
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1201
01:17:27,047 --> 01:17:28,173
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1202
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:31,884
I think I broke my ribs.

1203
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,453
- This is all my fault, May.
- No.

1204
01:17:39,526 --> 01:17:41,494
I should have let Strange send them back.

1205
01:17:41,562 --> 01:17:42,688
You did the right thing.

1206
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:46,659
They would have been killed.
You did the right thing.

1207
01:17:47,368 --> 01:17:49,393
It's not my responsibility, May.

1208
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:52,563
Oh.

1209
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:54,197
What Norman said?

1210
01:17:55,643 --> 01:17:57,543
My moral mission? No.

1211
01:17:57,644 --> 01:17:59,703
- No, May...
- Peter, you listen to me.

1212
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:02,071
You have a gift.

1213
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:05,049
You have power.

1214
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,354
And with great power,

1215
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:11,380
there must also come
great responsibility. Hmm?

1216
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:17,460
I know.

1217
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,465
Let's get the...out of here.

1218
01:18:19,533 --> 01:18:20,659
Okay, let's go.

1219
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:23,530
Let me just catch my...

1220
01:18:39,653 --> 01:18:41,644
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1221
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:43,486
Yeah, you're okay. What happened?

1222
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:46,384
Just have to...

1223
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:48,528
catch my breath.

1224
01:18:48,596 --> 01:18:50,530
Okay, well, catch your breath.
I'm right here.

1225
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:51,724
We're gonna take our time.

1226
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:54,824
You catch your breath
and then we'll take you to a doctor, okay?

1227
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:14,277
Are you okay?

1228
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:18,256
Somebody help!
I need an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1229
01:19:18,325 --> 01:19:20,259
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1230
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:22,955
You're okay, you're okay.

1231
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:27,167
Let me just... Let me catch my breath.

1232
01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:29,134
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1233
01:19:29,737 --> 01:19:30,727
I'm right here.

1234
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:38,768
You're okay.

1235
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:41,505
It's just me and you.

1236
01:19:51,759 --> 01:19:52,590
May?

1237
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,097
May?

1238
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:07,872
Will you look at me, please?

1239
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:17,515
May.

1240
01:20:18,686 --> 01:20:19,517
May.

1241
01:20:21,522 --> 01:20:22,580
What are you doing, May?

1242
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:25,523
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1243
01:20:48,482 --> 01:20:50,177
Get out of the car now! Move!

1244
01:20:56,724 --> 01:20:58,385
Get off, get off, get off me.

1245
01:21:00,728 --> 01:21:01,559
Peter!

1246
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:03,460
- Run!
- It's just me and you, okay?

1247
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:05,397
It's just me and you, okay?

1248
01:21:05,499 --> 01:21:07,228
Oh, May, I'm sorry.

1249
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:08,495
I'm so sorry.

1250
01:21:08,569 --> 01:21:10,230
I'm so, so, so sorry. I love you.

1251
01:21:10,337 --> 01:21:12,806
Parker, come out with your hands up!

1252
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:15,909
Come out right now, or we will open fire!

1253
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:16,943
Run!

1254
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:23,441
All right, let's go, let's go!
Move in!

1255
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:42,294
[Jameson on TV] Tragedy.

1256
01:21:46,107 --> 01:21:47,541
What else can I call it?

1257
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:50,642
What more need be said?

1258
01:21:51,612 --> 01:21:54,138
The damage, the destruction.

1259
01:21:54,949 --> 01:21:56,815
You saw it with your own eyes.

1260
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:03,289
When will people wake up and realize
that everywhere Spider-Man goes,

1261
01:22:03,391 --> 01:22:06,224
chaos and calamity ensue?

1262
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:11,123
Everything Spider-Man touches comes to ruin.

1263
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:14,223
And we, the innocents,

1264
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:16,836
are left to pick up the pieces.

1265
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:21,467
J. Jonah Jameson reporting.

1266
01:22:21,575 --> 01:22:24,636
Good night, and God help us all.

1267
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:47,632
We are told
that multiple people have been injured,

1268
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:52,070
and we can confirm
at least one person has been killed.

1269
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:53,163
Still nothing?

1270
01:22:54,842 --> 01:22:55,741
No.

1271
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:12,656
I'm gonna press it.

1272
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:17,356
- What? No, he...
- I know he told me to wait...

1273
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:20,994
-but I'm gonna do it.
- I just wish...

1274
01:23:21,068 --> 01:23:22,797
I just wish we could see him.

1275
01:23:28,075 --> 01:23:29,167
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1276
01:23:30,211 --> 01:23:31,645
- Do that again.
- Yeah.

1277
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:35,344
I just wish we could see him.

1278
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:40,084
Okay.

1279
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:42,686
I just wish we could see Peter.

1280
01:23:45,226 --> 01:23:47,752
Whoa.

1281
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:51,388
Lola, you're right. I am magic.

1282
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,531
Is that him?

1283
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:56,836
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
- Peter. Peter!

1284
01:23:56,904 --> 01:23:58,929
- Hey, Peter! Yeah.
- Peter!

1285
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:05,337
Whoa.

1286
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:08,939
Hi. Hi.

1287
01:24:09,049 --> 01:24:12,110
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1288
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:16,119
Okay.

1289
01:24:18,726 --> 01:24:21,252
- Who the Hell are you?
- I'm Peter Parker.

1290
01:24:21,362 --> 01:24:25,526
- That's not possible.
- I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1291
01:24:25,599 --> 01:24:28,694
But then yesterday, I was...

1292
01:24:30,437 --> 01:24:32,235
I was just here.

1293
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:35,070
Wow.

1294
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:40,203
String theory, multidimensional reality...

1295
01:24:41,515 --> 01:24:43,005
and matter displacement.

1296
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:44,582
All real?

1297
01:24:44,685 --> 01:24:45,675
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1298
01:24:45,753 --> 01:24:46,948
I knew it.

1299
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,453
This has to be because of the spell.

1300
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:52,855
The spell? Like magic spell?

1301
01:24:52,927 --> 01:24:54,759
- Uh, there's no spell. No.
- No spell.

1302
01:24:54,862 --> 01:24:56,591
- Magic's real here too?
- I mean...

1303
01:24:56,697 --> 01:24:59,098
- Shut up, Ned. Shut up.
- No, it's not real.

1304
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,725
- There's magicians, but there's no...
- Stop talking.

1305
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,463
Stop. Stop.

1306
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:05,602
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1307
01:25:05,706 --> 01:25:09,074
- That you're Peter Parker.
- I don't carry an ID with me, you know?

1308
01:25:09,143 --> 01:25:11,578
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1309
01:25:14,248 --> 01:25:16,478
- Why'd you do that?
- To see if you have the tingle thing.

1310
01:25:16,483 --> 01:25:18,451
I have the tingle thing, just not for bread.

1311
01:25:18,552 --> 01:25:20,543
Can you not throw the bread again?

1312
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:22,885
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1313
01:25:24,591 --> 01:25:25,615
and I respect it.

1314
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:32,129
Crawl around.

1315
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:34,133
- Crawl around?
- Yes.

1316
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:35,794
- No.
- Yes, crawl around.

1317
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:37,531
- Why do I need to?
- This is not enough.

1318
01:25:37,638 --> 01:25:38,918
- This is plenty.
- No, it's not.

1319
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:40,693
- Yes, it is. It is.
- No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

1320
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:43,268
- How do I stick to the ceiling?
- Do it.

1321
01:25:45,112 --> 01:25:48,878
Ned. [speaking Tagalog]

1322
01:25:51,552 --> 01:25:54,988
My Lola's asking
if you could just get the cobweb there.

1323
01:25:55,055 --> 01:25:56,955
- Since you're, like, up there.
- Yeah.

1324
01:26:04,965 --> 01:26:05,830
Thank you.

1325
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:11,569
We...

1326
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:13,037
We good?

1327
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,039
For now.

1328
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:17,709
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1329
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:20,075
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1330
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,080
- Ouch.
- No offense.

1331
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,309
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it.

1332
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:28,019
Find Peter Parker.

1333
01:26:28,122 --> 01:26:30,147
- What's the thing on his hand?
- Shh.

1334
01:26:30,224 --> 01:26:32,215
Find Peter Parker.

1335
01:26:34,228 --> 01:26:35,787
Find Peter Parker!

1336
01:26:45,172 --> 01:26:46,640
Great, it's just some random guy.

1337
01:26:47,508 --> 01:26:48,373
Hello.

1338
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:51,504
Um, I hope it's okay,
I just came through this, uh...

1339
01:26:52,513 --> 01:26:54,379
Oh. It just closed.

1340
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:57,179
You're Peter?

1341
01:26:57,985 --> 01:27:00,181
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1342
01:27:02,323 --> 01:27:03,984
I've seen you two...

1343
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:07,258
Hi.

1344
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:14,160
Wait. He's... He's not your friend.

1345
01:27:27,348 --> 01:27:28,509
Huh.

1346
01:27:30,084 --> 01:27:33,247
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1347
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,812
I generally don't go around advertising it.

1348
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:37,982
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1349
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,932
- I just said that.
- That's what he just said.

1350
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:55,733
My Lola's asking if you could clean up
the webs you just shot.

1351
01:27:55,809 --> 01:27:57,504
- Oh, sorry, Lola.
- Yes, of course.

1352
01:27:57,611 --> 01:27:58,976
I'm going to bed.

1353
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:01,309
- Night, Lola.
- Good night, Ned's Lola.

1354
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:04,281
Uh, this might seem kind of weird,

1355
01:28:04,818 --> 01:28:07,446
but I've been trying to find
your friend ever since I got here.

1356
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:10,752
I just have this sense...

1357
01:28:12,827 --> 01:28:14,158
that he needs my help.

1358
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:15,251
Our help.

1359
01:28:17,197 --> 01:28:18,289
He does.

1360
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:20,094
We don't know where he is.

1361
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:24,161
And, um, honestly,
right now we're all he really has left.

1362
01:28:25,673 --> 01:28:30,668
Well, uh, is there someplace that he might go

1363
01:28:30,778 --> 01:28:32,940
that has meaning to him?

1364
01:28:34,448 --> 01:28:37,941
Like a place where he would go to just...?

1365
01:28:38,018 --> 01:28:39,508
Get away from everything?

1366
01:28:42,623 --> 01:28:45,854
For me, it was the top of the Chrysler Building.

1367
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,189
Empire State.

1368
01:28:47,294 --> 01:28:50,457
- It's just a... It's a better view.
- That is a sweet view.

1369
01:28:53,267 --> 01:28:54,132
Yes.

1370
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:58,139
Yeah. I think
I know exactly where that would be.

1371
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:35,206
I'm sorry.

1372
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:44,043
Peter, there's...

1373
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,076
There's some people here.

1374
01:29:48,589 --> 01:29:49,420
What?

1375
01:29:58,599 --> 01:29:59,896
Hey, wait, wait! Whoa.

1376
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:02,068
What...?

1377
01:30:05,105 --> 01:30:05,936
Sorry...

1378
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:08,808
about May.

1379
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:17,746
Yeah. Sorry.
I got some understanding

1380
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:18,738
of what it is you're...

1381
01:30:18,786 --> 01:30:21,414
No, please don't tell me
that you know what I'm going through.

1382
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:23,920
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1383
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:28,292
And it's all my fault.

1384
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,797
She died for nothing.

1385
01:30:37,571 --> 01:30:39,571
I'll do what I should have done
in the first place.

1386
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:41,870
- Peter...
- Please don't.

1387
01:30:42,977 --> 01:30:46,242
You don't belong here. Either of you.
So I'm sending you home.

1388
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:49,977
Those other guys are from your worlds, right?

1389
01:30:50,918 --> 01:30:52,408
So you deal with it.

1390
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:54,420
If they die, if you kill them...

1391
01:30:55,389 --> 01:30:56,220
that's on you.

1392
01:30:57,424 --> 01:30:58,289
It's not my problem.

1393
01:30:59,259 --> 01:31:00,488
I don't care anymore.

1394
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:02,760
I'm done.

1395
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:10,099
I'm really sorry that I dragged you into this.

1396
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:15,402
But you have to go home now.

1397
01:31:17,945 --> 01:31:18,776
Good luck.

1398
01:31:24,485 --> 01:31:26,249
My uncle Ben was killed.

1399
01:31:27,922 --> 01:31:28,946
It was my fault.

1400
01:31:30,524 --> 01:31:31,423
I lost...

1401
01:31:34,595 --> 01:31:36,324
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1402
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:38,955
She was my MJ.

1403
01:31:41,836 --> 01:31:43,031
I couldn't save her.

1404
01:31:44,705 --> 01:31:47,072
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1405
01:31:50,211 --> 01:31:52,077
But I carried on, tried to, um...

1406
01:31:53,314 --> 01:31:55,544
Tried to keep going, tried to keep being...

1407
01:31:57,318 --> 01:31:59,184
the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man

1408
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:01,415
'cause I know that's what she would've wanted.

1409
01:32:02,256 --> 01:32:05,487
But at some point,
I just stopped pulling my punches.

1410
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,656
I got rageful.

1411
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:14,430
I got bitter.

1412
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:19,898
I just don't want you to end up like me.

1413
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:24,007
The night Ben died...

1414
01:32:25,346 --> 01:32:27,440
I hunted down the man who I thought did it.

1415
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,613
I wanted him dead.

1416
01:32:33,521 --> 01:32:34,955
I got what I wanted.

1417
01:32:37,425 --> 01:32:38,950
It didn't make it better.

1418
01:32:42,997 --> 01:32:45,193
It took me a long time...

1419
01:32:47,234 --> 01:32:48,861
to learn to get through that darkness.

1420
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,434
I wanna kill him.

1421
01:32:56,277 --> 01:32:57,767
I wanna tear him apart.

1422
01:33:01,849 --> 01:33:03,783
I can still hear her voice in my head.

1423
01:33:09,223 --> 01:33:10,918
Even after she was hurt,

1424
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:13,221
she said to me that we did the right thing.

1425
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:24,061
She told me that with great power...

1426
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,969
Comes great responsibility.

1427
01:33:33,447 --> 01:33:34,881
Wait, what? How do you know that?

1428
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:36,474
Uncle Ben said it.

1429
01:33:36,584 --> 01:33:38,052
The day he died.

1430
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:44,816
Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

1431
01:33:54,935 --> 01:33:59,771
Okay, so Connors, Marko, Dillon and, um...

1432
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:03,510
I think that I can repair
the devices for Dillon and Marko,

1433
01:34:03,611 --> 01:34:04,806
but the others...

1434
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:08,676
Oh, I got Connors.
I've cured him once, so no big deal.

1435
01:34:10,351 --> 01:34:12,217
- What? It's no big deal.
- Great.

1436
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,212
Yeah, that's great.

1437
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:19,790
I think I can make an antiserum
for Dr. Osborn.

1438
01:34:20,961 --> 01:34:22,725
Been thinking about it a long time.

1439
01:34:25,866 --> 01:34:28,358
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1440
01:34:30,004 --> 01:34:30,835
Right.

1441
01:34:32,573 --> 01:34:33,802
That's what we do.

1442
01:34:38,713 --> 01:34:39,874
Psst.

1443
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:43,148
What?

1444
01:34:43,818 --> 01:34:45,183
Just three yous.

1445
01:35:01,369 --> 01:35:02,359
Um...

1446
01:35:03,404 --> 01:35:06,465
So... do you have a best friend too?

1447
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:09,707
I did.

1448
01:35:11,912 --> 01:35:12,879
You did?

1449
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:16,182
He died in my arms...

1450
01:35:18,152 --> 01:35:19,677
after he tried to kill me.

1451
01:35:21,722 --> 01:35:23,156
It was heartbreaking.

1452
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:26,484
Dude.

1453
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:35,903
- Hey.
- Will you run a diagnostic?

1454
01:35:36,003 --> 01:35:36,834
Yeah.

1455
01:35:46,447 --> 01:35:47,437
Hey, you okay?

1456
01:35:49,049 --> 01:35:51,245
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

1457
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,223
You don't deserve this.

1458
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:00,787
- I've ruined your life. I ruined it.
- No. No, no, no.

1459
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:03,427
Look at me. I'm here.

1460
01:36:05,065 --> 01:36:06,226
Not going anywhere.

1461
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:11,127
We'll get through this
and we'll get through it together.

1462
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:13,004
Okay?

1463
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:16,409
- Okay.
- Okay.

1464
01:36:21,482 --> 01:36:22,415
Thank you.

1465
01:36:33,928 --> 01:36:35,327
You have someone?

1466
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:36,994
No.

1467
01:36:37,965 --> 01:36:42,368
[sighs] I got no time
for Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1468
01:36:44,472 --> 01:36:46,372
- Do you?
- Uh...

1469
01:36:47,107 --> 01:36:49,098
That's a little complicated.

1470
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:51,305
I understand.

1471
01:36:51,412 --> 01:36:53,779
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1472
01:36:53,848 --> 01:36:56,510
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1473
01:36:56,617 --> 01:36:59,518
Took a while but we made it work.

1474
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,247
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1475
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:04,019
Me and... MJ.

1476
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:07,620
My MJ. Uh...

1477
01:37:08,529 --> 01:37:10,088
It gets confusing here.

1478
01:37:10,164 --> 01:37:12,292
Yeah.

1479
01:37:12,366 --> 01:37:14,357
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1480
01:37:14,468 --> 01:37:17,870
- Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
- "Peter" Peter.

1481
01:37:17,972 --> 01:37:19,804
- We're all called Peter.
- We're all Peter.

1482
01:37:19,874 --> 01:37:22,935
- Peter Parker?
- Same again. We're all Peter Parker.

1483
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:24,500
- The computer.
- Oh.

1484
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,439
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah. Me too.

1485
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:32,452
Okay, so now, all we gotta do is lure
these guys someplace, right?

1486
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,013
Try to cure them while they try to kill us,

1487
01:37:36,123 --> 01:37:37,648
and then send them home.

1488
01:37:37,725 --> 01:37:40,353
- Using a magic box.
- Well, that's the plan.

1489
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:42,953
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1490
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:44,623
or do you got your suit?

1491
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:47,498
Good.

1492
01:37:47,568 --> 01:37:50,037
- Here's your web cartridges.
- Ah, thanks, man.

1493
01:37:50,137 --> 01:37:51,332
What's that for'?

1494
01:37:51,405 --> 01:37:54,238
It's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1495
01:37:55,342 --> 01:37:56,741
Whoa!

1496
01:37:57,578 --> 01:37:59,410
- That came out of you.
- Yeah.

1497
01:37:59,513 --> 01:38:01,174
- You can't do that, huh?
- No.

1498
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:03,012
How on earth does that even...?

1499
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:05,849
We're getting sidetracked.
This is where we'll do this, okay?

1500
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:07,683
It's isolated, so no one should get hurt.

1501
01:38:08,355 --> 01:38:10,920
We draw them there with the box.
It's the one thing they all want.

1502
01:38:10,925 --> 01:38:13,053
All we have to do is figure out how to get there.

1503
01:38:13,127 --> 01:38:14,561
- We could portal there.
- What?

1504
01:38:14,628 --> 01:38:17,063
- I'm magic now.
- Yeah, he's right. He can.

1505
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:18,792
- Yeah, we saw.
- Yeah, he is.

1506
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:21,200
- Wait, really?
- I got Doctor Strange magic.

1507
01:38:21,268 --> 01:38:22,463
- No way.
- Yeah.

1508
01:38:23,237 --> 01:38:26,639
I promise you, I won't turn
into a supervillain and try to kill you.

1509
01:38:28,943 --> 01:38:30,035
Okay.

1510
01:38:30,978 --> 01:38:32,241
Thank you.

1511
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:40,945
Um... here goes nothing.
What's that thing you always say?

1512
01:38:41,655 --> 01:38:44,056
- Expect disappointment and...
- No, no, no.

1513
01:38:45,426 --> 01:38:47,087
We're gonna kick some ass.

1514
01:38:47,161 --> 01:38:48,151
Okay.

1515
01:38:48,896 --> 01:38:51,331
Cure. Cure some ass.

1516
01:38:51,432 --> 01:38:53,264
Cure that ass.

1517
01:38:55,736 --> 01:38:57,204
Ladies and gentlemen,

1518
01:38:57,271 --> 01:38:58,991
the Bugle tip line has just received a call

1519
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,271
from none other
than the fugitive known as Spider-Man,

1520
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:04,811
fresh from his rampage in Queens.

1521
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:09,709
So, Peter Parker, what pernicious
propaganda are you peddling?

1522
01:39:09,783 --> 01:39:12,718
- Just the truth. Truth is...
- Oh, sure.

1523
01:39:14,254 --> 01:39:16,450
That this is all my fault.

1524
01:39:16,557 --> 01:39:19,083
I accidentally brought
those dangerous people here.

1525
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:20,820
Well, he admits it.

1526
01:39:20,928 --> 01:39:22,453
And if those people are watching...

1527
01:39:24,498 --> 01:39:26,398
just know that! did try to help you.

1528
01:39:27,768 --> 01:39:29,293
I could have killed you...

1529
01:39:30,604 --> 01:39:32,732
at any given moment, but I didn't.

1530
01:39:34,908 --> 01:39:38,003
'Cause my Aunt May taught me
that everyone deserves a second chance.

1531
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,979
- That's why I'm here.
- Where is "here," exactly?

1532
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:44,975
A place that represents second chances.

1533
01:39:47,922 --> 01:39:50,653
The Statue of Liberty?
Good God, folks.

1534
01:39:50,758 --> 01:39:53,989
He's about to destroy another national landmark.

1535
01:39:54,094 --> 01:39:55,755
World, if you're watching...

1536
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:57,661
Believe me, the world is watching.

1537
01:39:58,465 --> 01:39:59,557
Wish me luck.

1538
01:40:01,535 --> 01:40:03,731
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
could use some.

1539
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:12,369
Okay, it could be any minute now.

1540
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:14,675
Yep, almost done.

1541
01:40:19,587 --> 01:40:24,184
You know, Max was, like, the sweetest guy ever

1542
01:40:24,825 --> 01:40:26,156
before he fell into...

1543
01:40:27,061 --> 01:40:29,689
-a pool of electric eels.
- That'll do it.

1544
01:40:31,866 --> 01:40:33,834
Mm. Oh, there it goes.

1545
01:40:35,936 --> 01:40:37,097
You Okay?

1546
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:39,036
Oh, it's my back.

1547
01:40:39,106 --> 01:40:42,406
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1548
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:44,672
- Yeah. No, I got a middle-back thing too.
- Really?

1549
01:40:44,745 --> 01:40:46,873
Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1550
01:40:48,182 --> 01:40:49,411
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1551
01:40:49,517 --> 01:40:50,916
- That'd be great.
- All right.

1552
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,578
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1553
01:40:56,957 --> 01:40:58,516
Yep. That's good.

1554
01:40:59,293 --> 01:41:01,159
- How is it?
- Wow.

1555
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:05,165
- That's good. That's better.
- Right? Yeah.

1556
01:41:05,232 --> 01:41:06,063
Wow.

1557
01:41:09,403 --> 01:41:12,236
This is so cool. I always wanted brothers.

1558
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:16,901
So you, like,
make your own web fluid in your body?

1559
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:18,706
I'd rather not talk about this.

1560
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:20,747
- I don't mean to...
- But are you teasing me?

1561
01:41:20,848 --> 01:41:24,682
No, no, no. He's not teasing you.
It's just that we can't do that,

1562
01:41:24,752 --> 01:41:28,245
so we're curious as to how
your web situation works, that's all.

1563
01:41:28,356 --> 01:41:31,053
If it's personal, I don't wanna pry,
but I think it's cool.

1564
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:34,220
I... I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1565
01:41:34,295 --> 01:41:36,593
Like I don't do breathing.

1566
01:41:36,697 --> 01:41:38,631
- Like, breathing just happens.
- Whoa.

1567
01:41:38,732 --> 01:41:43,067
Does it just come out of your wrists,
or does it come out of anywhere else?

1568
01:41:43,137 --> 01:41:45,367
Only... Only the wrists.

1569
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:47,635
Never had a web block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1570
01:41:47,741 --> 01:41:50,233
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's...

1571
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:53,280
- It's a hassle compared to what you got.
- Sounds like a hassle.

1572
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:56,816
But I did. You said that,
I was like, "Oh. I had a web block."

1573
01:41:56,917 --> 01:41:59,409
- Whoa. Why?
- Existential-crisis stuff.

1574
01:41:59,487 --> 01:42:02,422
- Pfft. Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
- Hey.

1575
01:42:02,957 --> 01:42:06,018
What are some of the craziest villains
that you guys have fought?

1576
01:42:06,126 --> 01:42:08,823
- Seems you've met some of them.
- That's a good question.

1577
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:14,266
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1578
01:42:14,335 --> 01:42:16,429
Oh, no way. I fought an alien too.

1579
01:42:16,504 --> 01:42:18,199
- On Earth and in space.
- Oh.

1580
01:42:18,306 --> 01:42:20,104
- He was purple.
- I wanna fight an alien.

1581
01:42:20,174 --> 01:42:23,940
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1582
01:42:24,845 --> 01:42:29,043
I'm lame compared...
I fought a Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine.

1583
01:42:29,149 --> 01:42:31,846
Can we rewind it back to the "I'm lame" part?

1584
01:42:31,952 --> 01:42:33,147
'Cause you are not.

1585
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:35,314
Thanks. I appreciate that.
I'm not saying I am...

1586
01:42:35,389 --> 01:42:37,357
But it's just the self-talk.
Maybe we should...

1587
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:40,189
- Listen, I...
- 'Cause you're amazing.

1588
01:42:40,294 --> 01:42:42,194
Just to take it in for a minute.

1589
01:42:42,296 --> 01:42:44,788
- Yeah, I can take it in.
- You are amazing.

1590
01:42:44,866 --> 01:42:47,460
- I can. Thank you.
- You are amazing. Will you say it?

1591
01:42:47,534 --> 01:42:49,059
I needed to hear that. Thank you.

1592
01:42:50,404 --> 01:42:52,634
All right, guys, focus up. You feel that?

1593
01:42:52,706 --> 01:42:53,537
Yeah.

1594
01:43:01,148 --> 01:43:02,206
What's up, Peter?

1595
01:43:05,319 --> 01:43:06,809
How you like the new-new?

1596
01:43:07,988 --> 01:43:12,983
Look, you give it to me, I'm gonna destroy it.

1597
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,494
But I'll let you live.

1598
01:43:15,162 --> 01:43:16,687
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1599
01:43:19,566 --> 01:43:21,193
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1600
01:43:27,908 --> 01:43:31,538
Hey, Max!
I missed you, man. Ho!

1601
01:43:33,514 --> 01:43:35,039
All right, MJ, heads up!

1602
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:37,244
Got it! Close it.

1603
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:43,380
- Ned, it's not closing.
- Yeah, I know.

1604
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:45,049
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know.

1605
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:48,185
- Did you close it before? No?
- I mean, I've opened some.

1606
01:43:57,104 --> 01:43:59,539
Max, Max, Max. Can we talk for a second?

1607
01:43:59,607 --> 01:44:01,701
- Just you and me,just talk?
- Look who showed up.

1608
01:44:02,409 --> 01:44:03,706
My old friend Spider-Man.

1609
01:44:03,778 --> 01:44:05,746
I'm trying to save you.
That's all I've wanted.

1610
01:44:05,846 --> 01:44:07,405
- You're not trying to save me.
- I am.

1611
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:09,279
You ain't even the shit no more.

1612
01:44:09,383 --> 01:44:12,717
- Oh.
- Don't worry about me. I'll save myself.

1613
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:16,117
- Burn up!
- Oh!

1614
01:44:16,224 --> 01:44:17,817
Well, I got his attention. Now what?

1615
01:44:17,925 --> 01:44:19,415
Okay, great.

1616
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:23,152
Uh, just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1617
01:44:24,898 --> 01:44:26,297
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1618
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:30,095
[{Spider-Man 3] I need Max? cure!
Yeah. I'm on it.

1619
01:44:31,072 --> 01:44:33,063
Peter, I need the Lizard cure.

1620
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,437
[grunts] Okay, okay.

1621
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,475
Where's the box, Peter?

1622
01:44:41,582 --> 01:44:44,347
- Flint, we could help everyone.
- I don't care!

1623
01:44:55,763 --> 01:44:56,628
Sorry!

1624
01:44:57,464 --> 01:44:58,659
Ugh. Gross!

1625
01:44:59,367 --> 01:45:02,029
Sad to tell you, Sandman, nobody's going home.

1626
01:45:39,807 --> 01:45:42,799
Oh! What the Hell is going on out there?

1627
01:45:42,877 --> 01:45:44,641
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1628
01:45:44,711 --> 01:45:47,840
- But I thought you were Peter 2.
- What? I'm not Peter 2.

1629
01:45:47,948 --> 01:45:50,178
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1630
01:45:50,284 --> 01:45:53,185
- We're clearly not very good at this.
- I know, I know. We suck.

1631
01:45:53,287 --> 01:45:56,120
- I don't know how to work as a team.
- Me neither.

1632
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:58,158
I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1633
01:45:58,225 --> 01:46:00,853
I don't wanna brag, but I will.
I was in the Avengers.

1634
01:46:00,961 --> 01:46:02,292
- The Avengers?
- Yeah.

1635
01:46:02,363 --> 01:46:03,558
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1636
01:46:03,664 --> 01:46:04,529
What is that?

1637
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:06,894
You don't have the Avengers?

1638
01:46:07,001 --> 01:46:08,491
Is that a band? Are you in a band?

1639
01:46:08,569 --> 01:46:11,937
No, I'm not in a band.
The Avengers is Earth's mightiest...

1640
01:46:12,039 --> 01:46:13,768
- How's this helping?
- It's not important.

1641
01:46:13,874 --> 01:46:15,706
All we gotta do is focus, trust your tingle,

1642
01:46:15,776 --> 01:46:17,210
and coordinate our attacks.

1643
01:46:17,277 --> 01:46:20,008
Yes. Okay. Let's pick one target.

1644
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:22,448
- Right.
- We take them off the board one at a time.

1645
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:25,110
- You got it. Okay, Peter 1, Peter 2.
- Peter 2.

1646
01:46:25,219 --> 01:46:26,516
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3.

1647
01:46:26,587 --> 01:46:28,521
- Let's do this. Ready?
- Wait, wait!

1648
01:46:29,457 --> 01:46:30,686
I love you guys.

1649
01:46:33,361 --> 01:46:34,453
Thank you.

1650
01:46:36,096 --> 01:46:37,621
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1651
01:47:07,594 --> 01:47:11,087
Okay, Spider-Mans.
Sandman's first.

1652
01:47:12,266 --> 01:47:15,099
- I'm gonna lead him inside the statue.
- I'll meet you at the top.

1653
01:47:18,072 --> 01:47:19,904
- Come on!
- Hey!

1654
01:47:22,877 --> 01:47:25,744
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1655
01:47:27,048 --> 01:47:28,243
Peter 1!

1656
01:47:28,315 --> 01:47:29,214
I got it!

1657
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:43,397
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1658
01:47:45,466 --> 01:47:47,127
Guys, I'm at the top!

1659
01:47:47,235 --> 01:47:50,796
I need the cure!

1660
01:47:50,905 --> 01:47:52,430
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1661
01:47:53,407 --> 01:47:58,243
Just wait your turn, doc!

1662
01:47:58,312 --> 01:47:59,438
I'll be right back.

1663
01:48:36,684 --> 01:48:37,879
It's okay, Flint.

1664
01:48:40,154 --> 01:48:41,747
We're gonna get you home.

1665
01:48:42,556 --> 01:48:44,490
You just stay right here.

1666
01:48:49,096 --> 01:48:51,724
How do we stop him?
I've never seen him this powerful.

1667
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:54,096
It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

1668
01:48:54,201 --> 01:48:56,101
You're not gonna take this from me.

1669
01:48:58,706 --> 01:48:59,673
That's not gonna work.

1670
01:49:04,912 --> 01:49:06,539
We gotta do this up close.

1671
01:49:06,614 --> 01:49:09,447
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left. On me.

1672
01:49:14,521 --> 01:49:15,352
Yeah!

1673
01:49:36,077 --> 01:49:36,942
Um...

1674
01:49:37,044 --> 01:49:40,173
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1675
01:49:40,247 --> 01:49:43,080
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1676
01:49:43,183 --> 01:49:46,278
- All right, we got this. Shh.
- Focus and close the portal.

1677
01:49:49,623 --> 01:49:51,387
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1678
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:54,019
And that is a lizard and we should go!

1679
01:49:58,566 --> 01:49:59,431
Run!

1680
01:50:00,434 --> 01:50:02,903
Come on! Come on, this way!
Quick, quick, quick!

1681
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:04,369
Connors, stop!

1682
01:50:11,745 --> 01:50:14,737
Yeah.

1683
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:17,276
[groans]

1684
01:50:27,194 --> 01:50:29,754
Leave them. They're mine.

1685
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:32,424
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1686
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,662
Dr. Octavius, no.

1687
01:50:37,271 --> 01:50:38,636
What are you doing?

1688
01:50:40,307 --> 01:50:41,502
Get it off of me.

1689
01:50:52,486 --> 01:50:53,612
There you go.

1690
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,705
MJ!

1691
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,512
Whoa.

1692
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,849
- We gotta hide this thing.
- Oh, right.

1693
01:51:32,126 --> 01:51:33,719
- Nice, Ned!
- Yeah!

1694
01:51:34,995 --> 01:51:35,826
Oh.

1695
01:51:37,398 --> 01:51:38,331
Where is he?

1696
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:39,958
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1697
01:51:40,033 --> 01:51:44,061
Before you do anything, Mister...
Doctor Strange, Peters plan is working.

1698
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:45,900
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1699
01:51:54,982 --> 01:51:56,074
Dr. Connors?

1700
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,578
Welcome back, Sir.

1701
01:52:02,689 --> 01:52:03,918
Well, I'll be damned.

1702
01:52:06,894 --> 01:52:08,521
Did you just open a portal?

1703
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:10,691
Yes, Sir, I did.

1704
01:52:11,499 --> 01:52:12,728
Hmm.

1705
01:52:18,439 --> 01:52:21,534
Max? Max?

1706
01:52:22,276 --> 01:52:25,405
- Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
- Are you sure about that?

1707
01:52:27,381 --> 01:52:28,644
Back to being a nobody.

1708
01:52:28,749 --> 01:52:32,049
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was.

1709
01:52:32,653 --> 01:52:34,747
You didn't see me.

1710
01:52:35,289 --> 01:52:37,951
- Can I tell you something, though?
- Yeah.

1711
01:52:38,992 --> 01:52:40,756
You got a nice face. You're just a kid.

1712
01:52:41,762 --> 01:52:43,423
- Eh.
- You're from Queens.

1713
01:52:44,565 --> 01:52:47,796
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1714
01:52:47,902 --> 01:52:49,734
I just thought you was gonna be Black.

1715
01:52:50,938 --> 01:52:53,305
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

1716
01:52:53,407 --> 01:52:55,808
There's gotta be a Black Spider-Man
somewhere out there.

1717
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,475
Goddamn eels.

1718
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:05,650
The power of the sun.

1719
01:53:08,823 --> 01:53:11,690
- In the palm of your hand.
- Peter?

1720
01:53:14,295 --> 01:53:15,126
Otto.

1721
01:53:17,097 --> 01:53:18,861
Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy.

1722
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,099
It's good to see you.

1723
01:53:21,869 --> 01:53:23,098
You're all grown up.

1724
01:53:24,838 --> 01:53:25,862
How are you?

1725
01:53:28,175 --> 01:53:29,233
Trying to do better.

1726
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:38,516
- Strange, wait, we're so close.
- Skip it!

1727
01:53:38,619 --> 01:53:41,418
I've been dangling
over the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1728
01:53:41,488 --> 01:53:44,583
I know, I know, I know. I, uh... Um...

1729
01:53:45,426 --> 01:53:47,258
I'm sorry about that, Sir. I mean...

1730
01:53:47,327 --> 01:53:50,319
- You went to the Grand Canyon?
- He could have used your help.

1731
01:53:50,431 --> 01:53:52,593
It's okay.
These are my new friends.

1732
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:55,135
This is Peter Parker, Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1733
01:53:55,202 --> 01:53:56,802
- They're mes from other universes.
- Oh.

1734
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:59,635
They're here to help.
This is the wizard I told you about.

1735
01:53:59,706 --> 01:54:03,040
I am really impressed that you've managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

1736
01:54:04,278 --> 01:54:06,372
But this has to end. Now.

1737
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,848
Can the Spider-Man come out to play?

1738
01:54:31,772 --> 01:54:33,001
Strange, no!

1739
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:50,914
[inaudible dialogue]

1740
01:54:59,433 --> 01:55:01,424
[gasping]

1741
01:55:02,269 --> 01:55:03,464
Are you okay?

1742
01:55:04,572 --> 01:55:05,437
Yeah.

1743
01:55:05,539 --> 01:55:06,700
I'm okay.

1744
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:10,802
Are you okay?

1745
01:55:26,827 --> 01:55:29,091
Whoa.

1746
01:56:28,355 --> 01:56:29,845
Thank you, Mr. Cape, Sir.

1747
01:56:33,193 --> 01:56:34,024
Ned?

1748
01:56:35,463 --> 01:56:36,487
- Ned!
- Hey!

1749
01:56:41,135 --> 01:56:42,034
MJ!

1750
01:56:42,136 --> 01:56:43,297
Peter?

1751
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:45,202
- Ned!
- Peter!

1752
01:56:46,073 --> 01:56:47,234
Hey!

1753
01:56:47,341 --> 01:56:49,366
- Are you okay?
- We're okay!

1754
01:57:03,524 --> 01:57:09,019
Poor Peter.
Too weak to send me home to die.

1755
01:57:09,763 --> 01:57:10,594
No.

1756
01:57:11,498 --> 01:57:13,193
I just wanna kill you myself.

1757
01:57:14,034 --> 01:57:14,865
Attaboy.

1758
01:59:05,212 --> 01:59:06,839
She was there...

1759
01:59:07,548 --> 01:59:09,539
because of you.

1760
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:11,880
I may have struck the blow,

1761
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:14,219
but you...

1762
01:59:17,658 --> 01:59:20,855
You are the one that killed her.

1763
01:59:47,821 --> 01:59:48,652
Peter.

1764
02:00:02,302 --> 02:00:03,497
What have I done?

1765
02:00:07,575 --> 02:00:09,407
- It's you.
- You okay?

1766
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:12,639
Uh... Yeah, I'm good.
I've been stabbed before.

1767
02:00:12,713 --> 02:00:14,340
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Hey.

1768
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:16,816
- Oh, man.
- Hey, nice catch.

1769
02:00:17,918 --> 02:00:18,817
Nice throw.

1770
02:00:21,422 --> 02:00:25,222
- What? Is that happening, or am I dying?
- Yeah, no, that's happening.

1771
02:00:25,326 --> 02:00:27,658
- That's real.
- Are there people in the sky?

1772
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:38,600
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. I got it. You okay?

1773
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,407
What's happening?

1774
02:00:44,478 --> 02:00:46,708
They're starting to come through.
I can't stop them.

1775
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:49,806
There's gotta be something we could do.
Can't you just cast the spell again?

1776
02:00:49,917 --> 02:00:51,646
The original way, before I screwed it up.

1777
02:00:51,752 --> 02:00:53,652
We're too late for that.
They're here.

1778
02:00:54,588 --> 02:00:56,613
They're here because of you.

1779
02:01:02,095 --> 02:01:03,585
What if everyone forgot who I was?

1780
02:01:03,664 --> 02:01:04,563
What?

1781
02:01:05,066 --> 02:01:07,967
They're coming here because of me, right?
Because I'm Peter Parker?

1782
02:01:08,569 --> 02:01:09,730
So cast a new spell.

1783
02:01:09,803 --> 02:01:12,238
But this time, make everyone forget
who Peter Parker is.

1784
02:01:12,306 --> 02:01:13,671
Make everyone forget...

1785
02:01:15,643 --> 02:01:17,077
-me.
- No.

1786
02:01:17,144 --> 02:01:19,943
- But it would work, right?
- Yeah, it would work.

1787
02:01:21,348 --> 02:01:23,942
But you gotta understand
that would mean that everyone

1788
02:01:24,018 --> 02:01:26,578
who knows and loves you, we...

1789
02:01:28,756 --> 02:01:30,622
We'd have no memory of you.

1790
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:34,258
It would be as though you never existed.

1791
02:01:37,631 --> 02:01:38,462
I know.

1792
02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:41,798
Do it.

1793
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:48,101
You better go and say your goodbyes.
You don't have long.

1794
02:01:48,742 --> 02:01:50,767
- Thank you, Sir.
- Call me Stephen.

1795
02:01:54,448 --> 02:01:55,313
Thank you, Stephen.

1796
02:01:57,351 --> 02:02:00,150
Yeah. Still feels weird.

1797
02:02:02,823 --> 02:02:04,120
I'll see you around.

1798
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:06,984
So long, kid.

1799
02:02:15,002 --> 02:02:16,333
Hey. Uh...

1800
02:02:16,971 --> 02:02:19,497
I think this is it.
I think you're about to go home.

1801
02:02:19,607 --> 02:02:21,097
- Okay.
- All right.

1802
02:02:21,175 --> 02:02:23,041
Look, I, uh...

1803
02:02:24,611 --> 02:02:25,601
Thank you.

1804
02:02:26,514 --> 02:02:29,643
I just wanna... I want you to...
I wanna tell you that...

1805
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:32,319
I don't know how to say this. I...

1806
02:02:32,386 --> 02:02:34,047
- Peter.
- I want you to know that I...

1807
02:02:35,789 --> 02:02:38,281
You know. It's what we do.

1808
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:42,289
Yeah, it's what we do. Um...

1809
02:02:43,063 --> 02:02:45,532
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ. I...

1810
02:02:45,633 --> 02:02:49,035
Uh...
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1811
02:02:53,407 --> 02:02:55,899
- I guess I'll see you.
- See you.

1812
02:02:56,010 --> 02:02:56,875
Bye.

1813
02:02:59,514 --> 02:03:01,380
- Oh.
- You're in so much pain, huh?

1814
02:03:01,448 --> 02:03:02,574
- I am.
- Yeah.

1815
02:03:06,687 --> 02:03:08,712
Oh, you're okay.

1816
02:03:09,690 --> 02:03:10,782
So proud of you.

1817
02:03:11,893 --> 02:03:14,225
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

1818
02:03:14,295 --> 02:03:16,730
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1819
02:03:16,797 --> 02:03:18,231
- You sure?
- I'm fine, I promise.

1820
02:03:18,899 --> 02:03:20,128
- Okay, okay.
- 'I promise.

1821
02:03:20,234 --> 02:03:21,065
Good.

1822
02:03:22,636 --> 02:03:24,934
Um, we should go, right?

1823
02:03:27,474 --> 02:03:30,273
Yeah. You're gonna forget who I am.

1824
02:03:32,279 --> 02:03:34,577
- What?
- Forget? What are you talking about?

1825
02:03:35,983 --> 02:03:40,716
It's okay. I'm gonna come and find you,
and I'll explain everything.

1826
02:03:42,623 --> 02:03:44,148
I'll make you remember me.

1827
02:03:44,992 --> 02:03:48,087
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

1828
02:03:48,162 --> 02:03:51,530
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

1829
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,966
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

1830
02:03:54,735 --> 02:03:57,602
- I don't wanna do that.
- I know. MJ, I know.

1831
02:03:57,705 --> 02:04:01,141
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

1832
02:04:01,242 --> 02:04:02,732
There's always something we can do.

1833
02:04:04,879 --> 02:04:06,074
There's nothing we can do.

1834
02:04:10,718 --> 02:04:11,776
But it'll be okay.

1835
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:17,121
You promise?

1836
02:04:20,294 --> 02:04:21,591
Yeah, I promise.

1837
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:34,497
I'll come find you, okay?

1838
02:04:35,142 --> 02:04:36,405
I know you will.

1839
02:04:37,912 --> 02:04:38,970
- Okay.
- 'Okay.

1840
02:04:41,415 --> 02:04:42,678
You better.

1841
02:04:44,651 --> 02:04:48,451
If you don't, I'll just figure it out.
I've done it before, I can do it again.

1842
02:04:50,157 --> 02:04:51,647
I promise, I'll fix this.

1843
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:54,290
I really hate magic.

1844
02:04:55,996 --> 02:04:57,122
Yeah. Me too.

1845
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:02,961
I love you.

1846
02:05:09,377 --> 02:05:10,811
- I love...
- Just wait.

1847
02:05:12,012 --> 02:05:14,344
Wait and tell me when you see me again.

1848
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:17,181
Sure.

1849
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:45,803
<i>[mouths]</i> I <i>Jove you.</i>

1850
02:07:24,979 --> 02:07:28,005
It's been a few weeks
since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,

1851
02:07:28,115 --> 02:07:31,050
and Spider-Man's cultists continue to contend

1852
02:07:31,152 --> 02:07:33,621
that the vile vigilante is a hero.

1853
02:07:34,488 --> 02:07:38,652
If he were a hero, he'd unmask himself
and tell us who he really is

1854
02:07:38,726 --> 02:07:42,219
because only a coward conceals his identity.

1855
02:07:42,329 --> 02:07:45,492
Only a coward hides his true intentions.

1856
02:07:45,566 --> 02:07:47,660
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,

1857
02:07:47,735 --> 02:07:52,036
this reporter will uncover
those intentions, come Hell or high water.

1858
02:07:52,139 --> 02:07:56,804
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I... Uh...

1859
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:01,039
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,
and you don't know me, but you...

1860
02:08:04,852 --> 02:08:05,944
Okay, come on.

1861
02:08:08,322 --> 02:08:10,814
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

1862
02:08:18,799 --> 02:08:20,130
Hey.

1863
02:08:26,173 --> 02:08:28,642
One sec. Can I help you?

1864
02:08:28,709 --> 02:08:30,336
Hi. Um...

1865
02:08:30,411 --> 02:08:33,073
My name is Peter Parker, and I...

1866
02:08:36,817 --> 02:08:39,479
would like a coffee, please.

1867
02:08:40,254 --> 02:08:42,484
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

1868
02:08:49,063 --> 02:08:51,430
Doughnut for my fellow Engineer.

1869
02:08:52,166 --> 02:08:55,363
- Whoa. Wait, what?
- MIT, they're the Engineers. The mascot.

1870
02:08:55,436 --> 02:08:57,928
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

1871
02:08:58,038 --> 02:09:02,032
- Look at you with the school spirit.
- Tell anybody, I will deny it.

1872
02:09:02,109 --> 02:09:03,304
Oh, okay.

1873
02:09:13,487 --> 02:09:15,717
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

1874
02:09:16,457 --> 02:09:17,618
Your coffee.

1875
02:09:17,725 --> 02:09:19,250
- Right. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

1876
02:09:19,326 --> 02:09:20,225
Um...

1877
02:09:22,096 --> 02:09:23,564
Are you excited for MIT?

1878
02:09:25,066 --> 02:09:27,660
Oh, right. Yeah. Uh...

1879
02:09:28,669 --> 02:09:30,728
Yeah, I am excited, which is weird

1880
02:09:30,804 --> 02:09:33,136
'cause I don't really get excited about things.

1881
02:09:33,241 --> 02:09:34,902
I kind of expect disappointment.

1882
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,274
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

1883
02:09:38,178 --> 02:09:39,009
Right?

1884
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:41,147
Uh...

1885
02:09:42,016 --> 02:09:43,780
Yeah. Right.

1886
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:49,022
I don't know, it kind of feels different
this time for some reason.

1887
02:09:59,967 --> 02:10:01,332
