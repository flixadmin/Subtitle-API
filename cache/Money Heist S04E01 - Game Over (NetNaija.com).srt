1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,416
<i>Palermo...</i>

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,791
<i>this is war.</i>

3
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,625
<i>Act accordingly.</i>

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,583
Doors!

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,958
Fire!

6
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,458
<i>Everything can go to shit</i>
<i>in a split second.</i>

7
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,583
<i>The moment you feel</i>
<i>death creeping in,</i>

8
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,250
<i>you know nothing will ever be the same...</i>

9
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,583
<i>and that you need to try your best</i>
<i>to survive.</i>

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,708
<i>Nairobi, hang in there!</i>

11
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,583
Hang in there. Hang in there, Nairobi.

12
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,208
Come on.

13
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,791
Let's go!

14
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,625
<i>We all have snipers aiming at our hearts.</i>

15
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,166
<i>But the true terror arrives</i>

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,166
<i>when that bullet doesn't hit you...</i>
<i>but takes out someone you love.</i>

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,083
Hurry up!

18
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,250
Saline, Rio.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Almost done.

20
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,666
<i>The Professor was feeling</i>
<i>that terror the most.</i>

21
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>Two words that should never go together</i>
<i>collided in his heart: "love" and "death."</i>

22
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,250
<i>That made him freeze up.</i>

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,958
<i>As he ran through the woods...</i>

24
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,125
<i>he couldn't stop thinking,</i>

25
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,375
<i>"They've killed the woman I love."</i>

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,666
<i>But Lisbon was there.</i>

27
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,291
<i>She wasn't gone.</i>

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,625
<i>The shots of her fake execution</i>
<i>had sounded real enough to the Professor.</i>

29
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,666
<i>Our mastermind was losing his head</i>
<i>like never before.</i>

30
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,583
<i>And along with him,</i>

31
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,291
<i>we were losing ours.</i>

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,375
Pulse: 155 and rising.

33
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,750
Blood pressure: 85/40. It's dropping.

34
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,291
-We need two units of blood and saline.
-Nairobi.

35
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,958
Stay strong. I'm here.

36
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,958
<i>In the tent,</i> <i>Tamayo felt what I felt.</i>

37
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,250
<i>We were staring death in the face.</i>

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,916
<i>A dry mouth.</i> <i>The taste of metal.</i>

39
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,291
<i>Tightness in the chest</i>
<i>and pain in the temples.</i>

40
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:59,208
<i>But until it was game over,</i>
<i>we still had everything to play for.</i>

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Blood at 30ºC, ready for transfusion.

42
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,791
It's here.

43
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,208
The bullet. Behind the seventh rib.

44
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,458
It's in the lower part of the lung.

45
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,958
That's good news, honey.

46
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,458
{\an8}She can't breathe. It's a collapsed lung.

47
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,208
{\an8}-We have to release air.
-Tokyo, surgical kit six.

48
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,750
{\an8}OK, surgical kit six.

49
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,291
{\an8}There's air between the lung
and chest wall.

50
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,458
{\an8}Hurry, Helsinki.

51
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,125
{\an8}-She can't breathe!
-Hurry up!

52
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,416
{\an8}There we go.

53
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,166
{\an8}Get me out of here.

54
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,458
{\an8}I'd rather be in prison alive.
I don't want to die.

55
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,583
{\an8}Tokyo...

56
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,916
{\an8}hand me over to the police, please.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,291
{\an8}Please.

58
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,833
{\an8}Hand me over.

59
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,500
{\an8}STAGE 3

60
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,458
{\an8}RESISTANCE

61
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,333
{\an8}Once they hand over Rio,
we'll begin stage three of the plan:

62
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,250
{\an8}resistance.

63
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,291
{\an8}You can't get out
of the Bank of Spain alive.

64
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,208
{\an8}It's impossible.

65
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,000
{\an8}But I will get you out of there.

66
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,916
{\an8}Once we begin stage three,

67
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,875
{\an8}there'll only be one countdown:
the gold.

68
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,458
{\an8}And our only goal will be to melt it.

69
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,916
{\an8}Because the gold is the key.

70
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,916
{\an8}Without it,
I won't be able to get you out.

71
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,500
{\an8}The police...

72
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,375
{\an8}will react harshly, but it doesn't matter.

73
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,833
Whatever happens,

74
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,125
whatever they do...

75
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,916
we need to be able to keep control.

76
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,333
Otherwise, our lives will be in danger.

77
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,208
Did we kill any officers?

78
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,125
I don't know, but they were on fire.

79
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,833
They'll come back all guns blazing.
We can't defend ourselves.

80
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,083
And Nairobi needs a surgeon.

81
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,083
We used an antitank gun.
They won't send one.

82
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,375
She's got a bullet in her lung.

83
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,750
<i>We can't do it ourselves.</i>
<i>You've got to try.</i>

84
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,833
<i>We need the Pakistani surgeon.</i>

85
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,166
-How much time do I have?
-She's dying.

86
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,583
He has crampons, dog deterrent,
and camouflage clothes.

87
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,625
He may be hiding among the branches.
Shoot up into the treetops.

88
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,416
Raquel, don't let them get you alone.
Tell them I'll surrender.

89
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,500
<i>Raquel!</i>

90
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,750
<i>Get out of there!</i>

91
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,625
<i>Get out of there!</i>

92
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
Get out of there!

93
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,416
I'm going to try.

94
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,958
Easy.

95
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,625
Easy.

96
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,083
Good little bull.

97
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,500
Easy.

98
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,708
Easy.

99
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,916
Eas...

100
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,208
{\an8}<i>The Professor is attacking the police,</i>
<i>but nobody is leaving the Bank of Spain.</i>

101
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,958
<i>Demonstrators are in a state of shock.</i>

102
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,166
<i>Will this affect public support</i>
<i>for the Dalís?</i>

103
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,375
{\an8}<i>For the moment, nobody can say.</i>

104
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,458
{\an8}<i>But we may be witnessing</i>
<i>the Professor's first big problem.</i>

105
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,791
That was unreal,
the best we could hope for.

106
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,750
Those men have
second- and third-degree burns.

107
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,833
As expected.

108
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,208
-We need another armored van.
-Don't you care about anything?

109
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,250
I won't send more men
to be permanently disfigured!

110
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,041
They fired rockets at us,
and everyone in Spain saw it.

111
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,541
I'm not starting a war
in the center of Madrid.

112
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,833
It's already started.

113
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,583
Tamayo.

114
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,625
Don't make
the biggest mistake of your life.

115
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,250
My mistake was sending you
to torture that kid.

116
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,791
If we'd taken him to court,
we wouldn't be here.

117
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,750
We gave them strength and ammunition.
I won't do it again.

118
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,916
You're scared.

119
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
You're like Prieto.

120
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,750
You've got pills on your nightstand
and erectile dysfunction.

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,125
And you think the law will save you.

122
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,791
The law can't help us now.

123
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,166
I am the law.

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,958
And erectile dysfunction, my ass!

125
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,875
Maintain composure.

126
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,333
Let's de-escalate the situation, OK?
Dialogue and truce. Truce and dialogue.

127
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,291
Is that clear?

128
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,041
Crystal clear, boss.

129
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,958
Antoñanzas.

130
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,625
Yes, Inspector?

131
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,500
You heard that, right?
He is the law, like John Wayne.

132
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,416
I want an ambulance and a surgeon.

133
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,291
Now!

134
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,458
Let's get them
to hand over their wounded.

135
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,791
The governor studied medicine in the army.
He's going to help us.

136
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,541
I didn't complete the course
or practice, obviously, but...

137
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,458
I still know a few things.

138
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,916
-Put on some scrubs.
-I'll go get them.

139
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,791
Where's the damn surgeon?

140
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,833
I'm trying to reach him,
but they have to give me access.

141
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,250
Bogotá, anesthetic.

142
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:59,791
-Nairobi, we're going to put you under.
-You're not putting me under. Tokyo.

143
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,166
Tokyo...

144
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,458
tell him it's my life...

145
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,333
and I decide.

146
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,583
That's exactly why
we're going to operate on you here.

147
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,916
Tokyo, please.

148
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Please.

149
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,375
She decides.

150
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,375
Period.

151
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,000
Helsinki, put her under.
That's a fucking order.

152
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,541
You don't give me orders.
You're not my boss, asshole.

153
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,583
You let the phone in.

154
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,166
You're supposed to protect us.

155
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,916
She can make mistakes, but you can't!

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,666
Shut up, big man,
or I'll fucking kill you!

157
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
Shut the fuck up.

158
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,416
You're my little whore, not my mom.

159
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
It's her fault she's in this state.
She's an idiot.

160
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,791
If she says she's leaving,
I'll walk her to the door.

161
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,208
And you'll keep your mouth shut,
you piece of shit,

162
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,166
because from now on,
you're no longer my boss.

163
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,750
Put the gun down.

164
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,666
Denver.

165
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,750
If she talks, they'll kill us all.
We're treating her in here.

166
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,291
How are <i>you</i> going to treat her, dumbass?

167
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,125
Nairobi needs a surgeon.

168
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,083
Have you all gone nuts or what?

169
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,625
I swear on my son's life...
I won't tell them anything.

170
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,083
You think you won't,
but when they torture you, things change.

171
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,916
I don't give a shit!

172
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,000
She's leaving.

173
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,666
I don't think so.

174
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,333
Do you think
this is a good time for a rebellion?

175
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,375
One of the gang is dying.
Stop fucking around!

176
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,208
-Another one of the gang.
-What do you mean, another one?

177
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,291
They killed Lisbon half an hour ago.

178
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,833
I could show you my democratic side.

179
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,125
We could vote and send her out,
but I'd be killing her.

180
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,708
Lisbon was killed
on her knees and unarmed.

181
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,333
They brought Nairobi's son

182
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,416
with a teddy bear
to shoot her in the head.

183
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,291
Do you think the Red Cross is outside?
You've got to be fucking kidding!

184
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,333
Palermo is right.

185
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,291
You'll have to open me up...

186
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,083
and remove the bullet.

187
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,791
Maybe...

188
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,708
remove part of my lung.

189
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,833
All that,
without me bleeding to death.

190
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,541
You're going to kill me.

191
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,458
You're going to kill me.

192
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,250
Helsinki.

193
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,583
It's too complicated.

194
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,791
It's too complicated for you guys.

195
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,708
Take me to the door.

196
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,500
-Take me to the door.
-Relax.

197
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,125
-Take me to the door.
-Calm down.

198
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,625
-Calm down.
-Take me to the door.

199
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,666
-I'm going.
-What are you doing?

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,833
I'm going.

201
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,375
No!

202
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,916
No!

203
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,625
No...

204
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,541
No!

205
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,916
No...

206
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,291
Sorry, Professor. We had an argument.

207
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,458
I was going to sleep in Tokyo's room.

208
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,625
Are you sure you don't mind me sleeping
here with you?

209
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,333
It's all right.

210
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,166
But having someone in my bed
turns me on.

211
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,291
Do you mind?

212
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,083
Mind what?

213
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,541
Releasing some stress.

214
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,041
Rubbing our lamps.

215
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,000
I knew you were joking.

216
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,708
Can someone please tell me
why Palermo is in charge of the heist?

217
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,500
Because it was his idea.

218
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,291
-He's the mastermind.
-Mastermind?

219
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:49,500
The guy who was grabbing his junk
in the hallway like an ape?

220
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,125
Come on! Are you serious?

221
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,625
You know who should be in charge?

222
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,583
You. Yes, you.

223
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,833
I agree. If anyone has a lot invested
in this going well, it's you.

224
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:10,083
Don't egg me on.

225
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,958
I'm going to sleep.

226
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,458
Good night.

227
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:26,041
I'm going to talk with the Professor.
You'll see.

228
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:35,458
Professor, I want to be in charge...
of the heist. I'm better than Palermo.

229
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,458
Can we talk about it tomorrow--

230
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,416
No, not tomorrow, now.

231
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,166
-Why's he in charge?
-Let's see.

232
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,416
He... is in charge because this heist
has been in development for a long time.

233
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,791
He's been involved since the start.
The plan's in his head.

234
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,708
And?

235
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,791
I can learn it. I'm a quick learner.
"Platero's a small, soft, hairy donkey,

236
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,541
so soft you could say he's all cotton,
no bones."

237
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,458
<i>-Platero and I. </i>By Juan Ramón Jiménez.
-We know.

238
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,750
I don't know if you realize,
but you're spoiling an intimate moment.

239
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,416
What is it?

240
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Are you horny?

241
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,625
I was. Yes, I was.

242
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,083
Oh, were you?

243
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,416
I can't really imagine you two at it.

244
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
You'd be quite surprised.

245
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,250
Please...

246
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,625
Wow, really?

247
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,708
Want me to stay?

248
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,750
No.

249
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,750
What about you?

250
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,750
Why are we talking about this?

251
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,041
Because I'm proposing a threesome.

252
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,916
Palermo, you, and me.

253
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,166
He can do the numbers and calculations,
you can do the strategy.

254
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,041
But I'm the best captain
you could have in there.

255
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,791
Because when the going gets tough,
I react.

256
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,833
That's not something you can study.
You're born with it.

257
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,833
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm taking command.

258
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,083
Let's operate.

259
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:26,250
She's taking charge, the mastermind,
the intelligent, level-headed one.

260
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,625
The crazy bitch who brought us here
and cost some of us our lives. Great.

261
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,125
I'll leave you all playing doctors.

262
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,791
I'm going to think about my next move.
Careful.

263
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,958
<i>It was our darkest half hour.</i>

264
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,333
<i>In 30 minutes,</i>

265
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,458
<i>the police had come back</i>
<i>with guns blazing,</i>

266
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,666
<i>and they had us on the ropes.</i>

267
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:04,666
<i>The Professor, under the trough,</i>
<i>was only thinking of those 30 minutes.</i>

268
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,583
<i>If he could've called</i>
<i>half an hour earlier,</i>

269
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,791
<i>Lisbon would be alive.</i>

270
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,916
-Launch stage two of Hamelin.
-<i>All right.</i>

271
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
PRIVATE NUMBER

272
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,250
Alicia, empathy, dialogue, and truce.

273
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,208
Professor.

274
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,333
Five minutes as a widower,
and you're calling other women.

275
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,083
Naughty boy. You're a ladies' man.

276
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:13,416
-Did you order her execution?
-I didn't have time. She did it herself.

277
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,875
<i>Murillo violently resisted arrest,</i>

278
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,083
opening fire on her former colleagues,
like a traitor.

279
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:21,416
Colonel.

280
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,250
The cell tower isn't in Madrid.

281
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,625
It's a national highway.

282
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,208
In Huelva.

283
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,583
<i>He's gotten through the cordon.</i>

284
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,291
That bastard's on the move.
42 kilometers from your position.

285
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,333
You sure? It may be another trap.

286
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,375
I'm sure.
The signal bounced off three cell towers.

287
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,416
Highway 435, northbound. Go get him.

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,333
OK.

289
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,500
Inspector Rubio to all units.
We're leaving.

290
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:05,208
The target is escaping
on highway 435, northbound.

291
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,541
Listen, Sierra.

292
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,250
Before we're out of the Bank of Spain,

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,833
we'll destroy you.

294
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,666
So boring.

295
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,791
You're not an ethics professor, right?

296
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,833
No, you fired two rockets
in the center of Madrid,

297
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,000
and now you're on Al-Qaeda's team.

298
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,750
Bada bing, bada boom.

299
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:40,041
I'll fix my mistakes. I'm offering you
the chance to do the same with yours.

300
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,958
-Nairobi--
-No way! I won't send a surgeon in.

301
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,625
But I can offer access to medical care.
Bring Nairobi out.

302
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,916
I've got an ambulance waiting.

303
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,875
I won't put her in the hands
of a torturer who tried to kill her.

304
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,416
-Face the consequences.
-I'm trembling with fear.

305
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,708
As a gesture of goodwill,
I'm offering you a truce.

306
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,166
For the next 48 hours.

307
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,875
That way, you can assess
how serious the wound is.

308
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,208
Or let her die there.

309
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,208
I accept the truce,
but let me tell you something.

310
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,666
Nairobi will survive...

311
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,458
with or without your help.

312
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,791
Good.

313
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,708
Let's catch that bastard.

314
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,250
<i>And how will we get out of the epicenter?</i>

315
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,041
Following the Hamelin plan.

316
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,791
Tell me more.

317
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:45,083
Marseille will play the pipe,
and all the rats will run after him.

318
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,041
<i>We'll make them believe we've escaped.</i>

319
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:53,875
Exactly.

320
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:59,833
<i>We'll leave a false trail, but...</i>
<i>a believable one, backed up with evidence,</i>

321
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:03,625
and they'll leave the place
where we're hiding.

322
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:08,125
Then, when the predators have gone,
we'll climb down the trees like monkeys.

323
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,583
Don't you think
it'll be the most beautiful reunion?

324
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,541
Why'd you call me Mr. Potato Head?

325
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,166
I don't know. Your gait.

326
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,666
My gait? What gait?

327
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,041
Because you're... sweet.

328
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,541
Are you calling me sweet or fat?

329
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,208
Don't answer.
I'd rather think I'm sweet.

330
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,958
You really messed things up
calling me that.

331
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:21,875
Word got around. Now Homicide,
Internal Affairs, and the court all know.

332
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,875
I didn't know about memes
until I saw the Mr. Potato Head ones.

333
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,625
I'm really sorry.

334
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:41,000
Aren't you going to ask me...
why I got involved in this?

335
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,083
No.

336
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,458
I know you did it for love.

337
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,916
When we get to Madrid,
they'll offer you a cooperation deal.

338
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,166
I know.

339
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:03,541
Armed robbery, breach of the peace,

340
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,333
assaulting an officer,
possession of weapons,

341
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,458
disclosure of secrets,
belonging to an armed group,

342
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,625
and abduction.

343
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,458
Abduction of the hostages
and of my own daughter.

344
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,125
So, no matter what deal they offer me,

345
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:25,250
even with the most
anti-establishment prosecutor,

346
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,583
I'll do at least 30 years.

347
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,291
So, I'm fucked,

348
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,416
Mr. Potato Head.

349
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,125
The instructions you give
must be clear and concise, OK?

350
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,166
How many blood units do we need?

351
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,875
{\an8}Have three ready at room temperature.

352
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,625
How many are there?

353
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,250
-Three.
-OK, go and get more.

354
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,875
O negative and A negative.

355
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:58,375
Draw enough for three operations.
Ask if anyone's a doctor.

356
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,875
Bogotá, go downstairs.

357
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,500
It's our only way out of here.
Get melting.

358
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,000
Being in charge suits you well.

359
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,625
You lost the team's trust.

360
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,250
Do you know what your only way out will be
once I'm not here?

361
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,291
Walking out with your hands up, praying

362
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,375
that there are so many cameras outside
that they won't shoot you.

363
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,958
<i>Messieurs... au revoir.</i>

364
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,250
Bye.

365
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,583
Go ahead, Doctor.

366
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:42,041
<i>A 15-centimeter incision</i>
<i>between the sixth and seventh ribs.</i>

367
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,041
Scalpel.

368
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:50,416
This time, if anyone gets injured,
we'll be ready to save their life.

369
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:55,166
We'll learn the protocols
for the most common gunshot wound cases.

370
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,333
In the truck,
apart from what we need for the heist,

371
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:03,791
we'll also carry medical supplies
to carry out any kind of surgery.

372
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,833
<i>Dr. Ahmed will be the brains,</i>
<i>but he'll be 7,000 km away.</i>

373
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,166
<i>You'll be the hands.</i>

374
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,291
<i>And it won't be easy.</i>

375
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,000
You can't hesitate.

376
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,416
You can't fail.

377
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,208
Because it won't be
a dead pig on the table.

378
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,375
It'll be one of you.

379
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,916
<i>-Suction. I can't see.</i>
-Bring the camera closer.

380
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,416
Always keep the surgical area clean.

381
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,250
-I can see.
-Next step?

382
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,458
<i>We need to separate the ribs.</i>

383
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,250
<i>You may have to remove part of the lung.</i>

384
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,000
Separate the ribs? Fuck me.

385
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,666
The rib spreader.

386
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,333
-Is this it?
-Yes, bring it here.

387
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,916
Those with blood types O negative or
A negative, raise your hands.

388
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,333
Are you going to make us
check your medical records?

389
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,958
Paquita.
You were a nurse's aide, weren't you?

390
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,625
Yes, sir. And a midwife.

391
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,000
Come with me.

392
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,500
Everyone with their hand raised,
come with me now!

393
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:02,458
Hello.

394
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,208
Professor.

395
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,541
-Marseille!
-Yes, it's me. Don't worry.

396
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,833
-The cops aren't here.
-Where's the bull?

397
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:16,000
-What bull?
-Help me up. I'm stiff.

398
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,583
That bull?

399
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,583
That bull.

400
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,000
Start walking backwards
very slowly, Marseille,

401
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,166
and don't break eye contact.

402
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,708
Does this remind you of something?

403
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,041
San Fermín?

404
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,166
Italy.

405
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,833
When I met you, at the wedding.

406
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,625
Come on, farther back.

407
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,458
Isn't the bouquet thing for single women?

408
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,041
Do you see any single women here?

409
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,166
You're the closest thing we have.

410
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,208
Tradition says the bride has to throw it,

411
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,666
and that's what I'm doing.
Farther back.

412
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,875
Come on, move.

413
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,625
A welder, a gay guy,

414
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,875
a mute, and a librarian.

415
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,041
Fucking hell, this Italian wedding...

416
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,666
I'm not a mute. I'm just quiet.

417
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,958
I told you, I'm not a librarian.

418
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,125
Please just call me Sergio.

419
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,125
Ladies, the bride's throwing the bouquet.
Focus!

420
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,208
Come on, farther back, girls!
Just a bit more.

421
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,041
Farther back!

422
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:49,541
<i>Ready?</i>

423
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,625
My little brother!

424
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,500
<i>-Bravissimo,</i> little brother.
-Congratulations.

425
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:03,500
Mrs. Fonollosa,
it's time for the first dance.

426
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,041
-But first... a little surprise.
-What is it?

427
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,833
That's what I call a choir!

428
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,250
<i>Like anyone with no sense of rhythm,</i>

429
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,250
<i>the Professor sat at the table.</i>

430
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,916
<i>There he wondered,</i>

431
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:58,208
<i>which carries more weight: love or death?</i>

432
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,500
<i>Life carries the most weight.</i>

433
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,541
Life.

434
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,833
Then there's me.
Dying but still getting married.

435
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,708
Isn't it a beautiful contradiction?

436
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,708
Does she know you're sick?

437
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,750
Of course she does.

438
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,625
She's very smart.

439
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,916
And if you look on the bright side,
we're lucky.

440
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,791
Most people don't know
when their time will come.

441
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
We get to stay
in the honeymoon period forever.

442
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,875
People buy a bottle of champagne
for a special occasion

443
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,458
and go back to their routines.

444
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:49,000
Tatiana and I will live life to the limit
with a barrel of French champagne.

445
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,375
Death can be
the best opportunity of your life, Sergio.

446
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,291
Sad, Professor?

447
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,416
If you want,
you can talk to me about feelings.

448
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,000
Should I put some music on?

449
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,125
Music cheers you up.

450
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,875
The car's stolen. The music isn't mine.

451
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,625
It doesn't matter, Marseille.
Keep driving.

452
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,000
Excuse me.

453
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,708
Who is the blood for?

454
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,458
Why the fuck do you care?

455
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:18,500
Two of you went upstairs with the bear,
but only one of you is here.

456
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,791
Then you already know who it's for.

457
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,666
Now let's stay quiet.

458
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,583
-Denver.
-What?

459
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,000
Thank you.

460
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:40,708
-What for?
-I came in just to tell you in person.

461
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,833
I know we didn't start off
on the right foot,

462
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:49,875
but what matters
is that you've raised my son.

463
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,000
-Thank you.
-What are you talking about, jerk?

464
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,708
That'll do, Paquita. Thank you.

465
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,916
At your age and with all that money...

466
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,958
changing diapers
probably wasn't part of your plan.

467
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,291
That does you credit.

468
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,333
Because it takes a real man

469
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:17,583
to look after a kid who was born
from another man's sperm.

470
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,166
Look, freak.

471
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,625
Be quiet. Don't rile me up,

472
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,875
or you'll be eating my fist
till Christmas.

473
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,708
He isn't. He's not A negative.

474
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,291
Arturo is A positive.

475
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,750
What were you doing?

476
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,208
What were you doing?
I tested them by chance.

477
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,750
We could've killed her.

478
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,458
I'm sorry.

479
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,583
Sorry. Shit, I was wrong.
I didn't do it on purpose.

480
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:47,458
I know I'm A something. I didn't know
if it was positive or negative.

481
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,958
It's not something you use every day.
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,166
You're confused now, is that it?

483
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,291
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

484
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,541
Maybe he really was confused.

485
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,875
-Help him, for Christ's sake!
-Get up. He's OK. Get up.

486
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,291
You can't go around
punching people like that.

487
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:15,166
-It's enough that they're trapped here.
-It's over. He's OK. I'm sorry.

488
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,416
It's OK.

489
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,416
Besides...

490
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,166
I know exactly why you're so pissed off.

491
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,458
-Why?
-I get it.

492
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,166
Mónica told you about the bathroom,
right?

493
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,333
What bathroom?

494
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,916
What bathroom is he talking about?

495
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I apologize. For Christ's sake, I'm sorry.

496
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,250
I don't know what I was thinking.

497
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,750
I hadn't seen her or had her close
for such a long time...

498
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,875
I don't know, I misread the signs.

499
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,875
And she told me...

500
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,500
that we could meet somewhere
so I could see my kid.

501
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,333
One thing led to another,
and I went for it.

502
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,625
He went for what?

503
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,041
-What did he go for?
-Denver, nothing happened.

504
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,458
Let it go.

505
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,791
Were you going to meet this jerk
to show him our son?

506
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,166
He confused me, saying he was his father.
He was upset--

507
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,500
OK, but... what did he go for?
I don't get it.

508
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:17,333
It wasn't her fault.
Leave her out of it. I'm the one to blame.

509
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,125
We hugged... I got aroused...

510
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,666
-I held her--
-Shut up!

511
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,583
Is that true?

512
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:30,333
Did this son of a bitch
rub himself against you...<i> </i>with a hard-on?

513
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,625
I pushed him off right away with the gun.

514
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,166
Listen to me. I fought back, Denver.

515
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,416
So it's true.

516
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,750
Stop, Denver!

517
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,916
Stop, you're going to kill him,
Denver! Stop!

518
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,833
What the fuck is this?

519
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,083
What the fuck do you have inside of you?

520
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,291
All that rage...

521
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,583
All that violence...

522
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,375
You shot a hostage.

523
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,291
And now you beat him up...

524
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,000
like a maniac.

525
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,958
I can't...

526
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:44,500
I don't know what your trauma is
or where it came from,

527
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,416
but I can't, Denver.

528
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,083
I can't, and I don't want...

529
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,500
I don't want my son...

530
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,375
to feel that rage you carry inside.

531
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,458
I don't want that.

532
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,791
Correct. Continue.

533
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,333
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

534
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,333
-Is it him?
-The car rolled several times.

535
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:37,666
There are traces of blood and no driver.
It must be him.

536
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,750
Or a dealer, or someone undocumented...

537
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,166
The car was stolen just hours ago
in Salvatierra,

538
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,208
the town closest
to where we found Murillo.

539
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,041
And they climb trees.

540
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,083
I see.

541
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:51,791
Excuse me.

542
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,875
-Yes, Colonel?
-<i>Was it him?</i>

543
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,791
I think so. He can't be far.
He's lost a lot of blood.

544
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:07,208
Let Suárez deal with it.
I need you here with Murillo.

545
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,125
Bring her to Madrid.
That's more important. OK?

546
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,500
-Understood.
-<i>Get Suárez to send units</i>

547
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,583
to all the hospitals in the area,

548
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,833
to every vet,
to every nun with a first aid kit.

549
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:23,250
I want everyone alert. If we lose him,
it'd better be because he's dead.

550
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,958
Pamuk.

551
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:36,958
What?

552
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,041
My dog was called Pamuk.

553
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:43,875
Pamuk was with me during the war.
I know how you feel.

554
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:49,208
Are you making some kind of metaphor
with your dead dog and my partner?

555
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,541
She was a female dog.

556
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:57,083
After the war, all my friends were dead.

557
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And I... spent my nights in a bar.

558
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,708
One day, another day...

559
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,916
Pamuk was always outside waiting.

560
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,291
Did you also fall in love
only to have her killed in front of you?

561
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:17,916
Yes.

562
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,208
What happened to Pamuk?

563
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:33,125
The boys from the village...
liked to play war.

564
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,625
After a while,

565
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,458
without an enemy,
they got bored of playing war.

566
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:45,583
One day... they found some stones.

567
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,458
They broke bottles.

568
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,125
And they said Pamuk was the enemy.

569
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:00,833
I'm sorry.

570
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,916
She was a good dog.

571
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,083
Marseille, can you stop a minute?
I need to... urinate.

572
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,541
Good piss?

573
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,250
Peeing is a relief sometimes.

574
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,125
<i>However great the pain,</i>
<i>we could not lose sight of one thing.</i>

575
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,666
<i>Our lives depended on what was happening</i>
<i>48 meters below the ground.</i>

576
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,958
<i>The plan had a very simple rule:</i>

577
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,791
<i>either we got all the gold out of there,</i>
<i>or we were all dead.</i>

578
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,916
<i>No matter what was going on above,</i>
<i>we had to get the gold out.</i>

579
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:30,000
<i>No matter what was going on above,</i>
<i>we had to get the gold out.</i>

580
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:37,416
<i>Move the lung.</i>
<i>I want to see the lower part.</i>

581
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,458
Okay.

582
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,541
<i>Use your hand.</i>

583
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,458
Colonel!

584
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,916
There's an increased flow
of electromagnetic signals

585
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,750
going in and out of the bank.

586
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:57,250
-Martínez, in layman's terms.
-They're communicating with the outside.

587
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,208
<i>Move the image closer. OK.</i>

588
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,541
OK, we need to remove
the lower part of the lung.

589
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,791
<i>Risk of infection and necrosis.</i>

590
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,000
<i>It could kill her.</i>

591
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,666
How are we gonna cut
part of her lung out?

592
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:17,083
<i>-Do you have an electric scalpel?</i>
-Yes.

593
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,791
-From its size, I'd say it's a video call.
-Can we watch it?

594
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,916
The signal is encrypted. I'd say
it's going through a Kazakh satellite...

595
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:31,500
then probably through the deep web.
It's impossible to be sure.

596
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,666
Let's take it down, then.

597
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,375
<i>Let's do it. No time to waste.</i>

598
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:43,166
<i>Listen and follow my instructions closely.</i>

599
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,083
<i>-We'll go slowly. Understood?</i>
-Understood.

600
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:51,416
Colonel... if it were
a Spanish phone company satellite,

601
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,166
-we'd request a jam--
-Don't tell me what we can't do.

602
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,416
I told you to cut off the damn call.

603
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,750
<i>If you cut a vein, we stop the scalpel</i>

604
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>-and close it with Kocher forceps.</i>
-Understood.

605
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,625
We'd have to jam the signals in the area,

606
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,833
take down the Internet
and anything using satellite.

607
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:13,208
Like in Egypt in 2011. Do it.

608
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,583
<i>Let's make the first incision.</i>

609
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,833
<i>-See the lingula?</i>
-What's that?

610
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,416
<i>Lower part--</i>

611
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:24,750
-What?
-You've gotta be kidding.

612
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,791
What's wrong?

613
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,750
-There's no return signal.
-What?

614
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,916
Fuck!

615
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:41,208
There's no signal. Everything is down.

616
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,083
What do we do?

617
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,958
Blood pressure is dropping.
We're losing her.

618
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,083
No.

619
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,625
No, fuck!
