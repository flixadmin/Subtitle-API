1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,136
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,226
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,138
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,309
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,440
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,114
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,447
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,782
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,780
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,949
- He's your brother, Cisco.
- Not by choice.

11
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,288
So Mom tells me
you're still working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,124
We couldn't do what we do without Cisco.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,503
No, he's loyal. Just like a dog.

14
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,632
- We had a deal.
- My speed for Wally's life.

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,924
Hand him over and it's yours.

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,002
The Speed Force
is leaving his body.

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,796
He's becoming human again.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,802
I know some piece of you did care for me.
Please, let him go.

19
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,808
Caitlin!

20
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,975
You are gonna get your speed back, Allen.
And I'm gonna help you do that.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,232
- How?
- By creating another

22
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,565
particle accelerator explosion.

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,375
Barry, there's a high-speed chase,
heading south on Milton Ave.

24
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,623
We lost them.

25
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,175
Not gonna lose him, though.

26
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,502
You wanna bet?

27
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,721
On!

28
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,053
Oh, you wanna play? Okay.

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,721
All right, get ready to bring it!

30
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,686
They're not slowing down.

31
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,434
Of course not.

32
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,606
There's a route!
The tunnel, take the tunnel!

33
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,150
They're headed for the
Fifth Street Tunnel!

34
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,493
Satellite can't project in there!

35
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,199
What, you just thought of this now?

36
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,285
I didn't think he'd actually try to
outrun The Flash.

37
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,658
Lightning, lightning toss!

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,077
He wants to do the lightning toss!

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,211
No. No lightning.
It's a hologram, remember?

40
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,965
- Just...
- No. No, no, the wind-up!

41
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,714
So we can block their fuel division.
Yes, of course.

42
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,465
All right, Cisco.

43
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,009
This is where all those countless hours

44
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,889
gaming in your basement
are about to pay off.

45
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,687
Fingers, don't fail me now.

46
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,265
Leeroy!

47
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,270
- My eyes!
- What is this?

48
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,541
I need a breather.

49
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,541
I didn't think
this hologram thing was gonna work.

50
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,630
But so far, so good!

51
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,046
I mean, I figured if they could get
Tupac rapping again at a concert,

52
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,261
we could definitely get The Flash
running around Central City.

53
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,141
- It's not going to last.
- There it is.

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,302
It's not gonna be long
before someone figures out,

55
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,221
"Oh, wait, you never say anything,"

56
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,436
"you never touch anything,
or wait, you never go indoors."

57
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,102
Okay. Well, without Barry's speed,
this is as good an idea as any.

58
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,607
Actually, I beg to differ.

59
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,944
I think a better idea, instead of playing
hoodlums and holograms,

60
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,280
would be to rebuild
the particle accelerator

61
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,819
to get Barry's speed back.

62
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,157
Yeah, Wells,
that's what you keep saying.

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,321
That's right.

64
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,866
Look at what that explosion did
to this city.

65
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,872
Not to mention, the last time
we tried something like that,

66
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,584
we blew a hole in the universe and
created, like, 50 portals to your Earth.

67
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,545
Which is exactly how Zoom and
his henchmen got here in the first place.

68
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,053
I told you.
I know how to contain the explosion.

69
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,505
- BARRYI Really?
- HARRISONI Yes.

70
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,636
You know how to contain
a dark matter explosion

71
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,928
that last time just radiated
all of Central City?

72
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,556
You tried this on your Earth, remember?
Didn't go so well.

73
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,270
And even if you could contain it,

74
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,027
I thought you said that Barry couldn't
tap into the Speed Force anymore.

75
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,778
It wasn't connected
the first time he got his powers.

76
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,156
Look, I have your Wells' data.

77
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,316
The Harrison Wells from this Earth,
I have his science.

78
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,827
I know what chemicals need to be
in your body.

79
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,704
I know how the lightning needs to bond

80
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,831
with the dark matter from
the particle accelerator explosion.

81
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,836
I can recreate the circumstances to
get you your speed back.

82
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:08,215
This will work. Your subterfuge,
it's not gonna last.

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,590
But more importantly,
it's not gonna save Snow.

84
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,674
It's not going to bring your Caitlin back.

85
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,388
You wanna be ready?

86
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,852
Should Zoom return, if Zoom returns,
when Zoom returns,

87
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,149
there is only one way to do it,
and that's by getting your speed back.

88
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,381
- Hey.
- Hey.

89
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,671
- How are you?
- You made it.

90
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,876
Yeah.

91
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,553
- Look at this.
- Come inside. Get warm.

92
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,804
Yeah. Wow.

93
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,804
- Sure is a pretty drive up here.
- It is that.

94
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,853
I can't help but wonder
why a speedster needs a car.

95
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,241
Because I am no longer a speedster.

96
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,783
You lost your powers?

97
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,530
I gave them up to save Wally, Joe's son.

98
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:27,203
Zoom had him.
So it was either give him my speed, or...

99
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,164
I couldn't let Wally die.

100
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,088
No, you couldn't.

101
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,306
Now Jay has taken Caitlin,
and we have no idea how to save her.

102
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,011
Jay took Caitlin?

103
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,434
Jay...

104
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,973
Turns out Jay Garrick
is not The Flash from Earth-2.

105
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,062
He's Zoom.

106
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,434
Garrick?

107
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,729
Garrick, yeah. Why?

108
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,357
My mom's maiden name.

109
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,446
Well, maybe, maybe Wells is right.

110
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,739
Maybe I should try to get my powers back.

111
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,748
How would you do that?

112
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,918
By recreating
the particle accelerator explosion.

113
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,829
- And getting struck by lightning again?
- Mmm.

114
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,792
That doesn't seem like
the safest option, does it?

115
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,131
No.

116
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,970
I've watched you grow,
ever since you became The Flash.

117
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,147
And I am so proud of that man.

118
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,484
But ask yourself,

119
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:37,318
do you really need powers
in order to be that person?

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,277
It just feels like every time

121
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,953
something good happens in my life,
it's taken away.

122
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,457
Well, maybe it's time
we did something about that.

123
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,677
Looks like The Vacuum.

124
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,173
Uh... What's The Vacuum?

125
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,846
No Fringe on Earth-2. Noted.

126
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,223
What is that thing?

127
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,514
That is how
Barry's gonna get his speed back.

128
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,975
This is what you've been working on
in the workshop?

129
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,810
Someone has to worry about Zoom.

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,145
Okay, Barry cannot do this.

131
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,031
- Well, he has to, Ramon.
- You keep calling me that. But that's...

132
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
Dante?

133
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,377
What'd you see? Zoom? Did you see Zoom?

134
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,548
No. I saw my brother.

135
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,876
I gotta go.

136
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,848
Let's see where everybody is. Hey.

137
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,554
Henry?

138
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,430
Iris. Hi.

139
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,387
It's so good to see you.

140
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,226
Oh, you, too.

141
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,892
I guess Barry dragged you back
for a bit, huh?

142
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,102
Looks like maybe for good.

143
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,022
Wait, what? Seriously?

144
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,738
Yeah, yeah. I figured I've spent
enough time away from my son.

145
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,910
Have you told Dad?

146
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,405
Nah. I wanted to tell him in person.

147
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,827
Yeah, I think he's with Wally at C.C.P.D.
I'll give him a call. Okay.

148
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,586
- Good to see you.
- Dad, let's get settled.

149
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,340
Your sister called,
checking in when we'd be home.

150
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,591
As in, we need to get going?

151
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,635
Thanks. You know your sister.

152
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,478
Okay, move it, let's go.

153
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,975
Do you ever get sick of this, Joe?
Being a cop?

154
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,602
Oh.

155
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,943
Looks like someone inherited
the West I-need-to-help-people gene.

156
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,109
It's just, ever since The Flash saved me,
I Just...

157
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,122
I don't know if designing cars is what
I'm meant to do with my life.

158
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,498
Well, I'm sure there's something out there

159
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,789
that'll satisfy your need for speed
and helping people.

160
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,550
But until then,
you should stick with engineering.

161
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,960
It's much safer.

162
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,134
We should get going before Singh comes up
with something for me to do.

163
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,967
Zoom!

164
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,602
Hello, old friend.

165
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,271
Stay away from him.

166
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,765
Do not move.

167
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,392
Or what?

168
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,937
You've tried your guns on me once before.

169
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,065
No!

170
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,403
Don't hurt them.

171
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,619
Let them go, please!

172
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,665
Tell everyone that this city is mine.

173
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,426
Anyone who disobeys me

174
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,004
will meet their end.

175
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,142
All right. Clear out.

176
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,197
Caitlin's with Zoom.

177
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,823
Why would he bring her here?

178
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,370
To show power.

179
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,705
It's exactly what he did on my Earth.

180
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,213
- What are you talking about?
- First thing he did was murder people.

181
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,007
Slaughtered a bunch of policemen,

182
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,338
then recruited
every meta-human he could find.

183
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,133
And those that disobeyed, he killed, too.

184
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,881
Where are the police now?

185
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,423
Outside the precinct.

186
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,218
He'll kill them, Joe. He'll kill them all.

187
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,727
Not with Caitlin with him.

188
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,348
She talked him out of killing everyone
when he took over C. C. P.D.

189
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,437
That's what we're gonna rely on?
Snow talking him out of it?

190
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,272
Joe, you need to
get those guys out of there.

191
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,320
What if they set up at Jitters?

192
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,277
It's a good idea.
It's just a block away from the precinct.

193
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,907
And then what?
What happens next?

194
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,784
You saw what Zoom did on my Earth.

195
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
He will do
the exact same thing here, Barry.

196
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,785
We need to get you your powers back.

197
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,918
- There must be another way.
- There's not. There's not.

198
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,544
I'm gonna get word to Singh.
Get him to set up a task force at Jitters.

199
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,376
- And then what?
- I don't know yet.

200
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,923
But I'm gonna make sure
Wally and Jesse are safe.

201
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,816
You know they're going to
figure out a way to stop you, right?

202
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,904
Who? Barry? Wells? The police? No.

203
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,775
Nobody can stop me now. Not anymore.

204
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:36,823
So, what's your plan?
You'rejust gonna kill everyone?

205
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,575
Not everyone.

206
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,537
Then why are you keeping me here?

207
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,088
Because I don't want to be alone anymore.

208
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,967
I'm never going to be with you.

209
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,633
You think that you're not like me,

210
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,433
but I've seen the darkness
inside of you, Caitlin.

211
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,853
Just like it was inside Killer Frost.

212
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,312
All you have to do is unlock it.

213
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,681
Hey.

214
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,388
There she is.

215
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,687
Still refuse to dress
like a grown-up, I see.

216
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,851
- One grape soda.
- Uh...

217
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,066
No. I'm good. Thanks.

218
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,362
So, what's wrong?

219
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,315
What, something has to be wrong for me
to want to catch up with my brother?

220
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,701
Yeah, that's usually the way
it works with you, isn't it?

221
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,535
Actually, I had this feeling

222
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,699
that I should come and see you.

223
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,412
And make sure you're okay, so...

224
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,962
Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped by
Snart and his pyromaniac friend again?

225
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,215
Us. You, me, us.
They kidnapped both of us.

226
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,092
Yeah, well, you're not the one
who almost had his hands frozen off.

227
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,091
Lucky I can still play the piano.

228
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,093
Although my octaves haven't
quite been the same,

229
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,724
but not that that matters to you.

230
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,805
Dante, I called you. More than once.

231
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,470
But of course, you didn't answer.

232
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,805
Like I said, only when something's wrong.

233
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,436
Yeah. Okay.

234
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,397
I don't know why I thought
that whole experience,

235
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:37,409
that was it,
that was gonna bring us closer.

236
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,070
Cisco, we haven't been close
since we were kids.

237
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,535
I don't think anything's
ever going to change that.

238
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,253
All right.
We'll bring down some more supplies later.

239
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,757
How you can reach us.

240
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,340
And exactly how long
are we supposed to be in here?

241
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,761
Until someone lets you out.

242
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,844
This isn't ideal. None of it.

243
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,641
But Zoom's here.

244
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,727
And until he's taken care of,
this is what we're doing.

245
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,638
This is the safest place
for the two of you right now.

246
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,477
- What are you going to do?
- Whatever we can.

247
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,640
Joe, let me do something.

248
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
Wally, there isn't anything
you can do right now.

249
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,186
Sit tight.

250
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,607
Okay, what about the... Bathroom.

251
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,327
This room have Wi-Fi, at least?

252
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,951
Wally and Jesse are all good.

253
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,960
Thank you.

254
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,004
So this is what it takes to
get Barry his speed back.

255
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,344
Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,259
It's not uncomplicated, but almost there.

257
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,469
I told you before.

258
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,260
Once Barry makes up his mind,
it's impossible to change it.

259
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,430
Well, then we need to convince him that
this is the only way

260
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,223
before he decides not to do it, right?

261
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,981
You shouldn't have to convince anyone to
do anything against his will.

262
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,152
Joe, we're talking about Barry, right?

263
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,739
I mean, lcan't... I can't imagine
you don't feel the same way.

264
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,784
Henry, right now, I don't know
what the right thing to do is.

265
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,331
Seems clear to me.

266
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,832
This isn'tjust about your son, Henry.

267
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,500
This is about the people in Central City,
about saving those people.

268
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,835
This is about stopping Zoom.

269
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,128
Your daughter is safe.

270
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,836
This could kill my son.

271
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,422
I'm not gonna let that happen.

272
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,968
The last time he was struck by lightning,
he was in a coma for nine months.

273
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,011
- How did that happen?
- I know what I'm doing.

274
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,101
You are messing with something
that is out of your control.

275
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,226
And what if it did work?
I mean, what then?

276
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,235
Joe, he's goes up against Zoom?

277
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,072
The monster that snapped
his back and almost killed him?

278
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,983
And then took the one thing

279
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,869
that he's convinced now that
he needs in order to make him whole?

280
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,577
This is the way. This is the only way.

281
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,458
The people of Central City need The Flash.

282
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,709
Guys...

283
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,335
I know that you care about me,
each of you, in your own way.

284
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,878
And you all have your own
point of view on this.

285
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,512
But this decision is mine.

286
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,309
I have to make it on my own.

287
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,392
Can you put the Diamonds game on?

288
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,190
Ah! Sports. That's my cue.

289
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,574
All right, well, this was fun.
Um, good hang.

290
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,322
Oh, wait.

291
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,199
You're gonna take care of that, right?

292
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,957
- Dude, you invited me.
- Unbelievable.

293
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,704
Hey, hold up!

294
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,249
No.

295
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,880
What? Cisco. Hey, wait.

296
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,721
Yo, I need a lift home.

297
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,265
You still don't have a car?

298
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,101
Some of us don't have a fleet of
company cars at our disposal.

299
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,689
Dude, it's on the way.

300
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,308
Yeah, okay...

301
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,280
- You okay?
- Yeah.

302
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,130
Hello, Vibe.

303
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,638
Simmer down, Reaper,
we got no beef with you.

304
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,101
Maybe not.
But I've got beef with you, Vibe.

305
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,607
- Why does he keep calling you that?
- I don't know.

306
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,484
You killed my brother. So now you die.

307
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,902
Oh, my God.

308
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,147
You're Princess Bride-ing me right now.

309
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,446
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else, Inigo.

310
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,657
I don't think so. My brother was Reverb.

311
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,160
Remember now?

312
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,668
Move!

313
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,959
- He looks...
- Get... Get in the van!

314
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,342
- He looks like...
- Now!

315
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,341
God, I knew there was something wrong!

316
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,682
Every time I see you, we get attacked by
lunatics with crazy weapons!

317
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,352
Come on, he's gonna
blast us with that thing!

318
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,690
No, he's not.

319
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,489
Go, go!

320
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,251
You wanna tell me exactly what
you've gotten us into this time?

321
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,958
He calls himself Rupture.

322
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,715
Another meta-human under
Zoom's control from my Earth.

323
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,050
Great, so he's bringing
more of his friends over.

324
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,428
It's what I told you that he would do.

325
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,098
Okay, well,
Zoom must've lied to fake Dante

326
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,553
and told him I was the one
who killed Reverb,

327
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,180
'cause dude wants me dead.

328
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,677
We gotta do something.

329
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,141
What else do you know about him?

330
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,689
He gets his power
from that scythe he wields.

331
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,104
Thing's legit, too.
It almost took half the van with him.

332
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,484
All right, then that's what we need to do.

333
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,612
We need to figure out a way
to get it away from him.

334
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,772
Right.

335
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,362
Okay. All right, I'm sure
I can come up with something.

336
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,822
I just have to figure out a way
to not tell Dante

337
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,158
why this psychopath looks
exactly like him.

338
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,710
You know what you need to do.

339
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,252
I need a minute.

340
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,015
Hey.

341
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,314
This should be an easy decision.

342
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,144
Why isn't it?

343
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,612
I mean, it's not like you're picking out
what sweater you're going to wear.

344
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,777
Getting hit by another
particle accelerator explosion?

345
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,324
I mean, come on.

346
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,205
What if something goes wrong? What if...

347
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,620
I thought bringing my dad here
would make this easier.

348
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,835
It's just made it a lot harder.

349
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,966
Yeah, I can understand
him not wanting you to do it.

350
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,634
He just wants you to be safe.

351
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,135
What about you?

352
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,681
I mean, I don't know if I could go through

353
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,093
what I went through last time
if you get hurt.

354
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,432
Are you okay?

355
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,070
Not really.

356
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,653
What's up?

357
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,489
Do you remember when I told you
that I didn't want you going to Earth-2

358
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,790
if you felt like
you didn't have anything left here?

359
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,038
Yeah.

360
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,618
Because Patty left.

361
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,129
It wasn't just because of Patty.

362
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,712
What do you mean?

363
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,504
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

364
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,593
Me.

365
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,390
I've just been thinking a lot lately.

366
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,983
About us.

367
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,109
What Wells said
about us being married in the future?

368
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,273
And on Earth-2?

369
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,944
And I can't help but wondering if,

370
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,743
maybe, we were meant to be together.

371
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,672
So,

372
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,462
When I told you
how I felt about you last year...

373
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,804
I wasn't available in that way.

374
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,680
But... But I am now.

375
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,846
Why are you telling me this now?

376
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,479
Because,

377
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,359
Barry, I need you to know
that it doesn't matter to me

378
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,777
if you're The Flash or not.

379
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,411
You, Barry, that's who
I want to see if I have a future with.

380
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,241
I mean,

381
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,087
if you still want that, too, of course.

382
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,170
Um,

383
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:21,762
I should go see
if Jesse and Wally need anything.

384
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,929
Okay.

385
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,619
Come on.

386
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,540
Yes.

387
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,723
And?

388
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,182
RUPTUREI He got away. But I'll find him.

389
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,975
Later.

390
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,233
He needs to pay for
what he did to my brother.

391
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,691
And he will, later, Rupture.

392
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,646
What do you want me to do?

393
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,566
The police have gathered again.

394
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,112
They think I've spared their lives.

395
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,666
Tonight, show them they're wrong.

396
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,498
You disapprove.

397
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,334
You said you would spare them.

398
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,386
I need to teach them a lesson.

399
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,891
Is that why you change your voice,
so that everyone will be afraid of you?

400
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,221
I'm not a monster!

401
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,976
As you once said,

402
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,027
I'm nothing but a monster.

403
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,041
Can we come out now?

404
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,326
- No!
- No!

405
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,455
Something's blinking over here.

406
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,720
- From C. C.P.D.
- That's Caitlin.

407
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,506
What about Caitlin?

408
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,052
She sent us a message.
Rupture is gonna attack Jitters tonight.

409
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,137
We gotta move, Barry.

410
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,481
What are you gonna do, slugger?

411
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,734
Having The Flash might be the best way to

412
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,899
stop Zoom and all the metas
he's sending over.

413
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,320
But look, I... Until we know for sure

414
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,238
that setting off the accelerator
will work,

415
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,079
it's too risky,
notjust for me, for the entire city.

416
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,039
- Yeah.
- There are countless others

417
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,704
that would be affected
if the explosion is not contained.

418
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,588
- Yes, but, Allen...
- Stop, Wells. Look, I'm sorry.

419
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,964
I've made up my mind.

420
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,384
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,426
We're gonna have to figure out
how to do this without The Flash.

422
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,321
Joe, did you reach The Flash?

423
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,448
- He'll be here.
- Great. These guys are almost ready.

424
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,778
Keep it on one.

425
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,205
Hey, we're all set up.

426
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,033
Are you sure this is the best plan?

427
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,701
Look, I know you can't help as The Flash,

428
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,291
but stopping one of Zoom's cronies
sends him a message

429
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,831
that we won't be intimidated.

430
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,124
You think I made the right decision?

431
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,667
I don't know, Bar.

432
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,005
Whether you made the right one or not,
you're gonna have to live with it.

433
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,638
Yeah, all right.

434
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,062
What is this?

435
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,689
You went to another Earth?

436
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,272
You weren't supposed to read that.

437
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,489
It was on your desk.
It was addressed to Mom and me.

438
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,321
So, yeah, I read it.

439
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,078
Look, I gotta go, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

440
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,988
No, man.
We're gonna talk about this right now.

441
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,372
Okay! Let's talk about this now.

442
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,657
What did you want me to say?

443
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,163
"What up, fam?"

444
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,462
"I know you probably don't care, but I'm
going off to another Earth for a hot sec."

445
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,876
"If I don't make it
back in time for dinner,"

446
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,416
"it probably didn't go so well."

447
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,672
Why did you even go in the first place?

448
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,212
Because my friends needed my help.

449
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,759
What kind of help?

450
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,842
- They needed me to vibe.
- Vibe?

451
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,141
That's what that lunatic called you
who attacked us.

452
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,981
What aren't you telling me, Cisco?

453
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,857
I have powers.

454
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,406
Powers?

455
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,532
What, you're like a meta-human?

456
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,547
I was affected when the accelerator
went off two years ago.

457
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:12,344
And now I see things, vibes, of people.

458
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,049
Like, visions?

459
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,470
So that's why you called me.

460
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,354
Yeah.

461
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,227
I had one of you.

462
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,020
At least I thought it was you,

463
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,777
until your World of Warcraft
doppelganger showed up.

464
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,356
- You killed his brother?
- No.

465
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,573
I didn't kill his brother. Of course not.

466
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,234
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

467
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,450
Because you're right.
It's just like you said.

468
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,240
We haven't been close in years and...

469
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,994
And there's nothing
we can do to change that.

470
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,425
Look, I gotta go.

471
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,548
Just wait for me here, okay?

472
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,818
You all set, Cisco?

473
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,437
Yeah, we're set.

474
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,069
Here he comes.

475
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,962
Now where has everybody gone?

476
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,551
Flash. Not who I was expecting,
but you'll be a nice warm-up.

477
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,808
Too slow, Rupture.

478
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,027
Come on, Flash!

479
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,784
- All right, time to win an Oscar.
- Let's do it.

480
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,339
- Get up.
- Are we the guys you were looking for?

481
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,049
Hope you like being alone,

482
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,059
'cause you won't be talking to anyone
in Iron Heights.

483
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,893
Cisco, we got him. All good.

484
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,933
- Okay, we're live! Sir...
- Get back. Get that camera back.

485
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,192
Get back.

486
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,479
Breaking news coming out of
Jitters coffee shop.

487
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,571
CCPN has learned that a meta-human

488
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,859
was just apprehended
after an altercation with The Flash.

489
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,027
- That's right...
- You told them Rupture was coming.

490
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,620
How?

491
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,364
How?

492
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,671
You are smart, aren't you?

493
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,131
You betrayed me!

494
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,842
You said you would spare them.

495
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,469
- I guess now we're even.
- Jay, no!

496
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,602
My name is Zoom.

497
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,561
Oh, my God.

498
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,279
No!

499
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,580
Make sure you get this.

500
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,284
- What the...
- They gotta get out of there.

501
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,211
Everybody move!

502
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,594
Barry, don't!

503
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,603
No!

504
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,939
I told you what would happen
if you disobeyed me.

505
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,152
Hey. stop! Stop!

506
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,939
God... You've made your point.

507
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,653
Not quite yet.

508
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,451
You're an even bigger disappointment
than your brother.

509
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,301
Central City, The Flash you've seen

510
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,013
in your streets is a fake.

511
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,930
A hologram meant to give you hope.

512
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,103
But there is no more hope,

513
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,688
there is no more Flash,

514
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:41,154
and there's no one left
to protect your city from me.

515
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,656
Tell the rest of your force, Captain,

516
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,293
that their policing days are over.

517
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,507
You're only alive because of Caitlin.

518
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,379
Try something like this again,

519
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,889
and my affection for her

520
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,766
won't stop me from killing you,

521
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,603
or the rest of this city.

522
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,240
Did you see this?

523
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,543
That's what you left to go do, wasn't it?

524
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:39,375
Look, man, I know you're mad at me,
and we haven't been close in a long time.

525
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,221
Iwant things to change.

526
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,386
You're my brother.

527
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,774
Okay.

528
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,572
Okay.

529
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,661
You know that Wall's notjust going to
open for you, right?

530
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,413
It might.

531
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,040
Yeah. Trust me. It won't.

532
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,749
We shouldn't be in here.

533
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,834
We should be out there, with them.

534
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,594
Why? So Zoom can take us again?

535
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,380
No. So we can help stop him.

536
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,512
What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any powers.

537
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,972
I don't know.

538
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,434
But you're pretty quick at
solving "unsolvable problems."

539
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,728
Let's figure it out.

540
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,437
Iwill see what I can do.

541
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,273
It won't be long now.

542
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,282
He's moving faster
than he ever did on my Earth.

543
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,947
So what's next?

544
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,945
Next, he'll recruit
every meta-human he can find,

545
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,829
and then force them to do what he wants.

546
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,161
How many could be left?
We defeated most of them, didn't we?

547
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,535
No. You're not even close.

548
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,341
This is the list of meta-humans
from my Earth.

549
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,134
Ones that are the known, anyway.

550
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,254
Particle accelerator explosion
was contained on my Earth.

551
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,259
That didn't happen here.

552
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,134
Then why wouldn't we know
about other meta-humans here?

553
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,973
Because of The Flash.

554
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,145
And now that everyone knows
that he's not around...

555
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,897
They'll start coming out of the woodwork.

556
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,103
We don't know that.

557
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,901
What more do you need?

558
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,112
I told you he'd recruit meta-humans,
we've seen him do that.

559
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,774
I told you he would kill those officers,
we saw him do that, too.

560
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,445
What more do you need?

561
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,995
Let's do it.

562
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,657
Iwanna do it.

563
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,253
One of those cops that Zoom
killed tonight, he had a son.

564
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,259
Same age I was when Mom was murdered.

565
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,297
Now another kid has to grow up
without one of their parents

566
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,842
because The Flash wasn't there
to stop that monster.

567
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,768
I left this city unprotected
by giving up my powers to Zoom.

568
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,642
I enabled him to rule this Earth.

569
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,561
I need my powers back.

570
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,985
Let's do it.

571
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,029
Let's set off the particle accelerator.

572
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,749
So how does this work?

573
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,339
It's an abbreviated version of
the accelerator evil Wells built,

574
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,847
except Harry is isolating
the antimatter and dark energy

575
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,100
to direct it to Barry
instead of the entire city.

576
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,223
Good. Last thing we need is

577
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,513
more meta-humans
running around Central City.

578
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,482
So Barryjust gets in,
you turn it on and that's it?

579
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,063
Yeah. No.

580
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:49,898
Not exactly.

581
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,239
In addition to recreating what happened
with the particle accelerator explosion,

582
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,411
we also have to recreate
what happened to Barry.

583
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,696
Getting struck by lightning.

584
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,573
That's right.

585
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,251
Wait, so how are you going to do that?
It's not even raining outside.

586
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,002
Well, Ramon, you have the wand?

587
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,955
The one I made for Mark Mardon?

588
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,964
No, the one you built
for the Harry Potter convention.

589
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,841
Yes, of course the one
you built for Mardon.

590
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,003
How do you know about
that Harry Potter convention?

591
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,089
Get the wand, get on the roof.

592
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,592
- Why the roof?
- Because we're gonna need a lightning rod,

593
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,602
and that, Ramon, is going to be you.

594
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,613
All right, I'm on the roof.

595
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,234
I've never actually been up here before.

596
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,908
I think I can see my apartment from here.

597
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,621
Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.

598
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,248
When I give you the signal,

599
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,751
you're going to create
a lightning storm above you.

600
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,253
So I'm just supposed to stand here
in the middle of a lightning storm?

601
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,336
Really, Ramon, chances of being struck
are slim, indeed.

602
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,170
Yeah, not when you're the one causing it!

603
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,927
All we need is one lightning bolt
to strike the satellite.

604
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,679
The satellite's circuitry's
connected to the breach room.

605
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,011
Barry's in the breach room. Just do it.

606
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,345
Yeah, I'm doing it.

607
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,472
Mozart better watch out.

608
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,771
Cisco Ramon's about to
conduct something nasty.

609
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,357
You're gonna feel these clamps,
but they're necessary.

610
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,774
You good?

611
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,993
Yeah. Are you?

612
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,327
I'll be fine, Joe.

613
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,336
Barry, whatever happens,

614
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,173
it will never change the way
that I feel about you.

615
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:54,899
Son, you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

616
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:01,951
Being The Flash,
that's the best version of me.

617
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:07,044
If I don't have my speed,
I'll never be that person anymore.

618
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,671
I have to do this.

619
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,962
Okay.

620
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,178
You ready, Allen?

621
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,971
All right then. Here we go.

622
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,110
Think of it as hot-wiring a car.
Right, so there's a motor inside the wall.

623
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,903
So all we have to do is
provide electricity to make it turn on.

624
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,117
Exactly.

625
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,915
So let mejust do a little here...

626
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,922
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah, what's happening?

627
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,125
The particles are becoming unstable.

628
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,168
Ramon, get ready.

629
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,512
I'm gonna release the chemicals
into his system.

630
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,607
Why are you doing this?

631
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,644
The night Barry was struck by lightning,
he was doing fingerprint analysis.

632
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,441
Those chemicals got in his system then,
and they are going in now.

633
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,949
So you're injecting them into him?

634
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,827
We have to recreate everything
that happened to Barry that night.

635
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,112
I'm okay, Iris.

636
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,781
Hold on, Barry!

637
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,503
- He's going hydrostatic.
- Almost there, almost there!

638
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,872
- Wells!
- Almost there!

639
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,750
- Ready, Ramon!
- Ready!

640
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,127
Now!

641
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,797
Expecto Patronum!

642
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,889
Great Scott, it's working!

643
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,981
No!

644
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,321
Initiating collision.

645
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,168
Barry!

646
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,031
It worked! ls everyone okay?

647
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,360
What happened?

648
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,546
No. What did you do to my son?

649
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:15,941
You thought you could give
The Flash his speed back?

650
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,065
Well done.

651
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,615
You killed him instead.

652
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,920
Dad, no...
