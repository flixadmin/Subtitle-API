1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,355
"You don't need hands
as long as you've got heart.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,477
"My heart is filled with love.
I feel 5 feet tall."

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,075
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,355
Now, pretty little thing.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,953
Nice and easy.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,958
I just love a big, strong man
who's not afraid to show it...

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,951
with someone half his size.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,910
Be gentle, it's my first time.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,910
Tic-tac-toe.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,349
Thanks. L...

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,274
You make it so easy, don't you?

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,393
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,836
I am Catwoman.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,352
Hear me roar.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,839
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,194
Good time, too.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,875
Everyone but the bandits will be
slacking off till after New Year, anyway.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,478
- I'm not sure I like the inference, Bruce.
- Sorry, Max. I didn't realize I made one.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,679
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,077
A million saved is a million earned.

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,755
I commissioned this report. I thought
you might want to take a look at it.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,152
The point is, Max, Gotham City has
a power surplus. I'm sure you know that.

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,514
My question is...

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,749
what's your angle?

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,991
Power surplus? Bruce, shame on you.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,351
No such thing.
One can never have too much power.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,797
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,079
Yeah, well, I'm gonna fight you on this.
I've already spoken to the Mayor...

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,833
- and we see eye to eye.
- Mayors come and go.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,831
Blue bloods tire easy.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,760
You think you could go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,751
Well, I guess we're gonna find out.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,877
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner, so...

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,315
Crime boss? Shows what you know...

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,119
Mr. To-the-manor-born-
with-a-silver-spoon.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,395
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,038
If his parents hadn't 86'd him...

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,156
you two might have been bunkies
at prep school.

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,994
Oswald controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,640
Wayne, I'll not stand for mudslinging
in this office.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,156
If my assistant was here, she already
would have escorted you out...

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,832
Anywhere he wants.

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,629
Preferably some nightspot, grotto...

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,473
or secluded hideaway.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,716
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,074
Selina.

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,598
That's my name, Maximillions.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,399
Don't wear it out,
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,033
This is Bruce Wayne.

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,674
- Yeah, we've met.
- Have we?

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,753
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what?
I mistook me for somebody else.

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,673
You mean, mistook me.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,915
I mistook... Yeah. Isn't that what I said?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,672
No, I don't think so.

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,439
What happened?

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,631
Did you injure yourself on that ski slope?

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,917
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,198
It's a blur.

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,675
I mean, not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,469
and Betsy Riley saying
it was morning sickness.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,518
And I remember the time
I forgot to wear my underpants to school...

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,275
and the name of the boy
who noticed was Ricky Friedburg.

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,953
He's dead now.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,352
But last night, complete blur.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,231
Couldn't you just die?

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,075
Selina, please...

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,272
show out Mr. Wayne.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,679
With pleasure.

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,912
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,995
Right.

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,351
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Mr. Shreck.

72
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,874
No, you don't seem like the type
that takes orders from him.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,872
Well, that's a long story.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,990
I could free up some time.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,790
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,108
I'm working.

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,309
I'm leaving.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,838
- Dad, you buy that blurry business?
- Women.

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,391
Nothing surprises me, Chip.

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,557
Except your late mother.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
Who'd have thought
Selina had a brain to damage?

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,433
Bottom line?

83
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,594
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out a higher window.

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,991
Meantime, I've got badder fish to fry.

85
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,118
Oswald, it's Max.

86
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,679
You're home?

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,278
How've you been?

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,318
Your extended family?

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,353
Good to have a family.

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,430
I'd much rather not be disturbed now.

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,398
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,277
I don't like surprises.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,149
Come on down.

94
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,354
Don't peek.

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,793
You'll spoil it.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,154
Yes. Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows, I know.

97
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,630
But someone's got to supplant our
standing-in-the-way-of-progress mayor.

98
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,076
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

99
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,757
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,194
Mayor?

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,468
Mayor.

102
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,477
Elections happen in November.
Is this not late December?

103
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,913
Don't worry about it.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,039
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

105
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,075
Here.

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,277
Reclaim your birthright.

107
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,757
I'm Jen. Hi.

108
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,832
Okay, let's see.

109
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,311
What I'd like to do first
is put these little glove thingies on you.

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.

111
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,629
So if we wanna just lose this...

112
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,350
We'll do it another time then, okay?

113
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,677
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
down in the sewer?

114
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,511
Still, could be worse.
My nose could be gushing blood.

115
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,600
Your nose could be...
What do you mean by that?

116
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,794
Oh, God!

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,150
Everybody, back to work!

118
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,792
Let's make a mayor!

119
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,478
You're right, we missed
the regularly scheduled election...

120
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,199
but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

121
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,919
- given the boot. Look at Nixon.
- Agnew.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,513
Then think of you...

123
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,717
Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

124
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,439
I'd like to fill her void.

125
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,673
We're gonna need signatures
to overturn the ballot. I can supply those.

126
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,435
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- Oswald, we need one more thing.

127
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,273
A platform?

128
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,117
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world a giant icebox.

129
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,751
I like it. But to get the Mayor recalled,
we have to have a catalyst, a trigger.

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,434
You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot.

131
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,797
Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.

132
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,396
I need you, Oswald. I need you now.

133
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,359
That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen.

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,433
Soon. One incident like the Gulf of Tonkin
or the Reichstag fire.

135
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,556
You want my old friends up there...

136
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,279
to drive the Mayor into a foaming frenzy?

137
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,749
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

138
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,751
But...

139
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,632
I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

140
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,358
I've got my own things to tend to.

141
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,558
Sidetracked? Oswald,
this is your chance to fulfill a destiny...

142
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,949
your parents carelessly discarded.

143
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,677
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

144
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,797
Imagine, as mayor,
you'd have the ear of the media...

145
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,199
access to the captains of industry...

146
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,350
unlimited poontang.

147
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,349
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

148
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,232
All right, I'll be mayor.

149
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,514
Burn, baby, burn!

150
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,948
[Fast-paced instrumental music]

151
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,189
- Who is she?
- What is she?

152
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,238
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,353
You poor guys.

154
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,398
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

155
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,394
Don't hurt us, lady.
Our take-home's less than $300.

156
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,710
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

157
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,793
Go ahead and hit me.

158
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,717
Admiring your handiwork?

159
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,836
