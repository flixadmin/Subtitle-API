1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,680
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,520
Our brothers are crossing
the ocean even now.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,200
Gotham will be redeemed in blood.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,960
By killing nine random people,
you're insane.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,160
But not all the victims are random.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,640
The son of Gotham.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm gonna make sure
that you are telling the truth.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,480
Touch me, and my uncle
will have you gutted.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,720
- Are we good?
- Yes.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,520
- Bruce.
- I never bought your stupid act.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,840
You pretended to be my friend.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,320
Goodbye, Silver.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Kill him.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,040
Where's Galavan?

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,320
What do you want?

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,040
Well, your life, of course.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,120
Hey, guys. I fixed the hard drive.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,640
Bruce? Alfred?

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,200
Are you okay? Glass of water?

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,440
I won't sign those papers
no matter what you do.

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Oh, I'm resigned to that.
You're a very brave boy.

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll just have to acquire
the company by other means.

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
My true name is Dumas.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
And a long time ago,

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
my family was dishonored
and degraded by yours.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm sorry about that but...

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
For centuries,
our noble clan lived in vile,

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
squalid, obscurity
but we lived in hope

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,160
because our patron saint
spoke of a glorious day to come.

30
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,160
But that day would only come
when nine men of Gotham

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,920
and the last son of our mortal enemy
are slain by righteous hands.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,280
That's you, Bruce.

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,320
You're the last son.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,920
- Stop that.
- Be glad, boy.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,280
You are the anointed
redeemer of your family.

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
For seven generations,

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,080
the Wayne Family has wallowed
in vice and corruption.

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,160
So tonight, at the foretold
hour of midnight...

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,800
the Dumas will be avenged...

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,000
and the sins of the Wayne Family

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,280
shall wash away in your blood.

42
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,920
Oh, bloody hell!

43
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,240
{\an5}<i>For my mother looks over me</i>

44
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
{\an5}What the hell?

45
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,600
{\an5}At last!

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,720
{\an5}- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,320
{\an5}- Nygma?
- Hi.

48
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,680
{\an5}Long story. He's a friend.

49
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,200
{\an5}- A friend?
- You're welcome, by the way.

50
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,480
{\an5}No thanks needed,
saving your life and all.

51
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
{\an5}Yeah. Thanks, I guess.

52
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
No, really.

53
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,080
{\an5}What are friends for?

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,520
{\an5}You got beat pretty bad.

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
{\an5}That Galavan is a pistol, isn't he?

56
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,400
{\an5}Yeah, he is.

57
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,720
{\an5}Cool. You're free to go,
of course, Jim.

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,720
{\an5}Desperate fugitive from the law,
though you be.

59
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,080
{\an5}But I beg of you, sit and consider.

60
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an5}You and I share a bond
in Theo Galavan.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
{\an5}A passion, if you will.

62
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,840
If there was ever a time
for us to work together...

63
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,600
now is that time.

64
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,120
Yes, brother, it's all yours.

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,880
For God's sakes, smile.

66
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,360
- Did you find the manservant?
- Nope.

67
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,960
You lost him.

68
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,400
- What can one old butler do?
- Well, that's not the point.

69
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,800
The point is your lackadaisical
attitude.

70
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,920
- We're building an empire now.
- Getting nervous, are we?

71
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,280
Your childishness is no longer funny.
You need to grow up.

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh, please, pull the stick out,
big shot.

73
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,000
Like I don't know you from way back.

74
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Don't.

75
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
Without all of this wealth and power,
what are you?

76
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,000
- A sad little...
- I said, don't.

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,600
Uncle Theo?

78
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,600
Yes, my dear.

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,920
- What is it?
- I'm fighting off a cold.

80
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,960
I was thinking
I'd go to bed early tonight

81
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
if it's okay to miss out on...

82
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
the ceremony?

83
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,720
A cold?

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
Really?

85
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm beginning to wonder, Silver,

86
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,840
if you're cut up
to the task ahead of us.

87
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
I am.

88
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,240
Bruce Wayne bested you.

89
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,440
And yet you still feel for him.
He should be nothing to you.

90
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,920
He is. He's nothing to me.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,320
But you can't watch him die. Can you.

92
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
You're soft, Silver.
You have compassion.

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
No.

94
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
No?

95
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's see, shall we?

96
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm going to give you a test.

97
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,040
Anything.

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,000
Make Bruce Wayne fall in love
with you all over again.

99
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,280
I want to see him kiss you
before he dies.

100
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,840
But he knows.

101
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,360
He knows what I am now. He hates me.

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Well, that's what makes it a test.

103
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,920
If you're guileful enough
to win back his heart

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,200
and cruel enough
to smile at his killing,

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
then I'll know you're worthy
of the family name.

106
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,880
Brother, seriously.

107
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,080
- Cut the poor kid some slack.
- More from you? Really?

108
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
Isn't there some other way?

109
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,280
Oh, my dear.

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,240
I like you very much
but family interests come first.

111
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,720
And there are other girls
of the Dumas blood I could turn to,

112
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,080
should you fail to prove your mettle.
Understand?

113
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Do you?

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,680
My charming brother,
he will throw you out on the street.

115
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,520
If he's kind enough not to kill you.

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,760
Well, let's not dwell
on the negative.

117
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
You can do it. I know you can.
Be resourceful, be ruthless.

118
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
Why don't you get yourself
something pretty to put on.

119
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,520
Hey.

120
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,520
Why are you here?

121
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,120
I wanted to say...

122
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm really, really sorry
for what's happened...

123
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,040
and I'm sorry
that I had to lie to you.

124
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,640
I had to do what my uncle said.

125
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,200
But I think you're a good person...

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,040
and if I could help you I would.

127
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,520
But I can't and I'm sorry.

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,360
And I thought maybe you would
like some company.

129
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,520
But if you don't, that's fine.

130
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,320
- I'll go.
- Yes.

131
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,480
Please go.

132
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
You really hate me.

133
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
I have no feelings for you
whatsoever.

134
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Well, I like you.

135
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,040
And I'm sorry.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,240
That's all.

137
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,240
You can stay, if you like.

138
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,480
Excuse me, stop, stop, stop!

139
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,840
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop!

140
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,240
Excuse me, sir.

141
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,480
Oh, what you're crazy something?

142
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,520
Stop! Wait!

143
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
- Look, I have to get to work!
- Don't hurt me!

144
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm most terribly sorry, sir.
I'm in a most frightful hurry.

145
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
- Freeze!
- Oh, officer, I'm just gonna take...

146
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,520
Captain, what the hell?
You've put out a warrant on Jim?

147
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
- Armed and dangerous?
- That's right.

148
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,360
He's not a criminal.

149
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,800
He was obviously
abducted or something.

150
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,920
Look, I hope you're right.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,120
But the facts on the ground
don't look that way.

152
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
He assaulted the mayor and escaped
GCPD custody with Penguin.

153
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,240
Two good cops died.
And now he's a fugitive.

154
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,520
What would you call that,
if not criminal?

155
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,760
- Galavan is obviously...
- Galavan is innocent

156
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,360
until proven otherwise.

157
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
If Jim isn't dirty,
I need to hear that from him.

158
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,400
Where is he?

159
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,520
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

160
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,480
Do you know how long
he's been working with Penguin?

161
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,400
He's not working with Penguin.
And he's not dirty.

162
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
And I resent being
questioned like this.

163
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
Stop it. You're his girlfriend.

164
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
You know I have to ask you
these questions.

165
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm gonna ask you again
if you know where he is

166
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
because if you do
and you don't tell me

167
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
that makes you an accomplice
after the fact.

168
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,840
I don't know where he is.

169
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,160
I don't like this any more
than you do.

170
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,640
Jim is like a son to me.

171
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,320
A father would have shown more faith.

172
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
Are you sure you know Jim
as well as you think you do?

173
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Is your lover man alive,
go to Grundy, 8:05.

174
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,880
Will you please talk to me?

175
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,840
Silence makes me sad.

176
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
Talk about what?

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,320
It doesn't matter.

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
Anything.

179
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,640
Top ten lists, best vacations.

180
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,560
What's your favorite animal?

181
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,680
- Owls.
- Owls.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,560
Owls are okay.

183
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,200
Owls are cool.

184
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,240
Did you ever swim with a dolphin?

185
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,920
- No.
- I did once.

186
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,240
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,160
It was magical.
It was like we were friends.

188
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,400
They have this power.
They can like, read your mind.

189
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,560
- No, they can't.
- No, they can.

190
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,280
They can see your brainwaves.

191
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,640
They have a form of sonars
so they can see inside you

192
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,800
and detect tumours,
that sort of thing.

193
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,960
But they can't read minds.

194
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,480
Well, the one I met
could read my mind.

195
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Lee.

196
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,400
- What the hell are you doing?
- I need to get you out of town.

197
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,560
Penguin has a reliable man
who can take you upstate.

198
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,840
Things are gonna be unsettled
here for a while.

199
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,240
- Unsettled?
- We're gonna take down Galavan.

200
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,280
Are you out of your mind?

201
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
Miss Thompkins, I can assure you...

202
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,120
- He has to be stopped, Lee.
- By you?

203
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,600
- And these people?
- He has to be stopped.

204
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
You keep trying to kill yourself.

205
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,680
Have I got you all wrong?
Are you just crazy?

206
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
- Of course not.
- You're on the run from the law.

207
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,720
You wanna attack the mayor with
the help of a depraved sociopath.

208
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,840
That's not crazy?

209
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,960
- I can hear you.
- Don't speak.

210
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,360
Jim, don't do this.
Let's get out of town together.

211
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,880
I don't care
what you've done already

212
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,680
or what you have to leave undone.
Let's just go.

213
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,400
- I can't.
- Jim, please.

214
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,800
I can't.
I can't let Galavan win this way.

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm pregnant.

216
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
There were silver white roses

217
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,640
and red lilies all over the house.

218
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,800
All of my friends were there.

219
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,640
There was music, dancing...

220
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,480
and my mom made a cake with
my name spelled out in chocolate.

221
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,600
That was the year before she died.

222
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,920
She looked so beautiful and happy.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,080
So yeah...

224
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,120
that's my favorite memory.

225
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
My ninth birthday.

226
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,560
How about you?

227
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,480
I don't know.

228
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,640
Come on, you must have one.

229
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,320
So your parents really are dead,
are they?

230
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,480
Yeah.

231
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,200
I wasn't lying about that.

232
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,360
Hey...

234
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,880
that's show business.

235
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,240
We went camping once in a forest.

236
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,960
My father and I climbed
an oak tree and ate oranges.

237
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,680
We could hear my mom singing
to herself while she built a fire.

238
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,520
That was a good day.

239
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,520
Damn it.

240
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,400
Damn it. I can't do this.

241
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,160
I can't let you die.

242
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
That's good of you to say so
but is it up to you?

243
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
If we can get out of the cell
and past the guard,

244
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,160
I know a back stairwell
that isn't watched.

245
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,040
That's a big if.
What are you going to do?

246
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,040
I am a Dumas.
I have some pull around here.

247
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,200
Open up.

248
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Come in.

249
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,120
Give me your gun.

250
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,200
Come on.

251
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,680
Oh, you silly girl.
What were you thinking?

252
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
Bruce and Alfred have been gone
for at least 12 hours.

253
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm afraid they've been abducted.

254
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,560
We're very busy now, Mr. Fox.
12 hours isn't very long.

255
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,800
I am sure that something
has happened.

256
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,760
We usually don't post missing persons

257
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,560
until they've been missing
for 24 hours.

258
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,520
But out of respect
for Wayne Enterprises.

259
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,160
Bruce Wayne. Alfred Pennyworth.
Run them through the system.

260
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,760
Thank you.

261
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,400
Was there any evidence
of an abduction?

262
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,520
There was a lamp stand knocked over
and there was a window opened.

263
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,920
Who do you think abducted them?

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,280
Well, Theo Galavan
is the obvious suspect.

265
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,560
You have any proof of that?

266
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,480
- Threats made? Physical evidence?
- No, but it's obvious.

267
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,120
He's trying to take over the company.

268
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
Captain, we know the man's dirty.

269
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,160
Of course, we know he's dirty.

270
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,240
We know the names of every dirty
crook in Gotham, so what?

271
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Proof, Bullock. Proof.

272
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,760
To get a warrant against Galavan,

273
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,760
we need proof of a crime
and proof that he's involved.

274
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,080
Speak.

275
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Where's Master Bruce?

276
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,160
We were hoping you knew.

277
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,360
I was in process
of commandeering a vehicle

278
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,960
when two of your idiot
cozzers shot me straight

279
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,880
in the bloody face with a stun gun.

280
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,000
- Here I am.
- There's your warrant, captain.

281
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Where?

282
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
He was assaulted
on Galavan's property

283
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,560
by known associates of Galavan.

284
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,280
While trespassing in Galavan's Tower,

285
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,520
he was lawfully pursued
off the property

286
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,680
by the rightful occupants.

287
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,800
You got nothing there.

288
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Galavan's got Bruce Wayne, boss,
sure as eggs.

289
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Give me real proof.

290
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,920
We already jumped the gun once
with Galavan and we got screwed.

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,280
Without solid proof,
no judge is gonna sign a warrant.

292
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,640
Eggs or no eggs.

293
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,480
- So, what do you propose we do?
- You hang tight.

294
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,360
We'll dig up some health
and safety issue,

295
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,880
get a backdoor warrant
for Galavan Tower.

296
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,400
Right, so how long
is that gonna take?

297
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
Probably until tomorrow morning.

298
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,640
- But...
- That's the best we can do.

299
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,840
Oh, and you're free to go.
We'll drop your charges.

300
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,760
Right, I'm gonna thank you
very much indeed.

301
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,920
But Bullock, I'm gonna need
some clean bandages,

302
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm gonna need a car
and a couple of guns.

303
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
You got it.

304
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,760
- What are you going to do?
- I've got no choice.

305
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,680
No time.

306
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,240
- I've gotta go visiting.
- I'll come with you.

307
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,560
Are two men enough?
It wouldn't seem so,

308
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
but violence is not my metier.

309
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,000
No. Two men are not enough.

310
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,160
I would gladly join you,

311
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,360
but I imagine an amateur is no asset,
a hindrance perhaps.

312
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,560
That's very true.

313
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,360
Where is Jim Gordon?

314
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
He's perfect for this kind of thing.

315
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,960
- Where is he?
- Yeah. "Where is Jim Gordon?"

316
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,800
It's a long story
but nobody knows.

317
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,520
- Something funny, Ed?
- Do you know where Gordon is?

318
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
Do you?

319
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,200
Start speaking, Winters.

320
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,680
A diamond plate, a glowing grate,
a place you never leave. Where am I?

321
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,720
- What?
- Home.

322
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,640
Whose home? Your home?

323
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,120
Gordon's at your home?

324
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,880
No. Yes.

325
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,920
Who are you?

326
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,320
Good luck, old friend.

327
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,720
- See you around.
- I hope not.

328
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,920
- Goodbye, Penguin.
- Goodbye, Miss Thompkins.

329
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,960
Please don't think too badly of me.
We are what we are.

330
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,560
That's true. Goodbye, Mr. Cobblepot.

331
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,640
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

332
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,120
Wait here.

333
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,720
Galavan has Bruce.

334
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,040
I understand.

335
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,240
- Just promise me...
- What?

336
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,600
Never mind.
Do what you think is best.

337
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,880
Call me when it's over.

338
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm so terrible.

339
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,960
No, you don't.

340
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
Thank you.

341
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,520
You're so calm.

342
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,960
- It's like you're not scared.
- I guess I'm not.

343
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,720
It's weird.

344
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,680
You are weird.

345
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,640
But I love you.

346
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
- Do you?
- I do.

347
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
Do you love me?

348
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,200
No.

349
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,400
No?

350
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Silver, I don't know
why you're doing it,

351
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,280
but I know you're playing with me.

352
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
I know that whole escape
was a ghoulish charade.

353
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,240
That's a horrible lie.

354
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,760
I'm only telling you this
because when I'm dead...

355
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,880
you may feel bad and I don't want
you to think you tricked me.

356
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,720
So far, I don't love you.

357
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,800
I pity you.

358
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,800
Why did you do this?

359
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,640
What's the point?

360
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,160
Uncle Theo made me.

361
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,600
He said if I can't make you
love me again...

362
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,080
if you don't kiss me goodbye,

363
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,080
then I'm not good enough
for the family.

364
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,560
He's going to kick me out.

365
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,800
Or kill me.

366
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,680
Same thing, really.

367
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,680
- I see.
- God, I'm such a loser.

368
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,240
- An evil pathetic loser.
- You're not.

369
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,920
You're young and scared
and under the control of bad people.

370
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,600
You can change.

371
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,080
There's hope.

372
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,320
You can't even imagine
the things I've done.

373
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,160
There's no hope.

374
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,360
There's no going back to normal life.

375
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,920
My family is all I have.

376
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,920
And now I've lost them too.

377
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,120
All right, everybody set? Let's go.

378
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,240
What's the plan?

379
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,640
Get into that building, find Galavan

380
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
put a gun in his mouth
until he gives up Bruce.

381
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,720
- Then I kill him slowly.
- No. Then we arrest him.

382
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,680
Yeah, no.

383
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,320
Are you nuts?

384
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,920
- After all that he has done?
- He's going to stand trial.

385
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
Gotham needs to know
who he really is.

386
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,920
- Gotham needs him dead!
- Rub it, rub it, rub it.

387
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,440
Can we just stop the bunny and just
first get in there, please, chaps?

388
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,200
- Yes, let's go.
- Seriously that's it?

389
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,360
You have no plan?

390
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
How are you even
going to get into the building?

391
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,760
I know a way.

392
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,840
- Who is she?
- Fox, that's Cat. Cat, Fox.

393
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,680
- You know a way in?
- Yeah, I know a way in, Gordon.

394
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,920
How do we know
you're not gonna stitch us up?

395
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,560
I mean, you've switched sides
often enough.

396
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
How do we know that you're not
working with Galavan?

397
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,840
How do I know you're not
a Martian in a rubber suit?

398
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,040
I trust her.

399
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
You're in, Cat. Thanks for your help.

400
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,800
Grab a vest, let's go.

401
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,480
People, surely we should
have a backup strategy,

402
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,600
given the strong
possibilities of failure.

403
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,960
<i>Au contraire</i>, Mr. Fox.

404
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
Failure is not an option.

405
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,720
What he said.

406
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,360
As you like.

407
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,280
Stop acting like you're not scared.

408
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,560
I know you are.

409
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
Sure.

410
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,080
Maybe a little but...

411
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,000
mostly I feel very alive.

412
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,480
Happy even.

413
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
I'm going to see my parents.

414
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Hold that thought.

415
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,360
Show time.

416
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,360
One moment, please.

417
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,320
Goodbye, Silver.

418
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,080
I love you, and I forgive you.

419
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,080
Hey, Bravo.

420
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
Come on in.

421
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,640
Oh, for Pete's sake.

422
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,840
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.
Death to the son of Gotham.</i>

423
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,520
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.
Death to the son of Gotham.</i>

424
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,840
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.

425

426
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,920
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.

427
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,000
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.</i>

428
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,160
- What in hell is that?
- Nothing good.

429
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,640
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.</i>

430
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,680
- I'll be right there.
- <i>Death to the son of Gotham.</i>

431
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,600
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,600
<i>Death to the son of Gotham.</i>

434
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,800
Prepare yourself, boy.

435
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,760
You're a deluded old fool.

436
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,280
And you'll pay for this.

437
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,400
Ancestors, be our witness!

438
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,080
- The prophesy is fulfilled.
- Stop!

439
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,160
Please?

440
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,120
Sacrilege.

441
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,000
Listen to me, Barry.
Hold on just a moment.

442
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,600
All right, Mr. Fox, make it quick.
What do you got?

443
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,040
I have the current location
of James Gordon.

444
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,360
I'll call you back.

445
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,360
Drop the knife, old man. It's over.

446
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,240
So it would seem.

447
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
That was a lot of stairs.

448
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,280
Are you alright?

449
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,440
Where's Galavan?

450
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,880
The only way out of here now
is straight down.

451
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,600
There's only two of them.

452
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,720
Yeah.

453
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,640
Silver isn't coming.

454
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,480
I just wanted to take a moment,
sweetheart

455
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,480
to express my deep disappointment.

456
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,840
- Theo, Leave her be.
- Silence!

457
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,120
Bite me.

458
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,640
What... what are you doing?

459
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,360
I don't know who you are anymore.

460
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,920
Oh, please,
that's such a ridiculous cliché.

461
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,120
Forget it, brother. You lost.

462
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,840
It's time for me to look out
for number one.

463
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,120
Sorry.

464
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,320
Tabitha!

465
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,080
Theo Galavan.

466
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,600
You're under arrest.

467
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,360
Oh, God.

468
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,000
You scared me, man, I thought
you were gonna shoot me.

469
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,040
Cuff yourself.

470
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,360
Thank goodness for simple
men of principle...

471
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,800
who believe in the system.

472
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,000
This time you'll get the chair.

473
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,480
You want to make a bet?

474
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,840
- Maybe you're right.
- Steady now, Jim.

475
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,800
I was just talking big,
as they say I am.

476
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,160
- You got me fair and square.
- Had you that way the last time.

477
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,440
And you turned it around.

478
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Jim!

479
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,680
Back up!

480
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,480
I got him. Back up, I said!

481
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,960
And you, on your knees.

482
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,160
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

483
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Jim.

484
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,880
Now you put your gun on the ground.
Put your hands on top of your head.

485
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,080
- What?
- You heard me.

486
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
- You're still a fugitive.
- Captain, I've done nothing wrong.

487
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,880
I want to believe you, Jim,
so we're gonna do this by the book.

488
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,000
Put your gun on the ground
and let's handle this the right way.

489
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,680
You're making a mistake.

490
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,400
Nobody shoot.
We are all friends here.

491
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,920
- Like hell, we are.
- I apologize for that.

492
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,280
But there we are. It's done now.

493
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,880
They're still alive.
That's something.

494
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,080
Look forward now, Jim. What now?

495
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,000
I will kill you to get to him
if I have to.

496
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,480
Forget that this man
sicced Barbara Kean on you.

497
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,240
Forget that he nearly killed
the mother of your child.

498
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,800
Forget revenge.
Think of the greater good.

499
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,760
Think of Gotham.

500
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,200
He has the courts in his pocket

501
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,400
and billions of dollars
at his command.

502
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
Are you 100 percent sure
that he won't beat this

503
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,440
and walk free again?

504
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,000
Are you sure, Jim?

505
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,000
Think of Gotham.

506
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,600
Captain Bravo. Team Bravo, moving in.
Entry in 10.

507
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,200
But think fast.

508
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,560
I do believe, Master Bruce,

509
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,400
this falls very firmly into
the category of "I told you so."

510
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,400
I told him so too, Alfred.

511
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,880
Yes, well, thank you both
for your help.

512
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,000
But I had a perfectly feasible
escape plan.

513
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,440
You're a man of conscience, Jim.
You'll regret this.

514
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,400
I have many regrets.
This won't be top of the list.

515
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
Here we are.

516
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,360
Shame.

517
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,560
It's gonna be a beautiful morning.

518
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,000
Goodbye, Jim Gordon.

519
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,440
This is for my mother.

520
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,600
Kill me. Please.

521
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,640
Enough! That's enough.

522
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,920
It's over.

523
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,040
- Is it?
- Yes.

524
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,440
Good.

525
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,960
Will you marry me?

526
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,560
Here you go, Ms. Peabody.

527
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,880
- Fresh meat from the city morgue.
- Show some respect

528
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,920
Doctor Strange has high hopes
for this one.

529
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,400
That's unusual.
