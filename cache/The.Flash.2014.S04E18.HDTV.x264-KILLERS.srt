1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,376
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,929
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:05,130
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,140
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,509
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:10,093
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:12,054
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,289
like me.

9
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,140
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:16,876
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,912
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,304
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:23,796
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,617
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:28,867
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,187
So, one more bus meta out there.

17
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,671
Edwin Gauss. You better
find him before DeVoe does.

18
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:34,374
This is an intelligence booster.

19
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:36,773
You're talking about intense
amounts of dark energy

20
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,257
going right into that cap.

21
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,707
I'm gonna help you
finish the Thinking Cap,

22
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,500
- without using dark matter.
- Fine.

23
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:46,383
Good evening, Dr. Wells.
How can I be of service?

24
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:47,898
Hello, Gideon.

25
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:54,739
Good old CCTA, bus number 405,

26
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:57,227
where I was gifted with pretty
much the best powers ever.

27
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:58,546
If it wasn't for this old girl,

28
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:59,849
I'd still have to leave the couch

29
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,298
when I need to use the bathroom,

30
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,566
you know, because I can...

31
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:03,862
Yes, I know.

32
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,613
All right, this might be our last chance

33
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:07,249
to find any clues on the final bus meta

34
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:08,402
before DeVoe catches him.

35
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,139
Yeah, and we know what happens next.

36
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:12,209
What do we know about this meta?

37
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,511
Other than his name,
Edwin Gauss, nothing.

38
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,080
It's like he disappeared.

39
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:17,514
Well, that explains the brand new,

40
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:19,516
beepy, flashy "schmience" thingies.

41
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:20,985
Yeah, Cisco designed these scanners

42
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:22,519
to look for dark matter anomalies,

43
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:24,143
so anything that looks weird, all right?

44
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:26,226
Waves, ripples, whatever,

45
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,192
log it.

46
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:29,393
Ho...

47
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,061
- I got something.
- What?

48
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,563
My Big Belly punch card.

49
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:34,732
I'm only five away
from a free kids meal,

50
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,453
if I even long enough to use it.

51
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:37,808
Man, don't even joke like that.

52
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,770
We're gonna get DeVoe,
throw him in The Pipeline,

53
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:41,071
long before he gets to you.

54
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:42,873
Right. If that doesn't work,

55
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,675
we'll just, uh, take
him out the other way.

56
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:45,737
What other way?

57
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,311
Eh, we'll put him down with a shovel,

58
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,604
give him his harp and wings,

59
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:51,975
send him to visit Grandma
Thinker in the sky.

60
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,479
Ralph, you think we're gonna kill DeVoe?

61
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:57,275
The way that you're saying that

62
00:01:57,278 --> 00:02:00,012
makes me think I'm supposed to say no.

63
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,748
Okay, look...

64
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:04,428
I've taught you a lot
about being a hero, right?

65
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,432
You ready for what's probably
the most important lesson?

66
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:10,378
We never have to kill.

67
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,933
For people with our abilities,

68
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,837
there's just always another way.

69
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,840
You understand?

70
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:19,487
Han, you complete me.

71
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,924
- Bring it in, man. Come on.
- Uh, I'm good.

72
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:22,812
Just a little bit.
Give me some, come on.

73
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,276
Okay.

74
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,944
What's this?

75
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,659
Wait a second...

76
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:33,695
I talked to the guy
who was sitting there.

77
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:36,199
I remember, 'cause I paid his fare.

78
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,763
Uh... uh-oh.

79
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,500
I think I may have left my
wallet in my other pants.

80
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,159
Look, buddy, you either pay the fare

81
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:46,261
or you hit the sidewalk.

82
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:49,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mr. bus driver dude,

83
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:52,831
allow me to pay his fare.

84
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,178
Who are we to be the gatekeepers

85
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:59,183
of whatever path this
fellow traveler is on?

86
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,617
Have a seat.

87
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,022
Uh, thanks.

88
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,790
Oh, namaste, hermano.

89
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,792
Namaste in the back of the bus.

90
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:12,496
Funny fat dude.

91
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,839
This is crazy.

92
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:16,566
His residual dark matter reads
as if he was here one second,

93
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,569
and the next, vanished.

94
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,073
It's Harry.

95
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,537
He wants us back at S.T.A.R. Labs.

96
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,581
Says he has something
important to show everyone.

97
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:28,918
Well... now so do we.

98
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,675
Yeah. All right, come on.

99
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,297
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

100
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,159
That's the big news?

101
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:41,417
You're taking a sculpture
class at the community college?

102
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,860
It's not art. It's science!

103
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,662
And as such...

104
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:48,398
it is the thing that is
gonna help us defeat...

105
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,585
DeVoe.

106
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:53,021
Recall, if you will, the one thing

107
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,823
that we've seen... nay, heard...

108
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,741
That can actually harm DeVoe.

109
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,176
Izzy Bowin's soundwave powers.

110
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,380
Well, Izzy was killed by DeVoe,

111
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,478
so whatever powers she
had is in his hands now.

112
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:05,315
And now, Joe...

113
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:07,217
they're in ours.

114
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,719
Watch this.

115
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,121
So...

116
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:13,056
Actually, maybe you should...

117
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,526
take a couple steps back if
you value your internal organs.

118
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,604
I know how that feels.

119
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,975
One strike incapacitates The Thinker.

120
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:34,444
Two strikes, no more Thinker.

121
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:37,089
I call it a Sonic Scepter.

122
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,726
Okay.

123
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,295
Points for alliteration.

124
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,878
Basically just a big tuning fork.

125
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,950
My goodness.

126
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,286
Well, like, I mean, it's
not just any tuning fork.

127
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,854
This might be the most powerful
tuning fork in the multiverse.

128
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,323
You must've laser-shaved this thing

129
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,501
- down to the nanometer.
- Shaved it right down

130
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:53,970
to the last angstrom,
as a matter of fact.

131
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:55,995
Child's play for me and my Thinking Cap.

132
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:58,527
The Sonic Scepter mimics Izzy
Bowin's sonic frequencies,

133
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,507
so we can penetrate

134
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,511
a heretofore impenetrable
force field of DeVoe.

135
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:03,813
And here's the best part.

136
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,249
Because there's no tech involved...

137
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:07,542
- It's Kilgore-proof. Nice.
- Yes.

138
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:09,011
So, now we just need to figure out

139
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:10,457
where DeVoe is gonna appear next.

140
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,193
As a matter of fact,
before you got here...

141
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,629
I scripted a subroutine

142
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,112
on the pocket dimension predictor,

143
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,870
and it's gonna give us
a massive head start.

144
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,948
DeVoe's next location, thank you.

145
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,852
Yesterday, I thought you
said that wasn't possible.

146
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,261
That's right, Snow, I
did say that yesterday,

147
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,847
but today... is a new day.

148
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,096
I've got a million new ideas.

149
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,039
The cap and I, we're......

150
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,509
Firing on all cylinders.

151
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,879
Onward and upward.

152
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,300
Okay, let's get to it.

153
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,710
Cisco, can you integrate
Harry's algorithm

154
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:42,813
- into the predictor?
- Can do.

155
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:43,981
Okay.

156
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:49,060
Hey...

157
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:52,808
Harry's really loving
that Thinking Cap, huh?

158
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,079
Oh, my God. It's like the
best friend he never had.

159
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,915
I mean, he wears this thing everywhere.

160
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:59,885
I'm pretty sure I saw him
step out of the shower with it.

161
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,421
I want to know what kinda problem

162
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:03,799
he was trying to solve in there.

163
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:05,401
Nope.

164
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,706
Nope, I... I don't wanna know.

165
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:16,764
- What are you working on?
- My brain, or brains.

166
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,832
I think I finally figured
out the science behind

167
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,400
what activates Killer Frost.

168
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:21,881
So, in fight-or-flight,

169
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:24,440
the adrenal glands flood
the body with catecholamines,

170
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:26,081
uh, AKA the stress hormone,

171
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,308
and guess where the highest
concentration of dark matter is

172
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,862
in my body?

173
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,698
- In your adrenal glands.
- Exactly.

174
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,514
So if adrenaline is what
activates Killer Frost,

175
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,823
- then all I need...
- Is a shot of epinephrine.

176
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,989
No more Harry and Cisco traumatizing me

177
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,687
to get Killer Frost to show up.

178
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,589
I can't wait to tell her.

179
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:45,092
- Wait, you guys talk now?
- Sort of.

180
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,034
Uh, we leave each other notes.

181
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:49,371
Um...

182
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,374
"Thanks for the badass new jacket.

183
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,604
"I got some blood on it.

184
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:54,767
Don't worry, it's not ours."

185
00:06:57,206 --> 00:07:00,040
I guess her humor is
sort of an acquired taste.

186
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:02,589
Uh-oh.

187
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,158
Pocket dimension's about to open.

188
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:06,445
It's DeVoe. Get that pen ready.

189
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,687
Okay, stay ready.

190
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,784
Edwin Gauss?

191
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,125
What...

192
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,757
All right, guys, say hello
to our last known bus meta,

193
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,762
Edwin Gauss.

194
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,065
As we know, there's not much on him.

195
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,103
No college history, no known addresses.

196
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,531
Just a couple of backpacking
photos on an old message board.

197
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,525
Old? Flip phones are old.

198
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,129
This site is from the age of dial up.

199
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:02,748
Try prehistoric. No digital fingerprint.

200
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,345
Everything this guy owns
is strapped to his back.

201
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,709
He was off-grid before
he was even a meta.

202
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,812
That, and his powers are the
reason we couldn't find him.

203
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,914
And why there were 12
heat signatures on the bus,

204
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,382
including the driver.

205
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:16,384
Cisco, the way he
appeared and disappeared...

206
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:17,619
Pocket dimension.

207
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,554
What? Like... Like the DeVoe kind?

208
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,080
No, like the Edwin Gauss kind.

209
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,884
You see, pocket dimensions,
like the one you see here,

210
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,704
are unique to their users.

211
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,775
Just like DeVoe can
only enter or exit his,

212
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:33,128
Gauss too is limited to
his own pocket dimension.

213
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,520
So why does DeVoe need him?

214
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:37,790
Well, DeVoe uses his chair
to create pocket dimensions.

215
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:40,769
If he has Edwin Gauss's powers,
he won't need it anymore.

216
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,471
Then we need to catch Gauss first.

217
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:43,806
And we will.

218
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,474
Little late. Just tweaking the cap.

219
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:47,409
Now, listen, locating this meta

220
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,877
is not a task that
we have to accomplish.

221
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,580
Why is that, Harry? I'll tell you why.

222
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,549
It's because we already... have.

223
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,484
Yeah, this is the map
that we constructed:

224
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:56,799
Of all the pocket dimension activity

225
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:57,920
throughout Central City.

226
00:08:57,922 --> 00:08:59,165
Right, but that's when we thought

227
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,749
all the pocket dimensions
belonged to DeVoe.

228
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,224
Now we don't know whether
they belong to him or to Gauss.

229
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:05,027
And figuring out those distinctions,

230
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,696
I'm sorry, but that's too big
even for your britches, Harry.

231
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:09,531
My britches are plenty big, okay?

232
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,751
I fill my britches. Watch this, okay?

233
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:14,370
By simply tracking the
two lanes of identifiers,

234
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,822
cross-referencing the, uh,
fluctuation migration patterns

235
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:20,137
and the temporal displacement
in the energy app, and...

236
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,759
I give you Edwin Gauss's

237
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,813
pocket dimension activity.

238
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,111
"Ahhh, Harry.

239
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,552
Harry is amazing."

240
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,454
Yeah, let's all just split up

241
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,361
and search each one for Edwin Gauss.

242
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,125
Barry, you take Caitlin and Ralph,

243
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,693
and I'll go with Cisco and my dad.

244
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:38,779
- Harry...
- I'll go with you.

245
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,349
No, I was thinking
that you could just...

246
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,025
You would stay here
and hold down the fort.

247
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:43,794
Okay, I'll tweak the cap.

248
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,610
Detective, are you... Are
you not going after Gauss?

249
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:55,788
I'm on my way out.

250
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,252
I just wanted to see
if you needed anything

251
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:58,820
before we left.

252
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:00,856
- If I need... no, I'm good.
- Hm.

253
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:03,226
Holding that Thinking Cap real close.

254
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,763
Well, you never know
when you might need it.

255
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,087
Yeah, and you only need it

256
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,457
for DeVoe-related problems, right?

257
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,692
DeVoe-related problems,
science problems,

258
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,795
making-the-perfect-omelet problems.

259
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,329
You make omelets with that cap?

260
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,799
Oh, yeah. Pretty darn good omelet.

261
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:20,502
I bet. Hey... do you
mind if I borrow the cap?

262
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:22,604
No, I don't think so. Not a good idea.

263
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,506
Why not? It seems pretty easy to use.

264
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,041
Detective, this easy-to-use thing

265
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,110
is actually a delicate
scientific instrument

266
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:30,212
that directly alters the
brain wave of the user,

267
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,171
- so I don't think so.
- Mm.

268
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,249
- So it's dangerous?
- Yeah, it's very dangerous.

269
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:37,453
And yet you risk using
it to make breakfast?

270
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:43,811
All right.

271
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,381
Okay, you're good,
Detective. You're very good.

272
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,265
How much do you wear that cap?

273
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:50,065
I'm not overusing it, if
that's what you're asking.

274
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,700
Overusing is one way of putting it.

275
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:54,679
- Addiction is another.
- I'm not addicted to...

276
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:59,073
Your concerns are well-founded.
Ramon had the same concerns.

277
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,742
I told him, promised him

278
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,835
I would not use this Thinking Cap...

279
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,217
with dark matter.

280
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,006
Hm. And that's a promise you kept?

281
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:08,374
Yes.

282
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,070
All right, I don't mean to be paranoid.

283
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:11,772
I'm...

284
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,943
Sometimes, it's just hard
to turn off the cop brain.

285
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:18,299
I get it. No worries.

286
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,969
Good luck finding Gauss.

287
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,755
Iris...

288
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,158
where are we?

289
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,023
Looks like some sort of hippie commune.

290
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:46,552
Yeah, smells like one too.

291
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,288
Guys, I think I figured
out DeVoe's plan.

292
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,765
He means to suffocate
us with BO and incense.

293
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:52,906
Okay, well, this is the
last pocket dimension hotspot

294
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,537
on our list, so just...
Do you see Gauss anywhere?

295
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,873
Uh...

296
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,842
Unwashed flower child,

297
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,844
have you seen this man?

298
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,846
- Nope...
- Hm.

299
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:08,716
I've seen the soul that
belongs to this man.

300
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,863
The dude's aura is a trip.

301
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,654
Wait, so, you know Edwin Gauss?

302
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:14,355
Sure do.

303
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:18,960
'Round here, we call
him... the folded man.

304
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:22,130
- Folded man?
- He's everywhere...

305
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,233
and nowhere...

306
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,635
but mostly, he's around here.

307
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,981
Time for the reflection hike, everyone!

308
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:33,575
Don't forget to leash
your spirit animals!

309
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,777
Literally already smells better.

310
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,346
Okay, let's just search for Gauss.

311
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,081
Uh, stay in touch over the comms.

312
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,942
Yeah, I will leash my
inner-penguin spirit animal

313
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,019
and head south.

314
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,754
Be careful.

315
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:48,490
Don't touch anybody.

316
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:53,287
Okay, remember, if we find Gauss first,

317
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,457
we might be able to put
an end to DeVoe's plans.

318
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,835
- Speaking of ending DeVoe...
- Not what I said.

319
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:58,861
Allen, I'm just saying,

320
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:00,434
DeVoe's been ahead of us at every turn.

321
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:02,470
His backup plans have backup plans.

322
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:04,606
On the off chance that
we can't capture him,

323
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,107
shouldn't we be willing
to do whatever it takes?

324
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:06,911
We know that he is.

325
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:08,577
I am willing to do whatever it takes,

326
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,544
except kill DeVoe.

327
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:12,684
- Even in self-defense?
- It's not self-defense

328
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:14,207
if you're already thinking about it.

329
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,384
Look, I...

330
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,809
I've been down this road.
I know you're scared.

331
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,285
I understand the temptation,

332
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,490
but you have to hear me when I say

333
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,892
there's always another way.

334
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:30,431
I really hope you're right, rookie.

335
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,634
Guys, I got eyes on Gauss!

336
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:35,537
He's fast for a non-speedster!

337
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,139
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

338
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,642
Easy, narcs. Hey...

339
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:43,144
- I give up.
- We're not cops.

340
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,246
But you are in danger.
We're here to protect you.

341
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:47,482
Oh... righteous.

342
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,884
Is that why you're... why
you brought your ninja buddy?

343
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:50,919
What?

344
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:04,531
- Caitlin!
- Meet us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

345
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:07,621
You can't stop me, Mr. Dibny.

346
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:10,271
I will cut through all of Team Flash

347
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:11,903
to get what I want.

348
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,495
Are you sure you're okay?

349
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:19,079
Yeah, I mean, the wound started healing

350
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,426
before I even woke up.

351
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,196
You frosted out for a
sec when we got here.

352
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,552
- It probably helped.
- Yeah.

353
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,954
Hey, uh, shouldn't you rest?

354
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:28,488
Honestly, I'm fine.

355
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,758
If anything, this has just made me

356
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,324
more determined to get DeVoe.

357
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,455
I'm gonna go help Cisco

358
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,194
with that pocket dimension predictor.

359
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,860
Well, it could've gone worse.

360
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:41,207
Yeah, all things considered,
we got pretty lucky.

361
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,845
- Yeah.
- Lucky? Are you two serious?

362
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,408
Am I the only one who's
paying any attention here?

363
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,610
Ralph, the mission was successful.

364
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,813
Caitlin's okay, and Edwin
agreed to stay in The Pipeline.

365
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:55,249
- Edwin will be safe in there.
- Safe?

366
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,683
Because DeVoe's never
successfully attacked metas

367
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:59,754
in a maximum security facility before.

368
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:02,056
Oh, wait, he did exactly that.

369
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:04,325
- Watch it, Ralph.
- I have been watching.

370
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,227
Watching DeVoe ahead
of us at every turn,

371
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,762
watching Caitlin get skewered,

372
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:10,407
watching the metas drop
like flies, one by one,

373
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,333
because we can't save them.

374
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,869
And why? Because we
won't make the tough call

375
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,570
and end DeVoe when we get the chance.

376
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:18,105
Look, I'm not doing this again.

377
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,407
Okay, Ralph, I get
where you're coming from,

378
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,877
but that is not the tough
call, that is the wrong one.

379
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,902
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. S.T.A.R. Labs agree.

380
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,519
I swear if I was running this team...

381
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,972
- But you're not.
- Okay, all right.

382
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,751
That's enough. We don't
have time for this, okay?

383
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:33,387
We need to focus and
stick to the game plan.

384
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,189
Find DeVoe, hit him with the scepter,

385
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:36,423
and put him in The Pipeline.

386
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:37,858
No one has to die.

387
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,627
Huh...

388
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,729
same plan again.

389
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:43,719
And you wonder why
he's always ahead of us.

390
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:13,761
Yo... Magnum PI.

391
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:17,430
I am digging this tiny panic room, bro.

392
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,968
It's... it's... it's like...
Like an eggshell for my body...

393
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,072
which is the eggshell for my soul...

394
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:28,134
which contains the universal myste...

395
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,024
Zesty Ranch.

396
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:33,814
Right on.

397
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:36,884
You strike me as a munchies kinda guy.

398
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:38,619
Guilty.

399
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,215
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
not actually guilty.

400
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:42,851
It's not like I'm on anything, you know?

401
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:45,491
You... you... you guys
said you aren't cops, right?

402
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,004
- Nope.
- All right.

403
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,329
But apparently we have to
follow more rules than they do.

404
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:52,954
Well, whatever rules protect
me from that evil genius dude,

405
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:54,568
I shall heed.

406
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,871
Even his name is creepy.

407
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:59,273
"The Ponderer."

408
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:01,709
It's, uh, Thinker.

409
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,301
Yeah, sure is a thinker.

410
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:04,664
Makes me think about my journey.

411
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,779
Like, first time I folded,

412
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:09,116
I was in this white
space for, like, days,

413
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:12,119
and then another time,
I tumbled down this ramp

414
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:15,569
in this space agey
room with blue lights,

415
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:18,519
and there was this bald dude
in a Professor X floaty chair,

416
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:20,694
with tubes coming out of his noggin,

417
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:22,596
and there was this... this lady

418
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,670
in a white lab coat,

419
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:27,865
with such a hot accent. Ah...

420
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,534
Wait, wait, wait, Edwin, do you remember

421
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:31,138
anything else from
there? Anything at all?

422
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,541
This is important.

423
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,644
Well, I don't know if
this detail is relevant,

424
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:39,380
but, um, they had one of
those robot samurai dudes.

425
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,349
You were in DeVoe's lair.
Wait, how can that be?

426
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:43,851
Cisco said that a pocket dimension

427
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:46,787
can only be accessed
by its specific user.

428
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,489
I mean... You know,

429
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,956
some places are harder
to get to than others,

430
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,962
but if you ascend your mind
to a high enough plane...

431
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,031
You can go anywhere.

432
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,699
And my mind is really high.

433
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:01,201
Edwin, can you get us back there?

434
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:02,803
"Fa sho."

435
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:06,662
- Come on.
- What?

436
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:08,483
I... I... I got more.

437
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,576
No, I... I got more, I got more.

438
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,027
I cannot do it

439
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,814
any faster, Captain!

440
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,683
If I apply anymore hobby glue,

441
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,751
this ship is gonna blow!

442
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,855
Wow.

443
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:23,624
This glue's really something else.

444
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,120
I should probably wear a respirator.

445
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,834
Where is it?

446
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,545
Where's what? The exit?

447
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,364
It's right behind you,
please and thank you.

448
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,037
I can't find my Thinking Cap.

449
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,038
I... hey, I don't have
it, Captain Caveman!

450
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,909
I never said you did,

451
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,177
so why would you
volunteer that information

452
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,725
unless you do have it?

453
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,501
- Get out.
- I know what this is about.

454
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:48,849
You never wanted me to build
this sucker in the first place,

455
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,551
'cause you never wanted
me to be smarter than you.

456
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:53,397
Well, guess what, that's
funny, 'cause I already am.

457
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,909
What the hell are you talking about?

458
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,365
I want you to...

459
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,300
- What the hell are you doing?
- Give me my cap!

460
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,733
- Hey! What?
- Give me my cap!

461
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,494
Give it to me. It's mine. It's my cap.

462
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:03,030
- Cut it out!
- It's mine!

463
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:05,592
Harry! He didn't take it.

464
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:10,365
I didn't take it.

465
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,358
You definitely have a problem, man.

466
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,562
- Joe, this is fine.
- No, uh, be quiet.

467
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,232
Just listen.

468
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:21,537
I've seen these signs before
with my late wife, Francine.

469
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,241
Back then, I didn't
intervene so quickly,

470
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:27,411
because I said to myself,
I needed to be sure.

471
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,181
But I was sure.

472
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,225
I just didn't wanna see those signs

473
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:34,762
in somebody I cared about.

474
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:36,363
I can't make you stop using this.

475
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:37,998
That's up to you.

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,402
All I will ask is that
you take a long, hard look

477
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:43,537
at what it's doing to you,

478
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:46,774
and how it's making you
treat people you care about.

479
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,786
Ramon...

480
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:18,472
Uh... where are we going again?

481
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,240
You're gonna open up a pocket dimension

482
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:21,475
into DeVoe's lair,

483
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,777
and I'm gonna stop him for good.

484
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,479
No, you're not.

485
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,083
Cisco installed motion detectors

486
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,617
in The Pipeline intake.

487
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:33,554
I thought it was DeVoe coming for Edwin.

488
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,055
Now I kinda wish it was.

489
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:37,037
Edwin can get me into DeVoe's lair.

490
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,591
I can end this.

491
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,294
All you have to do is let me go.

492
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,463
- I can't let you do that.
- Um...

493
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:46,066
Um, listen, I... I don't
really do confrontations,

494
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:48,467
so, uh, can I just go
back to my glass cage?

495
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,803
We're both leaving in a second.

496
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:51,638
Okay.

497
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,574
Just give me the scepter.

498
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,009
You know I can take it
away from you if I have to.

499
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:57,711
Yeah?

500
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:02,014
Well, you're gonna have
to take it out of me.

501
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,654
- Oh
- Whoa, bro.

502
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:10,057
Wow, okay, I'm actually
glad I stayed for that.

503
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,693
That was trippy.

504
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,262
- Don't do this?
- Do what?

505
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:16,463
This?

506
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,254
I'm sorry, Ralph.

507
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:02,749
Olive Branch?

508
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:08,721
You don't wanna have a
drink with your buddy?

509
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:10,590
Is that what you call
someone who just went all

510
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,592
"Thor, son of Odin" on you?

511
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:13,960
You can take it.

512
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:15,928
Yeah.

513
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:20,233
Look...

514
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,068
I know you're worried about DeVoe,

515
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,737
about what he might do to you,

516
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:27,590
but there are some lines we can't cross.

517
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:29,609
Wow...

518
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:32,078
You really don't know as much
as you think you do, rookie.

519
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,647
I know what killing
DeVoe would do to you.

520
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:36,916
You would be throwing away
everything you've done:

521
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,684
to become a better
man, to become a hero.

522
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,987
You gotta realize that.

523
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:44,757
You... are a moron.

524
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,356
- Ralph...
- I am not afraid of DeVoe

525
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,452
and what he might do to me.

526
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:52,598
I am afraid of what
he might do to you...

527
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,902
and Iris and Caitlin and Cisco,

528
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:58,971
Joe, Harry, Cecile.

529
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:02,241
DeVoe has taken out everyone
who's gotten in his way,

530
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:04,610
and Team Flash...

531
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:07,547
they will always be in his way.

532
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:12,351
This was never about
protecting yourself.

533
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:15,113
I know that killing DeVoe
would mean throwing away

534
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:17,657
everything I've done to become a hero...

535
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:22,528
But aside from my mom,

536
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,165
this team is the only
family that I have ever had,

537
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:28,501
and I would throw myself into a furnace

538
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:30,269
to keep them safe.

539
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,574
DeVoe cannot have them.

540
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,709
They are mine.

541
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:44,817
What about what we want?

542
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:47,577
You may not care about
losing who you've become,

543
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,743
but we do.

544
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,923
We like hero Ralph.

545
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,733
Please don't take him away from us.

546
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:18,050
Well, Ralph was misguided,

547
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:20,920
but... he had a half-good idea.

548
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:23,589
- Which half?
- We use Edwin Gauss's powers

549
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:25,558
to create a pocket
dimension to DeVoe's lair.

550
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,452
Yep, that's the half I was afraid of.

551
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:29,060
It doesn't get more dangerous than this,

552
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,597
so if we go, everybody
needs to sign off.

553
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,633
Look, you two have led this team

554
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,520
through every danger there is,

555
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,223
so if you think this will stop DeVoe

556
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,805
from claiming any more lives, then...

557
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,340
let's go get that bastard.

558
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:43,242
I mean, damn, Joe, when you put it

559
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:45,611
all John McClane like
that, of course I'm in.

560
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:46,663
I'm in.

561
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,147
I don't even need to ask
Killer Frost what she votes.

562
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,751
- We're in too.
- So it's settled.

563
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:55,755
Tonight, we take on The Thinker.

564
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:01,994
Open it.

565
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:04,764
You got it, mega-fast dude.

566
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,699
Open it again in 15 minutes.

567
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:09,068
If we don't come out with
DeVoe in cuffs, close it.

568
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,369
Don't open it again.

569
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,891
- It didn't work.
- Why would it?

570
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:34,727
Sound has no effect on a hologram.

571
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,364
If DeVoe's not here, then...

572
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,637
Now, my love...

573
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:47,273
the real battle begins.

574
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,398
What's happening?

575
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:05,720
Someone's taken over our
systems and sealed us in.

576
00:26:05,723 --> 00:26:07,487
A second pocket dimension
opened in S.T.A.R. Labs

577
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,124
at the exact same time as ours.

578
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,393
It's DeVoe.

579
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,896
He used that first opening
to conceal his own entrance.

580
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,364
That's why our sensors didn't register.

581
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,832
This is all a part of his plan:

582
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,767
the Samuroid attack, us getting Edwin,

583
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,473
using him to attack DeVoe's lair.

584
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:22,364
- He wanted us divided.
- Where did Edwin go?

585
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,139
He's back locked in his
cell, and we got DeVoe's

586
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,241
pocket dimension energy
coming from the Cortex.

587
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:28,212
That must be where his chair
is. I mean, if we can get to it,

588
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:29,338
we can use it to get our team back.

589
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,141
First, we gotta get
ourselves out of here.

590
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:33,415
- Harry, can you unhack his code?
- Trying, but it's too complex.

591
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,120
If I had my quantum decryption keys,

592
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,240
I could do it, but they're
stuck in Cisco's workshop.

593
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:38,954
But we're not stuck in here.

594
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,563
What are you gonna do?

595
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:42,919
It's a little worst-case scenario

596
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,460
that I had Cisco whip up.

597
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,675
Get back. Get back.

598
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:58,426
Harry, go get your equipment...

599
00:26:58,429 --> 00:26:59,698
I'll go and hack the computers.

600
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,409
Yeah. Iris, get to that chair.

601
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,245
- Dad, you can't...
- Go.

602
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,753
Ah!

603
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:21,563
I heard all the
commotion, and I thought,

604
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:24,933
"If DeVoe was here,
where would he be going?"

605
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,468
Hmm.

606
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,239
A simple deduction for a simple man.

607
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:33,242
Though I assure you, you are no threat

608
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:36,378
for an intellect of my magnitude.

609
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,880
Please.

610
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,915
Everyone I fight is smarter than me,

611
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:41,850
but no bad guy has beaten me yet.

612
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:44,553
Well, I'm afraid an old friend

613
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:47,589
requests a rematch.

614
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:49,124
I really hate sequels.

615
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:21,530
Ah...

616
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,327
Mrs. West Allen,

617
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,464
I was hoping we'd meet again.

618
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,210
You might change your mind
about that pretty soon.

619
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,569
Ah... there's that passion

620
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:36,705
from our chat in the courthouse.

621
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:38,273
But I do remember warning you

622
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:40,296
that it could easily be destroyed.

623
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,777
And I remember you asking me

624
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,681
what I was willing to do for my husband.

625
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,194
How about I show you?

626
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,401
- Gideon?
- Yes, Dr. Wells?

627
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:08,904
Increase the Thinking
Cap's dark matter feed.

628
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:12,835
More.

629
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,776
Warning: Safe zone
parameters will be exceeded.

630
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,480
- Recommended...
- Maximum capacity now!

631
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:48,644
Come on.

632
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:52,014
Little closer. Little closer.

633
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:56,084
Warning: Fists in Pipeline
are larger than they appear.

634
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,241
No.

635
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,762
Even gray matter as unevolved as yours

636
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:47,970
understands the pain of psychic attacks.

637
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:51,440
You were born for me, Mr. Dibny,

638
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,202
and now...

639
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:56,288
you will die for me.

640
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:00,509
You first!

641
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,152
What's that?

642
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,835
A big old fork to shove up your...

643
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:18,820
One more strike and you're dead.

644
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,869
I have been waiting
for this a long time,

645
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:23,937
you and me alone,

646
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,974
so I can make the hard
choice that no one else will.

647
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:36,285
Ah!

648
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:41,890
Ah!

649
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,363
Perhaps you are willing
to do what it takes...

650
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,726
But it seems my love...

651
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,870
is stronger than yours.

652
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:05,112
Get out of my office.

653
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:09,684
Where is he?

654
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,218
- Iris?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

655
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,688
The others are still out there
fighting DeVoe and a Samuroid.

656
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:15,524
Actually, now it's just DeVoe.

657
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,312
- Hm.
- Iris?

658
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:20,960
I'm okay, we just need to get DeVoe.

659
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:23,191
Breach us to him. I'm ready
to get blood on this jacket.

660
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:25,433
That blow back in the lair
knocked down my breaching.

661
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:28,036
- I'll find him.
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,544
Did you just...

663
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,293
Beat The Thinker?

664
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:41,583
Yeah, I did.

665
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,052
You just got out-thunk, punk.

666
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:46,521
And I see you went with
the same plan, as always.

667
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:48,790
Eh.

668
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,126
Do you remember when I
visited you in prison?

669
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:53,595
You said that I could
have a greater life

670
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,732
if I'd just rise up.

671
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:58,800
Well...

672
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:01,069
I'm ready for that life.

673
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:03,038
And for the first time,

674
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,507
I might even deserve it.

675
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:07,376
Yes...

676
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:10,545
it appears I have been bested.

677
00:33:10,547 --> 00:33:12,381
However...

678
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,483
a tip, if I may.

679
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,482
Before you cuff a meta,

680
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:21,022
make sure the light is the right color.

681
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:24,159
Ralph!

682
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,500
Ms. Betty never understood

683
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:34,457
the full magnitude of her powers.

684
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,304
You're currently the
same gravimetric weight

685
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,840
as a cement truck, Mr. Allen.

686
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:42,210
That should hold you long
enough to bear witness.

687
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,783
Ralph! Just fight it,
all right? Fight it!

688
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,653
I'll save you.

689
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:53,499
You already did, Barry.

690
00:33:53,502 --> 00:33:55,302
No... no...

691
00:33:58,142 --> 00:33:59,775
No!

692
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:04,533
- Ralph?
- God...

693
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:06,234
Stand back.

694
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:41,603
Melt.

695
00:34:55,252 --> 00:34:56,818
All the training,

696
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,054
all the lessons you taught Mr. Dibny

697
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,857
to help him reach his full potential,

698
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:05,026
this body will be the
greatest gift of all.

699
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,820
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

700
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:10,031
You were an excellent teacher.

701
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,698
We were supposed to save them.

702
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,036
We tried.

703
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,938
We failed.

704
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:48,213
I know this isn't the ending
we were expecting, so...

705
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:51,891
If anyone wants to talk...

706
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,223
Should I track him down?

707
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,325
No.

708
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,994
I think I know where he's going.

709
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,127
- Cisco?
- Hey.

710
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,604
Uh, weather says rain's
coming. Do you mind helping me?

711
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:20,838
Can you get Harry?

712
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:22,908
I think something's wrong with me.

713
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,686
Well, your vitals seem okay.

714
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,924
Blood pressure, respiratory
rate seems normal as well.

715
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,557
You're gonna have to run the test again.

716
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,792
There was some feeling.

717
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,161
I... I don't know what it was, but...

718
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,996
You touched DeVoe.

719
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,507
Hand me the dark matter scanner.

720
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,099
The dark matter scanner...

721
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,218
I'll get it.

722
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,205
- Focus, Harry.
- Yeah, focus.

723
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,382
There's no trace of dark
matter anywhere on your body.

724
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,117
He must've used Melting Point's powers

725
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,886
to entangle your meta DNA.

726
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,855
- So, Killer Frost...
- Is gone.

727
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,089
Thought I might find
you at the other office.

728
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,393
Yeah, well, without Ralph
being around to dodge rain,

729
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,557
it's only a matter of time

730
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,729
before the landlord
closes this place up.

731
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,269
I know there's some things in here

732
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:52,807
Ralph wouldn't want anybody finding.

733
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,003
You know you could just whoosh around

734
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,440
and you could pack up a lot faster.

735
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,708
Yeah, I know.

736
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,650
- Barry, look, I just wanted...
- Iris, I...

737
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,210
I know that you're... You're here for me

738
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:16,288
and that I can talk to you,
and I love you for that,

739
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,262
but...

740
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:22,332
right now, I just need to pack up.

741
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,400
That's all.

742
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:29,806
Okay, yeah.

743
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,475
Um...

744
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,810
I'll leave you to it.

745
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,595
I'll keep them safe.

746
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,972
To our overwhelming success.

747
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,813
Yes, in more ways than one.

748
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,886
- What do you mean?
- Not only is my new host body

749
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:23,586
immune to the ravages of
my ever-expanding mind...

750
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:32,595
It also holds an ancillary benefit.

751
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,071
Clifford.

752
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:49,178
I'm nothing without you...

753
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,117
And now, all of me...

754
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,252
is with you once more.

755
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:16,506
But we must temper our
celebration with conviction.

756
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,767
Our plans have yet to reach their apex.

757
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,285
- Is that...
- Dark matter.

758
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,221
Siphoned from the room where Dr. Wells

759
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,091
was charging his counterfeit cap.

760
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,959
As I predicted,

761
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,530
his hubris was his undoing.

762
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,432
And so, now,

763
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:45,886
the fire that burns down Team Flash...

764
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,289
Will also light the path
to the Enlightenment.

765
