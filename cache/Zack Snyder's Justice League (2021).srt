1
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,608
Alert the queen.

2
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,157
Bruce Vayne.

3
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,949
Bruce Wayne.

4
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,389
Talk.

5
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,518
I believe there is a stranger.

6
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,225
Comes to this village from the sea.

7
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,145
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

8
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,530
He brings fish.

9
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,315
He comes on the king tide.

10
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,734
That was last night.

11
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,579
You have eyes, so see.

12
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,494
Icebergs in the harbor.

13
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,663
It's four months
since the last ship got through.

14
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,881
Well, this stranger doesn't come by ship.

15
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,471
There are enemies coming from far away.

16
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,436
I need warriors.

17
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,148
This stranger, others like him.

18
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,814
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

19
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,655
It's very important that I see this man.

20
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,117
If this stranger exists,

21
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,373
he'll give him your message.

22
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,750
$5,000 American.

23
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,751
Look, I'll give you $25,000

24
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,376
to talk to this man right now, outside.

25
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:50,097
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

26
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,560
Magical man from the sea.

27
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,444
We are poor, not stupid.

28
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,446
Get out.

29
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,817
I'm sorry.

30
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,781
Can't do that.

31
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,154
I'll leave after we've spoken.

32
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,125
He said, "Get out."

33
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,264
Arthur Curry.

34
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,185
Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

35
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,520
The Aquaman.

36
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,951
So, let me get this straight.

37
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,614
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

38
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,453
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

39
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,459
Oh, that shithole.

40
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,416
When the fight comes, we'll need you.

41
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,330
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

42
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,237
'Cause I don't like you coming here,
digging into my business

43
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,798
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

44
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,972
Is that why you do this?

45
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,368
Why you help these people out here
in the middle of nowhere?

46
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,392
I've read the stories.

47
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,843
Your good deeds you think no one sees.

48
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,477
You'll join us.

49
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,354
"Strong man is strongest alone."

50
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,764
You ever heard that?

51
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,600
You ever hear of Superman?

52
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,314
He died fighting next to me.

53
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,062
My point exactly.

54
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,448
He believed we were stronger together.

55
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,649
We owe it to him.

56
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,527
I don't owe anyone anything.

57
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,078
Dressed like a bat.

58
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,797
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

59
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,554
Move over, Dusty.

60
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,525
My God, Master Wayne, but this is cold.

61
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,033
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

62
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,445
Might be a metahuman or two in Fiji.

63
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,238
Costa Rica's nice.

64
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,827
I found him.

65
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,168
He said no.

66
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,255
So the draft stands at naught for two?

67
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,461
Maybe a man who broods in a cave
for a living

68
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,131
isn't cut out to be a recruiter.

69
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,569
That's $10, please.

70
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,820
Good morning, Miss Lane.

71
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,197
Jerry, hi.

72
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,286
Wow.

73
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,364
You don't miss a day, do you?

74
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,791
Like it here.

75
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,420
Excuse me.

76
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,109
Move!

77
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,284
Move it! Move it!

78
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,672
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

79
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,833
Get the fuck over there!

80
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,378
Move! All of ya!

81
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,981
Line them up along the wall.

82
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,688
Keep them quiet.

83
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,316
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

84
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,856
Shut them up, too!

85
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,486
We'll be making a statement shortly.

86
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,496
Until then, if I see any movement,

87
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,623
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

88
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,220
Should I take him?

89
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,975
Hold your fire.

90
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,603
They've got kids in there.

91
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,306
Yeah, he's not bluffing, chief.

92
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,396
St. Brigid's had a school trip today.

93
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,589
Quiet! Shut up!

94
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,971
Down with the modern world.

95
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,682
Back to the Dark Ages.

96
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,191
Quiet!

97
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,818
I said, shut your fucking mouth.

98
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,663
Who are you?

99
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,674
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

100
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,964
Now, who are you?

101
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,589
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

102
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,382
who wanna turn back the clock in Europe

103
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,801
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

104
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,560
We have no demands.

105
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,250
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

106
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,764
While you do what?

107
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,148
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

108
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,406
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

109
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,993
...while the world watches.

110
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,631
No!

111
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,758
Like lambs to the slaughter.

112
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,225
I don't believe it.

113
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,691
Believe it.

114
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,095
Is everyone all right? Are you okay?

115
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,347
Good. It's okay.

116
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,774
It's okay. It's over. You can stand up.

117
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,024
It's all good.

118
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,814
It's over now. Are you okay?

119
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,480
You okay? Good.

120
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,448
Are you okay, princess?

121
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,704
Can I be like you someday?

122
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,462
You can be anything you want to be.

123
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,751
Come on. Let's go.

124
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,761
Any changes today?

125
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,387
No, my Queen.

126
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,716
The Mother Box has awoken,

127
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,052
yet nothing has happened.

128
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,309
It has slept for thousands of years

129
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,440
since the First Age.

130
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,942
Why did it wake at all?

131
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,693
This is the first time it's gone quiet

132
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,995
since the crack appeared.

133
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,827
Maybe it's going back to sleep.

134
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,628
Evil does not sleep.

135
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,959
It waits.

136
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,925
Something is coming.

137
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,641
Prepare for battle!

138
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,544
Amazons, on your marks!

139
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,208
Ready!

140
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,440
Defenders.

141
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,363
They have failed 100,000 worlds.

142
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,365
They always fail.

143
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:56,000
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

144
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,087
I will bathe in your fear.

145
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,053
Daughters of Themyscira,

146
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,972
show him your fear!

147
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,555
We have no fear!

148
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,446
Gather the legions!

149
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,535
Go with her!

150
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,790
You must seal the cage!

151
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,419
- Go!
- Phillipus!

152
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,237
No!

153
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,959
Behind you!

154
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,506
Epione.

155
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,514
Honor us. It's right.

156
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,810
Seal it.

157
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,651
Ready the hammers!

158
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,703
Seal it now!

159
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,091
Guard it with your life.

160
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,065
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

161
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,636
Got it! Go!

162
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,750
Oh, noble Queen. Why do you fight?

163
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,538
You can't save her.

164
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,174
You can't save any of them.

165
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,094
The great darkness begins.

166
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,224
Amazons!

167
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,484
Yes, we will find the others.

168
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,859
Draw!

169
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,496
Loose!

170
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,256
He's gone back to his universe.

171
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,351
No.

172
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,304
He's gone to the lands of men

173
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,598
to find the other two boxes.

174
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,151
We have to light the ancient warning fire.

175
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,488
The fire has not burned for 5,000 years.

176
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,195
Men won't know what it means.

177
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,401
Men won't.

178
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,574
She will.

179
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,937
It's toxic.

180
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,822
That's good.

181
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,970
Go!

182
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,131
Follow the scent of the Mother Boxes.

183
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,845
Find the missing two.

184
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,887
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

185
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,806
This world will join the others.

186
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,727
He will be pleased.

187
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,817
He will see my worth again.

188
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,609
Hey.

189
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,994
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

190
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,575
Possibly.

191
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,535
"Possibly."

192
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,290
If I had a dollar for every "possibly."

193
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,080
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

194
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,760
Facial scan might have got a hit on him,

195
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,762
our disappearing man.

196
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:35,101
One Mr. Barry Allen from Central City.

197
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,681
Might be another false positive,

198
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,173
you'll have to give me a little time

199
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,565
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

200
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,018
Master Wayne,

201
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,529
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

202
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,696
to build this team

203
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,698
of people you can't even find.

204
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,951
I found one. I found two, including Diana.

205
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,245
Just because Lex Luthor says

206
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,118
the planet's in danger of attack?

207
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,283
This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor.

208
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,667
It has to do with him.

209
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,251
I made a promise to him on his grave.

210
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,250
I spent a lot of time trying to divide us.

211
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,215
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

212
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,597
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

213
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,969
No attacks. No barbarians at the gate.

214
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,847
Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate.

215
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,395
Maybe they're already here.

216
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,147
Keep looking. What else do you have?

217
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,692
Lab's all yours, Howard.

218
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,447
11:30.

219
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,949
Early night for you, Silas.

220
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,201
Yes, early night.

221
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,072
Tell your family I said hello.

222
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,948
What the...

223
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,032
Jesus.

224
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,111
The Arrow of Artemis.

225
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,736
It will reach the lands of men.

226
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,663
Sky torch,

227
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,374
hero beacon,

228
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,254
scatter the darkness.

229
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,667
Burn as you burned in days before.

230
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,721
Show her the darkness
before the daylight of history.

231
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,809
Warn my daughter that war has come

232
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,895
and protect her.

233
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,918
Return to me, Diana.

234
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,164
<i>What did you do this weekend, Diana?</i>

235
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,841
Nothing very interesting.

236
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,510
That's all you ever tell us.

237
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:05,055
What can I do? I'm not that exciting.

238
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,684
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

239
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,568
Again?

240
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,600
- What is it?
- Now what?

241
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,105
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

242
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,774
Now add to the list "arson."

243
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,432
<i>Yes, good morning from the isle of Crete.</i>

244
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,226
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

245
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,992
<i>an enormous bonfire is burning.</i>

246
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,286
<i>This fire has been burning
through the night.</i>

247
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,748
<i>We're now into the morning</i>

248
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,252
<i>and we are at least five miles away.</i>

249
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,759
<i>And we can still see it burning
as we speak.</i>

250
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,925
<i>This has baffled locals
and government authorities alike</i>

251
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,006
<i>here at this historical site</i>

252
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,638
<i>of the so-called shrine of the Amazons.</i>

253
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,707
<i>Now, locals and government officials
are baffled as to...</i>

254
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,767
- Invasion.
- <i>...what may have caused this.</i>

255
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:03,944
Ryan.

256
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,483
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

257
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,492
No damage to the electron-laser.

258
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,824
- Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

259
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,239
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

260
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,291
Who did this? Did they steal anything?

261
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,039
They took whatever was in here.

262
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,088
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

263
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,383
No. That was misplaced a while ago.

264
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,804
Object 6-1982.
Department of Defense Archives.

265
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,756
What was it?

266
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,185
I don't know.

267
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,330
You don't know?

268
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,595
I don't know,
which was why I was studying it.

269
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,263
What's your rank, Doctor?

270
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,682
Ryan, would you do the honors?

271
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,521
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

272
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,024
Civilian. S.T.A.R. Labs
is a private contractor.

273
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,229
We work for the DoD.

274
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,989
We advise them on xeno-science.

275
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,369
"Xeno-science"?

276
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,868
Alien technology.

277
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,045
For example,

278
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,751
the Superman ship.

279
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,024
Eight people never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

280
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,394
Cleaning staff, guards,
a few of your research scientists.

281
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,773
They were abducted.

282
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,150
Are you sure?

283
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,855
Witness saw it all. He escaped.

284
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,146
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

285
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,494
Any idea who or what that might be?

286
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,679
The box isn't safe here.

287
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,645
Victor,

288
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,099
they came looking for it at the lab.

289
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:05,691
People were taken
by some kind of monster or something.

290
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,407
You know a lot about monsters,

291
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,447
don't you?

292
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,952
Especially how to make 'em.

293
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,178
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

294
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,064
My hull is breached. I'm going down.

295
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,363
Mayday!

296
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,612
Is there anybody out there?

297
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,237
Whiskey.

298
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,961
Tell him to respect the storm next time.

299
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,141
It's on him.

300
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,455
King who would be man.

301
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,788
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

302
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,411
All the time I've wasted

303
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,627
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

304
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,114
Are you finished, old man?

305
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,595
You never sleep in the same place twice,

306
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,508
yet you keep coming back here.

307
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,435
I like it. It's quiet.

308
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,392
It's your inheritance.

309
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,682
You're the rightful king of Atlantis.

310
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,934
Our people suffer.

311
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,068
Your people.

312
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,777
A brutal, petty, superstitious race.

313
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,157
Is the surface any different?

314
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,278
Nobody calls me King of the Surface.

315
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,079
What do you want, Vulko?

316
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,541
Guards near the stronghold
have been disappearing.

317
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,122
Snatchers from above.

318
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,503
Talk to King Orm.

319
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,193
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

320
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,250
He's trying to fan the flames of war
with the surface.

321
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,047
He lies.

322
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,631
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

323
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,511
They're looking for it.

324
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,686
The Mother Box our people guard
is not safe.

325
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,102
Go to the stronghold of Atlantis.

326
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:22,683
Protect the box.

327
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,901
The time has come.

328
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,023
Take up your mother's trident.

329
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,875
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

330
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,837
Above or below.

331
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,580
DeSaad.

332
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,709
DeSaad! I call to thee.

333
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:35,927
Steppenwolf, have you begun the conquest?

334
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,426
This world is divided.

335
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,720
They are a primitive species.

336
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,231
Unevolved and at war with one another.

337
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,234
Too separate to be one.

338
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,736
Their free will must be ripped from them,

339
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,654
like the other worlds.

340
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,943
Given absolution in one glorious belief:

341
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,827
To serve him.

342
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,535
The Mother Boxes?

343
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,038
I have found one of the three.

344
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,669
The one that woke and called to me.

345
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,330
The other two still sleep,

346
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,342
but the parademons feel their presence.

347
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,968
They fly,

348
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,723
they search, they take prisoners
who carry the scent,

349
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:22,808
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

350
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,222
Yes.

351
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,980
Mighty Steppenwolf,

352
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,858
who might have sat here
by the side of the Great One.

353
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:41,372
But undone by his self-pride.

354
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,907
DeSaad,

355
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,369
I fall before you.

356
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,917
Let me make a plea to him

357
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,003
that I may come home

358
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,964
after I take this world in his name.

359
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,550
You betrayed him.

360
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,466
Your own family.

361
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,851
I saw my mistake.

362
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,603
I slaughtered those who sought his throne.

363
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:10,894
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

364
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,820
He will hear your plea

365
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,523
when you pay your debt.

366
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,491
The Mother Boxes will be found and united.

367
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,574
No protectors here.

368
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,165
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

369
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,957
This world will fall, like all the others.

370
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,751
For Darkseid.

371
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,181
For Darkseid.

372
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,035
You know, I paid millions of dollars
for this building's security.

373
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,609
You got your money's worth.

374
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,369
Took me almost a minute to disable it.

375
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,254
Hi there.

376
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,920
A new toy?

377
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:19,006
Prototype troop carrier.

378
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,345
I once knew a man
who would have loved to fly it.

379
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,935
The best minds at Wayne Aerospace
couldn't make it fly.

380
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,605
But you can?

381
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,437
I have no choice.

382
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,353
I need more range and I need more cargo.

383
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,111
I think there's an attack coming.

384
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,272
Not coming, Bruce.

385
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,033
It's already here.

386
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,694
From what I've learned,

387
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,372
they are things from another universe.

388
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,874
They serve a dark power.

389
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,751
An old power.

390
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,332
What do they want?

391
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,506
To invade. To conquer.

392
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:01,879
They came here once before, long ago.

393
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,432
<i>A great armada appeared in the sky,</i>

394
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,222
<i>laying waste to all who opposed it.</i>

395
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,484
<i>The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.</i>

396
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,898
<i>A name cursed and feared
in every universe.</i>

397
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,619
<i>Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.</i>

398
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,280
<i>The old gods, men,</i>

399
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,992
<i>Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea,</i>

400
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:38,131
<i>Amazons before
their betrayal and enslavement</i>

401
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,834
<i>and guardians from the stars.</i>

402
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,595
<i>Their histories had taught them
not to trust each other,</i>

403
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,927
<i>not to hope for an alliance.</i>

404
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,093
<i>To fight apart.</i>

405
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,860
<i>As Darkseid waged war on Earth,</i>

406
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,441
<i>he found a secret there.</i>

407
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:46,359
<i>A power hidden in the infinity of space.</i>

408
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,026
<i>He called forth mystics</i>

409
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:51,322
<i>who worshipped and controlled
three objects:</i>

410
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,534
<i>The Mother Boxes.</i>

411
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,286
Wait, wait, wait.

412
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,461
"Mother Boxes"?

413
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,166
Indestructible living machines,

414
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,544
<i>made from a science so advanced,</i>

415
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,796
<i>it looks like sorcery.</i>

416
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,586
<i>To conquer,
three boxes have to synchronize</i>

417
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:10,007
<i>and join together into The Unity.</i>

418
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:13,222
<i>The Unity cleanses a planet with fire,</i>

419
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,980
<i>transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.</i>

420
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,642
<i>All who live become servants of Darkseid.</i>

421
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,732
<i>Alive but drained of life.</i>

422
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,280
<i>Parademons.</i>

423
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,575
Amazons!

424
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,165
With me!

425
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,981
<i>But before The Unity could synchronize,</i>

426
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,195
<i>the defenders of Earth attacked</i>

427
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,527
<i>and fought as one.</i>

428
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,114
<i>Amazons alongside Atlanteans.</i>

429
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,998
<i>Zeus and his son Ares</i>

430
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,792
<i>alongside the guardians from the sky.</i>

431
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,960
<i>A golden Age of Heroes fighting together</i>

432
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,460
<i>to defend life on Earth.</i>

433
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:24,914
<i>They did what no world had ever done.</i>

434
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,249
<i>Sent the enemies back into the stars.</i>

435
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:33,043
<i>The three Mother Boxes never synchronized.</i>

436
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,801
<i>The Unity never came to pass.</i>

437
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,182
<i>But, in their retreat,</i>

438
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,928
<i>the boxes were left behind on Earth.</i>

439
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,815
<i>They grew weak. Dogs without masters</i>

440
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,234
<i>falling asleep,</i>

441
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,862
<i>awaiting their return.</i>

442
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,364
<i>Fading from the view of the enemy,</i>

443
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,698
<i>anonymous among a trillion worlds.</i>

444
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,760
<i>The defenders of Earth made a vow.</i>

445
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,384
<i>Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.</i>

446
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,393
<i>Each would enshrine and guard</i>

447
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,437
<i>one of the three sleeping Mother Boxes</i>

448
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:30,100
<i>according to the rites and rituals
of their culture</i>

449
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,020
<i>in case a box should ever wake again</i>

450
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,729
<i>to call out to the planet Apokolips</i>

451
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,648
<i>to return and conquer</i>

452
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,614
<i>the only world Darkseid had ever lost.</i>

453
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,235
Something woke the box my people guard.

454
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,987
It called out to the dark place,

455
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,573
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.

456
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,363
The enemy is here.

457
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,536
If he's here, where is he?

458
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,793
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

459
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,921
Hiding until he has all three,
until he's ready.

460
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,928
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

461
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,512
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

462
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,922
No, it will.

463
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,973
It has to.

464
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:31,221
The others. Where are they?

465
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,254
Am I late?

466
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,830
No, I'm so late. I'm very late.

467
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,380
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

468
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,041
Oh. No.

469
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,714
Okay, bye. Okay.

470
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,509
I'm so sorry.

471
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,173
I'm late.

472
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,725
Are you...

473
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,141
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

474
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,963
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

475
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,155
Essentially, the bus didn't come,
then the bus did come,

476
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,734
but then there was this old woman
counting change for the fare,

477
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,053
like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny.

478
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,837
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

479
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:26,995
She's 107 years old,

480
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,974
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

481
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,033
Résumé.

482
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,493
Résumé.

483
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:35,834
Come on.

484
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,255
Come on.

485
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,962
From the French, of course.

486
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:45,173
<i>"Resume,"</i> I believe,
is a past participle of...

487
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,093
Wow. That's no good.

488
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,203
It's like, what lives in my pocket, right?

489
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,855
"Paper monster hungry."

490
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,738
Come on. Supposed to be friends now.

491
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,328
Yes.

492
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,757
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

493
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,176
You said you had experience walking dogs.

494
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,671
Oh, gosh, I hope everyone's okay.

495
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:14,462
See, in times of crisis, for dog work,

496
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,548
I always bring a meat snack.

497
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:17,966
'Cause it makes them feel calm.

498
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,330
'Cause you never know
what's going to happen in this city.

499
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,890
I mean, oh, my gosh.

500
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,601
Right? I start on Monday?

501
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,601
You have been near a Mother Box.

502
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,808
The scent is on you.

503
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,643
Where is it?

504
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,939
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

505
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,380
Our people have guarded the Mother Box
for thousands of years.

506
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,173
I will never betray my own people.

507
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,229
You already have.

508
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,800
<i>This was taken
in the deepest trench on Earth.</i>

509
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,469
He must be an Atlantean.

510
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,754
A water-breather.

511
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,744
He was breathing air when I talked to him.

512
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,554
Mixed-blood, then.

513
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,593
He said he'll fight with us?

514
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:09,103
More or less.

515
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,565
More more or more less?

516
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:13,985
Probably more less.

517
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:15,939
- He said no?
- He said no.

518
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,111
Atlanteans can be tricky.

519
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,775
My people went to war with them once.

520
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,994
I'm not sure we can trust him.

521
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,476
Diana, if we're gonna do this,
you're gonna need to be open

522
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,769
to more things that we didn't,

523
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:29,793
you know...

524
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:31,639
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

525
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,939
Don't worry about it.

526
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,243
- Let's...
- It happens.

527
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:35,442
So...

528
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,457
This is the third person.

529
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,047
Disappears for 1/30 of a second here.

530
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,711
One frame of video, see?

531
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,505
Barry Allen. Central City.

532
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Go to him.

533
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,390
I'll work on number four.

534
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,678
Organic and biomechatronic body parts.

535
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,225
He's a cyborg.

536
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,336
- Ready!
- Break!

537
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:32,856
Three,

538
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,768
eighty,

539
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,942
set, go!

540
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,449
<i>Your son may be captain
of the football team</i>

541
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,619
and a certified genius, Mrs. Stone...

542
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,879
Dr. Stone.

543
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,467
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

544
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,427
to change his friend's grades.

545
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,723
Sarah's family lost their house this year.

546
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:12,723
How could that child pass her classes?

547
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:17,352
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

548
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,562
What did you do to help her?

549
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,608
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.

550
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,942
He got held up at the lab.

551
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,157
Okay. He always does.

552
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,750
He wanted to be here.

553
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,909
You always say that.

554
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:02,019
Ma, you gotta stop making excuses for him.

555
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,089
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

556
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:08,212
He just has difficulty showing it,

557
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,718
but I know he's proud of you.

558
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,221
We both are, Victor.

559
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,053
Hey, hey, hey.

560
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,312
With everything I know you can do today,

561
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,224
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

562
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,280
<i>Dr. Stone, I'm sorry.</i>

563
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,154
Your wife didn't survive.

564
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,912
I'm afraid your son won't, either.

565
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,757
I won't let you die.

566
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,262
I won't allow it.

567
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,307
I won't allow it.

568
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:09,781
Victor.

569
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,900
Victor, you're not stuck in here.

570
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,487
You still have a life ahead of you.

571
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:21,532
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

572
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,624
If you were there,

573
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,872
Mom would still be alive.

574
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,631
All right, look,

575
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,427
you don't have to give me a second chance,

576
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,054
but give yourself one.

577
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:44,142
If you can't stand looking at me,

578
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,474
try listening.

579
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,214
<i>What you can do now, Victor.</i>

580
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,597
<i>Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

581
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,308
<i>The tip of the tip.</i>

582
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,503
<i>In the world of ones and zeroes,</i>

583
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,260
<i>you are the absolute master.</i>

584
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:03,016
<i>No firewall can stop you.</i>

585
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,473
<i>No encryption can defy you.</i>

586
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,389
<i>We're all at your mercy, Vic.</i>

587
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,933
<i>From our power grids
to our telecommunications,</i>

588
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,147
<i>everyone's lives are controlled</i>

589
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,280
<i>and dominated by complex digital networks</i>

590
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,534
<i>that will bend, without effort,
to your will.</i>

591
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,496
<i>The fate of the world</i>

592
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,378
<i>will literally rest in your hands.</i>

593
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,346
<i>Its entire nuclear arsenal,</i>

594
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,224
<i>you could launch with a thought.</i>

595
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,200
<i>The world's monetary systems
and its complex interactions</i>

596
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:05,158
<i>will seem as easy to manipulate for you</i>

597
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,830
<i>as a child's plaything.</i>

598
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:44,610
<i>The question... No, the challenge</i>

599
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,954
<i>won't be doing it.</i>

600
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:52,868
<i>It will be not doing. Not seeing.</i>

601
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,209
<i>It is the burden of this responsibility</i>

602
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:00,672
<i>that will define you
and who you choose to be.</i>

603
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,374
<i>Now, make a wish.</i>

604
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,665
<i>One more time.</i>

605
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,998
<i>Good job. Wave to Grandma!</i>

606
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:40,336
<i>Hi, Grandma!</i>

607
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,730
What?

608
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,355
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

609
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:47,983
Oh, my God.

610
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,901
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

611
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:56,617
<i>Victor...</i>

612
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:01,622
<i>Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.</i>

613
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,962
<i>That's how I've been speaking to you.</i>

614
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:06,679
<i>Now,</i>

615
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,720
<i>let me speak to you from my heart,
not as a scientist,</i>

616
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,476
<i>as a father.</i>

617
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:29,942
Hey.

618
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,740
Hey, you!

619
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:51,555
<i>Because you are holding yourself back.</i>

620
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:55,262
You're going in circles, man.

621
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,598
Holding down three dead-end jobs,

622
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:58,773
going on four.

623
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,393
Where do you even find the time?

624
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:01,682
I make the time.

625
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,129
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

626
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:04,255
...then I'm gonna pay for my own tuition.

627
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,279
You can't.

628
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,549
Like I always said I would.

629
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:07,800
You cannot keep doing this to yourself.

630
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,635
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

631
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,596
Please, we have 10 minutes.

632
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,764
And this is all to pay
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

633
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,788
Yeah.

634
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:14,955
For what?

635
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,331
Let's see. As I talk to my father,

636
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:21,439
who's still in prison for the murder
of my mother, which he didn't commit.

637
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,463
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

638
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,126
I can't remember.

639
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,300
Oh, boy.

640
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,921
This path has clearly chosen me, Dad.

641
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,010
Give me your hand, man.

642
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,853
I want you to listen to me, Barry.

643
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:43,515
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

644
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,356
I want you to give all that up.

645
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,408
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

646
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:02,785
I am a drag on your life.

647
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,333
Okay.

648
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,379
Please don't ever say that to me again.

649
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,047
Please.

650
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:18,342
Hey, you know what criminal justice
would be for me?

651
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,310
My son not wasting his life.

652
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,474
You can be whatever you wanna be.

653
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,901
You're brilliant, man.

654
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,235
Absolute best of the best.

655
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:39,788
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

656
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,698
for some old dude

657
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:45,040
who's not going anywhere.

658
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:46,691
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

659
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:47,715
That's not true.

660
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,403
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

661
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,212
I want you to make your own future.

662
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,197
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

663
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,711
Open gate.

664
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:55,841
Great.

665
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,260
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

666
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,850
Clear. Close the gate.

667
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:59,196
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

668
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:01,699
You said that like it explains

669
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,997
why there's a total stranger in my place

670
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,954
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

671
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,833
Tell me about this.

672
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,677
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

673
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,554
but who is definitely not me.

674
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:23,550
Somebody... I don't know.

675
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,559
Hippie, long hair.

676
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,472
Very attractive Jewish boy.

677
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:31,982
Who drinks milk, I don't drink milk.

678
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,315
I know you have abilities.

679
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,320
I just don't know what they are.

680
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:37,821
My special skills

681
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,651
include viola, web design,

682
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,616
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

683
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:47,123
Silica-based sand quartz fabric.

684
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,626
Abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

685
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,661
Yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

686
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,705
It's what they use on the space shuttle

687
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,440
to prevent it from burning up on re-entry.

688
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:58,084
I do very competitive ice dancing.

689
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,463
Look, man. I don't know who you are,

690
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,549
but whoever you're looking for,

691
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:04,727
it's not me.

692
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,142
You're the Batman?

693
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,303
So, you're fast.

694
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:53,144
That feels like an oversimplification.

695
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:55,058
I'm putting together a team.

696
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,318
People with special abilities.

697
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:58,979
You see, I believe enemies are coming.

698
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,239
Stop right there. I'm in.

699
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,365
You are?

700
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:04,780
Just like that?

701
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:06,069
Yeah.

702
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:10,123
I need friends.

703
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,585
Great. Great.

704
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,870
Can I keep this?

705
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,339
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

706
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,087
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

707
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,467
I call it the Speed Force.

708
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,558
Causes me to burn
a tremendous amount of calories,

709
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,256
so I am just a black hole of snacks.

710
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,265
I am a snack hole.

711
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,978
How many people are
on this special fight team?

712
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,059
- Three, including you.
- Three?

713
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,099
Against what?

714
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,442
I'll tell you on the plane.

715
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,278
Plane?

716
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,689
What are your superpowers again?

717
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,573
I'm rich.

718
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,470
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

719
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,635
No, that's okay. I can do it myself.

720
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,308
Would you like to have some?

721
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,767
No, thank you.

722
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,143
If you put the water in first.

723
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,855
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

724
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,321
- Yes.
- Great.

725
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,451
No, that's probably enough tea.

726
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:30,987
All right.

727
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:33,645
Are you sure you don't wanna have some?

728
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:37,035
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

729
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:40,584
I will. I will, definitely will.

730
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:43,091
What are you working on?

731
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:44,592
It's a gauntlet

732
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,798
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

733
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,182
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

734
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:54,678
We borrowed this
from the Kryptonian scout ship.

735
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:57,684
Oh, maybe you should...

736
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:00,358
- A fraction. Thank you, thank you.
- Of course.

737
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:07,277
Ah.

738
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,368
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

739
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,278
Ha! Yes.

740
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,572
Not to be sneezed at.

741
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:17,163
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

742
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:18,827
It's Master Wayne's idea.

743
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,371
Maybe you should work on a lasso, too.

744
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,165
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

745
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:34,100
All right. Victor Stone.

746
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,361
Something is not working.

747
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:06,587
Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince.

748
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,734
Why are you looking for me, Diana?

749
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:08,144
You know who I am.

750
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:10,655
I know more than you can possibly imagine.

751
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:13,407
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

752
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:15,078
The world does.

753
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,162
Fuck the world.

754
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,158
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

755
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:25,912
I can't begin to imagine what.

756
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:29,999
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

757
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:31,967
Gifts?

758
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,299
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

759
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:35,634
We need you, Victor.

760
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,890
And maybe you need us.

761
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,722
I don't need anyone.

762
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:42,974
Not anymore.

763
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,640
I told myself the same for a long time.

764
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:55,199
I lost someone I loved once.

765
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:02,871
I shut myself off from everyone.

766
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:07,211
But I had to learn to open back up again.

767
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:13,339
The truth is, I'm still working on it.

768
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,721
And if you asked to meet me,

769
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,342
you're working on it, too.

770
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:35,716
You were right about the metal sample
from the Superman ship.

771
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:39,004
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

772
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:40,888
look what happens.

773
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,812
3.5 million kelvin.

774
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,944
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

775
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,446
Hot, dense matter.

776
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,532
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

777
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:05,617
Exact words I said to my prom date.

778
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,536
She dumped me anyway.

779
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,908
Yeah.

780
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,090
Hey, Doc,

781
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:16,123
do you think Batman is connected

782
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,710
to the object the CID is looking for?

783
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,881
You know, 6-1982?

784
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,140
No.

785
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:27,351
I don't.

786
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:04,263
Oh, Victor.

787
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,320
All right! Let's go!

788
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:25,931
Commissioner Gordon?

789
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:27,115
Come on!

790
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:28,412
Your messages.

791
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:29,656
Hey, hey!

792
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,419
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

793
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,423
Half of Gotham's
reality-challenged community showed up.

794
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,754
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

795
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:42,964
You were right, Ma. Police Academy.

796
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,670
What's wrong with dental school?

797
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,054
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

798
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:54,021
"Looked like a giant bat with huge fangs."

799
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:55,977
On a possibly related note,

800
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:58,484
sketch of the suspect in the abductions

801
01:41:58,571 --> 01:41:59,731
at the lab across the harbor.

802
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:02,442
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

803
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,116
Come on, you think he fights criminals
for 20 years here

804
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,949
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

805
01:42:09,999 --> 01:42:11,079
I'll talk to him tonight.

806
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,416
How do you think?

807
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:33,894
Silas?

808
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,350
Hey, hey.

809
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:36,855
Hey, hey!

810
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,856
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

811
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:45,151
His name is Victor.

812
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:48,693
We met, spoke.

813
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,074
Give him time.

814
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:53,830
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

815
01:42:54,001 --> 01:42:57,744
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

816
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,038
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

817
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,251
Oh!

818
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:04,421
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

819
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,677
Oh, sorry. That's your signal.

820
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:08,053
That means we have to go now.

821
01:43:08,224 --> 01:43:12,012
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

822
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:12,818
Commander Mera, I told the king
the perimeter guards were taken.

823
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:14,574
He won't send reinforcements.

824
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,365
He says all the reserves
are needed in the rebel regions.

825
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:21,286
He's as shortsighted as he is cruel.

826
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:23,545
All right, take what men we have left

827
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:25,456
and form a phalanx around the Mother Box.

828
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:07,353
You can't escape.

829
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:10,068
I'm not trying to.

830
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:14,518
Vulko told me you would come.

831
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,737
The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

832
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:21,654
Wait.

833
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:24,744
Please.

834
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:29,666
I knew her.

835
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:33,545
Well, that makes one of us.

836
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,006
My parents died in the wars.

837
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,134
She took me in.

838
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:40,753
What a saint.

839
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:43,589
You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way?

840
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:48,143
Your queen left me on my father's doorstep
and never gave me another thought.

841
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:50,520
Your mother left you to save your life.

842
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:54,107
You cannot imagine how it hurt her.

843
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:57,732
What it cost her.

844
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:01,152
But you're not a defenseless child now.

845
01:49:03,579 --> 01:49:05,160
It would have been her responsibility

846
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,493
to follow that monster to the surface
and stop him.

847
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:10,164
Now,

848
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:12,793
it's yours.

849
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:18,608
Yes.

850
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:42,917
<i>Steppenwolf,</i>

851
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:45,006
tell me what you've learned.

852
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,796
Two boxes found and awake.

853
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:50,933
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

854
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:54,095
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

855
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,685
Where is the third Mother Box?

856
01:50:56,859 --> 01:51:00,977
The parademons sense its presence
and search for the third.

857
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:04,397
They have taken prisoners
who carry its scent.

858
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:06,194
Go.

859
01:51:07,035 --> 01:51:08,946
Interrogate the prisoners.

860
01:51:09,746 --> 01:51:11,611
Find the third.

861
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:15,328
They will tell me what they know,

862
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:19,078
or I will rip it from them.

863
01:52:02,424 --> 01:52:04,005
How many of you are there?

864
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:05,958
Not enough.

865
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:10,296
Dozens of witnesses all over Gotham.

866
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:13,181
Description matches the suspect
in the Metropolis abductions.

867
01:52:13,769 --> 01:52:14,804
Parademons.

868
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:16,677
Okay.

869
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:19,187
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

870
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:20,441
At the lab.

871
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:22,941
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

872
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:24,297
So the eight may still be alive.

873
01:52:24,321 --> 01:52:25,321
Nine.

874
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:26,645
Oh.

875
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:29,857
The head of S.T.A.R. Labs
was taken tonight.

876
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:37,619
Wow, okay. So, another scientist.

877
01:52:37,793 --> 01:52:39,078
So, how do we find him?

878
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:40,914
There must be a nest nearby.

879
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:45,172
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

880
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,458
No discernable pattern I can see.

881
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:49,072
The lines on the map don't converge.

882
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,427
On land.

883
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:52,075
These lead back to Stryker's Island,

884
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:53,179
between the two cities.

885
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,762
These are air vents.
They all lead down to the tunnel

886
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:58,302
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

887
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,061
The nest could be there.

888
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:02,768
Is he coming with us now?

889
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,663
Because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

890
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,230
I have something bigger.

891
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:09,187
Do you really think that...

892
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:14,072
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

893
01:53:14,162 --> 01:53:16,619
Oh. That's rude.

894
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:57,411
We're close.

895
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:59,572
The scent of the enemy.

896
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:01,452
Of absence.

897
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:03,580
Darkness.

898
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:05,296
Death.

899
01:54:05,714 --> 01:54:06,794
Where are we, Alfred?

900
01:54:06,882 --> 01:54:08,109
<i>Stryker's Island.</i>

901
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:10,374
You should be directly under

902
01:54:10,469 --> 01:54:12,676
the venting tower for the tunnel.

903
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:14,469
<i>Now look to your left,</i>

904
01:54:14,556 --> 01:54:16,672
<i>you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.</i>

905
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:19,429
<i>Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.</i>

906
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,519
That's it.

907
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:21,896
Let's go.

908
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:38,819
Right. Is there a plan?

909
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,659
Either of you?

910
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,193
Don't engage alone.

911
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:45,034
We do this together.

912
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:55,843
I heard about you.

913
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:58,801
Didn't think you were real.

914
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:00,803
I'm real when it's useful.

915
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:12,902
I grow tired of your silence.

916
01:55:12,989 --> 01:55:15,196
Now tell me, where is the Mother Box?

917
01:55:21,998 --> 01:55:24,205
Please. We have families.

918
01:55:24,376 --> 01:55:26,458
Then you have weakness.

919
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:28,084
Steppenwolf.

920
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:32,419
Okay, I'm guessing that's the bad guy.

921
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:33,627
Good guess.

922
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:37,635
I'm really, really
missing Superman right now.

923
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:39,967
Circle to the other side.

924
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:42,133
We'll surround them and surprise him.

925
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,271
You have been near a Mother Box.

926
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:50,439
The scent is on you.

927
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:52,170
I don't know what you're talking about.

928
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:54,068
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

929
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,480
He doesn't know.

930
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:01,864
Wait, please, please!

931
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:10,160
You carry the scent, too. But stronger.

932
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,663
I will die before I tell you.

933
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:14,672
You'll die if you don't.

934
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:16,093
No!

935
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:26,472
Victor.

936
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:27,931
Kill them both.

937
01:56:31,485 --> 01:56:33,567
Ah, Amazon.

938
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:36,478
But not like your sisters.

939
01:56:36,656 --> 01:56:37,896
Stronger.

940
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:11,062
Amazon.

941
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:14,892
Hold!

942
01:57:15,278 --> 01:57:17,485
This one will be mine.

943
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:21,861
I belong to no one.

944
01:57:35,882 --> 01:57:37,918
Guys, this is not together.

945
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:46,244
Help get those people out of here.

946
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:48,350
I'll make sure these things follow me.

947
01:57:58,363 --> 01:57:59,773
Everybody, move!

948
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,030
A little quicker.

949
01:58:12,419 --> 01:58:13,784
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

950
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:16,374
I've got this. Keep moving.

951
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:19,383
This way.

952
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:57,164
The energy is dissipating.

953
01:58:57,339 --> 01:58:58,829
<i>My gauntlet worked!</i>

954
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:02,377
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

955
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:04,167
Thought you'd never ask.

956
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,594
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

957
01:59:37,045 --> 01:59:38,045
Thank you, Alfred.

958
01:59:38,213 --> 01:59:39,578
Don't mention it.

959
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,320
No!

960
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:12,809
They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

961
02:00:12,956 --> 02:00:16,039
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

962
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:29,211
My turn.

963
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,240
Catastrophic failure of all systems.

964
02:01:53,264 --> 02:01:55,676
Are you all right, Master Wayne?

965
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:56,850
Are you all right?

966
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:11,062
You have the blood of the old gods in you.

967
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,380
You okay?

968
02:02:28,383 --> 02:02:29,998
Wasn't sure you'd come.

969
02:02:31,052 --> 02:02:32,337
You're my father.

970
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:36,849
Go.

971
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:51,488
No!

972
02:03:36,993 --> 02:03:39,325
Relax, Alfred. I'll take it from here.

973
02:03:40,914 --> 02:03:42,745
Do I know you?

974
02:04:13,655 --> 02:04:14,895
What are we under, right now?

975
02:04:15,657 --> 02:04:16,942
Gotham Harbor.

976
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:56,940
Who is that?

977
02:05:22,265 --> 02:05:23,425
Come on.

978
02:05:28,563 --> 02:05:29,769
Diana, get on!

979
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:33,157
What is it?

980
02:06:40,968 --> 02:06:42,378
Show me.

981
02:07:21,551 --> 02:07:23,166
It is here.

982
02:07:23,928 --> 02:07:26,886
On this world.

983
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:03,756
Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine
for possible alien microbes.

984
02:08:03,926 --> 02:08:05,587
U.S. government protocols require that...

985
02:08:05,761 --> 02:08:08,548
I know the requirements. I wrote them.

986
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:14,433
It called to him.

987
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:16,140
The Mother Box.

988
02:08:16,314 --> 02:08:17,679
The one he already has.

989
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:21,061
He has two.
He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

990
02:08:21,235 --> 02:08:23,521
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

991
02:08:23,696 --> 02:08:24,896
If he doesn't already have it.

992
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:29,944
He doesn't have it.

993
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,324
I do.

994
02:08:44,884 --> 02:08:46,966
Have you finished the conquest?

995
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,376
Not yet, DeSaad.

996
02:08:48,554 --> 02:08:50,795
Then why do you summon me?

997
02:08:50,973 --> 02:08:52,634
I bring news.

998
02:08:52,808 --> 02:08:55,720
Before Mighty Darkseid came to the throne,

999
02:08:55,895 --> 02:09:00,389
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1000
02:09:01,025 --> 02:09:03,186
The Anti-Life Equation.

1001
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:08,020
The key to controlling all life
and all will throughout the multiverse.

1002
02:09:08,199 --> 02:09:11,284
He found it hidden on a primitive planet,
but before...

1003
02:09:11,369 --> 02:09:14,236
The story of the defiance is well-known.

1004
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:16,904
I have found the primitive planet.

1005
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:19,119
The world that fought back.

1006
02:09:19,293 --> 02:09:21,158
It is Earth.

1007
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:23,544
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

1008
02:09:23,714 --> 02:09:27,582
into the surface of this very world.

1009
02:09:31,264 --> 02:09:32,674
Are you certain?

1010
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:33,883
I have seen it.

1011
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:37,425
I have looked with my own eyes.

1012
02:09:38,604 --> 02:09:40,123
Anti-Life.

1013
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:22,394
My Lord.

1014
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:27,479
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1015
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:31,237
My Lord, I am but your humble servant.

1016
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:35,074
Can it be true that you have found it?

1017
02:10:35,244 --> 02:10:37,405
I have, Great One.

1018
02:10:38,164 --> 02:10:41,122
The lost world is Earth.

1019
02:10:41,292 --> 02:10:44,284
Anti-Life is here.

1020
02:10:45,629 --> 02:10:48,962
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1021
02:10:49,133 --> 02:10:52,091
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world is scorched,

1022
02:10:52,261 --> 02:10:55,469
I will come for my great prize.

1023
02:10:56,432 --> 02:10:58,639
You will come to Earth?

1024
02:10:59,685 --> 02:11:03,928
I have turned 100,000 worlds to dust

1025
02:11:04,106 --> 02:11:05,596
looking for Anti-Life.

1026
02:11:05,775 --> 02:11:08,983
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1027
02:11:09,153 --> 02:11:12,395
I will stride across their bones

1028
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,902
and bask in the glow of Anti-Life.

1029
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:17,783
And all of existence

1030
02:11:17,953 --> 02:11:21,411
shall be mine.

1031
02:11:24,835 --> 02:11:28,748
It shall be so, my master.

1032
02:11:32,968 --> 02:11:34,629
So cool.

1033
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:37,445
From the outside,
it looks like this building was abandoned.

1034
02:11:41,102 --> 02:11:42,842
It wants to fly.

1035
02:11:44,063 --> 02:11:45,928
You talk to machines?

1036
02:11:46,232 --> 02:11:48,223
I speak to intelligence.

1037
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:51,268
This one's saying she can't fly
because of a software issue,

1038
02:11:51,445 --> 02:11:53,401
but I could fix it with a little time.

1039
02:12:03,165 --> 02:12:05,372
There's a dark spot in my data stream.

1040
02:12:05,709 --> 02:12:07,950
I could feel the other two boxes.

1041
02:12:08,129 --> 02:12:09,960
I know they're awake,

1042
02:12:10,131 --> 02:12:11,621
but I can't see where they are.

1043
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:13,944
Well, we can't attack
unless we know where the base is.

1044
02:12:13,968 --> 02:12:16,209
Even if we knew,

1045
02:12:16,387 --> 02:12:19,220
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1046
02:12:21,434 --> 02:12:22,765
Maybe one.

1047
02:12:22,852 --> 02:12:24,558
Superman.

1048
02:12:25,479 --> 02:12:27,199
As long as the third box is asleep,

1049
02:12:27,231 --> 02:12:29,517
they can't see it, only sense it.

1050
02:12:29,692 --> 02:12:31,728
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1051
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:35,065
No. That's just a strategy
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1052
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:37,689
Remind me, are flamethrowers not a thing?

1053
02:12:38,576 --> 02:12:39,736
Why don't we just destroy it?

1054
02:12:39,827 --> 02:12:41,909
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1055
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:43,785
They're an unknown form of matter.

1056
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,158
Oh, they love heat.

1057
02:12:45,249 --> 02:12:47,456
They absorb it, hold it in their cores.

1058
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:49,742
Well, you know a lot about these boxes.

1059
02:12:50,337 --> 02:12:51,577
Makes you think.

1060
02:12:51,755 --> 02:12:53,461
Where'd you find the box, Victor?

1061
02:12:54,425 --> 02:12:55,835
Are you trying to say something?

1062
02:12:56,135 --> 02:12:57,625
Oh, I'm saying it.

1063
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:00,085
How do we know
you're not working for them?

1064
02:13:01,974 --> 02:13:03,635
It's a long story.

1065
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:06,012
You got somewhere else to be?

1066
02:13:13,402 --> 02:13:17,236
The Nazis found the box
at the end of the Second World War,

1067
02:13:17,406 --> 02:13:20,443
buried under an Italian monastery.

1068
02:13:20,618 --> 02:13:22,984
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1069
02:13:23,162 --> 02:13:25,369
They brought it back to the States in '44.

1070
02:13:25,956 --> 02:13:29,494
Unknown object 6-1982.

1071
02:13:30,377 --> 02:13:33,835
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives for 70 years

1072
02:13:34,381 --> 02:13:37,589
till DoD began to study the Superman ship.

1073
02:13:39,136 --> 02:13:42,639
A researcher at S.T.A.R. Labs
made a connection between the ship

1074
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,469
and 6-1982.

1075
02:13:46,352 --> 02:13:49,185
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1076
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:51,436
Different civilizations,

1077
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:54,140
similar properties.

1078
02:13:55,486 --> 02:13:58,228
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1079
02:13:58,906 --> 02:14:01,739
the researcher formulated a theory
on how to awaken it.

1080
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:04,108
And so did.

1081
02:14:06,413 --> 02:14:07,413
Then,

1082
02:14:09,542 --> 02:14:11,453
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1083
02:14:12,795 --> 02:14:16,003
But in an act of desperation or madness,

1084
02:14:16,173 --> 02:14:18,505
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1085
02:14:34,692 --> 02:14:36,774
He unleashed an alien technology

1086
02:14:36,944 --> 02:14:39,606
he didn't fully understand.

1087
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:42,146
He used that power to keep me alive.

1088
02:14:45,744 --> 02:14:47,325
A life

1089
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:49,827
that turned into this.

1090
02:14:52,626 --> 02:14:54,912
The box went back to sleep

1091
02:14:55,838 --> 02:14:57,499
and he never returned it.

1092
02:15:00,134 --> 02:15:02,170
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1093
02:15:03,887 --> 02:15:05,548
My father.

1094
02:15:08,851 --> 02:15:10,512
Wait,

1095
02:15:10,686 --> 02:15:14,053
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1096
02:15:14,231 --> 02:15:16,438
Aren't they psycho murder machines?

1097
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:18,975
They're change machines.

1098
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,815
The boxes don't think
in terms of healing or killing,

1099
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,321
alive or dead.

1100
02:15:24,491 --> 02:15:26,732
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1101
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:28,491
regenerate, reinstate.

1102
02:15:28,662 --> 02:15:30,072
Reinstate?

1103
02:15:30,164 --> 02:15:31,224
A box has the power

1104
02:15:31,248 --> 02:15:33,660
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1105
02:15:33,834 --> 02:15:35,714
So you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1106
02:15:35,794 --> 02:15:37,000
can't be created or destroyed,

1107
02:15:37,087 --> 02:15:39,078
their relations just transform.

1108
02:15:39,256 --> 02:15:41,998
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1109
02:15:42,176 --> 02:15:44,633
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1110
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:48,842
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1111
02:15:50,893 --> 02:15:52,633
But a Mother Box...

1112
02:15:52,811 --> 02:15:55,018
Turns smoke back into a house.

1113
02:16:01,028 --> 02:16:03,519
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1114
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:07,481
Who's gonna say it? I'm not gonna say it.

1115
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,850
Who is it?

1116
02:16:36,563 --> 02:16:37,769
Martha.

1117
02:16:42,486 --> 02:16:43,726
Hi.

1118
02:16:45,614 --> 02:16:46,979
Hi.

1119
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:57,661
I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

1120
02:16:57,751 --> 02:17:01,118
to finally pick up Clark's things.

1121
02:17:02,631 --> 02:17:05,919
I don't know why, nowhere to put them now.

1122
02:17:08,721 --> 02:17:10,336
I lost the farm.

1123
02:17:11,974 --> 02:17:14,090
I'd been behind on the payments
for a while.

1124
02:17:15,477 --> 02:17:17,013
Truth is, the house is too big

1125
02:17:17,104 --> 02:17:19,345
for me to live in by myself anyway.

1126
02:17:19,898 --> 02:17:22,685
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1127
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,816
for as long as you need.

1128
02:17:26,029 --> 02:17:28,645
Thank you, Lois. That's very kind.

1129
02:17:30,325 --> 02:17:32,445
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1130
02:17:32,578 --> 02:17:34,034
right by the diner.

1131
02:17:34,663 --> 02:17:36,028
I'm not here for help.

1132
02:17:37,207 --> 02:17:39,072
I'm here because

1133
02:17:39,918 --> 02:17:42,330
when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that

1134
02:17:43,797 --> 02:17:46,709
you haven't been to work since Clark died.

1135
02:17:51,513 --> 02:17:53,128
I can't.

1136
02:18:00,022 --> 02:18:02,354
The whole world is mourning.

1137
02:18:03,984 --> 02:18:06,396
Grieving over a symbol.

1138
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:10,358
Everywhere I go, everywhere I look,
I see that "S."

1139
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:13,483
I hear what people say.

1140
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,491
They talk like they knew him.

1141
02:18:16,705 --> 02:18:18,946
But they didn't know Clark.

1142
02:18:20,501 --> 02:18:22,833
And I can't stop them

1143
02:18:23,003 --> 02:18:27,288
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1144
02:18:29,301 --> 02:18:31,792
You're the only one who knows.

1145
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:34,382
Who feels what I do.

1146
02:18:35,724 --> 02:18:38,682
Burdened by a secret on top of grief.

1147
02:18:41,855 --> 02:18:45,143
I came all this way because I wanted...

1148
02:18:45,317 --> 02:18:47,308
Because I wanted to see you.

1149
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:50,526
Tell you

1150
02:18:50,697 --> 02:18:52,528
I understand.

1151
02:18:56,829 --> 02:19:00,367
I will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1152
02:19:04,127 --> 02:19:06,118
And I just miss him.

1153
02:19:07,297 --> 02:19:09,504
I miss him so much.

1154
02:19:16,223 --> 02:19:17,884
So do I, sweetheart.

1155
02:19:22,479 --> 02:19:27,348
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1156
02:19:30,946 --> 02:19:33,528
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1157
02:19:35,951 --> 02:19:38,192
Come back to the living.

1158
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:21,034
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1159
02:20:24,833 --> 02:20:25,993
<i>The dead are dead.</i>

1160
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:28,075
The box brought Victor back.

1161
02:20:28,253 --> 02:20:29,789
Victor wasn't dead.

1162
02:20:29,963 --> 02:20:31,703
Life is either one or zero.

1163
02:20:31,882 --> 02:20:34,794
It's to be or not to be. Not both.

1164
02:20:34,968 --> 02:20:36,583
Can you operate this box, Victor?

1165
02:20:36,678 --> 02:20:37,678
Of course.

1166
02:20:38,096 --> 02:20:40,508
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1167
02:20:40,682 --> 02:20:42,513
There's no telling what's gonna happen.

1168
02:20:44,478 --> 02:20:45,968
Okay, but...

1169
02:20:46,146 --> 02:20:49,764
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1170
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:51,480
What do we have to lose?

1171
02:20:51,652 --> 02:20:54,189
We cannot try unless we activate the box.

1172
02:20:54,363 --> 02:20:55,819
As soon as it wakes up...

1173
02:20:55,989 --> 02:20:58,367
The enemy sees it, comes,

1174
02:20:58,533 --> 02:21:01,070
activates The Unity. The end.

1175
02:21:01,244 --> 02:21:03,610
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1176
02:21:03,789 --> 02:21:05,829
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1177
02:21:05,916 --> 02:21:08,407
Even if Superman could return,

1178
02:21:08,585 --> 02:21:10,450
who's to say that he could defeat them?

1179
02:21:10,629 --> 02:21:12,494
The Mother Box did.

1180
02:21:12,798 --> 02:21:16,131
Victor's father activated a Mother Box
more than a year ago.

1181
02:21:16,218 --> 02:21:17,958
When Superman was still alive.

1182
02:21:18,136 --> 02:21:20,001
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

1183
02:21:20,097 --> 02:21:21,553
None of the boxes did. Not until...

1184
02:21:21,723 --> 02:21:26,388
Not until Superman died.

1185
02:21:26,561 --> 02:21:28,517
It's like they were afraid of him?

1186
02:21:28,605 --> 02:21:31,472
Yes, they were afraid of him.

1187
02:21:34,403 --> 02:21:36,189
This is the only way.

1188
02:21:37,864 --> 02:21:41,607
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1189
02:22:09,039 --> 02:22:10,999
Cross this one off the bucket list.

1190
02:22:11,148 --> 02:22:14,936
Exhume Superman from the grave. Check.

1191
02:22:16,987 --> 02:22:19,399
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1192
02:22:20,115 --> 02:22:21,480
We could.

1193
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,656
He was my hero.

1194
02:22:33,295 --> 02:22:34,501
All right.

1195
02:22:38,133 --> 02:22:41,170
An Amazon working with an Atlantean.

1196
02:22:41,344 --> 02:22:42,584
Half-Atlantean.

1197
02:22:44,473 --> 02:22:47,215
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1198
02:22:47,893 --> 02:22:50,760
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1199
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:54,687
I hate Atlanteans
as much as you Amazons do.

1200
02:22:54,858 --> 02:22:56,894
Hate is useless.

1201
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,361
Yep.

1202
02:23:02,657 --> 02:23:04,238
No, thank you.

1203
02:23:08,789 --> 02:23:11,747
You know, my father told me
there's a saying in Atlantis.

1204
02:23:13,502 --> 02:23:15,709
"None are taken back from the darkness.

1205
02:23:15,796 --> 02:23:18,583
- Not without..."
- "Not without giving one up in return."

1206
02:23:20,842 --> 02:23:22,423
We say the same thing.

1207
02:23:25,055 --> 02:23:26,386
How about that?

1208
02:23:26,890 --> 02:23:28,755
Wonder Woman.

1209
02:23:30,143 --> 02:23:31,143
What do you think, man?

1210
02:23:31,228 --> 02:23:34,095
You think she'd ever go for a younger guy?

1211
02:23:34,481 --> 02:23:37,063
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1212
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:40,775
Every guy's a younger guy.

1213
02:23:42,781 --> 02:23:43,861
Jesus.

1214
02:23:45,367 --> 02:23:47,073
Oh, Christ.

1215
02:23:49,621 --> 02:23:52,033
Oh, bloody...

1216
02:23:53,416 --> 02:23:54,416
Any luck?

1217
02:23:54,584 --> 02:23:55,664
If by "luck" you mean

1218
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:58,919
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1219
02:23:59,089 --> 02:24:01,080
then, no. No luck.

1220
02:24:01,967 --> 02:24:03,503
It's okay.

1221
02:24:03,677 --> 02:24:05,530
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1222
02:24:05,554 --> 02:24:06,554
to the Kryptonian ship.

1223
02:24:06,638 --> 02:24:07,949
It's basically an organic computer.

1224
02:24:07,973 --> 02:24:09,964
It can talk directly to the Mother Box.

1225
02:24:10,142 --> 02:24:12,599
What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor?

1226
02:24:12,769 --> 02:24:13,889
Something like that.

1227
02:24:13,979 --> 02:24:17,813
What could possibly go wrong?

1228
02:24:24,447 --> 02:24:25,937
Master Wayne,

1229
02:24:28,034 --> 02:24:29,240
you did it!

1230
02:24:29,619 --> 02:24:32,907
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1231
02:24:33,206 --> 02:24:35,413
You've fulfilled your promise.

1232
02:24:36,501 --> 02:24:39,914
But to try to do that, I mean,

1233
02:24:40,547 --> 02:24:42,378
your guilt's overcome your reason.

1234
02:24:43,592 --> 02:24:45,708
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1235
02:24:45,886 --> 02:24:48,969
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1236
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:50,970
not on reason.

1237
02:24:51,766 --> 02:24:55,975
But if you start playing
with this little box of tricks,

1238
02:24:56,146 --> 02:24:58,228
I mean, it could be the end of everything.

1239
02:24:58,398 --> 02:25:00,263
How do you know your team's strong enough?

1240
02:25:01,526 --> 02:25:03,858
If you can't bring down the charging bull,

1241
02:25:04,029 --> 02:25:05,735
then don't wave the red cape at it.

1242
02:25:05,906 --> 02:25:07,487
You do when it's this red cape.

1243
02:25:07,657 --> 02:25:09,818
This red cape charges back.

1244
02:25:24,549 --> 02:25:25,709
Okay.

1245
02:25:32,682 --> 02:25:35,048
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1246
02:25:35,227 --> 02:25:36,842
Everyone's clear, including you.

1247
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:39,602
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1248
02:25:39,773 --> 02:25:41,500
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1249
02:25:41,524 --> 02:25:42,524
Absolutely.

1250
02:25:46,529 --> 02:25:47,814
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1251
02:25:47,989 --> 02:25:50,446
You're all clear. So, gather your things.

1252
02:25:50,617 --> 02:25:52,153
If you need more medical attention...

1253
02:25:52,327 --> 02:25:55,990
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option A?

1254
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:57,404
- Definitely not A.
- Okay.

1255
02:25:57,582 --> 02:26:00,699
Or B?

1256
02:26:02,337 --> 02:26:03,577
Let me see A again?

1257
02:26:09,219 --> 02:26:12,336
Right. We should get dressed.

1258
02:26:14,474 --> 02:26:16,430
I'm always dressed.

1259
02:26:43,586 --> 02:26:44,586
ID?

1260
02:26:44,838 --> 02:26:45,998
ID.

1261
02:26:49,175 --> 02:26:50,290
Aye, aye.

1262
02:26:52,637 --> 02:26:53,843
"Aye, aye"?

1263
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:18,409
Okay.

1264
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:20,662
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1265
02:27:27,630 --> 02:27:28,710
Doc!

1266
02:27:28,882 --> 02:27:30,122
They let you out of quarantine.

1267
02:27:30,175 --> 02:27:31,694
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1268
02:27:31,718 --> 02:27:33,959
Now, let's take a look
and see what progress we've made

1269
02:27:34,137 --> 02:27:35,137
with the electron-laser.

1270
02:27:35,305 --> 02:27:37,637
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1271
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:55,230
Victor, clear this place out.

1272
02:27:55,575 --> 02:27:56,815
Done.

1273
02:28:01,039 --> 02:28:03,701
<i>Code Red. Contamination breach.</i>

1274
02:28:03,792 --> 02:28:07,125
<i>All personnel evacuate immediately.</i>

1275
02:28:07,212 --> 02:28:09,328
Bio red five.

1276
02:28:09,506 --> 02:28:11,872
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1277
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:14,666
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1278
02:28:14,844 --> 02:28:15,964
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1279
02:28:16,012 --> 02:28:18,378
All right, people, shut it down. Let's go.

1280
02:28:18,473 --> 02:28:19,950
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1281
02:28:19,974 --> 02:28:21,327
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1282
02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:22,411
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1283
02:28:22,435 --> 02:28:23,829
Full base evacuation! Everyone out!

1284
02:28:23,853 --> 02:28:26,094
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1285
02:28:26,272 --> 02:28:29,014
<i>Remain calm
and proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

1286
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:37,196
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

1287
02:28:37,367 --> 02:28:40,154
Go! Go! Everybody out! Come on! Move!

1288
02:28:40,328 --> 02:28:41,943
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1289
02:28:42,122 --> 02:28:43,612
Everybody out! Go!

1290
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:06,642
Yes! Gotcha!

1291
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:09,683
Post Commander,
this is Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1292
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:12,315
- <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
- This is a false alarm.

1293
02:29:12,485 --> 02:29:15,022
Someone has hacked into the system.
We must alert...

1294
02:29:24,998 --> 02:29:26,408
Victor.

1295
02:29:28,168 --> 02:29:30,329
<i>Dr. Stone, you there? I don't copy.</i>

1296
02:29:31,379 --> 02:29:32,379
I was mistaken.

1297
02:29:32,547 --> 02:29:33,753
The alarm's legit.

1298
02:29:33,923 --> 02:29:35,504
Everybody out. And nobody, I repeat,

1299
02:29:35,675 --> 02:29:38,417
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1300
02:29:38,595 --> 02:29:39,835
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1301
02:29:50,482 --> 02:29:51,834
Get the civilians out!

1302
02:29:51,858 --> 02:29:53,098
Let's go! Let's go!

1303
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,632
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1304
02:29:58,656 --> 02:29:59,656
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1305
02:30:32,982 --> 02:30:34,222
This way.

1306
02:30:44,827 --> 02:30:46,783
It knows he's here.

1307
02:30:47,956 --> 02:30:49,947
That's intense.

1308
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,285
This is amazing.

1309
02:30:57,131 --> 02:30:58,337
This is crazy.

1310
02:30:58,508 --> 02:31:00,373
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1311
02:31:00,552 --> 02:31:02,918
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1312
02:33:28,908 --> 02:33:30,739
<i>Systems coming online.</i>

1313
02:33:33,663 --> 02:33:35,369
<i>Welcome, Victor.</i>

1314
02:33:36,124 --> 02:33:37,830
<i>Would you like to assume command?</i>

1315
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:38,917
I'm in.

1316
02:33:48,344 --> 02:33:50,551
The ship says the Mother Box is hostile.

1317
02:33:50,722 --> 02:33:52,383
I can override the security protocols,

1318
02:33:52,557 --> 02:33:54,326
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1319
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:56,716
that Luthor's power surges caused
to the primary capacitors.

1320
02:33:56,811 --> 02:33:57,971
English.

1321
02:33:58,146 --> 02:34:00,182
There's not enough charge to wake the box.

1322
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:02,555
I might be able to do it.

1323
02:34:04,902 --> 02:34:06,813
I mean, I might be able to jump-start it.

1324
02:34:06,988 --> 02:34:08,173
I don't like to break this rule,

1325
02:34:08,197 --> 02:34:10,108
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1326
02:34:10,283 --> 02:34:11,773
Look, crazy things happen to time,

1327
02:34:11,951 --> 02:34:14,533
but if I do it,
I create massive electrical power.

1328
02:34:14,704 --> 02:34:16,584
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1329
02:34:16,622 --> 02:34:18,783
I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

1330
02:34:18,958 --> 02:34:21,290
I might be able to wake the box,

1331
02:34:21,711 --> 02:34:23,292
if that's still what we want?

1332
02:34:23,463 --> 02:34:24,873
It is. Do it.

1333
02:34:29,719 --> 02:34:30,925
Hey, Miss Lane.

1334
02:34:31,012 --> 02:34:32,012
Morning.

1335
02:34:32,096 --> 02:34:33,336
I didn't think you were coming.

1336
02:34:34,474 --> 02:34:35,964
One last time.

1337
02:34:53,117 --> 02:34:56,484
I see engines,
so this must be the end of the line.

1338
02:34:56,996 --> 02:34:58,098
<i>So I'm in position.</i>

1339
02:35:00,958 --> 02:35:03,040
<i>Ready to initiate drop sequence.</i>

1340
02:35:03,503 --> 02:35:05,118
The Mother Box is ready.

1341
02:35:24,649 --> 02:35:26,480
The ship's begging me not to wake the box.

1342
02:35:26,567 --> 02:35:27,920
<i>This action is irreversible.</i>

1343
02:35:27,944 --> 02:35:29,838
It's afraid.
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.

1344
02:35:29,862 --> 02:35:31,602
We know that already. Continue.

1345
02:35:31,948 --> 02:35:34,405
<i>I strongly advise against activation.</i>

1346
02:35:34,575 --> 02:35:36,111
Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.

1347
02:35:36,285 --> 02:35:37,946
<i>This action is irreversible.</i>

1348
02:35:38,037 --> 02:35:39,157
- Five.
- <i>Five.</i>

1349
02:35:39,247 --> 02:35:40,474
Five.

1350
02:35:40,498 --> 02:35:41,558
- <i>Apokoliptian technology is hostile.</i>
- This is a bad idea.

1351
02:35:41,582 --> 02:35:42,582
No, it isn't. Keep going.

1352
02:35:42,685 --> 02:35:43,686
Four.

1353
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:44,812
- <i>Four.</i>
- Four.

1354
02:35:44,836 --> 02:35:46,063
<i>I strongly advise against activation.</i>

1355
02:35:46,087 --> 02:35:47,998
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1356
02:35:48,339 --> 02:35:49,483
- Three.
- <i>Three.</i>

1357
02:35:49,507 --> 02:35:50,507
Three.

1358
02:35:50,591 --> 02:35:52,502
- Two.
- <i>Two.</i>

1359
02:35:52,677 --> 02:35:54,383
- Two.
- <i>This course is irreversible.</i>

1360
02:35:54,470 --> 02:35:55,676
- One.
- <i>One.</i>

1361
02:35:56,722 --> 02:35:59,509
- One.
- <i>This action is irreversible.</i>

1362
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:30,020
- <i>Victor?</i>
- No.

1363
02:37:31,067 --> 02:37:32,067
Go?

1364
02:39:02,616 --> 02:39:05,528
<i>The future has taken root in the present.</i>

1365
02:39:05,619 --> 02:39:07,234
Get down!

1366
02:40:51,350 --> 02:40:52,886
He's back.

1367
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:22,627
Something's wrong. He's scanning us.

1368
02:41:24,758 --> 02:41:26,168
What?

1369
02:41:41,192 --> 02:41:42,192
Victor?

1370
02:41:43,485 --> 02:41:44,485
Victor?

1371
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:48,316
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1372
02:41:48,782 --> 02:41:50,318
It's my auto-defense system.

1373
02:41:50,492 --> 02:41:51,527
It senses danger.

1374
02:41:51,702 --> 02:41:52,862
Victor, no! Victor!

1375
02:41:53,037 --> 02:41:54,868
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1376
02:42:07,301 --> 02:42:08,461
Kal-El, no!

1377
02:42:16,852 --> 02:42:18,808
He's confused. He doesn't know who he is.

1378
02:42:25,986 --> 02:42:28,602
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

1379
02:42:59,186 --> 02:43:02,804
Kal-El, the last Son of Krypton,

1380
02:43:03,899 --> 02:43:06,106
remember who you are.

1381
02:43:07,736 --> 02:43:09,101
Tell me who you...

1382
02:44:43,957 --> 02:44:46,994
Let's go!

1383
02:44:54,218 --> 02:44:55,833
You should probably move.

1384
02:44:59,139 --> 02:45:00,139
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1385
02:45:00,307 --> 02:45:02,764
Get up. Take cover back there. Go.

1386
02:45:55,195 --> 02:45:57,231
Please don't make me do this.

1387
02:46:29,938 --> 02:46:31,053
Clark.

1388
02:46:32,149 --> 02:46:33,309
Clark, no.

1389
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:45,870
Clark.

1390
02:46:46,288 --> 02:46:47,448
No.

1391
02:46:48,290 --> 02:46:50,030
This world needs you.

1392
02:46:55,255 --> 02:46:56,255
Clark.

1393
02:46:56,632 --> 02:46:57,838
Clark.

1394
02:46:57,925 --> 02:46:59,961
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1395
02:47:01,595 --> 02:47:02,710
Clark.

1396
02:47:06,099 --> 02:47:07,464
Please.

1397
02:47:41,718 --> 02:47:42,833
Please.

1398
02:47:54,064 --> 02:47:55,224
Please.

1399
02:47:55,983 --> 02:47:57,769
Just go.

1400
02:47:58,235 --> 02:47:59,235
Yeah.

1401
02:48:00,112 --> 02:48:01,397
Let's go.

1402
02:48:33,979 --> 02:48:35,970
I'm so sorry.

1403
02:48:45,365 --> 02:48:46,365
Take cover!

1404
02:48:46,617 --> 02:48:49,108
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

1405
02:48:49,286 --> 02:48:50,321
Where is it?

1406
02:49:01,048 --> 02:49:02,254
Come on.

1407
02:49:03,175 --> 02:49:04,460
Come on.

1408
02:49:30,011 --> 02:49:33,056
<i>Attention, security breach detected.</i>

1409
02:49:33,622 --> 02:49:35,783
<i>Sector Four, Level Three.</i>

1410
02:49:35,957 --> 02:49:38,744
<i>Implement lockdown procedures immediately.</i>

1411
02:50:07,322 --> 02:50:08,903
Give me the Mother Box.

1412
02:50:22,087 --> 02:50:23,497
No, no, no.

1413
02:50:26,049 --> 02:50:27,755
Dad, wait! Don't!

1414
02:51:08,091 --> 02:51:10,958
So begins the end.

1415
02:51:16,725 --> 02:51:18,010
Victor?

1416
02:51:20,562 --> 02:51:23,679
Vic... Victor. Are you okay, man? Come on.

1417
02:51:29,696 --> 02:51:30,856
Victor?

1418
02:51:31,990 --> 02:51:33,446
He's dead.

1419
02:51:33,617 --> 02:51:34,617
What?

1420
02:51:35,702 --> 02:51:36,908
My father.

1421
02:51:38,371 --> 02:51:41,329
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1422
02:51:42,125 --> 02:51:43,410
Oh, my God.

1423
02:51:50,342 --> 02:51:52,424
His father's dead 'cause of us.

1424
02:51:52,594 --> 02:51:54,197
I told you waking that box was a bad idea.

1425
02:51:54,221 --> 02:51:55,802
It wasn't a bad idea.

1426
02:51:55,972 --> 02:51:58,304
We needed Superman. We still do.

1427
02:51:58,475 --> 02:52:00,761
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

1428
02:52:00,936 --> 02:52:03,928
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1429
02:52:04,105 --> 02:52:05,720
It is him.

1430
02:52:05,899 --> 02:52:08,015
He recognized Lois Lane.

1431
02:52:08,401 --> 02:52:10,312
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1432
02:52:10,695 --> 02:52:12,686
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1433
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:15,080
He went to her
'cause she wasn't afraid of him.

1434
02:52:15,158 --> 02:52:16,568
It's called instinct, Diana.

1435
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,831
Wait, where did Steppenwolf go?

1436
02:52:26,002 --> 02:52:27,602
He's gone back to his base

1437
02:52:27,671 --> 02:52:29,332
to assemble the three boxes.

1438
02:52:29,506 --> 02:52:31,025
And we don't know where his base is.

1439
02:52:31,049 --> 02:52:32,609
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1440
02:52:32,759 --> 02:52:34,420
The boxes synchronize, Unity forms,

1441
02:52:34,594 --> 02:52:36,835
we don't get there in time to stop it,
the planet dies.

1442
02:52:37,764 --> 02:52:39,425
This is not your...

1443
02:52:41,977 --> 02:52:43,467
He knew.

1444
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:45,351
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1445
02:52:45,522 --> 02:52:47,042
He wasn't trying to destroy the box,

1446
02:52:47,357 --> 02:52:49,268
he was trying to superheat it.

1447
02:52:49,442 --> 02:52:52,046
He made the core the hottest thing
on Earth outside of a nuclear reactor.

1448
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:53,297
Now, anything that hot would have to...

1449
02:52:53,321 --> 02:52:54,465
Blink off the charts

1450
02:52:54,489 --> 02:52:56,696
on a thermal imaging system.

1451
02:52:56,867 --> 02:53:00,234
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1452
02:53:00,412 --> 02:53:02,412
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1453
02:53:02,455 --> 02:53:04,446
to scan the Earth for thermal anomalies.

1454
02:53:04,624 --> 02:53:05,739
I'm already on it.

1455
02:53:05,917 --> 02:53:07,908
I'm sorry. You have a satellite?

1456
02:53:08,086 --> 02:53:09,086
I have six.

1457
02:53:09,588 --> 02:53:10,623
Right.

1458
02:53:12,424 --> 02:53:14,415
Let's go find the son of a bitch.

1459
02:53:38,992 --> 02:53:41,074
You brought us here.

1460
02:53:41,244 --> 02:53:42,404
You remembered.

1461
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,945
This is home.

1462
02:53:46,875 --> 02:53:48,081
You spoke.

1463
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:53,995
Did I not before?

1464
02:54:27,999 --> 02:54:30,536
Your mother got behind on the payments.

1465
02:54:32,045 --> 02:54:34,036
She never told anyone.

1466
02:54:35,715 --> 02:54:37,455
I don't understand.

1467
02:54:40,553 --> 02:54:42,965
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1468
02:54:46,101 --> 02:54:47,466
Here.

1469
02:55:02,409 --> 02:55:04,070
She loved it here.

1470
02:55:14,879 --> 02:55:16,494
So did I.

1471
02:55:18,508 --> 02:55:19,918
So did I.

1472
02:55:45,577 --> 02:55:46,862
Wow!

1473
02:55:47,037 --> 02:55:48,652
This is awesome.

1474
02:55:48,830 --> 02:55:50,320
Brought some friends.

1475
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:59,462
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1476
02:55:59,632 --> 02:56:02,123
Everyone, this is Alfred. I work for him.

1477
02:56:02,302 --> 02:56:04,509
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1478
02:56:10,977 --> 02:56:12,842
It's badass, Alfred.

1479
02:56:15,648 --> 02:56:18,060
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1480
02:56:18,234 --> 02:56:19,234
Great.

1481
02:56:19,402 --> 02:56:21,233
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1482
02:56:24,157 --> 02:56:26,990
There's the Mother Box, right there.

1483
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:28,946
Go to visible spectrum.

1484
02:56:30,997 --> 02:56:32,658
Pozharnov.

1485
02:56:33,249 --> 02:56:36,082
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

1486
02:56:36,252 --> 02:56:38,918
It's been abandoned since
the nuclear accident there 30 years ago.

1487
02:56:39,089 --> 02:56:40,295
Not even the army goes in.

1488
02:56:40,465 --> 02:56:41,901
Right, it's probably so radioactive

1489
02:56:41,925 --> 02:56:44,086
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1490
02:56:44,177 --> 02:56:45,177
Not anymore.

1491
02:56:45,261 --> 02:56:47,252
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1492
02:56:47,347 --> 02:56:48,382
Zoom.

1493
02:56:52,435 --> 02:56:53,800
What the hell is he building?

1494
02:56:53,978 --> 02:56:55,218
The Unity's in there.

1495
02:56:55,396 --> 02:56:56,806
We'll attack from above.

1496
02:56:56,981 --> 02:56:59,563
Explosives won't separate the boxes,

1497
02:56:59,734 --> 02:57:01,565
only strengthen their bond.

1498
02:57:01,736 --> 02:57:03,005
What, so we can't blow it up?

1499
02:57:03,029 --> 02:57:04,485
Not from the outside.

1500
02:57:06,074 --> 02:57:08,440
I want to plug into The Unity, one-on-one.

1501
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:10,570
Fuse with it.

1502
02:57:10,745 --> 02:57:13,432
Weaken its bond from the inside
so we can break it back into three.

1503
02:57:13,456 --> 02:57:15,663
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1504
02:57:15,834 --> 02:57:19,372
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1505
02:57:19,546 --> 02:57:21,878
These boxes together are world destroyers.

1506
02:57:22,048 --> 02:57:23,458
A billion years old.

1507
02:57:23,633 --> 02:57:25,749
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1508
02:57:25,927 --> 02:57:28,088
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1509
02:57:28,263 --> 02:57:30,254
Just get me in and get me time.

1510
02:57:30,515 --> 02:57:31,675
You could die, Victor.

1511
02:57:31,850 --> 02:57:34,136
If I don't, we all die. Period.

1512
02:57:38,898 --> 02:57:40,638
I got nothing left.

1513
02:57:46,030 --> 02:57:47,986
You wanted me to use these gifts, right?

1514
02:57:51,077 --> 02:57:52,567
That's what I'm gonna do.

1515
02:57:52,745 --> 02:57:54,610
Okay.

1516
02:57:55,331 --> 02:57:56,946
So if Victor wants to try
to save the world

1517
02:57:57,041 --> 02:57:58,577
by fusing with the doom boxes,

1518
02:57:58,793 --> 02:58:00,954
I say we put him in the doom boxes.

1519
02:58:01,296 --> 02:58:04,083
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1520
02:58:04,257 --> 02:58:06,464
Fighting the devil and his army

1521
02:58:06,634 --> 02:58:07,669
in hell.

1522
02:58:07,844 --> 02:58:10,085
I mean, this guy's probably fought

1523
02:58:10,263 --> 02:58:12,595
hundreds of thousands of other superbeings

1524
02:58:12,682 --> 02:58:14,362
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1525
02:58:14,392 --> 02:58:15,882
And we have to assume he's won.

1526
02:58:16,060 --> 02:58:19,177
I don't care how many demons
he's fought in how many hells.

1527
02:58:19,355 --> 02:58:22,847
He's never fought us. Not us united.

1528
02:59:13,326 --> 02:59:14,941
Take that as a "yes."

1529
02:59:15,078 --> 02:59:16,409
What?

1530
02:59:19,874 --> 02:59:21,114
The ring.

1531
02:59:24,837 --> 02:59:26,373
You're really back.

1532
02:59:59,872 --> 03:00:02,079
I have a second chance, Lo.

1533
03:00:04,377 --> 03:00:06,834
And I am not gonna waste it.

1534
03:01:05,104 --> 03:01:06,264
Are you really you?

1535
03:01:06,439 --> 03:01:08,145
I'm really me, Ma.

1536
03:01:26,167 --> 03:01:28,203
Listen, Ma.

1537
03:01:29,796 --> 03:01:31,832
They wanted me back for a reason.

1538
03:01:33,591 --> 03:01:35,127
I need to find out why.

1539
03:01:55,279 --> 03:01:56,689
How's Victor doing?

1540
03:02:01,077 --> 03:02:03,819
You know, wanted to be by himself.

1541
03:02:05,415 --> 03:02:08,578
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1542
03:02:08,751 --> 03:02:11,542
to go up against the most
powerful machines in the universe.

1543
03:02:13,381 --> 03:02:14,871
It's not fair.

1544
03:02:16,634 --> 03:02:18,249
I thought you didn't care?

1545
03:02:19,679 --> 03:02:21,169
I never said that.

1546
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:35,520
What is it?

1547
03:02:39,449 --> 03:02:42,441
I had a dream, like, I don't know,

1548
03:02:42,535 --> 03:02:44,446
almost like a premonition.

1549
03:02:45,413 --> 03:02:48,200
It was the end of the world

1550
03:02:48,374 --> 03:02:51,207
and Barry Allen was right here

1551
03:02:51,377 --> 03:02:55,245
and he said to me, "Lois Lane is the key."

1552
03:02:57,925 --> 03:03:01,133
She is, to Superman.

1553
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:03,795
Every heart has one.

1554
03:03:04,432 --> 03:03:06,297
I think it's something more.

1555
03:03:07,185 --> 03:03:09,050
Something darker.

1556
03:03:13,232 --> 03:03:14,232
Master Wayne.

1557
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,890
Master Wayne!

1558
03:03:16,736 --> 03:03:18,397
You need to see this.

1559
03:03:41,677 --> 03:03:43,383
You fixed it.

1560
03:03:43,554 --> 03:03:45,260
It wanted to fly.

1561
03:03:46,516 --> 03:03:47,847
Flight is its nature.

1562
03:03:48,017 --> 03:03:49,302
Yours, too.

1563
03:03:56,108 --> 03:03:58,064
He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.

1564
03:03:58,236 --> 03:03:59,851
What makes you so sure?

1565
03:04:00,613 --> 03:04:03,195
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1566
03:04:25,304 --> 03:04:26,885
At last.

1567
03:04:28,724 --> 03:04:31,431
Prepare for his arrival.

1568
03:04:33,271 --> 03:04:37,389
My redemption is nigh.

1569
03:04:45,283 --> 03:04:46,739
Unite.

1570
03:04:51,914 --> 03:04:54,405
Synchronize.

1571
03:05:38,753 --> 03:05:41,665
The satellites revealed
he's created a defensive dome.

1572
03:05:41,839 --> 03:05:42,999
It's a design flaw.

1573
03:05:43,174 --> 03:05:45,415
Take out the tower, the dome will fall.

1574
03:05:45,593 --> 03:05:47,584
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1575
03:05:47,762 --> 03:05:51,258
Right, probably 'cause he didn't think
anyone would be that nuts.

1576
03:05:52,266 --> 03:05:53,551
Bruce is right.

1577
03:05:53,726 --> 03:05:55,307
We've got to destroy the defensive dome

1578
03:05:55,478 --> 03:05:57,764
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1579
03:05:57,938 --> 03:05:59,644
What if the dome's not destroyed?

1580
03:05:59,815 --> 03:06:00,815
It'll be destroyed.

1581
03:06:00,983 --> 03:06:02,983
Once Victor is linked with The Unity,

1582
03:06:03,110 --> 03:06:04,316
with Barry's help,

1583
03:06:04,403 --> 03:06:06,359
he'll break through The Unity's defenses.

1584
03:06:06,530 --> 03:06:08,050
Remind me, how's that again?

1585
03:06:08,157 --> 03:06:09,772
With the power of love.

1586
03:06:09,950 --> 03:06:12,566
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1587
03:06:12,745 --> 03:06:13,745
Good.

1588
03:06:13,913 --> 03:06:15,932
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1589
03:06:15,956 --> 03:06:18,117
to generate a charge of that size.

1590
03:06:18,668 --> 03:06:20,659
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1591
03:06:21,003 --> 03:06:23,870
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1592
03:06:24,048 --> 03:06:25,913
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

1593
03:06:26,092 --> 03:06:28,834
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1594
03:06:29,512 --> 03:06:32,549
We actually finally have a plan.

1595
03:06:33,099 --> 03:06:34,805
We have a plan.

1596
03:06:50,157 --> 03:06:52,193
<i>The symbol of the house of El means hope.</i>

1597
03:06:52,368 --> 03:06:54,529
<i>Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief</i>

1598
03:06:54,704 --> 03:06:58,413
<i>in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.</i>

1599
03:06:58,582 --> 03:06:59,582
<i>Clark...</i>

1600
03:06:59,667 --> 03:07:01,019
<i>That's what you can bring them.</i>

1601
03:07:01,043 --> 03:07:02,999
<i>...you were sent here for a reason.</i>

1602
03:07:03,170 --> 03:07:05,081
<i>You will give the people of Earth</i>

1603
03:07:05,172 --> 03:07:07,037
<i>an ideal to strive towards.</i>

1604
03:07:07,717 --> 03:07:09,695
<i>And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,</i>

1605
03:07:09,719 --> 03:07:13,462
<i>you owe it to yourself
to find out what that reason is.</i>

1606
03:07:13,639 --> 03:07:16,255
<i>They will stumble, they will fall.</i>

1607
03:07:16,434 --> 03:07:18,234
<i>You're gonna have to make a choice.</i>

1608
03:07:18,561 --> 03:07:20,973
<i>They will join you in the sun, Kal.</i>

1609
03:07:21,147 --> 03:07:25,105
<i>A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.</i>

1610
03:07:25,276 --> 03:07:28,439
<i>You will help them accomplish wonders.</i>

1611
03:07:45,588 --> 03:07:50,082
<i>All the hopes and dreams of Krypton
live in you now.</i>

1612
03:07:50,259 --> 03:07:52,500
<i>I'm so proud of you, son.</i>

1613
03:07:53,846 --> 03:07:55,882
<i>Your mother and I loved you.</i>

1614
03:07:56,557 --> 03:08:00,091
<i>Your mother and I knew
you would change the world.</i>

1615
03:08:01,395 --> 03:08:03,226
<i>Your heart was tested.</i>

1616
03:08:04,523 --> 03:08:06,479
<i>I know it's been hard, Clark.</i>

1617
03:08:07,234 --> 03:08:10,146
<i>But you gave hope to their world.</i>

1618
03:08:10,321 --> 03:08:12,983
<i>You need to show them who you are.</i>

1619
03:08:13,699 --> 03:08:15,405
<i>Love them, Kal.</i>

1620
03:08:16,035 --> 03:08:18,151
<i>The way we loved you.</i>

1621
03:08:20,623 --> 03:08:21,738
<i>Fly, son.</i>

1622
03:08:22,792 --> 03:08:23,998
<i>It's time.</i>

1623
03:09:27,773 --> 03:09:30,897
I'm gonna take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1624
03:09:31,068 --> 03:09:32,183
Whatever you see,

1625
03:09:33,529 --> 03:09:34,644
stick to the plan.

1626
03:09:37,366 --> 03:09:39,277
It's why I brought you together.

1627
03:10:19,366 --> 03:10:21,106
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1628
03:10:24,246 --> 03:10:26,953
Just have to knock a little louder.

1629
03:10:51,941 --> 03:10:52,941
Kill him!

1630
03:10:53,692 --> 03:10:56,434
Get to the carriage. Defend The Unity.

1631
03:11:01,659 --> 03:11:02,659
Oh, shit.

1632
03:11:22,805 --> 03:11:23,885
The tower's down.

1633
03:11:26,225 --> 03:11:27,225
Do you read me?

1634
03:11:27,559 --> 03:11:28,674
Yeah, loud and clear.

1635
03:11:29,770 --> 03:11:31,135
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1636
03:11:32,398 --> 03:11:34,980
<i>Bruce? Bruce?</i>

1637
03:11:35,275 --> 03:11:36,390
Get to the reactor.

1638
03:11:36,485 --> 03:11:37,671
I'll lure as many of these monsters

1639
03:11:37,695 --> 03:11:39,811
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

1640
03:11:42,825 --> 03:11:44,816
Don't worry about me. Get to The Unity.

1641
03:11:47,496 --> 03:11:48,611
They're here.

1642
03:11:48,706 --> 03:11:49,866
<i>Bruce?</i>

1643
03:11:52,876 --> 03:11:54,161
Comm went dead.

1644
03:11:55,879 --> 03:11:57,119
Let's go.

1645
03:12:36,045 --> 03:12:37,876
Come on, follow me, you damn insects.

1646
03:13:57,835 --> 03:13:59,195
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1647
03:14:39,001 --> 03:14:40,241
You really are outta your mind.

1648
03:15:07,154 --> 03:15:08,269
You're welcome.

1649
03:15:08,447 --> 03:15:09,732
My man.

1650
03:16:42,833 --> 03:16:44,448
Yeah, we got this.

1651
03:16:44,626 --> 03:16:45,991
You go do your thing.

1652
03:17:41,808 --> 03:17:43,298
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1653
03:17:45,187 --> 03:17:46,472
Master Kent.

1654
03:17:48,523 --> 03:17:50,013
He said you'd come.

1655
03:17:51,735 --> 03:17:55,148
Now, let's hope you're not too late.

1656
03:18:05,999 --> 03:18:08,285
Hey!

1657
03:18:16,385 --> 03:18:17,716
Remember me?

1658
03:18:20,263 --> 03:18:21,673
Round two?

1659
03:18:22,391 --> 03:18:23,551
Hell yeah.

1660
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:46,445
Shall we?

1661
03:18:47,416 --> 03:18:49,702
Tell me, Amazon,

1662
03:18:49,876 --> 03:18:53,164
why did you abandon your own sisters

1663
03:18:54,089 --> 03:18:56,546
only to cast your lot with these creatures

1664
03:18:56,716 --> 03:18:59,958
clinging to their puny lives?

1665
03:19:00,178 --> 03:19:03,011
You weren't there to protect them from me.

1666
03:19:03,265 --> 03:19:05,301
And, sadly, you could have.

1667
03:19:46,266 --> 03:19:47,972
Barry, I'm in position.

1668
03:20:06,745 --> 03:20:09,452
Okay. I built the charge.

1669
03:20:10,081 --> 03:20:11,161
<i>You call it.</i>

1670
03:20:12,334 --> 03:20:13,574
Barry, on one.

1671
03:20:14,252 --> 03:20:16,208
Three, two...

1672
03:20:19,382 --> 03:20:20,747
Get the hell off me!

1673
03:20:21,259 --> 03:20:22,590
Victor!

1674
03:20:58,672 --> 03:21:00,208
Victor!

1675
03:21:04,052 --> 03:21:06,543
I watched your island burn,

1676
03:21:06,721 --> 03:21:10,179
your sisters begging for their lives.

1677
03:21:10,350 --> 03:21:12,591
As did your mother.

1678
03:21:12,978 --> 03:21:13,978
Liar.

1679
03:21:39,713 --> 03:21:41,704
I can't maintain this!

1680
03:21:42,591 --> 03:21:43,591
Victor!

1681
03:22:05,822 --> 03:22:08,029
Victor, I can't hold this!

1682
03:22:14,706 --> 03:22:16,947
For Darkseid.

1683
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:23,286
Not impressed.

1684
03:23:07,801 --> 03:23:08,916
All right.

1685
03:23:09,094 --> 03:23:10,675
Kal-El.

1686
03:23:49,217 --> 03:23:51,424
Barry, I'm connected to The Unity.

1687
03:23:51,594 --> 03:23:53,550
I need the charge to get inside.

1688
03:24:15,618 --> 03:24:16,618
Barry?

1689
03:24:17,537 --> 03:24:19,198
Barry, are you okay?

1690
03:24:20,832 --> 03:24:21,872
<i>Barry!</i>

1691
03:24:21,916 --> 03:24:23,326
I got the wind knocked out of me.

1692
03:24:23,418 --> 03:24:25,409
Need a few seconds, that's all!

1693
03:24:42,520 --> 03:24:45,353
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1694
03:24:45,607 --> 03:24:47,347
Okay, okay.

1695
03:24:47,734 --> 03:24:50,350
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1696
03:24:50,528 --> 03:24:52,189
Heal. Heal.

1697
03:25:18,056 --> 03:25:19,592
Barry!

1698
03:25:32,529 --> 03:25:34,235
It's too late.

1699
03:25:35,573 --> 03:25:36,983
Oh, no.

1700
03:25:41,204 --> 03:25:42,865
He's here!

1701
03:26:12,360 --> 03:26:13,395
Okay.

1702
03:26:13,486 --> 03:26:14,922
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1703
03:26:14,946 --> 03:26:16,090
Far beyond the speed of light.

1704
03:26:16,114 --> 03:26:19,359
You gotta break the rule, Barry,
and you gotta do it now.

1705
03:26:32,422 --> 03:26:34,128
Dad,

1706
03:26:37,969 --> 03:26:40,301
whatever happens, I want you to know

1707
03:26:43,016 --> 03:26:45,007
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1708
03:26:48,229 --> 03:26:50,140
One of the best of the best.

1709
03:27:45,578 --> 03:27:48,115
Make your own future.

1710
03:27:54,587 --> 03:27:56,543
Make your own past.

1711
03:28:01,135 --> 03:28:04,673
It's all right now.

1712
03:28:51,728 --> 03:28:53,889
We've been waiting for you, Victor.

1713
03:28:55,023 --> 03:28:57,105
My broken boy.

1714
03:28:59,527 --> 03:29:01,518
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1715
03:29:01,696 --> 03:29:03,357
We'll be together again.

1716
03:29:11,205 --> 03:29:13,287
We can put it back, Vic.

1717
03:29:17,628 --> 03:29:19,744
Make you whole again.

1718
03:29:31,601 --> 03:29:33,341
I'm not broken.

1719
03:29:43,071 --> 03:29:44,936
And I'm not alone.

1720
03:30:01,756 --> 03:30:02,756
Superman!

1721
03:31:33,431 --> 03:31:35,387
I told you

1722
03:31:36,976 --> 03:31:39,592
Steppenwolf would fail.

1723
03:31:40,563 --> 03:31:44,226
Yes. Yes, you did.

1724
03:31:44,901 --> 03:31:46,266
My master,

1725
03:31:46,360 --> 03:31:49,397
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1726
03:31:50,281 --> 03:31:54,024
how will you retrieve your great prize?

1727
03:31:54,285 --> 03:31:57,698
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1728
03:31:57,872 --> 03:32:02,536
And we will stop at nothing to possess it.

1729
03:32:05,713 --> 03:32:07,203
Ready the armada.

1730
03:32:08,132 --> 03:32:10,544
We will use the old ways.

1731
03:34:34,904 --> 03:34:37,020
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1732
03:34:44,330 --> 03:34:48,660
<i>Now, let me speak to you from my heart,
not as a scientist,</i>

1733
03:34:48,834 --> 03:34:50,495
<i>as a father.</i>

1734
03:34:50,628 --> 03:34:53,745
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1735
03:34:56,300 --> 03:34:59,713
<i>I brought you into the world
and back to it.</i>

1736
03:34:59,887 --> 03:35:03,505
<i>You can't imagine how proud I am
of who you are.</i>

1737
03:35:04,058 --> 03:35:05,719
<i>Have always been.</i>

1738
03:35:07,853 --> 03:35:12,726
<i>So many years with you I wasted.
So many wrongs I've left un-righted.</i>

1739
03:35:15,194 --> 03:35:17,059
<i>Everything breaks, Victor.</i>

1740
03:35:17,655 --> 03:35:19,896
<i>Everything changes.</i>

1741
03:35:30,584 --> 03:35:32,666
I gotta go see my father.

1742
03:36:08,247 --> 03:36:10,078
<i>The world is hurt.</i>

1743
03:36:10,249 --> 03:36:11,329
<i>Broken.</i>

1744
03:36:11,500 --> 03:36:13,286
<i>Unexchangeable.</i>

1745
03:36:14,086 --> 03:36:15,747
Ship's all yours now, kid.

1746
03:36:15,838 --> 03:36:17,169
You're the boss.

1747
03:36:19,467 --> 03:36:22,630
"Ryan Choi, Director of Nanotechnology."

1748
03:36:22,803 --> 03:36:24,293
That's your thing.

1749
03:36:24,972 --> 03:36:26,382
Yep.

1750
03:36:26,974 --> 03:36:28,555
That's my thing.

1751
03:36:33,606 --> 03:36:37,690
<i>But the world's not fixed in the past,</i>

1752
03:36:37,776 --> 03:36:38,936
<i>only the future.</i>

1753
03:36:40,821 --> 03:36:44,689
<i>The not yet. The now.</i>

1754
03:36:44,867 --> 03:36:47,825
Wow. Must be 100, 150 feet.

1755
03:36:48,412 --> 03:36:49,743
Must be.

1756
03:36:50,873 --> 03:36:52,488
Big round table.

1757
03:36:52,666 --> 03:36:54,827
Six chairs, right there.

1758
03:36:55,961 --> 03:36:57,576
But room for more.

1759
03:37:00,007 --> 03:37:01,622
But room for more.

1760
03:37:02,635 --> 03:37:04,375
God help us.

1761
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:08,171
<i>The now is you.</i>

1762
03:37:11,894 --> 03:37:13,259
What?

1763
03:37:13,437 --> 03:37:16,224
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1764
03:37:16,398 --> 03:37:18,764
But my foot's in the door.

1765
03:37:18,943 --> 03:37:20,524
This is like a "job" job?

1766
03:37:21,320 --> 03:37:22,435
"Job" job.

1767
03:37:26,116 --> 03:37:28,698
Your foot's in the door.

1768
03:37:31,038 --> 03:37:32,238
Isn't that a thing people say?

1769
03:37:32,331 --> 03:37:34,242
Your foot's in the door.

1770
03:37:34,416 --> 03:37:36,702
Yeah, that's something people say, man.

1771
03:37:36,877 --> 03:37:38,563
His foot's in the door!

1772
03:37:38,587 --> 03:37:41,044
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1773
03:37:41,257 --> 03:37:42,588
Taught him nothing he knows.

1774
03:37:42,758 --> 03:37:45,118
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna get maced again.

1775
03:37:48,305 --> 03:37:50,011
No stopping you now.

1776
03:37:52,142 --> 03:37:53,382
Thanks, Dad.

1777
03:37:53,561 --> 03:37:54,596
<i>Now.</i>

1778
03:37:54,770 --> 03:37:57,853
<i>Now's your time, Victor, to rise.</i>

1779
03:37:58,148 --> 03:38:01,106
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1780
03:38:01,277 --> 03:38:04,644
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1781
03:38:15,082 --> 03:38:17,539
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1782
03:38:18,002 --> 03:38:19,993
I bought the bank.

1783
03:38:22,423 --> 03:38:24,709
Congratulations, by the way.

1784
03:38:25,050 --> 03:38:26,586
<i>Do this. Be this.</i>

1785
03:38:26,969 --> 03:38:31,133
<i>The man I never was. The hero you are.</i>

1786
03:38:32,308 --> 03:38:34,594
<i>Take your place among the brave ones.</i>

1787
03:38:34,768 --> 03:38:39,683
<i>The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.</i>

1788
03:39:12,348 --> 03:39:15,260
<i>It's time you stand,</i>

1789
03:39:19,021 --> 03:39:20,511
<i>fight,</i>

1790
03:39:23,150 --> 03:39:24,560
<i>discover,</i>

1791
03:39:29,323 --> 03:39:31,405
<i>heal, love,</i>

1792
03:39:34,995 --> 03:39:36,030
<i>win.</i>

1793
03:40:02,648 --> 03:40:04,229
<i>The time</i>

1794
03:40:04,525 --> 03:40:05,890
<i>is now.</i>

1795
03:40:15,077 --> 03:40:16,317
Ready?

1796
03:40:16,495 --> 03:40:17,780
Come on, Stevens.

1797
03:40:21,417 --> 03:40:23,257
All right, let's keep it moving.

1798
03:40:24,628 --> 03:40:25,743
Keep going.

1799
03:40:27,548 --> 03:40:29,288
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1800
03:40:32,970 --> 03:40:34,085
Luthor.

1801
03:40:39,101 --> 03:40:40,141
Open up two, Carl, please.

1802
03:40:49,278 --> 03:40:50,563
Luthor.

1803
03:40:55,617 --> 03:40:57,232
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,

1804
03:40:57,327 --> 03:40:58,817
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1805
03:42:27,459 --> 03:42:29,370
Ah, there he is.

1806
03:42:30,128 --> 03:42:31,368
Welcome aboard.

1807
03:42:31,547 --> 03:42:33,333
Care for a glass of Gout de Diamants?

1808
03:42:33,507 --> 03:42:35,372
I was just celebrating God's return.

1809
03:42:35,551 --> 03:42:37,837
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1810
03:42:38,220 --> 03:42:40,544
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

1811
03:42:40,681 --> 03:42:42,342
I was, thank you,

1812
03:42:42,516 --> 03:42:46,808
until the good doctors at Arkham
helped me find some much needed clarity.

1813
03:42:46,979 --> 03:42:49,186
Now, you volunteered to destroy the bat

1814
03:42:49,273 --> 03:42:50,273
free of charge.

1815
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:51,930
Why the pro bono work?

1816
03:42:52,317 --> 03:42:53,773
It's personal.

1817
03:42:54,444 --> 03:42:57,231
Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye?

1818
03:42:59,324 --> 03:43:01,030
You said you had something I'd want?

1819
03:43:01,201 --> 03:43:02,641
You'd better not be wasting my time.

1820
03:43:03,036 --> 03:43:04,867
And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1821
03:43:04,955 --> 03:43:06,695
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1822
03:43:06,874 --> 03:43:08,205
I have too much to live for.

1823
03:43:08,292 --> 03:43:10,453
And more important things to do.

1824
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:14,878
But if you want the Batman,

1825
03:43:15,048 --> 03:43:18,131
here is something that can help you.

1826
03:43:19,469 --> 03:43:23,587
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1827
03:43:26,810 --> 03:43:29,222
On second thought,

1828
03:43:31,565 --> 03:43:33,476
we do have something to celebrate.

1829
03:43:34,610 --> 03:43:36,020
Good boy.

1830
03:44:40,342 --> 03:44:41,548
Clear.

1831
03:44:47,057 --> 03:44:48,547
How much further?

1832
03:44:49,810 --> 03:44:51,016
We're almost there.

1833
03:44:53,271 --> 03:44:54,807
Well, we need to hurry.

1834
03:44:54,982 --> 03:44:56,582
We can't be out in the open much longer.

1835
03:44:56,650 --> 03:44:58,265
He'll come for us.

1836
03:45:01,238 --> 03:45:02,853
Let him come.

1837
03:45:03,365 --> 03:45:04,980
Let the bastard come.

1838
03:45:06,451 --> 03:45:08,533
I'll stab this through his heart

1839
03:45:08,620 --> 03:45:10,235
for what he did to Arthur.

1840
03:45:11,039 --> 03:45:12,950
I want to make him pay.

1841
03:45:14,668 --> 03:45:16,954
I understand how you feel, Mera.

1842
03:45:17,462 --> 03:45:19,953
You have no idea how I feel.

1843
03:45:20,465 --> 03:45:24,587
But we have to stick to the plan
to have any chance to make this right.

1844
03:45:32,519 --> 03:45:35,932
Who have you ever loved?

1845
03:45:50,078 --> 03:45:53,241
<i>Au contraire,</i> my little fish stick.

1846
03:45:57,002 --> 03:46:00,418
He knows exactly what it's like
to lose someone he loves.

1847
03:46:02,382 --> 03:46:04,623
You know, like

1848
03:46:05,969 --> 03:46:07,334
a father,

1849
03:46:08,805 --> 03:46:10,136
like a mother.

1850
03:46:11,141 --> 03:46:14,178
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1851
03:46:15,854 --> 03:46:17,845
Like an adopted son.

1852
03:46:21,610 --> 03:46:23,225
Isn't that right,

1853
03:46:24,780 --> 03:46:26,236
Batman?

1854
03:46:29,493 --> 03:46:32,700
Maybe, in a way,
that smelly old flounder is right.

1855
03:46:34,539 --> 03:46:37,281
Because how many can die in your arms

1856
03:46:37,375 --> 03:46:38,831
before you grow numb to death?

1857
03:46:40,420 --> 03:46:42,285
That's not very careful.

1858
03:46:43,548 --> 03:46:46,665
And how many dead eyes can you look into

1859
03:46:47,385 --> 03:46:49,751
before you die inside yourself?

1860
03:46:50,305 --> 03:46:53,968
I've been dead inside a long time,

1861
03:46:54,142 --> 03:46:56,053
but even I have a limit.

1862
03:46:56,228 --> 03:46:58,081
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

1863
03:46:58,105 --> 03:47:00,391
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1864
03:47:01,108 --> 03:47:02,894
You won't kill me.

1865
03:47:03,777 --> 03:47:05,733
I'm your best friend.

1866
03:47:06,238 --> 03:47:10,277
Besides, who's gonna
give you a reach-around?

1867
03:47:12,285 --> 03:47:13,650
Anyway,

1868
03:47:14,955 --> 03:47:16,491
you need me.

1869
03:47:19,584 --> 03:47:25,208
You need me to help you undo this world
you created by letting her die.

1870
03:47:27,801 --> 03:47:29,041
Poor Lois.

1871
03:47:29,845 --> 03:47:32,632
How she suffered so!

1872
03:47:38,520 --> 03:47:39,976
I often wonder

1873
03:47:40,939 --> 03:47:42,804
how many alternate timelines

1874
03:47:42,899 --> 03:47:45,060
do you destroy the world because,

1875
03:47:46,236 --> 03:47:50,400
frankly, you don't have the cojones
to die yourself.

1876
03:47:54,995 --> 03:47:58,783
So, as usual, I'll be the bigger man.

1877
03:48:02,627 --> 03:48:04,083
A truce,

1878
03:48:04,921 --> 03:48:06,206
Bruce.

1879
03:48:08,967 --> 03:48:13,051
As long as you have this card, a truce.

1880
03:48:16,099 --> 03:48:18,090
But all you have to do is tear it in half

1881
03:48:18,185 --> 03:48:19,453
and I'm happy to discuss with you

1882
03:48:19,477 --> 03:48:22,469
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

1883
03:48:24,232 --> 03:48:26,063
to do a man's job.

1884
03:48:29,487 --> 03:48:31,273
You know, it's funny

1885
03:48:31,448 --> 03:48:34,489
that you would talk about people
who died in my arms,

1886
03:48:34,659 --> 03:48:36,365
because when I held Harley Quinn

1887
03:48:36,536 --> 03:48:38,993
and she was bleeding and dying,

1888
03:48:39,164 --> 03:48:42,702
she begged me with her last breath

1889
03:48:42,876 --> 03:48:45,117
that when I killed you,

1890
03:48:45,295 --> 03:48:48,708
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you,

1891
03:48:48,882 --> 03:48:50,713
that I'd do it slow.

1892
03:48:51,927 --> 03:48:53,883
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1893
03:49:24,501 --> 03:49:27,243
Oh. You're good.

1894
03:49:31,549 --> 03:49:33,130
You almost had me.

1895
03:49:52,612 --> 03:49:53,692
Where are we holing up?

1896
03:49:53,863 --> 03:49:56,104
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1897
03:49:56,574 --> 03:49:59,486
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

1898
03:49:59,577 --> 03:50:02,114
What do you think?

1899
03:50:08,211 --> 03:50:09,211
He's found us.

1900
03:51:38,385 --> 03:51:39,841
Can I help you?

1901
03:51:41,221 --> 03:51:44,713
I'm sure you know
Darkseid is not finished with Earth.

1902
03:51:44,891 --> 03:51:47,883
The Anti-Life Equation is here somewhere.

1903
03:51:48,061 --> 03:51:50,848
We have to find it before he does.

1904
03:51:51,022 --> 03:51:52,728
There's a war coming.

1905
03:51:53,024 --> 03:51:54,764
And I'm here to help.

1906
03:51:54,943 --> 03:51:57,184
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1907
03:51:57,362 --> 03:51:59,569
I've gone by many names

1908
03:51:59,656 --> 03:52:02,443
and taken many forms. And like you,

1909
03:52:03,076 --> 03:52:05,692
I've realized I have a stake in this world

1910
03:52:05,870 --> 03:52:08,327
and it's time I started fighting for it.

1911
03:52:09,082 --> 03:52:10,197
Oh.

1912
03:52:11,876 --> 03:52:13,992
Well, we could definitely use the help.

1913
03:52:14,212 --> 03:52:17,420
So, glad you're here.

1914
03:52:18,675 --> 03:52:20,959
You know, I never thought
I'd see the defenders of Earth

1915
03:52:21,010 --> 03:52:23,171
united and fighting as one.

1916
03:52:24,180 --> 03:52:26,546
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

1917
03:52:28,017 --> 03:52:30,383
Your mother and father would be proud.

1918
03:52:31,771 --> 03:52:32,931
I hope so.

1919
03:52:38,987 --> 03:52:41,945
Well, I'll be in touch.

1920
03:52:42,991 --> 03:52:47,030
Oh, and some have called me

1921
03:52:47,203 --> 03:52:49,489
the Martian Manhunter.

1922
03:52:57,213 --> 03:52:59,545
I guess I'll see you around.
