How is it?

Then make him.
He's gotta do this song.

12

But the lyrics are weak, man.

Of course! Why?

Singing about a girl

tears that...

I got this off someone.

Who?

68
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,451

Gap-sik?
I know him well.

Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

71

Who does your friend
work for now?

72
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,262
He left the biz, too.

73

What does he do?

74
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,505
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

75
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,406
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

76

- Yes.

Gone? To where?

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,478
Right after KANG Chul-kyu left...

91
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,655
KANG knows her well?

92
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,624
Of course.
He was totally in love with her.

93
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,129
Do you have KANG's number?

94
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,769
- He died.
- He's dead?

95
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,128
When?

96
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,633
About a month after
he married off EUN Won.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,776
Mr. KANG!

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,342
What was the name of his show?

99
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,407
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

100
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,743
Yeah, that's it!

101
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,946
He married off
the woman he loved?

102
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,826
- What does that mean?
- Well...

103
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,062
Tell us what happened.

104
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,430
It's a long story.

105
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,149
Hi, Chul-kyu!

106
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,235

<i>Without even talking to her.</i>

112
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,815
<i>I asked,</i>

113
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,789
<i>'Shouldn't you at least
say a few words, first?'</i>

114
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,485
<i>Then he said...</i>

115
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,390
<i>If you need words,
then how can mutes love?</i>

116

How did you know my name?

117
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,950
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

118
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,754
Want me to live with you?

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,401
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

120
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,507
We can't change our names.

00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,407
Why not?

122
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,886

<i>Even the very air she breathed.</i>

<i>Why did he drink the poison?</i>

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,362
<i>Perhaps he knew.</i>

145
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,160
<i>To love someone</i>

- I'll visit <i>often.</i>

147

<i>I</i> received so much from her

Wait!

It's the least I can do.

156
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,017
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

157
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:57,018
Have some soup with the Kimbap
and chew carefully.

158

Is this your new singer?

159

Greet them, girl.
They're the best writers in SBC.

00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,047
It's a new concept.
She's a cat.

164
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,346
It's Cat Girl.

165
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,817
This gal's got brains.

166
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,920
She's a student
at Seoul University.

167
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,594
Really?

168
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,925
It's Seoul University of Arts.

169
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,963
Whose side are you on?

170
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,730
You could get in trouble
for lying about schools these days.

171
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,234
If you're so holy,
go be a cop instead.

172
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,305
Sorry.

173
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,983
Mr. Kang!

174
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,974
How are you?

175
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,185
Here's Seung-chuFs new album.
It's deep.

176
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,782
- It's a sure hit.
- I'm sure it's great.

177
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,850
- Say hi.
- Hello.

178
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,125
Call me K.

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,487
Let's go for drinks some time.

180
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,229
- Sounds great.
- Bye.

181
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,093
Seoul Univ. of Arts.
Same difference.

182
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,394
That's right.

183
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,840
Did you eat, sir?

184
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,831
Mr. Kang!

185
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,133
- How've you been?
- I waited so long for you.

186
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,803
She's Cats.
Damn, I keep forgetting.

187
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,909
It's Cat Girl, sir.

188
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,816
Go on and
introduce yourself, girl.

189
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,714
I'm Cat Girl.
I promise to sing my heart out.

190
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,882
Thank you.

191
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,557
Of course you should.

192
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,788
Let's go some place quiet
to talk, Mr. Kang.

193
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,133
See you folks later.

194
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,928
- Come on, what are pals for.
- I can't.

195
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,877
It's just a show
of my appreciation.

196
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,667
The album's finished?

197
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,371
I put together all the best
songwriters around.

198
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,615
You know me,
I get what I want.

199
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,276
How is she?

200
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,780
Oh, her?
Not bad.

201
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,784
But she has trouble
getting along with the others.

202
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,119
Still she's got talent.
Be nice.

203
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,727
Of course.
Anything for you.

204
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,960
- But do this for me.
- I can't.

205
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,464
It's not much.
Please, take it!

206
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:23,864
I can't sleep
at the thought of you.

207
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:31,086
My dear love.

208
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:38,112
That part you just sang.
Try not to scream it this time.

209
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,586
You'll scare 'em off.

210
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,229
How, sir?

211
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,941
How would you feel
if someone screamed they loved you?

212
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,612
You know, softly and tenderly?
You're good at that.

213
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:01,310
What? Not that.
Stop making me do it.

214
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,048
- That's not what I meant!
- Roll it!

215
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,432
What's she so good at?

216
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,430
Drop it will ya, man?

217
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,871
Come on.
Just between us?

218
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:33,312
She's my future.
That's all I can tell ya, man.

219
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,987
Did you fix the second verse?

220
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,590
What?

221
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,325
The climax on the second verse.

222
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,758
'Always like yesterday'?

223
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,024
It's a little corny,
isn't it?

224
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,931
'A world without love?'
How's that?

225
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,934
Like that's not corny?

226
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,779
It's just a suggestion.

227
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:12,880
Let's not get too excited here.

228
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,528
You two write it, then.
I'm out.

229
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,597
What?

230
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,835
So feisty.

231
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,595
Do you have to become a singer?

232
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,090
What?

233
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,505
Got enough medication left?

234
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,184
My damn connection
to your family.

235
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,524
First your father, now you.

236
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,429
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

237
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,687
What's wrong?

238
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,060
What is it?

239
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,268
Don't cry.

240
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,794
Stop crying-

241
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,232
The bastards told me
to rewrite it.

242
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,941
'If I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

243
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,085
'If I could live again?'

244
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:31,089
If you could,
what would you like to be reborn as?

245
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,228
Besides a person?

246
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,961
Anything.

247
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,135
Well...

248
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,037
lf l could live again...

249
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,267
A ring?

250
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,679
Wait.

251
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,014
Start over.

252
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,755
If I could be born again...

253
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,327
A ring.

254
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,424
A pair of glasses.

255
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,563
A bed.

256
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,102
A diary.

257
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,731
Born again as things like that?
What fun is that?

258
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:25,306
You can buy me.
It'll always be right at your side.

259
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,085
So sensible.

260
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,511
Did you eat?

261
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,415
Of course, I did.

262
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,256
Well, I didn't.

263
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,193
Then let's eat.

264
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,604
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

265
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,336
Like what?

266
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,197
A deep, dark secret?

267
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,476
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

268
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,278
I'll be the priest and listen.

269
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,221
A deep, dark secret?

270
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,813
Say anything.
I'm ready to listen.

271
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,452
I like you.

272
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,600
I want to ask you something.

273
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,531
Do you have a wish?

274
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,330
A wish?

275
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,237
If you could have
anything in the world?

276
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,101
First, hold up your spoon.

277
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,111
Then?

278
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,814
Eat all your food.

279
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,289
Then?

280
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,797
Meet a great guy
and get married.

281
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,265
Can't I marry you?

282
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,429
I'm not a great guy.

283
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,600
It wasn't my choice,
but heaven's will,

284
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,970
to fall in love with you.

285
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:13,412
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

286
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,658
Now, for the requested song.

287
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,770
Your second toe is longer than
the first one like mine.

288
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,344
That means your mom
will outlive you.

289
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,079
Who says that?

290
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,317
I think I read it somewhere.

291
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,317
It's a lie.

292
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,190
Why?

293
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,894
Because my Mom and Dad died
on the same day.

294
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,628
If you...

295
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,468
If you die before me,
I'll kill you!

296
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,340
<i>Here's another requested song.</i>

297
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,749
Are you finished?

298
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,715
Excuse me?

299
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,549
The coffee.

300
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,566
Then can I have the cup?

301
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,227
Which side did you drink from?

302
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,327
Pardon?

303
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,271
This isn't kissing, is it?

304
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,353
- Hey.
- Yeah?

305
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,490
- You know the guest doctor?
- Yeah?

306
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,934
What kind of doctor is he?

307
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,695
Huh?

308
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,375
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

309
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,584
We kiss on the first day.

310
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,228
You see inside me,
on the second day.

311
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,194
What should we do
on the third day?

312
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,476
What?

313
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,508
We'll decide when the time comes.

314
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,583
I'm in love!

315
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,987
A guest on another show.
He's a dentist.

316
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,935
Pass me the toothbrush?

317
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,398
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

318
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,835
- As you're out driving...
- Did you eat?

319
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,271
Oh, hi.

320
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,912
- Got a show to record, today?
- No.

321
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,153
The guest doctor
on your show...

322
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,123
Who? You mean CHA Joo-hwan?

323
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,184
How is he?

324
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,291
He's a great guy.
Why?

325
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,624
Just wondering.

326
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:06,837
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

327
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,877
And he's a famous dentist.

328
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,347
You look a little sad today.

329
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,140
Good job, bro.

330
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,908
It was fun.

331
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,645
- Great show.
- Cut it short.

332
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,217
Hey, nice seeing you.

333
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,183
Let's go out for drinks.

334
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,586
Not if it's just a few drinks.

335
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,558
- How much then?
- All night?

336
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,136
All night! Alright!

337
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,074
<i>What's his social security number?</i>

338
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,299
- 730313105...
- 730313...

339
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,007
6715

340
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,104
Sure you can get
his medical records?

341
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,676
<i>Insurance companies get everything.</i>

342
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,142
<i>Bu! why do you want
to check out a guy?</i>

343
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,844
I'll tell you later.

344
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:59,352
<i>Bingo! He's got life
and medical insurance.</i>

345
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,886
<i>No record of family illness
or any operations.</i>

346
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,757
<i>He has an impeccable
health record.</i>

347
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,092
You sure?

348
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,494
<i>Insurance companies know
how to make money, man.</i>

349
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,261
KANG!

350
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,764
<i>If he has a hospital record,
we'll see it.</i>

351
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,798
KANG!

352
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,676
Thanks. I owe you one.

353
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,904
Got a minute Mr. KIM?

354
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,784
For you, any time!

355
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,049
It's a gift.

356
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,265
Ah, thank you.

357
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,296
Just a thank you?

358
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,570
First my lips,
then my insides...

359
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,738
Now, you're in my head.

360
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,178
Buy me a drink?

361
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,554
<i>A drink'!?</i>

362
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,488
I don't get it.

363
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:10,965
Who would've thought I'd use
my former dark roots to help you?

364
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,506
No need to worry.
Now about Cats.

365
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,798
Man, I gotta change
that name!

366
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,766
It's Cat Girl, sir.

367
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:27,944
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

368
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,942
Call me whatever you want, hon.

369
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,719
Who cares if it's a cat
or a dog?

370
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,859
That's my pretty-

371
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,029
My sweet Cats.

372
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,002
We're changing the name.

373
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,095
- Ah, sir?
- I said, I know!

374
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,303
Not that.
The phone.

375
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,743
Sorry, Producer KANG!
I checked and...

376
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,650
You kids scram for a sec.

377
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,248
I gotta take this call.
Go!

378
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,818
CHA Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

379
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,422
He even has a hot fiancé.

380
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,802
He's got it made.

381
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,193
<i>Fiancé?</i>

382
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,107
ls something up?

383
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,678
Oh, you dropped your candy.

384
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,912
Let's put it in your pocket.

385
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,028
Have you ever been in love?

386
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,268
Like a rock
thrown into the river.

387
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,305
Give me the ring.

388
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,740
Excuse me?

389
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,511
Your ring.

390
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,662
Like this.

391
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,746
Someone to pull you out.
Like this.

392
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,384
I'm engaged.

393
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,131
It doesn't matter.

394
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,698
Let's keep drinking.

395
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,805
It's so cold.

396
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,452
Did you drink?

397
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,320
What do you like
so much about him?

398
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,502
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

399
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,333
Sterilized?

400
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,401
Sterilized.

401
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,176
Perfect.

402
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,030
- Let's eat.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

403
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,894
- You're not eating?
- I can't.

404
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,125
What about all this food?

405
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,105
You eat it all.

406
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,499
I'll see you later.

407
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:15,922
ABCDEFGHIJK...

408
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,309
Hello?

409
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,572
<i>Is this EUN Won's number?</i>

410
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:06,282
Yes, it is.

411
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,248
<i>May I speak to her, please?</i>

412
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,256
She's not here.

413
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,886
<i>My name's CHA Joo-hwan.</i>

414
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,355
<i>We were supposed to
meet today</i>

415
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,559
<i>but something came up
at the clinic.</i>

416
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,295
<i>ls there any way
I can reach her?</i>

417
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,742
Where were you going to meet?

418
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,719
So cold.

419
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,549
Hey.

420
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,057
He can't come.

421
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,687
Who?

422
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,250
Him.

423
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,466
The doc.

424
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,560
Where are you going?

425
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,234
<i>L</i> gotta go-

426
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,034
Sit down.
The curry here is great.

427
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,903
You know I don't eat curry.

428
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,037
Then what do you want?

429
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,172
What else is there?

430
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,175
What do you want to eat?

431
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,849
Kimbap.

432
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,586
So boring.

433
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,590
Just eat curry.

434
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,388
You're buying.

435
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,666
Come on Producer KANG.
Spill it.

436
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,104
Did he rip you off
or something?

437
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,744
Then, why didn't you say so!

438
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:17,477
My boys can get the money back
before lunch in no time.

439
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,244
It's not that.

440
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,290
Then what is it?

441
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,089
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

442
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,200
Are you interested in his fiancé?

443
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,999
Just find out, please.

444
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,766
Fine, then.

445
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:46,243
Anyway, Cat's albums are
starting to get noticed, now.

446
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,606
Let's cook up something
with your show

447
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,986
and sell 'em like hotcakes!

448
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,045
I'm sure it'll do well.

449
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,821
Of course.

450
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,525
Hey, Min-chul!

451
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,723
Did you like the house?

452
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,326
Mother said she liked it.

453
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,366
It's not bad.

454
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,932
I heard you stopped
holding exhibitions.

455
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,803
I'm tired of putting on shows.

456
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,977
And there's nothing
to take pictures of.

457
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:23,014
I'm sorry I'm not more fun
to be around.

458
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,850
Don't worry.
I like to have fun by myself.

459
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,353
That's sad.

460
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,223
- Let's have fun together from now on.
- Sure.

461
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,866
Can I get an ashtray here?

462
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,138
I'm sorry.
There's no smoking here.

463
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,369
The world's such a bore.

464
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,345
Get her an ashtray
to put that out, please.

465
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,472
Yes, sir.

466
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,810
Interesting.

467
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,552
Keep smoking.

468
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,088
Should've known.
She's really somethin' all right.

469
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,060
She's got men
coming out of her ears.

470
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,722
I told 'em to take
some good pics.

471
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,923
It won't be long.

472
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,560
<i>How did you pose
for your album cover?</i>

473
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,830
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

474
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,932
Exactly how?

475
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,035
<i>- Here?
- Pardon?</i>

476
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,609
Men are all the same.

477
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,611
Okay, then.

478
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:38,018
First, I open my eyes
like a cat.

479
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,649
Like this.

480
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,218
- Ah, Cat Girl?
- Then...

481
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,322
I hold my hands up
and open my mouth like this.

482
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,291
Look at her.
She's a natural born star!

483
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,067
You can just tell us.

484
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,962
But my boss said a star

485
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,498
- has to speak with the body.
- See that?

486
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:00,499
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

487
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,545
That foxy babe.
Who wouldn't love her?

488
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,979
- Ah, sir?
- KANG!

489
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,960
- What's wrong?
- KANG!

490
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,569
Where is he?

491
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,568
- Hey!
- I'm dead beat.

492
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,406
What's wrong with you!

493
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,371
What's with you!

494
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,214
Don't start.

495
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,054
Why does he keep fainting
like this?

496
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,350
It's hereditary,
but it could also be

497
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,953
not enough calcium
in his diet.

498
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,954
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

499
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,140
Why are you the only one
who keeps fainting!

500
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,542
You eat way more than I do.

501
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:08,012
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

502
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,559
You!

503
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,572
Yes?

504
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,663
What did he just say?

505
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,841
To break off your engagement...

506
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,212
- Stop! Please!
- Who are you!

507
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,584
What the hell
are you trying to pull!

508
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,788
You don't wanna mess with me!

509
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,862
Get the hell out of my sight!

510
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,635
I said, get lost.

511
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,790
Why are you doing this?

512
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,723
Huh?

513
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,865
You're a successful
radio show producer.

514
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,440
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

515
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,533
Aren't you embarrassed?

516
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,014
I don't have time
to be embarrassed.

517
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,975
What are you talking about?

518
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:55,120
One mountain after another.
But no time to go.

519
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,556
Ow, my head.

520
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,864
Does it hurt?

521
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm hurt, too.

522
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,239
What's with me today?

523
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,168
It's because we're sad.

524
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:24,409
Then cry instead of making jokes.

525
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,283
I don't want to cry.

526
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,357
Don't wanna make
someone cry even more.

527
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,166
I'm dying.
Just like my dad.

528
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,501
Chul-kyu!

529
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:55,676
<i>Mom left me a year after
Dad died.</i>

530
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,089
<i>It probably wasn't
because she resented me.</i>

531
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,517
<i>She was sick of everything
because of Dad.</i>

532
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:12,229
<i>I understand.
I was sick of everything, too.</i>

533
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:18,103
<i>But when she left me all alone...</i>

534
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,537
<i>I was so lonely.</i>

535
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,976
<i>People...</i>

536
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,083
should never be alone.

537
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,940
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

538
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,143
<i>I want you to leave your fiancé.</i>

539
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,977
<i>The girl that I love is
in love with him.</i>

540
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,849
<i>- Medical records</i>

541
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,586
<i>I beg you.</i>

542
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,502
Under one condition.

543
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,997
But...

544
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,568
But?

545
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,114
No, please!
Tell me.

546
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,728
I want to take your pictures.

547
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:01,366
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

548
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,412
Now, that's an interesting model.

549
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,484
I think it'll be fun.

550
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,283
I don't think it'll be fun.

551
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,695
Then the deal's off.

552
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,825
Drink up, first!

553
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,799
Give me a drink, too!

554
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,780
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! You're late!

555
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:49,119
Hello.
I spoke to you on the phone.

556
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,247
Oh, hi.

557
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,522
I'm KANG Chul-kyu.

558
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,957
CHA Joo-hwan.

559
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,497
- Thanks again for that day.
- Anytime.

560
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,464
You know him?

561
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,233
The sterilizer?

562
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,062
- Did you eat?
- No, I'll eat now.

563
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,838
Why are you so late?

564
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,377
- Still recording a show.
- What?

565
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,934
You said you're done.

566
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,472
Not yet.
I gotta go back.

567
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,847
- Here.
- Thank you.

568
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,089
The song's great.

569
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,562
'If I can live again'?

570
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,722
Of course, I wrote it.

571
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,567
Sorry, I gotta run.

572
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,629
- Come on.
- Don't go.

573
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,139
I'll see you later.

574
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,734
Bye.

575
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,073
- See you next time, then.
- Sure.

576
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,943
Be careful in the snow!
