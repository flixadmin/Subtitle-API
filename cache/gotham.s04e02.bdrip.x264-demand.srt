00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,515
How much longer must our citizens
suffer their incompetence?

169
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,035
This coming from a man
who takes money from criminals

170
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,397
in exchange for a license allowing them
to victimize innocent people.

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,709
And it is working.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,996
Jim, why can't you see that I am not
here to destroy your beloved GCPD,

173
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,555
but to save it?

174
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,350
And through that, Gotham.

175
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,400
Your licenses are illegal,

176
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,994
and I will arrest anyone I find
who is issued one.

177
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,071
S0 sure your Boy Scout morality
can protect this city, Jim?

178
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,633
How well has that worked in the past?

179
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,835
Should I list the victims of
your antiquated righteousness?

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,832
Instead. let me make you a deal.

181
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,835
Find this Jonathan Crane
and lock him up within 24 hours

182
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,829
or admit to me, your subordinates.

183
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,389
And the people of Gotham

184
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,194
that you failed.

185
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,349
And allow me to clean this city up!

186
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,075
Good for you, Jim.

187
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,840
- (Game on.
- UNDISTINCT CHATTER)

188
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
What are you doing here?

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,509
Have I taught you nothing?

190
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,756
I could've slit your throat
before you even <i>saw</i> me.

191
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,239
I found this on the door this morning.

192
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,672
Someone left this inside last night.

193
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,519
Thank you for coming, ladies.

194
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,915
No way.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I saw you die.

196
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
That so?

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
It is Gotham.

198
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,876
- Check for a pulse next time.
- I will.

199
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,319
Right after I slit your throat.

200
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,916
So what happened to you?

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Long story.

202
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,192
Right now, all you need to know
is that I'm back.

203
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,354
And like the card says.

204
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,031
An opportunity awaits you.

205
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,640
A new beginning.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,593
You sure you wanna get this close?

207
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Please hear me out.

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,800
Not a day goes by
where I don't think about what I did.

209
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,956
If I could take it back,
trust me, I would.

210
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,639
I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.

211
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,558
Perhaps I'II finish the job this time.

212
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I was jealous.

213
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,155
I was stupid.

214
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,153
I am sorry.

215
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,952
Kill me if you don't believe me.

216
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,750
S0 is this your place now?

217
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,753
This is our place.

218
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Another club?

219
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
In Gotham?

220
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
How original.

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,115
It's not a club.

222
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,120
Penguin's taking over.

223
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,876
Like it or not,
every criminal in this city

224
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,914
is gonna go to him for a license
to mug. steal, or blow stuff up.

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,154
Those criminals are gonna need supplies,
and that is where we come in.

226
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,435
Not only will we be able to facilitate
these lowlifes,

227
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,319
but we'II also find out
what they're planning

228
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,674
and how it's going down.

229
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,234
But I will not go forward
without you both.

230
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,512
This is our way back on top.

231

No.

233
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,751
I will never be able to get back.

to the ground.

to stop you, Master Bruce.

you are simply not ready.

You can block one.

than I've ever felt before.

I am not stopping you, sir.

I can talk to them if you want...

332
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,070
I distinctly remember saying you could
come if you kept your mouth shut!

333
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,795
You will need
an operating license, obviously.

334
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,399
Then pay a weapon tax...

335
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,118
- "Weapon tax"?
- And then,

336
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,670
perhaps, your little store can open.

337
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,471
Well, you don't ask for much
now, do you?

338
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,674
I am not asking for enough.

339
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,271
Let me be absolutely clear, Ms. Kean.

340
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,633
Iwill be keeping
a very close eye on you.

341
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,671
The first rumor I hear
about you and your little partners

342
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
making moves to contest me,
and Victor...

344
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,714
will end you
with your own merchandise.

345
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Understood.

346
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,515
Couldn't have been cheap.

347
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
<i>L\\ \ \ n\\ \</i>

348
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,631
You lost your money on the Sirens club.

349
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,435
Then went missing.
Rumor was you were dead.

350
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,638
And now you're back
with a brand-new fancy place.

351
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Who paid for it?

352
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,191
You really think
Iwon't find out who it is?

353
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
(SIGHS)

354
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm gonna take this.

355
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Crane?

356
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,239
Do you believe in fate?

357
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,717
I didn't before today,

358
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,996
but you, sir, have made me a believer.

359
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,791
Of all the police in Gotham, it was you.

360
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,315
You came.

361
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Jonathan.

362
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,915
What happened to you?

363
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,635
Well, first,

364
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,750
you killed my father.

365
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,195
Your father was insane.
He was trying to kill you.

366
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,032
He tried to help me.

367
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,678
Help all mankind.

368
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,956
- He was a murderer.
- He <i>was</i> a pioneer!

369
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,110
Å Genius!

370
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,229
He taught me
we can live our entire lives

371
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,593
imprisoned by our fears.

372
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,991
Or we can embrace them.

373
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,796
You should know that better than anyone.

374
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,633
What will you see. I wonder.

375
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,429
What scares you the most?

376
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,713
What will you see. I wonder.

377
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,156
One of your victims, perhaps?

378
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,272
One of your victims?

379
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,994
What haunts you the most?

380
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,316

Ijust...

383
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,040
I just want some...

384
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
God, no.

385
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,478
- What have you done?
- Don't touch me.

386
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,595
Let me go.

387
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,954
Please let me help you.

388
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,510
You've caused me so much pain.

389
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,349
I've suffered you long enough.

390
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,871
We could've been a family, had a child,

391
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,149
but you destroy everything you touch.

392
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,629
Ijust want

393
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
- peace.
- No.

394
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,279
Lee. No.

395
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,316
You can join her

396
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,709
to show her how much you truly love her.

397
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,312
Don't let her die hating you.

398
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,475
It's what she would want.

399
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,270
It's the only way to show her, love her.

400
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,959
Cut deep.

401
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,912
Cut deep. It's what she would want.

402
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,399
Cut deep and find peace.

403
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,673
Don't let her die.

404
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,156
- Follow her to death.
- No.

405
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,515
<i>She wouldn't say that.</i>

406
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,751
<i>She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

407
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,310
- Cut deep and find peace.
- No.

408
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,518
<i>She loves me. She loves me.
She wouldn't want that. She loves me.</i>

409
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
No.

410
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,994
Crane? Where are you?

411
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Crane?

412
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
How did you do it?

413
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,274
How did you defeat the toxin?
It's impossible!

414
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,358
I overcame my fear.

415
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Liar.

416
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,439
You liar!

417
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,393
You can'tjust stop being afraid.

418
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,672
You can only become your demon
like I did.

419
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
No.

420
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,793
You have a choice, Jonathan.

421
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,520
And whatever your father was,
he didn't want this for you.

422
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,874
You need help.

423
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,113
My father thought that I was weak.

424
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,555
My whole life.

425
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,355
Scared little Jonathan.

426
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Okay.

427
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
I can help you.

428
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Let me help you.

429
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,952
But I'm not weak anymore.

430
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,635
And I will never go back
to being that boy.

431

(DISTANT LAUGHTER)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

434
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Just around the corner.

435
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,115
I'm telling you, man.
He leaves the back gate open.

436
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,594
Ha-ha! It's gonna be too easy.

437
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Well, well.

438
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,597
Seems we've caught our stalker.

439
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,349
And he made it way too easy.

440
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,674
Didn't know when he was being played.

441
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Who are you, huh?

442
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,239
Some... Some Boy Scout?

443
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
He'sjust a kid.

444
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,990
Some kind of do-gooder?

445
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,591
Did I date your mom
and not call her back?

446
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
(ALL LAUGH)

447
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,514
Why you hassling us, kid?

448
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,114
I don't know, guys.
His face, it seems familiar.

449
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,755
You famous or something?

450
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,432
You know we got licenses for this, kid?

451
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,150
We're all above board.

452
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,917
- Penguin gets his share.
- That's right.

453
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,152
It's within our rights
to do anything we want to you.

454
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Anything.

455
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,754
Look what you went and did.

456
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,589
You've seen my stash.

457
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,879
You've ticked off my boys.

458
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,710
Now, you're gonna die.

459
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,879
Wait.
I'm telling you, I know this kid's face.

460
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,280
Would you shut the hell up?

461
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,518
Hey, I'm telling you,
I've seen this dude.

462
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Don't matter.

463
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
No matter who he is,

464
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,075
he's gotta go.

465

466
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Get up!

467
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,513
Think you're s0 slick, huh?

468
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,869
Now, I hate to tell you,
"I told you so," Master Bruce.

469
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Up you get.

470
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
We gotta leave.

471
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,355
She said she's sorry.

472
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,596
She chose Nygma over me and Butch.

473
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,433
So? Nygma's a popsicle now.

474
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,115
Let's give her a chance.

475
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,554
Why do you want this so bad?

476
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,039
Because I'm sick and tired
of not being taken seriously.

477
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,633
AII those selfish guys out there
who treat me like I'm stupid?

478
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,679
Alone, I can't do much about it.

479
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,234
With Barbara, maybe.

480
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,994
But with you and Barbara?

481
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,637
The three of us could give
all those creeps a run for their money.

482
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Iwant in.

483
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,280
- Get out.
- No. Please, just hear me out.

484
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,676
No.

485
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,114
You're a Penguin stooge.

486
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,717
What? I hate that freak.

487
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,235
Oh, please, you guzzled down
his Kool-Aid. Beat it.

488
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,713
No one takes me seriously, either.

489
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,696
There's nothing
Iwouldn't do to get back

490
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,472
at the men who treated me like garbage.

491
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Nothing.

492
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,910
Not buying it.
You're working for Penguin.

493
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,357
Cool down, okay? I believe her.

494
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Thank you.

495
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Know what?

496
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
You're rude.

497
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,151
And you're about to get your skinny ass
kicked down the block.

498
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
I won't ask again.

499
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Get out.

500
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
(nooa CLOSES)

501
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
Get word to Barbara. I'II talk business.

502
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,678
But I'II need something in return.

503
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
GORDON: Crane?

504
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,550
- CRANE: The demon is here.
- Crane?

505
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,952
CRANE: The demon who haunts
and tortures you is here.

506
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,119
The one who poisoned your minds.

507
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,753
Destroy him and free yourself
from his tyranny.

508
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
(SCREECHING)

509
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,869
Kill him!

510
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,873
Water. Right.

511
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
(SCREAMING)

512
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,790
WOMAN: I'm so happy.

513
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Jonathan.

514
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,717
- You could've been killed.
- But I wasn't.

515
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,115
That's 'cause I followed you.

516
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,073
I had it under control.

517
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,958
How am I supposed to suppen you
if you refuse

518
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,416
to accept the realities
of the situation?

519
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,976
Alfred, the realities of the situation...

520
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
(KNOCKING ON moon)

521
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Mr. Fox.

522
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Bad time?

523
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,118
No. Not at all.

524
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Please come in.

525
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Forgive me.

526
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,600
I should have called, but...

527
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,156
Well, Ijust couldn't stop thinking
about our last chat.

528
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,314
Wayne Enterprises were developing
a durable material

529
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,789
for military uniforms
when I worked there.

530
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,157
It is a thin Kevlar <i>weave</i>
with reinforced forearm protection.

531
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,995
The gloves have a faceted grip design

532
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,117
to help you cling to any surface.

533
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,316
The whole uniform
is extremely lightweight

534
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,471
and actually bulletproof to impacts
from 10 feet or more.

535
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,958
You know, for rock climbing.

536
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,112
Oh, and long-distance
radio communicators.

537
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,631
In case you two wish
to talk to each other

538
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
whilst climbing rock.

539
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,840
Well, I will not keep you.

540
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,837
I just didn't want to see you
get hurt again, Mr. Wayne.

541
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Thank you, Mr. Fox.

542
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,229
I feel safer already.

543
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,549
Ladies. Thank you for returning.
I'm glad...

544
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Not so fast.

545
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,591
I'II be needing proof of your sincerity.

546
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,119
Yes. Selena said you would
need something from me.

547
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,351
- You can have anything you like.
- Fine.

548
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I'II take your hand.

549
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
My what?

550
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,276
Both Butch and I lost a hand due
to Penguin's Machiavellian war games.

551
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,149
I believe it's your turn.

552
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,591
- You didn't say anything about this.
- Quiet.

553
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,752
- Tabitha, I assure you...
- No more words.

554
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
Penguin cut off Butch's hand,
Nygma mine.

555
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,519
Now I take yours.

556
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Fine.

557
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,953
If this is the only way
I can get you to trust me,

558
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
so be it.

559
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Fine.

560
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I'II trust you.

561
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
For now.

562
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
I'II start Monday.

563
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
PENGUIN: Where is he?

564
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,479
We had a deal, Detective Gordon.

565
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,955
That you would apprehend Jonathan Crane.

566
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,875
You made a demand
in front of your cronies

567
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,874
in an attempt to undermine
me and this department.

568
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,714
There was no deal.

569
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,677
I spoke for all of
the citizens of Gotham

570
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,390
when I said that the GCPD
can no longer keep us safe.

571
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,793
How many of you are sick
of risking your lives every day

572
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,712
just to see criminals escape?

573
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,637
How many times has this very building
become a war zone?

574
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

575
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,349
I say it is time to start anew.

576
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,276
To police ourselves.

577
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,190
I will triple the wage
of any cop here who wants to work for me

578
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,159
in ensuring the safety
of this city's people.

579
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,991
The future is now.

580
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,592
Follow me into it.

581
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,760
Police yourselves.

582
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,990
He just wants to pay you
to look the other way.

583
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,559
Would you blame them if they did?

584
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,800
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

585
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,550
This is a war, not one battle.

586
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,910
If I would've went with you,
I would've lost them.

587
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,711
And we need them to win this war.

588
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,353
Now, you don't have to say nothing,

589
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,798
but I am buying you a drink.

590
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,838
Oh, no, not you. Leave!

591
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,070
You never paid
for the last stuff I gave you.

592
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,673
You make me smell perfume.
Make me giddy. Cheap trick!

593
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,038
Out! Out!

594
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,072
I'm done with perfumes.

595
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm here for the good stuff.

596
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,199
Don't know what you're talking about.
Leave! I'm closing up.

597
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,197
Word is you have potions here.

598
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,829
Ancient, mystical potions
made by shamans all over the world.

599
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,909
Who told you that?

600
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
I'm done playing nice.

601
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,392
I need a change. A big one.

602
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,391
I need strength, power.

603
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No..

604
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Where are they?

605
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
My safe.

606
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Under the register.

607
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,593
- Combinationil
- It's open.

608
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,879
Which ones make me stronger?

609
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,998
That's dangerous stuff.
It's too powerful for you.

610
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,912
It can get in your blood, your DNA.

611
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Good.

612
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
No!

613
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Stop! No!

614
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,953
No, you must stop!

615
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
(PANTING)

616
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,397
You let me walk into
that nightmare alone.

617
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,959
Yeah, well, I figured it would take

618
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,395
more than a couple of loonies
to take you out.

619
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,390
Besides, I figured you and me
taking on Penguin

620
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,030
and the entire criminal underground
by ourselves wasn't the best idea.

621
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,115
So, what, you wanna sit here,
do nothing, get drunk?

622
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,350
- Is that your plan?
- Unless you got a better one.

623
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,720
What makes you think those cops
back there were wrong?

624
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,358
Are we really making a difference?

625
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,039
One worth risking our lives over?

626
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,989
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

627
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,710
Makes me miss Falcone.

628
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,274
I mean, I know he's a vicious bastard,
but he was... He was fair.

629
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,376
He ran the criminals in this city
with an iron fist. There was...

630
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,232
There was honor.

631
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,473
- No.
- What?

632
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,159
Do not <i>mess</i> with Falcone.

633
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,029
You killed his son, remember?
Italians do not forget that crap.

634
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,555
He must hate what Penguin's doing
as much as we do.

635
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,869
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

636
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,755
Yeah, well...

637
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,356
Like you said, we need an army.

638
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
He's got one.
