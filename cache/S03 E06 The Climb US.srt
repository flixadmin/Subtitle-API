1
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,168
You've got too much wood in there.

2
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,005
But the more wood, the bigger the fire.

3
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,884
It needs to breathe.
Take off that big log.

4
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,897
You know your fires.

5
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,909
Someone built your fires for you
growing up?

6
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,203
It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.

7
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,373
And there were servants, of course.

8
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,626
I knew you were highborn.

9
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,925
I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

10
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,054
Buried treasure.

11
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,682
Thousands of years old.

12
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,767
I think.

13
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,353
What does it do?

14
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:13,276
I'm not sure that it does anything.
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

15
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,746
-How much longer?
-Not so far.

16
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,456
A few more days.

17
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,585
Is the Wall as big as they say?

18
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,378
Bigger.

19
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,925
So big, you can't even see
the top sometimes.

20
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,843
It's hidden in clouds.

21
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,389
-You're playing with me.
-I'm not.

22
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,977
It's 700 feet high, all made of ice.

23
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,189
On a warm day, you can see it weeping.

24
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,029
Castle Black is nice enough.

25
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:04,577
They keep a fire burning in the long hall,
day and night.

26
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:09,958
And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.

27
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,960
Very tasty.

28
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,172
Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.

29
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,633
Dareon sings best.

30
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,760
-Do you sing?
-No.

31
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,596
No, no, no. Not very well.

32
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,392
Sing me a song.

33
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,981
All right. Let's see.

34
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:47,745
The Father's face is stern and strong
He sits and judges right from wrong

35
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,374
He weighs our lives, the short and long

36
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,794
And loves the little children

37
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:01,884
The Mother gives the gift of life
And watches over every wife

38
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,722
Her gentle smile ends all strife

39
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,310
And she loves her little children

40
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,319
-That's not how you skin a rabbit.
-I know how to skin a rabbit.

41
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,779
Not by the looks of it.

42
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,922
You grow up north of the Wall,

43
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,759
you learn the proper way to handle game.

44
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,594
I didn't see any game before I got here.

45
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,514
If I had a bow, I could have shot
a dozen rabbits.

46
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,224
Well, I made this bow myself.

47
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,435
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

48
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,562
You learn how to use your fists, though.

49
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,522
You're gonna punch the rabbits to death?

50
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,734
-I had someone else in mind.
-Well, someone else is sitting right here.

51
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,070
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

52
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,156
Some of us are just a little better.

53
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,699
Well, some of us would say thank you

54
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,451
when someone else hunts down
their breakfast for them.

55
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,287
Or don't they teach you
to say "thank you" north of the Wall?

56
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,166
You've got a big mouth, girl,
and too many teeth.

57
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,167
Stop it!

58
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,961
-Hodor.
-You've been fighting since you met.

59
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,046
Just stop it.

60
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,632
Lady Reed here's got a stick
so far up her ass,

61
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,133
it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.

62
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,720
You've been nasty to her every day.
Of course, she's nasty back.

63
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,388
Me? It's my fault?

64
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,641
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

65
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,768
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

66
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,440
We can't fight each other.
We'll never make it to the Wall.

67
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,485
I want you both to make peace.

68
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,205
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

69
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,165
-I said so, didn't I?
-Osha!

70
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,755
-You're a good little hunter.
-Thank you.

71
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,842
See? Not so hard, is it?

72
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,052
-"Thank you."
-Don't push me.

73
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,732
I'm right here with you.

74
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,195
-What's happening?
-I'm right here with you.

75
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,657
What's wrong with him?

76
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,954
The visions take their toll.

77
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,624
He's having one now?

78
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,563
I saw Jon Snow.

79
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,399
You saw him?

80
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,651
At Castle Black?

81
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,863
He was on the wrong side of the Wall.

82
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,074
Surrounded by enemies.

83
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,213
Used to be yho couldn't find a tree
within a mile of the Wall.

84
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,341
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

85
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,430
Your flock gets smaller every year.

86
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,231
You ever climbed it before?

87
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,899
No.

88
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

89
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,660
You're afraid.

90
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,997
-Aren't you?
-Aye.

91
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,875
Well, it's a long way up
and a long way down,

92
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,421
but I've waited my whole life
to see the world from up there.

93
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,012
Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.

94
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,308
They're too big for you, but they're good.

95
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,143
You kill someone for them?

96
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:27,567
No. I didn't kill him,
but I bet his balls are still bruised.

97
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,951
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

98
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,539
Well, he didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

99
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,419
-Hey, can we not talk about that here?
-"Can we not talk about that here?"

100
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,338
"I'm Jon Snow."

101
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,257
"I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

102
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,467
but I'm scared of naked girls."

103
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,679
-Did I seem scared the other day?
-You were trembling like a leaf.

104
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,680
Only in the beginning.

105
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,975
"Only in the beginning."

106
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,730
You're a proper lover, Jon Snow.

107
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,940
And don't worry.

108
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,444
Your secret's safe with me.

109
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,321
What secret?

110
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,659
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls in silk dresses

111
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,744
you knew growing up?

112
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,248
You're loyal and you're brave.

113
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,588
You didn't stop being a crow

114
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,673
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

115
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,266
But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.

116
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,355
You're going to be loyal to your woman.

117
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,196
The Night's Watch don't care
if you live or die.

118
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,199
Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.

119
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,576
We're just soldiers in their armies,

120
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,578
and there's plenty more to carry on
if we go down.

121
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:15,674
Well, it's you and me
that matters to me and you.

122
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,305
Don't ever betray me.

123
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,773
I won't.

124
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,277
'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off
and wear it 'round me neck.

125
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,667
Sink your metal deep,

126
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,753
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

127
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,508
And if you fall, don't scream.

128
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,095
You don't want that to be
the last thing she remembers.

129
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,526
Joffrey.

130
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,573
Cersei.

131
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,409
Ilyn Payne.

132
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,245
You're good.

133
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,752
You're not as good as you think you are.

134
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,009
Face, tits, balls...
I hit 'em right where I wanted to.

135
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,220
Aye, but you took your sweet time of it.

136
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,849
You won't be fighting straw men,
little lady.

137
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,686
Show me your position.

138
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,819
Keep your elbow high.
You want your back doing the hard labor.

139
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,072
You're holding.

140
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,534
-Never hold.
-What?

141
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,620
Your muscles tense up when you hold.

142
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,998
Pull the string back to the center
of your chin and release.

143
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,917
Never hold.

144
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,752
But I have to aim.

145
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,795
Never aim.

146
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,756
Never aim?

147
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,384
Your eye knows
where it wants the arrow to go.

148
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,553
Trust your eye.

149
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,684
There's someone out there.

150
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,914
That's about far enough.

151
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,130
-We come as friends.
-Begging your pardon, my lady,

152
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,632
but we'll be the judge of that.

153
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,136
Valar morghulis.

154
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,930
Valar dohaeris.

155
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,552
My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.

156
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
Why are you here, my lady?

157
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
Forgive my manners.

158
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,783
-I don't see many ladies these days.
-Lucky for the ladies.

159
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,232
How many times has the Lord
brought him back?

160
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,275
Six.

161
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,053
I've always been a terrible priest.

162
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,473
Drank too much rum.

163
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,851
Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.

164
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,020
It's a terrible thing to say,

165
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,108
but by the time I came to Westeros,
I didn't believe in our Lord.

166
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,408
I decided that He, that all the gods,
were stories we told the children

167
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,450
to make them behave.

168
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,454
So I wore the robes,
and every now and then

169
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,125
I'd recite the prayers,
but just for show.

170
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,337
A spectacle for the locals.

171
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,341
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

172
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,014
I knelt beside his cold body,

173
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,934
and said the old words.

174
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,520
Not because I believed
in them, but...

175
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,774
He was my friend,

176
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,527
and he was dead.

177
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,364
And they were the only words I knew.

178
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,618
And for the first time in my life,
the Lord replied.

179
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,706
Beric's eyes opened,

180
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,125
and I knew the truth.

181
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,962
Our god is the one true god.

182
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,967
And all men must serve Him.

183
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,435
You've been to the other side.

184
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,104
The other side?

185
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,150
There is no other side.

186
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,404
I have been to the darkness, my lady.

187
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,702
He sent you to us for a reason.

188
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,748
You have someone He needs.

189
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,043
Bodkin point.

190
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,421
Penetrates plate at 200 yards.

191
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,052
Can you make 'em?

192
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,805
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.

193
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,182
Just need decent steel.

194
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,267
I'll get you the steel.

195
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,481
I don't like that woman.

196
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,902
-On the ground.
-That's 'cause you're a girl.

197
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,196
What does that have to do with anything?

198
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,912
Forgive me, lad.

199
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,710
What are you doing? Let go of him.

200
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,129
-Tell them to stop.
-Come on.

201
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,174
He wants to be one of you.
He wants to join the Brotherhood.

202
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,343
-Stop them!
-We serve the Lord of Light.

203
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,971
And the Lord of Light needs this boy.

204
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,849
Did the Lord of Light tell you that
or did she?

205
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,690
You're not doing this for your god.

206
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,194
-You're doing it for gold.
-We're doing it for both, girl.

207
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,491
We can't defend the people without weapons
and horses and food.

208
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,121
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

209
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,706
You told me this was a brotherhood.

210
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,917
You told me I could be one of you.

211
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,010
You are more than they can ever be.

212
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,804
They are just foot soldiers
in the great war.

213
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,307
You will make kings rise and fall.

214
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,322
You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.

215
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,537
I see a darkness in you.

216
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,292
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me...

217
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,963
brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes.

218
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,508
Eyes you'll shut forever.

219
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,889
We will meet again.

220
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,217
You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?

221
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,763
Look out!

222
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,104
You all right?

223
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,318
Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.

224
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,791
Sorry.

225
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,169
Were you sleeping?

226
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,386
Water?

227
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,346
You want some water.

228
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,435
I wish I had some for you.

229
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,785
So let's play a game.

230
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,414
Which body part do you need the least?

231
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,128
-Please.
-Please is not a body part.

232
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,255
I'll tell you everything, please.

233
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,386
But you've already told me everything.
Remember?

234
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,601
Your daddy was mean to you.
The Starks didn't appreciate you.

235
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,771
One good bit, though.

236
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,776
The Stark boys, they're still alive.

237
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,531
Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?

238
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,786
You failed,
but I'm a better hunter than you.

239
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,917
Now... how about your little finger?

240
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,463
You don't use that for much, do you?
No? Good. Let's start with that.

241
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,686
You've been wondering why you're here.
Haven't you?

242
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,814
Where you are.

243
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,068
Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you.

244
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,655
So, guess.

245
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,617
If you guess right, I'll tell you.

246
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,787
By the old gods and the new, I swear it.

247
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,541
You win the game

248
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,795
if you can figure out who I am
and why I'm torturing you,

249
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,631
and I win the game
if you beg me to cut off your finger.

250
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,970
If I win, you'll let me go?

251
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:39,978
If you think this has a happy ending,
you haven't been paying attention.

252
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,479
Please.

253
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,400
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

254
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,741
You first. Where are we?

255
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,454
-The North.
-Too vague.

256
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,788
Deepwood Motte.

257
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,959
Terrible guess.

258
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,136
Now, where?

259
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,014
Last Hearth.

260
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,309
Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?

261
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,272
Karhold!

262
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,073
Karhold?

263
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,827
How did you know that?

264
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,666
Did you see any banners flying
when we came in?

265
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,002
No. It was just a guess.

266
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,215
Very good, Lord Theon.

267
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,514
-And who am I?
-Torrhen Karstark.

268
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,598
He's dead.

269
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,893
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

270
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,814
He was your brother.

271
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,781
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

272
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,584
-You swore to tell me if I--
-You're right.

273
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,382
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

274
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,634
I betrayed Robb.

275
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,054
That's why you're torturing me.

276
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,058
Yes.

277
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,188
You win.

278
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,411
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.

279
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,997
You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

280
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,756
I'm afraid I am.

281
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,553
Everything I told you is a lie.

282
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:28,104
This isn't happening to you for a reason.
But well, one reason... I enjoy it.

283
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,232
Please, cut it off! Cut it off!
Cut it off!

284
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,740
I win.

285
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,493
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

286
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,162
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

287
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,748
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

288
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,335
But when the King of the North
summons us, we come.

289
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,129
Our Father has instructed us to tell you

290
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,425
that his alliance with the North
can continue if his terms are met.

291
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,597
Lord Frey requires a formal apology
for your violation

292
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,849
of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.

293
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,727
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

294
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,063
As restitution for this betrayal,

295
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,400
he demands Harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.

296
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,069
-I don't think that's--
-We are fighting for the North.

297
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,572
Harrenhal is not in the North.

298
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,243
It is his once the war is over,

299
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,870
and we have
no further strategic need for it.

300
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,790
And there's something else.

301
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,710
We will do whatever we can
to give Lord Frey what he needs.

302
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,880
Not what, whom.

303
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,717
What?

304
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,142
No.

305
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,395
Our Father requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters,

306
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,729
Roslin.

307
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,065
-How old is she?
-Nineteen.

308
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,901
-Could I see her first?
-You want to count her teeth?

309
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,904
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

310
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,115
We need an answer before we leave,

311
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,867
and a wedding
not more than a fortnight thereafter

312
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,326
or this alliance is at an end.

313
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,246
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

314
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,498
Father is old.

315
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,293
It will put his heart at peace

316
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,128
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

317
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,965
And his recent experience
has made him wary

318
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,341
of long engagements.

319
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,427
He has every right to be.

320
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,513
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

321
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,617
Why should I let that old ferret
choose my bride for me?

322
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,120
Very least, I should be offered
the same choice you were.

323
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,497
I'm his liege lord.

324
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,083
-He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
-I didn't wound him.

325
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,252
My answer is no.

326
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,844
Listen to me and listen very carefully.

327
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,889
-You are...
-The laws of gods and men are very clear.

328
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,100
No man can compel another man to marry.

329
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,394
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

330
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,188
It's all right. You heard him.

331
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,359
If you refuse,
our alliance with the Freys is dead.

332
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,196
He's wanted me for one
of his daughters since I was 12.

333
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,114
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

334
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,703
When I say no, he will come back
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

335
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,456
You're willing to risk our freedom
and our lives

336
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,501
-for a chance at a prettier wife?
-I have a war to fight.

337
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,672
We can't win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.

338
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,383
You said you wanted to make amends
for the Stone Mill.

339
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,095
You recall that heroic engagement?

340
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,143
I had something less permanent in mind.

341
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,356
I've won every battle,
but I'm losing this war.

342
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,318
If we don't do this and do it now,

343
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,654
we're lost.

344
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,370
I'll marry her.

345
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,081
You're paying for my sins, Uncle.

346
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,752
It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.

347
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,013
I see my men have finally found you
something appropriate to wear.

348
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,890
Yes. Most kind of them.

349
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,311
You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

350
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,063
I am acting on Lady Stark's orders

351
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,232
to return Jaime Lannister
to King's Landing.

352
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,277
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

353
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,655
If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her for treason.

354
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,874
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

355
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,459
You should.

356
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:04,297
But instead, you're sitting here
watching me fail at dinner.

357
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,509
-Why might that be?
-Wars cost money.

358
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,512
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

359
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,598
We both know who would pay the most.

360
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,103
Or make you pay the most
if he found out you had captured me

361
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,230
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

362
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,649
You're right.

363
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,403
Perhaps the safest thing to do
is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

364
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,617
It would be, if you honestly believed
my father would never find out about it.

365
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,911
King Robb is keeping your father
quite busy.

366
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,205
He doesn't have time for anything else.

367
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,123
He'll make time for you.

368
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,507
As soon as you're well enough to travel,
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

369
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,843
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

370
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,138
And you will swear
to tell your father the truth,

371
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,808
that I had nothing to do
with your maiming.

372
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,192
-Shall we drink on it?
-I don't partake.

373
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,823
You do understand
how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

374
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,826
Very well.

375
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,748
My lady, may our journey continue
without further incident.

376
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,750
No, she won't be going with you.

377
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,672
-I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime...
-You are charged with abetting treason.

378
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,258
I'm afraid I must insist.

379
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,719
You're in no place to insist on anything.

380
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,471
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

381
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,516
about overplaying your position.

382
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,981
-Impossible.
-Why?

383
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,483
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

384
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,820
The most desirable bachelor
in all Seven Kingdoms.

385
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,364
-Your daughter...
-Is rich,

386
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,409
the most beautiful woman
in all Seven Kingdoms...

387
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,330
-and the mother of the king.
-Old.

388
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,499
Old?

389
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,877
Old.

390
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

391
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,966
Her change will be upon her before long.

392
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,927
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

393
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,222
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

394
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,183
but this is another matter entirely.

395
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,519
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

396
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,193
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

397
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,653
The only thing that might turn it

398
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,865
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

399
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,243
-Do you deny them?
-Oh, not at all.

400
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,454
A sword swallower through and through.

401
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,333
And a boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity

402
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,835
to marry the most beautiful woman
in the kingdoms

403
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,505
and remove the stain from his name.

404
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,090
Did you grow up with boy cousins,
Lord Tywin?

405
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,386
Sons of your father's bannermen,
squires, stable boys?

406
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,846
Of course.

407
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,266
And you never...

408
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:04,977
No.

409
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,564
Not once? Not in any way?

410
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,274
Never.

411
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,152
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

412
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,988
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

413
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,240
at each other beneath the sheets.

414
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:22,119
Perhaps Highgarden has
a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.

415
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,621
I wouldn't say that.

416
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,626
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots
over a discreet bit of buggery, but...

417
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,463
brothers and sisters...

418
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,591
Where I come from,

419
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,845
that stain would be very difficult
to wash out.

420
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:44,141
I will not breathe further life
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

421
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,398
Lie or not, you must admit
many people find it quite convincing.

422
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,484
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands,

423
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,571
and send them off
to kill Lannisters and Tyrells.

424
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,573
Thanks to our new affiliation.

425
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:03,369
I don't care what people believe.
And neither do you.

426
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,164
As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.

427
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,085
Now, if the rumors about my children
were true,

428
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,880
then Joffrey is no king at all,

429
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,259
and House Tyrell is throwing
its prized flower into the dirt.

430
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,721
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

431
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,850
we're throwing another prized flower
into the dirt.

432
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,061
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

433
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,356
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.

434
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,817
All right.

435
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,361
I'll remove it for you.

436
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:44,076
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,
I will name him to the Kingsguard.

437
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,455
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.

438
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,958
He will never marry.
He will never have children.

439
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,252
The Tyrell name will fade.

440
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,548
And Highgarden will go to the children
of Joffrey and Margaery.

441
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,969
You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?

442
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,306
I would have my grandson protected
by a skilled warrior

443
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,267
who takes his vows seriously.

444
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,520
So, shall I draw up the order?

445
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,608
Or do you consent to this match?

446
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:26,118
It's a rare enough thing,
a man who lives up to his reputation.

447
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,792
No!

448
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,006
No!

449
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,805
No!

450
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,610
We gotta cut them loose!

451
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,404
No!

452
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,202
Take my hand!

453
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,697
That's a wonderful pin.

454
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,743
It's more of a brooch, really.

455
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,791
Though I suppose
a brooch is a sort of pin, so...

456
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,424
I'm very happy about...

457
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,012
Yes. I am as well.

458
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,936
-I feel like I'm in a dream.
-Yes, me, too. Definitely.

459
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,023
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

460
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,485
The guests, the food, the tournaments.

461
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,992
And the bride, of course.

462
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,123
The most beautiful bride in the world.

463
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,544
In a beautiful gown of gold
and green brocade with fringed sleeves.

464
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,215
Have you ever been to Highgarden,
my lady?

465
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,803
No. I had never left Winterfell
before I came to King's Landing.

466
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,057
But it sounds wonderful.
I can't wait to see it.

467
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,477
And to leave this place.

468
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,022
It's terrible, isn't it?

469
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,985
The most terrible place there is.

470
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,789
I don't suppose there's
anything we can do about this.

471
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,917
We can have them both killed.

472
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,964
It's hard to say which of the four of us
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

473
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,675
Probably Sansa.

474
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,180
Though Loras will certainly come
to know a deep and singular misery.

475
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,849
Father doesn't discriminate.

476
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,353
We're all being shipped off
to hell together.

477
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,480
On a boat you built.

478
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,983
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

479
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,402
I did what I did to protect our family.

480
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,779
I'm your family.

481
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,074
A member of your family

482
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,410
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

483
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:23,666
Whether or not you or Father
or anyone else wants to admit it.

484
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,708
I do admit it.

485
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,003
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

486
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,423
Stannis would have sacked the city
before Father got here.

487
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,927
Our heads would still be rotting
on the city gate.

488
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,722
Trying to have me killed
is an odd way of saying thank you.

489
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,187
There are two people in King's Landing
who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

490
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,775
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon
to kill me

491
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,235
during the Battle of the Blackwater?

492
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,205
The impulse I understand.

493
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:10,462
He hates me because I'm the only one
who tells him what he really is.

494
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,428
So, fair enough. He wants me dead.

495
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,972
But his stupidity?

496
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,350
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

497
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:29,815
But the king orders a Kingsguard
to murder the Hand of the King

498
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,900
in full view of his own army.

499
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,987
-The boy's an idiot.
-What do you want me to say?

500
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,906
I want you to tell me
if my life is still in danger.

501
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,033
Probably.

502
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,078
But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now Father's here.

503
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:49,084
Seven Kingdoms united
in fear of Tywin Lannister.

504
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,211
Not the Tyrells.

505
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,881
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

506
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,343
Joffrey will belong to Margaery,
the little doe-eyed whore.

507
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,137
And so will his children
and their children.

508
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,931
History will be taken from our hands.

509
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,894
You may escape, at least.

510
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,563
Once Jaime gets back,

511
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:12,066
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

512
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,233
of sword through bowels.

513
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,612
When Jaime gets back, yes.

514
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,199
But when do we think that's going to be?
He's out there somewhere.

515
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,788
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

516
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,085
Who's going to tell her?

517
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,047
Do you think people will like it?

518
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,716
I don't think they will even notice it.

519
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,052
You're right. It's not my wedding.

520
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,723
Anyway, from what I can tell,
the dressmakers in Highgarden

521
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,101
will be far superior
to the ones in King's Landing.

522
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,853
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

523
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,607
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

524
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,943
I'm sure he does.

525
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,949
-Will they let me invite my family?
-They haven't asked my opinion.

526
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,452
-But do you think they will?
-No.

527
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,129
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.

528
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,005
-Should I...
-I beg your pardon, my lady.

529
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,385
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
I was just trying on a gown

530
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,553
for King Joffrey's wedding.

531
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,266
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

532
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,894
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

533
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,479
Of course.

534
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,857
Alone, if I may.

535
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,276
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

536
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,277
Shae.

537
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,405
Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.
She's not from here.

538
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,075
But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.

539
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,165
Sometimes, we think we want
to hear something,

540
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,042
and it's only afterwards
when it's too late

541
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,797
that we realize, we wished we'd heard it
under entirely different circumstances.

542
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,549
It's all right, really.

543
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,054
How to begin?

544
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,022
This is awkward.

545
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,109
A thousand blades

546
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,030
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

547
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,200
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

548
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,993
There aren't a thousand blades.

549
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,871
There aren't even 200.

550
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,375
-I've counted.
-I'm sure you have.

551
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,961
Ugly old thing.

552
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,215
Yet it has a certain appeal.

553
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,009
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

554
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,845
Shame you had to settle
for your second choice.

555
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,014
Early days, my friend.

556
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,642
It is flattering, really...

557
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:59,066
you feeling such dread
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

558
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,694
Thwarting you has never been
my primary ambition, I promise you.

559
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,199
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

560
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,954
You're so right. For instance,
when I thwarted your plan

561
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,956
to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

562
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,166
If I'm going to be honest,

563
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,337
I did feel an unmistakable sense
of enjoyment there.

564
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,507
But your confidant,

565
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,511
the one who fed you information
about my plans,

566
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,846
the one you swore to protect.

567
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,767
You didn't bring her any enjoyment.

568
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,563
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

569
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,733
She was a bad investment on my part.

570
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,408
Luckily, I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.

571
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,660
Something daring.

572
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:59,668
And he was so grateful to me
for providing this fresh experience.

573
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,842
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

574
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,760
The realm?

575
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,555
Do you know what the realm is?

576
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,852
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

577
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,898
A story we agree to tell each other
over and over

578
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,484
till we forget that it's a lie.

579
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,405
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

580
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,702
Chaos.
A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

581
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,204
Chaos isn't a pit.

582
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,416
Chaos is a ladder.

583
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,173
Many who try to climb it fail,
and never get to try again.

584
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,010
The fall breaks them.

585
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:04,441
And some are given a chance
to climb, but they refuse.

586
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:11,782
They cling to the realm,
or the gods, or love.

587
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,660
Illusions.

588
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,288
Only the ladder is real.

589
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,792
The climb is all there is.
