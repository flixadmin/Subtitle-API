DRUIG: Phastos,

1477
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:10,292
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1478
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,918
Okay, get ready for it.

KINGO: Bracelets?

1480
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:17,883
You made us bracelets?

1481
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,968
PHASTOS:
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1482
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,054
Celestials are the most powerful

1483
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,805
energy generators in the universe.

1484
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,349
When Arishem made us,

1485
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:27,225
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

1486
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,935
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1487
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,729
The bracelets, in theory,

1488
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:32,773
shut down our regeneration process.

1489
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,316
And once that happens,

1490
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,040
our bodies accumulate
extra cosmic energy.

1491
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:37,361
What for?

1492
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,322
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1493
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:44,159
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1494
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,828
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1495
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,955
one of us could become
immensely powerful,

1496
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,833
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1497
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,168
forming...

1498
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,090
a Uni-Mind.

1499

1507
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:19,319
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

Well, you know

Your sarcasm.

1512
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:26,868

could take decades.
