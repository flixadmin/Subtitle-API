2
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,308
What is this? It's blue.

3
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:55,406
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

4
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,700
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

5
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,371
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

6
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,379
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

7
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,434
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

8
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,397
Just remember
who you're working for.

9
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,896
What did you say?

10
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,900
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

11
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,691
Like they don't already know that?

12
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,573
Are you saying that they're stupid?

13
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,911
No, I'm just saying.

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,747
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

15
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,583
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

16
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,209
Is that it?

17
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,417
Is that what you're doing?

18
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,802
Tuco. Tuco.

19
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,268
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

20
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,434
Heisenberg says relax.

21
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela...

22
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,292
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

23
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,589
Yeah, that's messed up.

24
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:46,343
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

25
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,563
Adjusting for inflation...

26
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,487
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

27
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,196
...say, $45,000 a year.

28
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:52,366
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

29
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,582
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

30
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,877
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

31
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,877
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

32
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,175
...say, 2 grand a month.

33
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,890
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

34
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:16,939
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

35
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,655
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

36
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,732
Seven thirty-seven.

37
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,913
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

38
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,454
That is what I need.

39
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,045
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

40
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,090
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

41
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,796
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

42
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,174
It's doable. Definitely doable.

43
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,621
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

44
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,426
Heisenberg!

45
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,987
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

46
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,394
What's the matter with you?

47
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,948
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

48
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,820
- Oh, damn, Tuco.
- Shut up!

49
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,328
There's no pulse.

50
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,996
- Do something.
- Do something?

51
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,535
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

52
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,126
Do something! You're smart, right?

53
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,668
Do that... Do that thing.

54
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,179
No, there's not... There's nothing.

55
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,801
Breathe into his mouth.

56
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,305
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

57
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,184
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

58
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,895
No.

59
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,223
Get rid of him.

60
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,561
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

61
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,565
Buzzards and rats and all that.

62
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,611
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

63
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,744
That sounds like arguing.

64
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,028
Gonzo, hurry up.

65
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,799
What's the big hurry?

66
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,430
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.

67
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,520
Oh, yeah?

68
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,154
You're done.

69
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,866
Hey, I'm back here.

70
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,833
Hello?

71
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,263
Are already married...

72
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,888
Hello?

73
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,933
Thank you to our viewers...

74
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,060
Hey.

75
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,111
The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.

76
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,985
Walt?

77
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,276
Didn't you hear me?

78
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,321
Walt.

79
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,671
Walt.

80
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,040
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

81
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,502
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

82
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,348
Are you okay?

83
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,763
Great.

84
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,313
New hat?

85
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,315
Yeah.

86
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,318
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

87
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,362
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

88
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,446
But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...

89
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,166
...like airports, golf courses...

90
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,391
Where've you been?

91
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,300
What is...?

92
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,422
What are you doing?

93
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,684
Okay.

94
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,012
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

95
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,224
Let me clean up first, okay?

96
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,439
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

97
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,571
Okay. Yeah, just...

98
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,238
Okay. Enough.

99
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,534
Hold up. Stop it.

100
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,868
Stop it!

101
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:45,624
I know you're scared...

102
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:51,138
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

103
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:57,178
But you cannot take it out on me.

104
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,061
Hey, I'm home.

105
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,562
Oh, we are dead.

106
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,231
Dead, man.

107
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,018
Ruto or rute
or however the hell you...

108
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,066
- This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

109
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,192
- Conjecture isn't helping.
- Conjecture...?

110
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,744
- We need to state the facts.
- Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

111
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,075
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

112
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,035
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

113
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,577
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

114
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,252
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

115
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,004
What is that, conjecture?

116
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,837
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

117
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:58,468
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

118
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,520
And that way...
That way he just kept staring at us...

119
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,313
...saying, "You're done."

120
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,521
"You're done"?

121
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,356
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

122
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,442
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

123
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,231
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

124
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,658
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

125
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:22,332
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

126
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,789
What happens
when he decides "no"?

127
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,838
No.

128
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,810
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

129
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,985
- How would you do it?
- What do you mean, how?

130
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,699
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

131
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,912
All right.

132
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,911
Say we set up one last sale.

133
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,330
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

134
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,750
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

135
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,296
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

136
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,338
So three shots?

137
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,267
- Three shots or, I don't know, two.
- Wait, is it two, or is it three?

138
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,851
- Two would probably work, I guess.
- Okay, two shots.

139
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,523
Two in the chest, in the face?

140
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,184
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

141
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,029
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

142
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,281
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

143
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,533
- ...he's probably coming at you, right?
- Yeah.

144
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,904
- You turn toward him.
- Yeah, just wheel on him...

145
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,950
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

146
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,542
How many shots does that take?

147
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,543
- I don't know. Three shots.
- Three shots.

148
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,541
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

149
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,334
Now, is there anyone else there?

150
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,713
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

151
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,556
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

152
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,181
All right.

153
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,682
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

154
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,858
At this point, how many shots fired?

155
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,071
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

156
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,035
It's not...

157
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,585
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

158
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,422
...and you can't even open the gun?

159
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:45,933
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

160
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,892
Yeah.

161
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,782
Call Skyler.

162
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,592
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

163
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,301
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

164
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,886
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

165
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,674
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

166
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,353
...over by UNM tonight...

167
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,054
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

168
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,350
Listen to me. "Hang."

169
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,853
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

170
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,649
I'm still hip.

171
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,939
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

172
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,030
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

173
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:51,407
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

174
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:56,621
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

175
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,510
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

176
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:04,427
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

177
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,131
I wonder if that ever happens.

178
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,885
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

179
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,395
Skyler didn't pick up?

180
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,807
Obviously she's not home.

181
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,908
Baby. Baby, wait up.

182
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,410
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

183
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,581
Dinner tonight. That new place.

184
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,577
- How late they serve?
- I don't know.

185
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,671
You got Dave at 8.

186
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,929
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you do. Remember?

187
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,715
No, that's Thursday.

188
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,390
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

189
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,891
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

190
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,726
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

191
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,017
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

192
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,350
And I'm doing them, Hank.

193
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,487
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

194
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,901
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

195
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,276
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

196
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,921
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

197
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,793
Oh, boy. I...

198
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,252
I think Dave is really helping you.

199
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,850
Yeah.

200
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,802
Yeah.

201
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,109
Sorry about that.

202
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,954
She's...

203
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,926
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

204
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,642
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

205
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,390
- ...and then he says, "Give me a four."
- Hey, Gomez.

206
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,143
Gomez? What do you got for me?

207
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,350
Come on. Chop-chop.

208
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,976
Good morning to you too.

209
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,818
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

210
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,990
- You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

211
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,404
The place smells like feet.

212
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,866
This is them. Check this out.

213
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:44,749
- Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite. So they tell me.

214
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,710
Burns about 5000 degrees.

215
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,920
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

216
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,803
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

217
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,060
Wait. I take that back.

218
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,056
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

219
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:06,024
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

220
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,029
It rolls. Jesus.

221
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,191
- So, what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

222
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,572
P2P?

223
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,661
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

224
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:21,532
Who the hell still does that?

225
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,541
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

226
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,292
Pseudo's in short supply...

227
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,044
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

228
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,836
That and the thermite...

229
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,216
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

230
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,104
- But ranking them as burglars?
- Shit.

231
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:42,148
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

232
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,607
They got book learning
but no street skills.

233
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,194
Maybe they're college kids.

234
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,231
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

235
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,654
Yeah, maybe.

236
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,440
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...

237
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,746
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

238
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,452
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

239
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,421
...and not those boys from Juarez.

240
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:33,795
Your daughter wants out.

241
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,541
Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.

242
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:09,373
We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.

243
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:12,878
Hey, it's me.

244
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,586
Thought I'd try you earlier...

245
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:18,420
...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.

246
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:19,884
I'm realizing now...

247
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,099
...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...

248
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,596
...owing to the extra baby weight...

249
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,226
Hey, sweetie.

250
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,736
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

251
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,493
No.

252
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,906
No, no. Well, not all of it.

253
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:50,833
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...
My stomach, you know.

254
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:55,044
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

255
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,538
- How would he know where I live?
- You sure it was Tuco?

256
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:26,827
Who else could it be?

257
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,080
- Did you ever tell him my name?
- No.

258
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,250
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

259
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,335
- No.
- What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

260
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,705
- Did you tell them anything?
- I didn't say jack.

261
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,459
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

262
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,806
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

263
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:51,263
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

264
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,439
Oh, God. What happens then?

265
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,822
Look, it's got five bullets.

266
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:07,447
I finally figured out how to...
Look, I just finally... I figured it out.

267
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,238
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

268
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:14,373
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

269
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,331
I mean, mathematically.

270
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,707
I've got a better idea.

271
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,843
Thank God.

272
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,431
All right.

273
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,966
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

274
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,313
- Beans.
- Beans?

275
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,853
They're castor beans.

276
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,693
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

277
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,396
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

278
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,194
Climb it and escape?

279
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,860
We are going to process them
into ricin.

280
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:50,706
Rice and beans?

281
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,872
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

282
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,372
It's toxic in small doses.

283
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,046
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

284
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,050
All right.

285
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,050
- All right. So...
- Don't touch them.

286
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,386
- You can get poisoned from beans?
- Yes.

287
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:16,099
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

288
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,941
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

289
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,230
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

290
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,863
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

291
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,443
But it... It killed him?

292
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,572
Oh, yes.

293
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,253
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

294
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:41,420
...and then no more Tuco.

295
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:25,042
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey, Hank.

296
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,296
How you doing?

297
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,467
Is this... This a bad time?

298
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,176
No, come on in.

299
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,942
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

300
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,859
What can I do for you?

301
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:55,990
Maybe we ought...

302
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,165
You wanna sit down first?

303
00:31:58,836 --> 00:31:59,915
I don't know, Hank.

304
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:03,295
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

305
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:10,502
- Did she send you?
- Hell, no.

306
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,296
She's barely even talking to me.

307
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,344
That's why I'm here, okay?

308
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:19,641
Self-preservation. Big time.

309
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,567
Look...

310
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,360
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

311
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:29,031
- I get it.
- Gals.

312
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:32,526
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

313
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,744
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

314
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:42,711
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

315
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,789
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

316
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:50,425
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

317
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,926
Just call her back.

318
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,893
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

319
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,191
That's right.

320
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,319
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

321
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,780
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

322
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:15,326
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

323
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:19,998
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

324
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,074
Yeah.

325
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:27,715
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know...

326
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,094
You knew about this.

327
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,633
We're working on it.

328
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:42,938
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

329
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:46,066
- And I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good, yeah.

330
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,898
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

331
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,778
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

332
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,450
I mean, we gotta, you know.

333
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,325
We gotta support the shit out of her.

334
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,322
Do we?

335
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,917
Yeah.

336
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,080
I need support.

337
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,083
Me.

338
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,292
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

339
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,301
...with the surprise baby on the way.

340
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,679
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

341
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,641
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

342
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,808
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

343
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:24,016
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

344
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,974
And the overdrawn
checking account.

345
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,726
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

346
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,650
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

347
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,987
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

348
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,154
But, oh, I see.

349
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,991
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

350
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:43,697
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

351
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,669
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

352
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,796
...who somehow always manages
to be the center of attention?"

353
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:55,962
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

354
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,529
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

355
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,599
That's all it takes?

356
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,355
That's all it takes.

357
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,065
So now what?

358
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,409
Now we arrange our next meet.

359
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,943
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

360
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,202
Business as usual.

361
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:08,080
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

362
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:14,580
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

363
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,914
Care to try it?"

364
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,921
Okay, well, what's new about it?

365
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,297
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

366
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,058
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

367
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,764
It gets the user insanely high.

368
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,387
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

369
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:34,059
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

370
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,444
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

371
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:43,828
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

372
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,611
...it'll look like natural causes.

373
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,877
- What, like a heart attack?
- Yeah.

374
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:52,995
Or the flu, maybe.

375
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:56,048
His associates won't know
any differently...

376
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,125
...and we'll be in the clear.

377
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,298
Not if Tuco kills us first.

378
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,696
Just keep it down.

379
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,032
Hey, Hank. What's up?

380
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,822
Oh, hey, buddy.

381
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:29,780
You been home yet?

382
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,660
No. Why?

383
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,207
Well...

384
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:38,799
Because I really screwed up.

385
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,093
I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.

386
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:45,056
I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.

387
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:50,508
- I should have just kept out of it.
- Yeah, well, okay.

388
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,307
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

389
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:56,188
Yeah, well, that... You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

390
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,975
Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

391
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,104
Jesus, the wives, huh?

392
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,696
Hank, unfortunately, I really...

393
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,409
Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.

394
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:13,450
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.

395
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,377
You wanna see something
really freaky?

396
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:18,873
- Well, I would, but...
- Seriously, Walt, this is...

397
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:24,220
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

398
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,554
Hank.

399
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,891
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

400
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:38,389
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

401
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,105
Couple of local bulletheads.

402
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:46,277
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

403
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,869
Walt, you there?

404
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,702
Hey, Walt?

405
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,551
- I'm taking this.
- No. It's my gun. I need it!

406
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,333
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

407
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,674
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've...

408
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:12,260
I've gotta get home. My family.

409
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,428
Skyler?

410
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,476
Walter, Jr.?

411
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,819
Skyler?

412
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,707
Hey.

413
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:01,876
Where's Walter, Jr.?

414
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:05,752
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

415
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:12,387
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

416
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,638
So where have you been this time?

417
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,026
Walt?

418
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,167
Walt?

419
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,600
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

420
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,907
Walt!

421
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,533
I'll be right there.

422
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,831
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

423
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,458
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

424
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:33,923
...named Tuco Salamanca.

425
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:36,675
- Guess he got tired of associating.
- Yeah.

426
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,512
- Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

427
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,968
Thanks.

428
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:47,640
The big one smells fresher.

429
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:50,856
You guys find a death wound?

430
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:58,694
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

431
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,659
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

432
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,453
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

433
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,834
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

434
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:22,602
Snap.

435
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:25,646
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

436
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,697
Oh, this is beautiful.

437
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,695
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

438
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:42,621
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

439
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,239
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

440
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:49,409
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

441
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,963
...when the stack must have shifted.

442
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:57,588
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

443
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:02,383
- Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
- Don't you just?

444
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,724
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

445
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:08,187
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

446
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:18,233
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

447
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,537
I don't know where to begin.

448
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,801
What the hell are you doing here?

449
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:33,013
Get in.

450
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:48,158
Get in.

451
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,095
Let's go.

452
