00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:39,377
Soon as I could...

171
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:43,614
I came for you.

172
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,050
What, so you can just

173
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,418
jump wherever you want?

174
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,153
If I can see where I'm going.

175
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,489
We got a second chance, Clay.

176
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:52,757
We can leave Central City.

177
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,828
Do... Do all the things we talked about.

178
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,265
I can't leave yet, baby.

179
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:04,068
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

180
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,103
I skipped town before paying him back.

181
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,105
He'll find us.

182
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:11,208
Hey, but with what you can do,

183
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,578
we can pay off that debt.

184
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,682
Then we'll be free, and
we can go anywhere in the world.

185
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:21,418
Together.

186
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:29,693
Not even Barry's cells move this fast.

187
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,595
I've never seen anything like it.

188
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,564
So Clay Parker is a meta-human?

189
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,932
Not so fast.

190
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,601
The particulate residue Barry gathered

191
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:40,104
at Iron Heights does contain
Clay Parker's DNA,

192
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,740
but also DNA of a woman.

193
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,975
Run her DNA against
the CCPD criminal database.

194
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:48,145
See if you get a match.

195
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:52,382
Yahtzee.

196
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:53,884
Her name's Shawna Baez.

197
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,285
Mostly petty crimes,

198
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,721
and this girl likes to party, apparently.

199
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:00,157
Long list of disorderly
conducts at local bars.

200
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,359
(Joe) So I'm guessing we find
her, we find Clay Parker.

201
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:03,994
- Barry?
- Yeah.

202
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:05,462
In the meantime,
let's track these particulates

203
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:08,632
and see how they work.

204
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,834
I'll be right with you guys.

205
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:19,910
I've had the biggest craving for Thai food.

206
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:22,479
You said you knew what happened to Ronnie

207
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,481
and how he was still alive.

208
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:27,450
And you said Professor Stein
was at S.T.A.R. Labs

209
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,952
the night of the explosion.

210
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:32,255
Yes. He was.

211
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:34,291
Why?

212
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:42,933
The mystery isn't why Stein went
to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

213
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:46,269
It's why he didn't leave.

214
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,804
Tell me.

215
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,673
Can't. I have to show you.

216
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:51,141
[scoffs]

217
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:54,644
You are not getting out of this cell.

218
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:59,916
Fair enough, but I know you, Cisco.

219
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,551
I know how much you looked up to Ronnie.

220
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:03,353
He was like family.

221
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:07,257
A family you built for yourself here.

222
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,959
I know how much you want
to see that family healed.

223
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,561
Let me help you.

224
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:15,031
I don't believe you.

225
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,934
Well, I'm telling you the truth, Cisco.

226
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:22,038
When you are ready,
you know where to find me.

227
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:40,876
What's that smile about?

228
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:43,111
I saw my dad today.

229
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:44,413
No glass, no phones.

230
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,048
Just me and him, face-to-face.

231
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,115
Joe arranged it.

232
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:48,951
That must have been amazing, Barry.

233
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:51,253
Yeah. I really needed it.

234
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:53,855
I'm sure he needed it, too.

235
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:56,792
Were you there investigating the breakout?

236
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:59,394
- Mm-hmm.
- That is a big story.

237
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,530
Which I am not a part of.

238
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:04,666
My editor wants me writing about
The Flash, and only The Flash.

239
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:06,034
Is that a bad thing?

240
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:07,436
I don't know. I would just like

241
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,704
to be thought of
as more than The Flash PR flack.

242
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,240
I mean, if I don't write something soon,

243
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:13,642
I think I might lose my job.

244
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,043
Hey, no.

245
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,312
We will find you
a great story to write about.

246
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,446
Together.

247
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:19,948
Okay?

248
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,618
You know I'm always here for you.

249
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,787
I know.

250
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,429
Didn't know you enjoyed yourself
a little rough trade.

251
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,564
If I'm gonna let you out,

252
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:41,002
I'm not taking any chances.

253
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:44,272
Curiosity's a maddening thing, is it not?

254
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,545
(Barry) What do you mean
you've been asking around?

255
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:53,648
(Henry) Do you know a Marcus Stockheimer?

256
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:57,218
Sure, he's some mid-level gangster.

257
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,953
He works mainly on the south side.

258
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,689
Word is, Clay Parker was
a runner for Marcus.

259
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,492
When Clay got pinched,
Marcus lost a lot of money.

260
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,861
Apparently Marcus doesn't like
losing money.

261
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,629
So, what? So Parker can't leave

262
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:10,698
Central City until he's paid off his debt?

263
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,266
From what I'm told,

264
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:13,835
if you're a member of the Stockheimer crew,

265
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:15,102
you get out,

266
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:16,804
first thing you do is pay him a visit

267
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,974
or suffer the consequences.

268
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:21,509
All right.

269
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:24,178
No more playing cop.

270
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,746
Promise me.

271
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:28,683
I hear you.

272
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:30,151
All right.

273
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:38,392
You said you were gonna show me
what happened to Ronnie.

274
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:40,394
Ronnie died inside the building.

275
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:42,329
What are we doing out here?

276
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:45,165
What do you see?

277
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,834
I don't know.

278
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:50,938
Buildings, walls, dirt.

279
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,841
Wells would be so disappointed
in your observational skills.

280
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:57,044
Look again.

281
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,317
[Hartley speaks foreign language]

282
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,219
It's Japanese.

283
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,754
How can you speak six languages

284
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:09,089
and sound like a dick in every one of them?

285
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:11,225
It means "bomb shadow"

286
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:13,060
They found these all over Hiroshima

287
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:15,763
after the first atomic bomb was dropped.

288
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:20,867
This shadow belonged to Martin Stein.

289
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:24,371
The accelerator explosion did this to him?

290
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,039
You really don't see it, do you?

291
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,609
You're gonna kick yourself
when you figure it out.

292

Oh, man.

You were full of it then,
and you're full of it now.

your lame-ass tricks.

We're going back into the Pipeline.

Aah.

309
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:10,083
If you know how to find Ronnie,

310
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,751
then you better tell me.

311
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:12,819
Right now.

312
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:13,887
Please, make it stop.

313
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:14,921
Please. I'll show you.

314
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,956
I'll show... Ah... Aah!

315
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,425
- [screeching stops]
- Try that again,

316
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,728
and I won't make it stop.

317
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,962
Ever.

318
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,330
I'm impressed.

319
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:28,401
Didn't think you had that in you.

320
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:30,770
But you have to take these off me

321
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:33,339
if you want to find out the truth.

322
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,241
And why's that?

323
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:38,444
It'll look a little conspicuous
where we're going next.

324
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,317
Mm. I was analyzing the particulates

325
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,519
that Clay Parker and
Shawna Baez left behind,

326
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,287
and I found something very interesting.

327
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,290
When Clay's cells come into
contact with Shawna's,

328
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:54,493
they adopt her properties.

329
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,965
Something bothering you?

330
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,700
Why would you ask that?

331
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:02,835
You're doing that
biting your lower lip thing

332
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:04,804
that you do when something's bothering you.

333
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,505
[clears throat] I'm fine.

334

669
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:44,712
It's a valid question.

670
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:46,714
Hello?

671
00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:49,050
What?

672
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:50,218
(Barry) Yeah, I'll be right there.

673
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,653
All right.

674
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:55,089
What's wrong?

675
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,257
M... My dad.

676
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:58,226
He's been stabbed.

677
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:08,091
Dad... What happened?

678
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:11,723
A rather stern reminder, I'd say,

679
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:14,459
not to poke around
Marcus Stockheimer's business.

680
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:17,529
Dad, I told you to stop.

681
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,494
Your dad called me with more intel.

682
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:24,765
It helped us track down Clay and
Shawna and arrest Stockheimer.

683
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:28,402
I managed to screw up
Marcus's big heist, too, so...

684
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:30,771
You two kept working together,
and you didn't tell me?

685
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,606
(Henry) It isn't his fault.

686
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,675
I did it to help you.

687
00:31:34,677 --> 00:31:39,647
You getting stabbed and beaten
is not helping me.

688
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,516
Look, I... I... I don't get to

689
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:47,388
feel useful very much in here.

690
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,423
So if I can help you for a change,

691
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:52,226
I'm gonna want to be there for you.

692
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:55,429
Just like you've been there
for me all these years.

693
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,870
Yep.

694
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,307
You said Marcus had a big heist coming up?

695
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,542
Mm.

696
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:10,043
Do you know anything else about it?

697
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
Dad, tell me who did this to you.

698
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,147
No, it doesn't matter, slugger.

699
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:14,615
But you said you want to help me.

700
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:18,318
So help me.

701
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,787
One of Marcus's boys.

702
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:22,956
Julius.

703
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,636
What the hell?

704
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,639
Evening, Julius.

705
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,241
How'd I get out here?

706
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:42,642
You escaped.

707
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,611
They catch me trying to escape,

708
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,280
they're gonna add five years
to my sentence.

709
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:49,049
Ten, actually.

710
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,483
Unless you tell me where

711
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:52,185
Marcus Stockheimer's next job is gonna be.

712
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,620
[alarm sounds]

713
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:56,456
Oh! Guards will be here any second.

714
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,724
I'd start blabbing.

715
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,826
Okay!

716
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,161
Okay.

717
00:33:01,163 --> 00:33:03,496
It's a TDK and money transfer truck

718
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:06,199
coming from the federal reserve
bank in St. Louis.

719
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,501
Supposed to be millions.

720
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:10,236
Delivery is around 8:00.

721
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,838
That's all I know. I swear.

722
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,173
That's right now.

723
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,675
- [barking dogs approaching]
- [men shouting]

724
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:16,676
Hey!

725
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:18,878
Hey, what about me?

726
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,456
I think we got company.

727
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:35,228
What the...

728
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,035
Okay.

729
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,204
Let's go.

730
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,784
I got this.

731
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:02,688
Why the hell do you care what we do?

732
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,290
Are you a cop or something?

733
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,325
Something.

734
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:15,267
[both grunting, blows thudding]

735
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:30,649
Come on!

736
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:34,453
[grunts]

737
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:42,795
[tires peel out]

738
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:51,637
Barry, remember: she cannot
teleport if she cannot see.

739
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,272
Limit her field of vision.

740
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:06,451
[glass shattering]

741
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,020
No.

742
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,341
He left me.

743
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,549
Is there any way she can
teleport out of this?

744
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:48,983
It's impossible.

745
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,051
It's one-way glass.

746
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,886
It's mirrored on the inside.

747
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:55,156
No one dangerous is ever gonna
get out of this thing again.

748
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:02,363
Shawna.

749
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:03,865
Clay left you.

750
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:06,134
He's out there, and you're in here.

751
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:09,570
You know what the crazy thing is?

752
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,239
I still love him.

753
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,413
Cisco.

754
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:27,519
Crazy is right.

755
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,723
Some people are worth being crazy for.

756
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:35,794
I'm sorry if I was a bit of
a drunken mess the other night.

757
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,462
Actually, it was pretty fun.

758
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,931
Yeah, it was.

759
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:42,100
You know what?

760
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:44,602
I think everybody's been right
about you and me.

761
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:49,040
Both of us have been hung up
on people for way too long.

762
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,875
If what Cisco says is true,

763
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:54,312
that Ronnie merged with Martin Stein,

764
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:59,050
then he's not alive anymore.

765
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,052
Time for me to move on.

766
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,288
Find someone new to be crazy about.

767
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,161
[both chuckling]

768
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,729
[sighs]

769
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,997
All right, well.

770
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,098
I'll see you tomorrow.

771
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,933
Yes, sure.

772
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,569
- Bye.
- Bye.

773
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,852
That's for you.

774
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,487
I thought maybe you could help me out,

775
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,689
if you're willing.

776
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,394
This is about the breakout at Iron Heights.

777
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,763
Clay Parker. He's still on the loose,

778
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,364
and we need to catch him.

779
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,900
Why are you giving this to me?

780
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:53,037
'Cause you're a good reporter.

781
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,206
And the only one I know.

782
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,379
You're not the only one who's fast.

783
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,217
Hey, what are you doing here?

784
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:08,485
- Hey.
- If you came to check on me,

785
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,787
that is really sweet,

786
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,523
but I think everything's gonna be okay.

787
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,425
I'm glad. Uh...

788
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:17,161
I actually am not here to see you.

789
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:18,695
No?

790
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,898
No, I have a lunch date.

791
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,733
With who?

792
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,401
- Ready.
- Hey.

793
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,904
Oh, hey, you're our new stringer, right?

794
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:27,971
Yeah.

795
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm Linda Park. Sports.

796
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:31,808
Iris West.

797
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,711
How did you two meet?

798
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,346
Well, it's actually kind of a funny story.

799
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,414
(Barry) Yeah, I'll tell
you later, all right?

800
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,415
- You ready?
- Yeah.

801
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,016
- Okay.
- See ya.

802
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,052
Have fun.

803
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,625
(Henry) So an actual date this time.

804
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,927
Good for you.

805
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:54,798
You didn't tell her
your dad's in the slammer?

806
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,134
No, I read in a magazine that
that's a big turnoff.

807
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,169
Smart.

808
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,372
[both laughing]

809
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,473
Hey.

810
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,575
You see this?

811
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,910
No.

812
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,912
I haven't.

813
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:12,983
The Flash.

814
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:14,718
I saw him once.

815
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,287
In here.

816
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,923
Watched him save Joe's life.

817
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:20,924
Joe told me about that.

818
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:22,091
I guess he was lucky.

819
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,560
Hm.

820
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,762
Lucky Joe.

821
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,766
The strangest thing.

822
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,268
I get roughed up by Julius, end up in here.

823
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,671
Next thing I know, Julius is
caught trying to escape,

824
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,040
claims The Flash broke him out.

825
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:42,211
Won't be seeing Julius for a long time now.

826
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:47,417
Guess I'm lucky too, huh?

827
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:50,119
Dad.

828
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,222
If I was The Flash,

829
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:57,360
don't you think that you'd be
the first to know about it?

830
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,961
Yeah.

831
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,700
Well, if The Flash were my son,
I'd tell him a few things.

832
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,869
First off, I'd tell him
it's a dangerous world,

833
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,071
so be careful.

834
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,377
Then I'd tell him he's a hero.

835
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:17,580
And he's saving a lot of lives.

836
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:23,319
But the most important thing
for him to know, I feel,

837
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,589
is that his father's proud of him.

838
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:41,637
Power grid's been going haywire
in this sector.

839
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,439
The system's so antiquated.

840
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,941
[clank]

841
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:57,119
[heavy breathing]

842
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:11,867
[growling]

843
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,635
Whoa.

844
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,404
What was that?

845
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:43,164
- [snarling]
- Aah!

846
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,000
[snarling, growling]
