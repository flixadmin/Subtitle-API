1
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,062
<i>There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.</i>

2
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>A vile god, so large and so powerful</i>

3
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,487
<i>that it consumed entire planets as fuel.</i>

4
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,989
<i>Few believed such a thing could be true,</i>

5
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:17,536
<i>until the day we saw Unicron
with our own eyes.</i>

6
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,396
<i>But he didn't just come for our planet.</i>

7
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,649
<i>He wanted our greatest technology,</i>

8
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,943
<i>the Trans warp Key.</i>

9
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,322
<i>And he sent
his most powerful henchman to collect it,</i>

10
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,157
<i>Scourge.</i>

11
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,916
More enemies are landing.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,376
We won't be safe for long.

13
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,627
Do we have the key?

14
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,505
You must take it.

15
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,341
Keep it hidden,

16
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,218
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

17
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,929
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

18
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,850
No. Protecting our Trans warp Key
is all that matters!

19
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,977
Go. Use it to escape.

20
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,812
What will you do?

21
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,815
I'll hold him off.

22
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,692
Buy you some time.

23
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,694
Then I'm staying with you.

24
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,821
This is my fight.

25
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,992
Listen, if Unicron were to get the key,

26
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,328
he could open a portal
through time and space

27
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,206
with no end to the worlds
he could destroy.

28
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,085
It is now your time to lead the Maximals,

29
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,170
Optimus Primal.

30
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:57,571
So you're this planet's great warrior.

31
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:04,328
Mmm. You have such a beautiful world

32
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,917
filled with an abundance of life.

33
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,255
Savory.

34
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,925
My master grows hungry.

35
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:23,848
Give me the Trans warp Key,
and he will spare your home.

36
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,393
We'd rather die
than let him reach other planets.

37
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,896
So be it.

38
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,458
Benefits of serving the almighty Unicron.

39
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,255
They never learn.

40
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,216
You're too late, Scourge.

41
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,928
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy forever.

42
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,602
No!

43
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,610
His sacrifice will be our oath.

44
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,778
To preserve the key,

45
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,239
no matter the cost.

46
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:36,378
You let them slip away
with the Trans warp Key.

47
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:40,925
Scour the universe
and find where the Maximals have gone.

48
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:45,804
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

49
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,057
Yes, my lord.

50
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:54,188
Once I have the key,
I alone will reign supreme.

70
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,681
I ain't your butler, Kris.

<i>Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.</i>

<i>It's Tails.</i>

73
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,729
Oh, my bad,

74
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,065
Kristopher Diaz from 974 Wilson Avenue,

75
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,900
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

76
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,194
<i>No real names. They're listening.</i>

77
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,615
Ain't no secret government agencies
worried about us, Tails.

78
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
Now get your behind out here
while it's hot.

79
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,745
At least they got that going for 'em.
Here, I ironed this for you.

80
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,390
- I already ironed it. What...
- Yeah, like you cooked those eggs?

81
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,958
What you mean? They're just... seasoned.

82
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:40,252
Aw, come on.

83
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,545
Come eat, bro.

84
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,173
I can't get past Bowser.

85
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,674
Well, good morning to you too.

86
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,551
Drink this and take your medicine.

87
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,678
- All of it.
- Okay.

88
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,221
Are you sure you can take him?

89
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,932
Yeah, uh, hospital's on the way.
I got time.

90
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,810
And if that lady,
that administrator, is there

91
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,354
and she mentions a bill,

92
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,438
just...

93
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,899
tell her we're handling it.

94
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,569
I will. And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

95
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,155
Good luck on the interview.

96
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,783
Don't forget to laugh at all their jokes.

97
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,869
- White people love that shit.
- Ma, language.

98
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,037
Okay!

99
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,498
Remember, I have class tonight,
so I'll be home late.

100
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,166
<i>- Los quiero.
- I love you.</i>

101
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,669
Hurry up, man. We gotta get into the city.

102
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,633
Hey. Hold up. Hold up.

103
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,301
Your hand's hurting again?

104
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,970
No, it's nothing.

105
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,972
Yo, let me see.

106
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,810
Kris.

107
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,023
It's swollen.

108
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:46,235
The sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

109
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,778
How long has this been going on?

110
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,279
Couple days.

111
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,199
Hey, yo, look, I told you,

112
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,826
you gotta tell me these things.

113
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,495
You fighting this alone,
or we fighting it together?

114
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,039
Together.

115
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,917
Home team?

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,085
Home team.

117
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,720
Two for ten. Two for...
Stop touching everything.

118
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,887
Oh, hell no.

119
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,691
Yo, Kris, what'd I tell you about
letting your mans come out the crib

120
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,885
looking like a whole square?

121
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,852
Only so much I can do.

122
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,729
Yeah, whatever, bro. Look. Here.

123
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,273
Ooh! My dawg!

124
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,901
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

125
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,112
Yeah. Says the dude
who can't even afford cable.

126
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,488
"Says the guy who..."

127
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,574
I choose not to purchase cable.

128
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,201
It's my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

129
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,494
of modern-day capitalism!

130
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,748

Intern? Intern?

144
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,131
I paged you three times.
Why didn't you call me?

145
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,217
Okay, well,
I figured if I stopped to call,

146
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,301
that would make me later.

147
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,720
The police are here.

148
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,597
They busted an art auction.

149
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,308
The owner claims
that everything is authentic,

150
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,852
but they want a second opinion.

151
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,313
All right.

152
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,278
The da Vinci sketch is legit.
The painting's a copy.

153
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,322
Real one's at the National Gallery
in London.

154
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,450
Roman vase.

155
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,120
Valuable, but you are not
gonna retire off of them.

156
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,083
The sinner's Greek curse tablet.

157
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,544
It would be expensive, but it's a fake.

158
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,087
How can you tell?

159
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,714
See the spelling? Roman.

160
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,424
Doesn't even show up in that era.

161
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,134
Got it.

162
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,054
Officers, I figured it out.

163
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:23,517
So, the da Vinci, that is real.

164
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,611
Hmm.
Now, where did you come from?

165
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,878
What are you?

166
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,505
- It's pretty neat, right?
- Yes.

167
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,674
Where is it from?

168
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,551
They just discovered it in Sudan.

169
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,513
The boys say it's Horus,
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

170
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,683
This symbol is
definitely not hieroglyphic.

171
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,394
Well, if it's as exotic as it looks,

172
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,313
<i>I'm gonna get a feature in Minerva.</i>

173
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,107
Uh, Jillian?

174
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,320
Okay, team, let's do it.

175
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,964
Okay, what are the rules?

176
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,926
Bros before hos.

177
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,640
"Don't be a problem.
Don't go looking for a problem."

178
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,767
- Or else we're gonna...
- have a problem.

179
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,976
I know, I know.

180
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,603
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit.

181
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,111
Mr. Diaz?

182
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,740
Hey, I know
we're a little behind on the bill.

183
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,950
Three months behind.

184
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,386
And until your account is current,
you can't bring your brother here.

185
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,763
- I've told you that.
- I'm gonna fix it.

186
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,206
- I just need a little more time.
- You can always take him to the ER.

187
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,792
Well, they won't see him in the ER
unless he's critical.

188
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,377
- Mr. Diaz.
- He's 11!

189
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,129
He's 11 years old.

190
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,342
Come on, Kris, we gotta go.

191
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,795
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later, man. All right?

192
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,264
Come on. Let's get out of here.

193
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,769
Hey, yo. Sit here.

194
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,189
And don't move!

195
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,485
<i>After a conference with
Simpson's attorney, Howard Weitzman...</i>

196
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,653
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

197
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,781
Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

198
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,241
I'm Noah Diaz.

199
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,910
- It's been canceled.
- No. No, that has to be a mistake.

200
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,787
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

201
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,833
Just need your authorization...

202
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,668
Mr. Bishop! Hey! Hey!

203
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,170
It's okay, Walker.

204
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,382
It's me, Noah Diaz. Sir, I think
your boy back there is confused.

205
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,759
- He said our interview was canceled.
- Because it is.

206
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,804
Wait, why? On the phone,
you said I was perfect for the job.

207
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,115
You said this was just a formality.

208
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,766
It was until your old commanding officer
called me back.

209
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,270
Said you were brave,
an expert com tech, but unreliable.

210
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,730
Couldn't trust you.

211
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,565
Your head was always somewhere else.

212
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,191
Sir, I can explain all of that.

213
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,777
I had some responsibilities at home.
My brother, he's sick...

214
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,280
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

215
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,407
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

216
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,993
I'm a hard worker, okay? I just...

217
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,288
I just really need a break.

218
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,667
Listen, I can't have someone like you
mess up what I've built.

219
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,878
Someone like me?

220
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,135
You don't know anything about me!

221
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,763
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

222
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,433
God.

223
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,810
Hey, look.

224
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,604
Superman went on a bunch of interviews

225
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,648
<i>before he got his job on the Daily Planet.</i>

226
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,485
- But he never gave up.
- I'm not Superman, Kris.

227
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,819
Life ain't a comic book.

228
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,363
I'm just saying. You'll get the next one.

229
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,532
Yo, there is no next one.

230
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,993
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

231
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,337
Yo, man, I'm sorry.

232
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,380
It's all right.

233
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,673
No, it's not.

234
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,678
None of this is.

235
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,521
You know what?

236
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,564
Come on.

237
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,902
Yo, here, bro.

238
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,530
Just head upstairs.
I'll be right there, all right?

239
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,203
So what was you talking about earlier?

240
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,288

248
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,307
Hey, yo, you want one?

249
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,601
No. I don't want any candy.

250
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,520
You gotta relax, man.

251
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,605
Your energy is really affecting my chi.

252
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,150
And I get it.
I was nervous my first time too.

253
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,113
But you might wanna do some breathing
exercises or something. Look at me.

254
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,244
My man, my man, my man, my man.

255
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,914
It's just I ain't done this before.

256
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,667
I know that. But them rich cats in there,

257
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,752
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

258
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,504
to make themselves feel better.

259
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,190
If you look at it
from a holistic perspective,

260
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,716
we doing them a favor.

261
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,845
- Hey, yo! You're welcome!
- Will you stop?

262
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,762
What are you doing?

263
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,557
This ain't about to
affect they pockets at all.

264
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,225
And it's about to be easy as hell.

265
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,728
So why you ain't the one
going in there and doing it?

266
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,230
<i>Because, papito, I'm the mastermind.</i>

267
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,108
Now come on, put this in your ear.

268
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,861
My man, you serious?
Yo, is that even clean?

269
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,362
It's the fourth quarter,

270
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,531
we got about
ten seconds left on the clock,

271
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,241
and you got the rock.

272
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,452
- Get rid of this.
- Hey, man!

273
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,039
Don't slam the...

274
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,589
Okay. I am off to my fundraiser.

275
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,966
- What do you think?
- It's nice.

276
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,762
Um, can I... can I run something by you?

277
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,975
So I've been doing some research,

278
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,187
and I don't think
that the statuette is Horus.

279
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,314
As a matter of fact, I'm sure it's not.

280
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,067
The boys dated it around 5000 BC, right?

281
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,652
Mm-hmm.

282
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,903
But the Nubians,

283
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,863
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

284
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,782
until 600 years after that.

285
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,325
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

286
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,535
I don't even think
it's from that part of the world.

287
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,746
I think it might be Aztec or Inca.

288
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,501
It's not some Egyptian god.
It's something else.

289
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,466
Interesting.

290
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,759
Get those pressed, okay?

291
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,992
Yeah.

292
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,578
There you go. Let that breath fill you up.

293
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,373
<i>In... out.</i>

294
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,250
Please stop talking.

295
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,128
Okay, all right, I get it,
you don't like to chitchat back and forth.

296
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,462
But I got something for you.

297
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,677
You got a robbing mix tape?

298
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,761
<i>Uh, no.</i>

299
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,222
I got a liberating mix tape.

300
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,611
You feeling that, huh?

301
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,696
Yeah, whatever.

302
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,343
<i>All right, there shouldn't be
nobody in this part of the building.</i>

to just waltz right on in.</i>

304
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,756
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

305
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,050

473
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,189
I mean, you looking pretty rough yourself.

474
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,776
Sorry, sir.

475
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,654
I will deal with your mistake later.

476
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:10,786
Okay, the energy surge
we felt was in the 4,000 yottahertz range,

477
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,747
which is undetectable to humans.

478
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,000
I've reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

479
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,587
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

480
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,589
<i>What the hell am I looking at?</i>

481
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,215
The Trans warp Key.

482
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,260
It was thought to be lost
thousands of years ago.

483
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,556
<i>It was once used
to open space-time portals</i>

484
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,060
<i>to Energon-rich planets
throughout the universe.</i>

485
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,395
You mean Energon-rich planets like...

486
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,980
Cybertron.

487
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,941
After seven long years stranded on Earth,

488
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,027
we've finally found a way home.

489
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,945
Wait till I catch you, Reek.

490
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,199
Okay, so where is this t-tran, t-trun...

491
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,617
- Trans warp Key?
- Thank you.

492
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,452
It's in the new museum on Ellis Island.

493
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,622
<i>Let's blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge!</i>

494
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,792
No, we can't just go in
blasting and steal it, Bee.

495
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,502
The humans will hunt us down.

496
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:02,088
What we need is a quiet way in.

497
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,011
Ooh, how about him?

498
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,263
- No.
- What? Come on, man.

499
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,849
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors,

500
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,477
grab the key, leave a nice IOU
and peace out.

501
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,105
- He's perfect.
- What?

502
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,565
No, it is a bad idea.

503
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,692
I agree with Big Man.

504
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,821
So, it's been real, y'all. But...

505
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,697
- Uh, time-out.
- Mirage.

506
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,826
I know. I know. Just relax.
Let me just talk to my guy real quick.

507
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,286
Yo, don't leave me
with these tight-asses, bro.

508
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,371
We make a great team.

509
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,331
This is a waste of time.

510
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,000
Look, I'm not breaking into a museum
for some space robots.

511
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,002
But what about for friendship?

512
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,464
Uh, uh... Or, or, or

513
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,883
what about for cash?

514
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,846
Uh-huh. You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock...

515
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,181
no offense,
love the neighborhood and all...

516
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,559
and then I let you sell me.

517
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,686
Lambo?

518
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:00,687
Ferrari?

519
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,439
Indy?

520
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,735
Look, you get paid and then I'll split.

521
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,821
So all I gotta do is walk in and out?

522
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,282
All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

523
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,076
Cross my spark and hope to die.

524
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,453
Wow! That was corny
when I said it out loud.

525
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:21,500
What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

526
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,752
You let me worry about him.

527
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:24,837
Cool?

528
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,592
Ah! Got him! He's in, baby! Whoo!

529
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,412
So y'all are robots
that transform into cars,

530
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,581
even though you're from way out in space.

531
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,334
But now there's this key
that opens a portal back to your home?

532
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,503
Oh, and you know this
because there's a beacon light in the sky

533
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,214
that I can't see because I'm human.

534
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:11,008
- You say that like it's weird.
- It's super weird.

535
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,886
You know what's weird?
Marky Mark is leaving the Funky Bunch!

536
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,263
I heard he's just gonna pursue acting now.

537
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,473
- That's crazy!
- What?

538
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,391
- How does that...
- What a world.

539
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,601
Whatever, man.

540
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,353
I'm just trying to collect this money

541
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,231
and get your angry-ass boss off of Earth
before he blows a gasket.

542
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,982
Don't take it personal.

543
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,817
He just misses home.

544
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,321
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

545
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,531
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know,

546
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:38,410
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

547
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,996
Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here,

548
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,207
like he has to fix it all on his own.

549
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,126
<i>All right, team,
heads up. There's security up ahead.</i>

550
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,461
Nice!

551
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,754
This is gonna be fun, man.

552
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,131
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

553
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:54,426
You need to turn into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

554
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,762
I got something
way better than that.

555
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,443
Good call.

556
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,407
I do not like this plan.

557
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,493
Yeah, Mirage isn't
really known for being quiet.

558
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,495
At least Mirage is one of us.

559
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,998
We should not be relying on a human.

560
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,332
<i>They are my friends.</i>

561
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,584
I know one was good to you, Bee,

562
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,503
but this is not our world.

563
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,464
The humans will always
protect what is theirs.

564
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:35,426
We can only trust our own kind.

565
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,761
<i>You can't handle the truth!</i>

566
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:41,432
I do not want you going
to that drive-in theater anymore.

567
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,271
Night bird, search the island.

568
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:34,610
Finally, the hunt draws to a close.

569
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,346
Hello?

570
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,864
Fudge.

571
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:21,949
Oh.

572
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:23,826
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

573
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,289
- Hey, are you okay?
- Back up!

574
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,417
- Yo, are you okay?
- Back up! Back up! Back up!

575
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,001
I didn't think anyone was in here.

576
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,464
That's it.

577
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,387
Who are you? Hmm?

578
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,721
I'm, uh...

579
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,515
the janitor.

580
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,144
Security!

581
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,188
No, no, no! You don't have to do that!
It's not what it looks like.

582
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,275
It looks like you're trying
to steal museum property.

583
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,152
Okay, it's a little what it looks like.

584
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,405
Oh, shit.

585
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,490
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, yo, yo!

586
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,534
- It doesn't belong to you anyway.
- No, no, no!

587
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,702
Just stop! Just...

588
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,456
Hey, hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

589
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,540
Let me ex...

590
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,417
It belongs to...

591
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,879
to these...

592
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:23,469
these giant robots from space.

593
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,220
Really?

594
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,930
Look, I'm gonna need that.

595
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,392
Da... Oh!

596
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,269
- Damn!
- Hey!

597
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,813
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?
Don't move.

598
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,297
Man, it's about time you showed up!

599
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:45,574
The key.

600
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,434
- You were telling the truth.
- Yeah.

601
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,728
But those ones aren't with me.

602
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:25,405
Rip the flesh from their bones
and bring me the key.

603
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,411
It's yours.

604
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,882
Guys, we got company!

605
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,017
Autobots, protect the key!

606
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,271
Catch!

607
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,783
<i>Not so fast!</i>

608
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,624
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

609
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,970
Impossible!

610
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,848
I enjoy that look of confusion

611
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,935
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

612
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,697
What the hell are those things?

613
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,949
Are you okay?

614
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,122
- Hey! Stop following me!
- I'm not following you!

615
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,124
I'm just escaping in the same direction.

00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,624
My God! Put me down!

633
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,046
Whoa, that was so scary.

634
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,048
Oh, cool. You're still alive.

635
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,594
Get the key!

636
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,346
Noah, get outta here!

637
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,892
Get off me! I hate spiders!

638
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:27,147
- Go, go, go!
- Don't die, don't die, don't die!

639
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,778
Go! Get out of here!

640
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:42,329
Uh-uh-uh. Leaving so soon?

641
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,915
Yo! Look out!

642
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,587
The key!

643
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,762
Enough of these games. I'll get it myself.

644
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,680
<i>Not on my watch.</i>

645
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,711
Aw, don't be frightened, humans.

646
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,006
This'll all be over soon.

647
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,095
And you call yourself a Prime.

648
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,139
Primus would be ashamed.

649
00:44:56,486 --> 00:45:00,490
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

650
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,199
Bee!

651
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:05,662
<i>O Captain! My Captain!</i>

652
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,330
No!

653
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:27,684
Bee.

654
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:36,401
Now to add a Prime to my collection.

655
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,332
Maximals.

656
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,418
Good.
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

657
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,671
No. We got what we came for.

658
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,637
No.

659
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,891
This cannot be.

660
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,535
We must go now. Come with me.

661
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:56,064
This is my fault. It should've been me.

662
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,943
I'm sorry for your loss.

663
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:03,029
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

664
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:06,491
My name is Airazor.

665
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,410
I am a Maximal.

666
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,329
A warrior from both your past and future.

667
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:14,582
Oh, right. That... That tracks. Yeah.

668
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,628
We fled our home planet
on the eve of its destruction.

669
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:22,298
We sought refuge and hid here on Earth.

670
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,676
Right.
So you're a Maximal. Y'all are Autobots.

671
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,845
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

672
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,054
Terrorcons.

673
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,724
Servants of a dark, hungry god

674
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,893
who feeds on entire worlds
to sustain himself.

675
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,021
Unicron.

676
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,733
So you're saying this thing Unicron
eats planets to survive?

677
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:44,112
Yes. And he imbues
his servants, like Scourge,

678
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:49,367
<i>with dark energy,
which makes him all but invincible.</i>

679
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,495
<i>He is entirely beholden to Unicron.</i>

680
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,916
<i>Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.</i>

681
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,794
Awaken, my dark master.

682
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,148
Rise.

683
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,109
My hunger is killing me.

684
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:24,527
What have you found?

685
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,696
Salvation.

686
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,618
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on, my master.

687
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,622
I should've gotten the key myself.

688
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:38,208
I should've known better
than to rely on humans.

689
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,794
Yo, hold up. What, you blaming me?

690
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:44,506
After you conveniently left out the part
about a planet-eating monster?

691
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,925
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

692
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,552
to consume every planet in the universe!

693
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,638
Including my home world.

694
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:55,308
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

695
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:59,145
You fool!

696
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:02,482
- This is only half the key.
- Please!

697
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:06,653
The Maximals... They must have split it.

698
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,571
Excuses!

699
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,533
Complete the key,
or else you will wish you had died

700
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,827
<i>with the rest of your planet.</i>

701
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,664
We broke the key into two pieces
for safekeeping,

702
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,416
then splintered and went into hiding.

703
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,628
I do not know where the other half is.

704
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,007
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

705
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,468
It's in Peru.

706
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:31,970
How you know that?

707
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,013
It's the symbols on the stone.

708
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,808
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

709
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,727
The Inca Temple of the Sun in Cusco.

710
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,188
It's one of the oldest buildings
in the western hemisphere.

711
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:46,276
I'm... I'm guessing that
that can't be a coincidence.

712
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:50,155
If you can track those symbols to Peru,
so can the Terrorcons.

713
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,990
We need to get there before they do.

714
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:57,036
And then kill Scourge
and take his piece to complete the key.

715
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,663
Yo. Hold up. Hold up.

716
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,790
You want to find this other key

717
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,877
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

718
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,171
The Trans warp Key is our only way home.

719
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,215
If this dude gets a hold of that thing,
it's game over for Earth!

720
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:11,342
Our families, everybody!

721
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,514
I'm going.

722
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:17,765
Out of the question.

723
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,602
No offense,

724
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,730
but I'm not trusting my home to a guy
who couldn't even protect his.

725
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,984
This is my planet. I'm going.

726
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,444
What about you?

727
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,033
- Me?
- What is your name?

728
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,118
Elena.

729
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,745
Elena,

730
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,955
will you lead us to this temple?

731
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,377
Chance to stop the end of the world.

732
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,171
Actually,

733
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,590
you'll be saving two worlds.

734
00:50:58,348 --> 00:50:59,557
Yeah.

735
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:11,653
<i>Yo, is that you, Sonic?</i>

736
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:15,949
What are you doing up, Tails?

737
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,326
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

738
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:29,754
This too hot?

739
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:32,840
You playing that game too much.

740
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,051
Give it a rest,
so your hand can take a break.

741
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,886
I'm gonna beat it.

742
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,556
My money's on you, bro.

743
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,308
We don't quit.

744
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,143
Come on, get some sleep, all right?

745
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,153
Yo, listen, um,

746
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:56,489
I gotta... I gotta head out for a while.

747
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,741
And I don't know when I'm gonna be back.

748
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,451
Why?

749
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,331
Oh, shit.

750
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,005
- What the...
- No, no, no!

751
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,257
No! Stop, please! Turn off! Turn off!

752
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,718
Yo, won't you... I told you to sit tight.

753
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,521
- Stop it.
- I can't turn it off. I'm sorry.

754
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,594
Is that a robot?

755
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,056
No, no, no. Go... Go back to bed.
Yo, shut it off!

756
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,684
I think your bad hot-wiring skills
messed up my lights.

757
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,447
- I got the bat.
- Yo, chill. Give me that.

758
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,022
- Did he say "bat"?
- You're gonna wake up Ma!

759
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,529
I know you're a robot.

760
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,032
K-Kris?

761
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,791
Yo! You scratched my paint!

762
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,627
What are you doing?

763
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,421
Man, they didn't treat E.T. like this.

764
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,048
- You know this thing?
- Yeah.

765
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,633
We're just work friends.

766
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,636
"Work friends"?
You've been inside me.

767
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,474
Look, that thing I told you
I have to go do?

768
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,850
It's for him and his crew.

769
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,685
We're trying to stop the end of the world.

770
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:08,936
The world's ending?

771
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,439
- No!
- Maybe. Sixty-forty.

772
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,399
You know I'm not gonna let that happen.

773
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,693
But that's why I have to leave.

774
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,698
I'll go get my things.

775
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,326
Tough kid.

776
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,120
What? No. Whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up. You're not coming.

777
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,164
Why? You need someone to watch your back.

778
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,333
It's too dangerous, Kris.

779
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,379
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

780
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,466
'Cause you might not come back.

781
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,773
Hey, robot.

782
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:57,402
Me? 'Sup?

783
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:01,155
Watch out for my brother. Okay?

784
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,199
You got it, little man.

785
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,159
Nah, I'm serious.

786
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,787
If he gets hurt, I'm coming after you.

787
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,917
Don't worry.
I got Noah's back. I promise.

788
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,210
Mm-hmm.

789
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,089
Home team?

790
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,093
Home team.

791
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,099
Kid's got heart.

Aw, come on, Prime. Smile a little bit.

797
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,456
It won't hurt. Let me see that under bite.

798
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,625
All right. So what kind of jet
we taking to Peru?

799
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,461
Or is it a plane? Either one's fine.

800
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:59,172
I just need first class, okay?
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

801
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,132
Uh, well, he is a plane.

802
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,884
No. No, no. Don't...

803
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,719
Don't tell me we're flying on...

804
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,012
Oh, no.

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

823
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,466
Um, me and my dad, we used to go to this...

824
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,927
this pizza spot down
on Knickerbocker and Greene.

825
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,763
Tony's Pizza? Wow.

826
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,520
So, uh, tell me about him, your pops.

827
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:38,771
What... What was he like?

828
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,775
He was a... He was a cabbie for 40 years.

829
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,528
Smartest guy you ever met.

830
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,863
He could talk to you about anything.

831
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,533
History, science, cricket.

832
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,285
Cricket?

833
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,705
And he ain't never
even go to college either.

834
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,748
He used to always say,

835
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:01,419
"If you keep your eyes and your ears open,

836
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,754
life will show you
everything you need to know."

837
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,551
So that's why you said yes to all of this.

838
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,054
I figured if he is somewhere watching,

839
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:15,725
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

840
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,477
would definitely make him proud.

841
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,115
You really think this key thing's in Peru?

842
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,533
I... I think so.

843
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,118
The evidence lines up.

844
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,206
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

845
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,666
then we gotta destroy it.

846
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,751
What?

847
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,921
They can't unite the key
without both pieces.

848
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:49,508
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

849
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,181
Yeah, but then they can't get home.

850
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,225
We gotta think about us.

851
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:04,065
Look, all you gotta do is find it.

852
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,359
And I'll take care of the rest.

853
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,115
Do you think an Energon infusion
could bring him back?

854
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,826
Perhaps.

855
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,413
If we could get him back to Cybertron.

856
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,460
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

857
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:09,088
Wow! Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

858
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,384
Sorry I'm late.

859
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,261
I was taking in a harmonious moment

860
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:19,056
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

861
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,808
Such tranquility.

862
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:24,353
<i>- Yo-ho-ho. Oye, papo, where you from?
- Cybertron.</i>

863
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,939
- So where'd you get that accent?
- Accent? What accent?

864
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,316
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

865
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,819
<i>I was about to be like,
"¿Yo, Mira, papi, de dónde eres?"</i>

866
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:35,489
<i>Pero I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,</i>

867
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:36,949
because then... Right?

868
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,785
<i>Mmm. A little racist, hermano.</i>

869
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,871
I'm not trying to be, you know... Yo.

870
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:45,124
But anyway... The mission. Follow me.

871
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,209
But he's a robot, like, so,

872
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,587
how's that racist?

873
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,301
Okay, you guys, check this out.

874
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,471
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

875
00:59:58,554 --> 00:59:59,597
Take a look.

876
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,642
That's Santo Domingo.

877
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,770
The Spanish built it
on top of an old Inca temple.

878
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:09,732
<i>Correcto. I picked up some residual
energy readings around the courtyard,</i>

879
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,359
so I'm guessing
the key's somewhere close by.

880
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,653
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

881
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,113
Inti Raymi.

882
01:00:16,197 --> 01:00:18,991
It's a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

883
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,452
- Guess it's a night mission then.
- No.

884
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,788
Scourge could already be here.

885
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:27,082
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

886
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,712
- Me and Elena will do it.
- Hmm?

887
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,547
Y'all would never make it two blocks.

888
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,716
There's human security
all around the church.

889
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,675
You'll never get through.

890
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:39,470
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

891
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,722
We'll hide in plain sight.

892
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:44,058
We'll blend in with the parade.

893
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,019
It is not a bad idea.

894
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,897
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

895
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,609
On first sign of trouble, we are going in.

896
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,277
Yo, Noah, think fast.

897
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,619
And if you need help, just holler.

898
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,679
I am in position.

899
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,639
All right, coast is clear.

900
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,308
<i>Noah, Elena, it's go time.</i>

901
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,311
<i>Blend in. Act natural.</i>

902
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:05,014
Autobots must be using
their new pets

903
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:07,141
to reach the temple.

904
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,435
Lovely.

905
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,229
They're doing our work for us.

906
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:14,440
Go fetch.

907
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,238
The key's gotta be
in here somewhere.

908
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:23,032
Yeah.

909
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,590
That stonework is 17th century.

910
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,718
What we're looking for is something

911
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,388
much, much older.

912
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,441
- What is it?
- It's the same insignia on Airazor.

913
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,152
But it's not lined up right.

914
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:04,573
Wait, you see that?

915
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:09,620
I think there's something
under here.

916
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:14,875
There's another one.

917
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,714
There is.

918
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:30,933
Now what?

919
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:34,645
I thought it would've...

920
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,411
That's some Indiana Jones-type shit.

921
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,539
You sure about this?

922
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,249
No.

923
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,301
Any sign of Scourge?

924
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,636
Nope, all clear here.

925
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,013
Uh, yeah.

926
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,973
It's just groupies over here.

927
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,350
Stay on task, Mirage.

928
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,270
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

929
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:24,903
Ah.

930
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:42,921
You know, we must be the first people
to walk here in half a millennium.

931
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:47,176
<i>Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?</i>

932
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:49,970
No.

933
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,973
Wait, did you just call me Sonic?

934
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:54,433
I think that's a temple.

935
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,150
What are we looking for?

936
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,235
You see the symbols
on that temple?

937
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,112
They match the ones in the courtyard.

938
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:08,614
I think it's up there.

939
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,711
I think we found
what we came here for.

940
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,424
I always wondered
what it would feel like to be there

941
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,843
when artifacts were actually found.

942
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,224
All right. Now come on, push.

943
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,192
Are you even pushing?

944
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,361
Yeah, I'm pushing.

945
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,791
- Wait, what?
- Just... Just let me think.

946
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,793
Oh, no, no. Where is it?

947
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:07,005
Sometimes there's, like, a...
like a false bottom or something.

948
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:11,927
Look.

949
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,847
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

950
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:18,183
I've seen markings like this...
the Airazor statue at my museum.

951
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:19,810
They're new.

952
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,437
They're not on the Trans warp Key.

953
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,564
There's two of them.

954
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:34,491
Mirage?

955
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,540
- Let's keep moving.
- Just give me a second.

956
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,296
Run!

957
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,555
Go, go, go, go, go!

958
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,724
Mirage! We got trouble!

959
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,685
<i>One of those things is down here!
Where are you guys?</i>

960
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,729
Hang tight! I'm on the way.

961
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,858
<i>The Autobots are moving.</i>

962
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,235
They must have found the key.

963
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,915
Come on!

964
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,918
Airazor, where are the humans?

965
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,837
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

966
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:48,440
Aw, man, they're tailing us!

967
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:00,285
- Do something!
- What do you want me to do?

968
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,878
You had a gun this whole time?

969
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,274
<i>Prime, what the hell
are you doing?</i>

970
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:33,110
I'm going to take back Scourge's key

971
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,446
and then take off his head.

972
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,877
Guys!
I could use a little help!

973
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,005
Did someone call for backup?

974
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:02,973
- Brake, brake, brake!
- What?

975
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,267
Brake!

976
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:15,360
Yay!

977
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,572
This is for Bee!

978
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,169
Come here.

979
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:33,503
Hold on!

980
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,318
I love your fire, Prime.

981
01:09:56,401 --> 01:10:00,155
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

982
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,034
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

983
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,314
I will end you, Scourge.

984
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,694
That is a promise.

985
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:41,321
They're getting away.

986
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:43,156
Not this time.

987
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,374
I hear water.

988
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,796
Where are we?

989
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:05,095
What was that?

990
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,193
Who are you?

991
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,155
And why are you hunting for the key?

992
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:25,615
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

993
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,493
- Uh, Mirage?
- Don't worry. Your boy's got this.

994
01:11:31,163 --> 01:11:33,707
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

995
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,334
Hey, hey, hey!

996
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,418
Not so fa...

997
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:43,008
Ay, ay, ay.

998
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,677
Hey! Over here, kitty, kitty.

999
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:49,681
Stand down!

1000
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,644
I won't ask a second time.

1001
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:01,443
No! All of you, stop!

1002
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,698
- Airazor.
- Primal.

1003
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,784
I thought you were lost. All of you.

1004
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:13,038
The others... Are they...

1005
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,665
I am all that is left.

1006
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:22,547
Prime, these are my fellow Maximals.

1007
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:24,966
Rhinox.

1008
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,551
Cheetor.

1009
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,345
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

1010
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,388
Scared? Please.

1011
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:31,932
I'm not scared.

1012
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,517
That's just engine oil.

1013
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,021
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

1014
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,899
Optimus Primal?

1015
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:45,237
Named after you,
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

1016
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,488
It's an honor.

1017
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:51,034
Airazor, I'm happy to see you, old friend.

1018
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:54,204
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

1019
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,748
I fear you bring dark tidings.

1020
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,042
Scourge has come to Earth.

1021
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,877
He's found us.

1022
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,380
And he has half of the key.

1023
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:06,174
We must find the second piece
before he does.

1024
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,093
But it wasn't in the cave.

1025
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:11,137
It was. But we moved it long ago
to keep it safe.

1026
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,473
Where is it now?

1027
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,103
Come with me.

1028
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,321
That doesn't look so good.

1029
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,658
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

1030
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,494
But I'll be all right.

1031
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:49,467
Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

1032
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,636
Yeah. Your little bro's got this thing

1033
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,431
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

1034
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,224
- Wait, you been talking to Kris?
- Uh-huh.

1035
01:13:56,308 --> 01:13:59,686
He gave me this to keep tabs on you,

1036
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,187
make sure I'm keeping my promise.

1037
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:02,772
Oh, here.

1038
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,899
Next time, include warning labels.

1039
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,776
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

1040
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,946
I guess it does look better on me.

1041
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,574
Just don't ask
what part of my body it came from.

1042
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,621
So, who are you?

1043
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:19,748
We Maximals are an advanced race

1044
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:24,002
dedicated to the expansion of life
throughout the universe.

1045
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:27,339
We use the Trans warp Key
to visit young worlds.

1046
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,092
The Nazca Lines, the Temple at Tikal...

1047
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:32,802
That was you guys, right?

1048
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,095
Not us.

1049
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:36,723
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

1050
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,226
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

1051
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,771
When Unicron destroyed our world,

1052
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:46,608
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

1053
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,652
no matter the cost.

1054
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,945
And Earth has been a safe refuge.

1055
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,945
This is Amaru.

1056
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:35,699
He and his family
are the last descendants of a tribe

1057
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:38,576
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

1058
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:43,623
When we arrived,
they shared their world with us.

1059
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:46,084
And together we protected its people

1060
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,920
and our secret.

1061
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,429
You allied with humans.

1062
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,014
We did.

1063
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,768
If you give us this key,

1064
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:07,939
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

1065
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:12,444
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

1066
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,863
I won't risk losing another.

1067
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:17,574
As a leader, I know you understand.

1068
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:46,352
He is not the Optimus Prime I imagined.

1069
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:49,355
Well, he has lost so much.

1070
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,357
Many more will perish

1071
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,527
if the key falls into the wrong hands.

1072
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:58,323
If you had another chance
to save our home,

1073
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:00,158
would you act any differently?

1074
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:07,540
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

1075
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,631
Your friend will find peace here.

1076
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,052
This is raw Energon.

1077
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,095
The valley is rich with it.

1078
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:22,931
Could this revive Bee?

1079
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:27,060
I'm sorry, but in this state, it is inert.

1080
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,729
It would take a great power to ignite it.

1081
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:32,690
Greater than anything we have here.

1082
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:38,363
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

1083
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,323
Yes, I am.

1084
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,201
I've been amongst them a long time now.

1085
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:46,496
There is more to them than meets the eye.

1086
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,498
They are worth saving.

1087
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:00,552
Hmm.

1088
01:18:23,408 --> 01:18:24,909
What if we didn't destroy it?

1089
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:32,584
Maybe there's another way
to... to save both our homes.

1090
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,712
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

1091
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,007
This is different.

1092
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,261
I can't fail at this.

1093
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:46,264
I can't let my family down.

1094
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:49,350
You're just like him. You know that?

1095
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:50,727
Who?

1096
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,978
Optimus.

1097
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,522
I'm serious.

1098
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:57,734
- He feels it too.
- Feels what?

1099
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:00,612
Like a beast of burden

1100
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:04,574
just trying to carry
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

1101
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:09,537
You think he's some...
some general barking orders,

1102
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:11,873
but when I look at him,

1103
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:14,834
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1104
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:13,810
Are you okay?

1105
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:21,526
Airazor?

1106
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:25,279
I can feel Scourge!

1107
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:27,865
He's... in my mind.

1108
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,919
Run, Elena!

1109
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:44,007
No!

1110
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:50,596
Airazor.

1111
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,056
They found us.

1112
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,518
Everyone, defensive positions!

1113
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,146
Noah, guard the key.

1114
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:00,606
Take Elena
and find someplace safe to hide.

1115
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,736
We must protect the humans.

1116
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,198
Miss me?

1117
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,409
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

1118
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:29,802
We have to destroy it.

1119
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:33,222
Noah!

1120
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,807
No!

1121
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,393
Don't.

1122
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:43,649
I know you want to protect your people,

1123
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,444
but if you destroy that key,

1124
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:49,405
our home will be lost forever.

1125
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:51,699
We do not have to choose.

1126
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:00,291
Please, Noah.

1127
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,353
Elena!

1128
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:25,733
Go!

1129
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,173
Elena!

1130
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:58,099
Wait, wait. Didn't I kill you already?

1131
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,601
No!

1132
01:23:00,685 --> 01:23:03,563
I'm the Maximal
that's going to rip out your spark.

1133
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:06,774
We'll see about that.

1134
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:07,900
Kill them!

1135
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:16,033
Airazor, no!

1136
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,995
I can't hold him back...

1137
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,913
much longer.

1138
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:23,291
Fight it, Airazor.

1139
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,295
Remember our oath, Primal.

1140
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,006
No matter the cost.

1141
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,634
- I can't hold it back!
- Airazor, no!

1142
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:46,647
Primal!

1143
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:57,283
It's okay.

1144
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:58,784
Do it.

1145
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,268
Primal.

1146
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,563
No matter the cost.

1147
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,324
Elena! Elena, look at me.

1148
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,910
Are you okay?

1149
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,248
Scourge has the key.

1150
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:34,547
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1151
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,612
I am sorry, Noah.

1152
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,406
You were looking out for your own.

1153
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,536
I can't even be angry at you for that.

1154
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,954
On my home world,

1155
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,999
we believe that the battle
with darkness will continue

1156
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:54,168
till all are one.

1157
01:26:55,753 --> 01:26:57,755
I lost sight of that.

1158
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:01,842
You fought for yours as I fought for mine

1159
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:05,304
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1160
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:11,435
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1161
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:18,192
All right, everybody, squad up!

1162
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:19,860
Bring it in.

1163
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:21,904
There's got to be a way to stop this dude.

1164
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:26,033
It's too late.
The Trans warp has already been activated.

1165
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:28,786
It has more energy than a supernova.

1166
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,705
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1167
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,750
The only way to stop this process

1168
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:38,129
is an access code
installed long ago as a safeguard.

1169
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,630
Okay, what's the code then?

1170
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,341
The code was split along with the key.

1171
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:46,595
Sadly, the second half
of that code died with Airazor.

1172
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,139
No, wait, wait, wait. I got it.

1173
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:50,182
The one hiding her half of the key,

1174
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:51,434
it had markings in it,

1175
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:54,103
just like the ones I found in the cave
where you hid yours.

1176
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,148
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1177
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:58,232
Hmm.

1178
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,192
So we got a chance now, right?

1179
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:01,735
A slim chance.

1180
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:06,282
That is all we need
if you will show us the way, Primal.

1181
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:12,037
All right. We need to move quickly.

1182
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,290
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1183
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:16,125
large enough for Unicron to enter.

1184
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:19,420
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1185
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,797
They are too small for Maximals, but...

1186
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,632
But not for humans.

1187
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:27,386
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1188
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,889
they can use the code to shut it down,

1189
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:32,558
remove the Trans warp Key...

1190
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:36,562
and close the portal
before Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1191
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,772
But Scourge will be watching
our every move.

1192
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:41,275
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1193
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,486
Then we bring the fight to him.

1194
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:48,199
Autobots and Maximals
will charge the bridge together

1195
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,868
and lure Scourge onto the battlefield.

1196
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,746
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1197
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,168
It sounds like we're all going to die.

1198
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:05,508
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1199
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,510
all as one.

1200
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:23,567
This world is yours, master.

1201
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,278
Scourge,

1202
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:27,655
they're back.

1203
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,747
Prime.

1204
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:42,211
Protect the key.
Don't let them get to the bridge.

1205
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:04,149
Maximals!

1206
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:05,985
Autobots!

1207
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,653
Roll out!

1208
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,959
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1209
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,401
At least
the foot soldiers took the bait.

1210
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,528
Yeah, but Scourge didn't.
He's guarding the key.

1211
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:50,446
All right.

1212
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:53,866
This should lead to the bottom
of the Trans warp control panel.

1213
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:57,244
- Get the key, get the hell out of there.
- What are you gonna do?

1214
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:59,371
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1215
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,123
No, you can't take on Scourge alone.

1216
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,001
Relax. I'm Mirage, remember?

1217
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:05,085
Hey.

1218
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,374
One, two, three!

1219
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:45,459
Whoomp! There it is! Pow!

1220
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,961
We gotta hurry up.

1221
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:56,136
Take cover!

1222
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,639
Someone give me a real fight!

1223
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,019
It's a fight you want? You got one.

1224
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,577
He was mine.

1225
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:22,955
Nope!

1226
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:24,540
Missed me!

1227
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,837
Noah, get to the key.

1228
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:30,920
Mirage!

1229
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:33,882
What do we have here?

1230
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:35,884
Elena, go!

1231
01:32:39,138 --> 01:32:43,767
Brave, but futile.

1232
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,565
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

1233
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,630
Mirage.

1234
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:22,222
No one will remember this pathetic planet.

1235
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,685
And no one will remember you.

1236
01:33:30,898 --> 01:33:32,399
Mirage, what are you doing?

1237
01:33:32,483 --> 01:33:34,735
Keeping my promise.

1238
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,404
Mirage, no! Come on, you gotta get up!

1239
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:39,031
It's okay, Noah.

1240
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:45,871
Home... Home team.

1241
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,541
Home team.

1242
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:54,463
Mirage!

1243
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,801
Mirage?

1244
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:03,847
Mirage.

1245
01:34:04,765 --> 01:34:06,642
Kill the other human.

1246
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:45,722
Unicron.

1247
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:48,433
You fought bravely.

1248
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:52,729
But this world is already mine.

1249
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:03,532
We're too late.

1250
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,418
- Yo!
- Hey!

1251
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:21,049
Hey! Look!

1252
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,273
<i>Hey, Knuckles.</i>

1253
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:39,234
<i>You there? Over.</i>

1254
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:40,569
<i>Yo, Sonic.</i>

1255
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:43,238
<i>- Kris!
- Noah?</i>

1256
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:45,532
What's going on?

1257
01:35:45,616 --> 01:35:47,159
Where's Mirage?

1258
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:50,495
He... He's gone.

1259
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:51,830
<i>Gone?</i>

1260
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:56,627
No.

1261
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,714
<i>I'm sorry, Kris.</i>

1262
01:36:08,347 --> 01:36:10,349
<i>I'm not gonna win this one.</i>

1263
01:36:11,058 --> 01:36:12,684
But you don't lose, right?

1264
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:14,811
I wish that were true,

1265
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:16,855
but I can't.

1266
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:25,072
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

1267
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:28,075
No.

1268
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:32,204
No, man, I'm not you.

1269
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,497
<i>I hate being sick.</i>

1270
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:34,873
<i>Whenever I wanna give up,</i>

1271
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:37,501
you're always there
telling me to keep going.

1272
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:39,586
<i>And now it's my turn.</i>

1273
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,296
Keep going, Noah.

1274
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:47,844
<i>You think you're a nobody,
but you're the strongest guy I know.</i>

1275
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:50,430
You guys are so cute.

1276
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,182
Mirage?

1277
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:54,059
You're alive!

1278
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:58,897
Uh, yeah, but...
I'm gonna need you to take the wheel.

1279
01:37:10,617 --> 01:37:12,411
<i>You can do this.</i>

1280
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,917
<i>'Cause you're my brother.</i>

1281
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,878
Noah Diaz from Wilson Avenue,

1282

<i>Apartment2-C, Brooklyn, New York.</i>

1283
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:31,263
No names over the airwaves.

1284
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,390
Forget that.

1285
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:34,891
Let 'em know who you are.

1286
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,106
Yo, Scourge!

1287
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,779
Remember me?

1288
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:11,678
You think you can take me on alone?

1289
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:17,059
He is not alone.

1290
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:05,065
I'm never leaving Brooklyn again.

1291
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:20,372
Ah! Energon.

1292
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:51,444

1349
01:44:03,113 --> 01:44:04,656
You did it!

1350
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,199
Brooklyn, baby!

1351
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:08,284
No!

1352

I've had enough!

1355
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,509
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1356
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:31,558
This belongs to a friend of mine!

1357
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:45,613
The panel,

1358
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:47,866
it's destroyed.

1359
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:50,076
I can't stop it.

1360
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:53,997
Autobots, Maximals,

1361
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,623
retreat to safety.

1362
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:58,751
I will destroy the key myself.

1363
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,420
Prime! No!

1364
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:02,046
There's gotta be another way.

1365
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,923
Bee, protect them.

1366
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:16,519
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1367
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:20,064

We can't leave him!

1370
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:38,291
Everyone, on me!

1371
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:51,846
Don't, Prime.

1372
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:55,099
I can give you everything you want.

1373
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:56,559
Then die.

1374
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:36,015
Noah.

1375
01:46:36,099 --> 01:46:37,475
I got you!

1376
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:51,364
Let me go, Noah. Save yourself.

1377
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:55,994
Till all are one.

1378
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:18,057
Till all are one.

1379
01:47:30,695 --> 01:47:31,904
Punch it, Prime.

1380
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,516
Yeah, baby!

1381
01:48:31,464 --> 01:48:33,966
Unicron... Is he dead?

1382
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:37,178
Trapped, but not dead.

1383
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,681
Evil can never be vanquished completely.

1384
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,141
He could return.

1385
01:48:42,225 --> 01:48:44,227
Let him come.

1386
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:47,271
United, we will destroy him,

1387
01:48:47,355 --> 01:48:49,357
once and for all.

1388
01:48:53,236 --> 01:48:55,405
<i>I am Optimus Prime,</i>

<i>leader of the Autobots.</i>

1390
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,535
<i>We have lost the Trans warp Key</i>

1391
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:03,621
<i>and with it, our ability to go home.</i>

1392
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:09,127
<i>But we have gained an ally</i>

1393
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:12,463
<i>in our battle against the forces of evil.</i>

1394
01:49:12,547 --> 01:49:14,841
<i>Forces too powerful</i>

1395
01:49:14,924 --> 01:49:18,469
<i>for any of us to defeat on our own.</i>

1396
01:49:18,553 --> 01:49:22,557
<i>But together, we might just have a chance.</i>

1397

<i>I am Noah Diaz.</i>

1398
01:49:35,153 --> 01:49:36,446
<i>What is there to know about me?</i>

1399
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,865
<i>I was raised out in Brooklyn.</i>

1400
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:42,201
<i>I got a little bro who calls me Sonic.</i>

1401
01:49:42,285 --> 01:49:45,538
<i>And if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love,</i>

1402
01:49:45,621 --> 01:49:47,540
<i>well, then that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

1403
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:19,489
How you doing, sir?

1404
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:21,908
Um, I'm here for the job interview?

1405
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:23,201
Noah Diaz.

1406
01:50:23,284 --> 01:50:24,786
I'll tell 'em you're here.

<i>Is it down to talk with Elena Wallace.</i>

1409
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:34,462
<i>She recently discovered
an underground temple</i>

1410
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,589
<i>with a network of catacombs...</i>

1411
01:50:36,672 --> 01:50:39,425
<i>dating back to 5000 BC.</i>

1412
01:50:39,509 --> 01:50:43,095
<i>I never could've imagined
making a discovery of this significance.</i>

1413
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:45,848
<i>So it's definitely a dream come true.</i>

1414
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:48,726
Brooklyn, baby.

1415
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:50,853
They're ready for you.

1416
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:52,855
- Thank you, sir.
- Elevator in the back.

1417
01:50:58,027 --> 01:51:00,196
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

1418
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:02,490
In addition to
my experience with electronics,

1419
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:06,202
I've also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

1420
01:51:07,954 --> 01:51:09,288
Is that so?

1421
01:51:09,372 --> 01:51:12,542
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.

1422
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:15,002
Résumé's a little thin.

1423
01:51:15,086 --> 01:51:17,713
Yeah, well, I just recently had a job

1424
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:20,508
working internationally.

1425
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:21,926
Oh, was that...

1426
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,097
No, don't think it's on here.

1427
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,850
No, it was... it was a short-term contract.

1428
01:51:28,933 --> 01:51:31,644
Oh, well, that's cool.

1429
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:33,354
Why don't you tell me about that?

1430
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:40,528
It was in South America.
So I got to work on my Spanish.

1431
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:42,113
My mom was real happy about that.

1432
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:44,490
You know what I'm saying?
You know moms.

1433
01:51:44,574 --> 01:51:47,326
She's just really...
But while I was out there, honestly, man,

1434
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:50,329
it was really just like
work, work, work, you know?

1435
01:51:50,413 --> 01:51:51,414
Ah.

1436
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:54,166
That's a shame, because I hear
the food is really good in Peru.

1437
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:59,171
Wait, I didn't... I didn't
mention anything about Peru.

1438
01:51:59,255 --> 01:52:01,507
Well, that's where you were, right?

1439
01:52:01,591 --> 01:52:03,968
- I was...
- Down in Cusco?

1440
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:06,888
With you and, uh, Elena

1441
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,267
and your, um,
I don't know, call 'em friends?

1442
01:52:14,854 --> 01:52:15,855
What...

1443
01:52:16,814 --> 01:52:18,691
What's going on in here?

1444
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:21,193
We know a lot about you, Mr. Diaz.

1445
01:52:21,277 --> 01:52:24,780
Who are you? The CIA or FBI or...

1446
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:27,825
We are a secret government organization.

1447
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:29,577
Strictly off the books.

1448
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,412
We specialize in global threats.

1449
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:34,415
Planetary loss prevention,
that kind of thing.

1450
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:37,627
We're in the middle of an ongoing war,

1451
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,795
and we'd love to have you join the fight.

1452
01:52:39,879 --> 01:52:41,714
You and your whole team.

1453
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:43,424
You know,

1454
01:52:44,967 --> 01:52:45,968
the big guys.

1455
01:52:46,052 --> 01:52:48,054
No idea what you're talking about.

1456
01:52:49,805 --> 01:52:51,515
That's a good answer.

1457
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:52,975
All right.

1458
01:52:53,059 --> 01:52:55,686
Either way, I want you to know,

1459
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:58,105
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

1460
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:01,192
we will be taking care of
your brother Kris's health care.

1461
01:53:01,275 --> 01:53:02,276
All of it.

1462
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,112
From now on, he will have 24/7 access

1463
01:53:05,196 --> 01:53:07,281
to the greatest doctors in the world.

1464
01:53:07,365 --> 01:53:10,743
And these are doctors who don't ask
their patients about account balances.

1465
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:16,999
Are you serious?

1466
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:19,919
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1467
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:21,629
I don't know what to say.

1468
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,506
We'll work on that.

1469
01:53:25,174 --> 01:53:27,093
Your brother's gonna be just fine.

1470
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,433
Oh.

1471
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:36,352
Kris was right, by the way.

1472
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:47,446
No names over the airwaves.

1473
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:51,677
We could really use
someone like you, Noah.

1474
01:53:51,701 --> 01:53:53,995
Why don't you think about it?

1475
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:17,643

This?

1493
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:07,693
This is a complete waste of
your skills and my expertise.

1494
01:55:07,777 --> 01:55:09,361
Think it came out pretty good.

1495
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:13,240
Well, I guess we could call it modern art

1496
01:55:13,324 --> 01:55:15,493
and sell it to some cats in So Ho.

1497
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:16,744
Nah, I'm not selling.

1498
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:17,828
What?

1499
01:55:18,579 --> 01:55:19,580
Why?

1500
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:22,583
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

1501
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:26,295
No. I told you, I did not ditch you!

1502
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,048
I was running the give-and-go.
I thought you knew the play!

1503
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:32,426
All right, let's say I did ditch you,
even though I didn't.

1504
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,929
For your sake... I see your face...
let's just say I did.

1505
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:37,139
I think all the blood,
sweat and dead presidents

1506
01:55:37,223 --> 01:55:40,434
I put into getting these car parts for you
make us even Steven.

1507
01:55:40,518 --> 01:55:42,353
It's not that.

1508
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:44,271
This car is special.

1509
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:47,775
This car is a jigsaw puzzle
made of garbage!

1510
01:55:47,858 --> 01:55:52,196
Hey, I bet the joint don't even start.

1511
01:55:54,782 --> 01:55:55,866
Bet?

1512
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,619
Yo, Mirage.
