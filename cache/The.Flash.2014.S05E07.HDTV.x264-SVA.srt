1
00:00:00,184 --> 00:00:01,679
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:03,937
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,130
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,140
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:09,223
But secretly, with the help of my friends

6
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,765
at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime

7
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,789
and find other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,209
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

9
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:17,598
she changed the present.

10
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,195
And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

11
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,770
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

12
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,890
I am The Flash.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,859
Previously on "The Flash"...

14
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,086
To be able to control the
weather like that indoors.

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,280
He'd have to be a weather wizard.

16
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,616
- This is Sherloque.
- He's the greatest detective

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,459
in all the multiverse.

18
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:37,786
I'm here to catch your killer.

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,287
The only part of the satellite

20
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,599
that would have dark
matter levels that high...

21
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:44,481
Is the core, which is where
Cicada's dagger came from.

22
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:45,829
We got a list from FEMA of everyone

23
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:47,754
who reported injuries the
night of the Enlightenment.

24
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,940
Two of them are twins
whose father is deceased,

25
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:52,351
third is a ten-year-old girl
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

26
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,612
So if my dad's right and
Cicada's a father, then...

27
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:56,654
We may have just found his daughter.

28
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:15,466
Excuse me, could you tell me
where Grace Gibbons' room is?

29
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:17,343
One sec, let me check.

30
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:25,289
Actually, yeah, she's that first room

31
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,132
- right on the right.
- Great.

32
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:30,338
Just where do you think you're going?

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,179
Into my patient's room
is what I looks like.

34
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:34,601
I'm sorry. I am Barry Allen.

35
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,594
I'm with the CCPD.

36
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,642
I was hoping to speak
with you, actually.

37
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,695
I'm looking for Grace Gibbons' parents.

38
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:43,309
Specifically her father.

39
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,455
I'm sorry, but the girl's
parents are deceased.

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,691
Are you sure about that?

41
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,461
I can show you her charts.

42
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,032
See for yourself.

43
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,159
She came in with a
wave of new admissions.

44
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,661
No legal guardian
listed, no next of kin.

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,538
The sad truth is,

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,875
our staff is the only family
this little girl has left.

47
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,543
Okay.

48
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,729
Thank you for your help.

49
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,310
Orlin Dwyer, are you in there?

50
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,372
It's CCPD. Open up.

51
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:30,741
- Orlin Dwyer?
- Hey, listen, man,

52
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:32,525
I don't care what that guy says,

53
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,211
he was drunk and I was defending...

54
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:37,072
This is about your sister, Mr. Dwyer.

55
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,050
There's been an accident, a meta attack.

56
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:52,553

57
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,881
- Careful.
- I know, I know.

58
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,309
- This is a critical time.
- Okay.

59
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,319
- Steady hands.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,766
Call time of death.

61
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,102
It's okay. It's a pie.

62
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,395
It's not supposed to be a piece of cake.

63
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,605
Wow.

64
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,825
Hey, thanks for helping.

65
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,327
With Cicada's trail running cold,

66
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,088
at least we have the
extra day to prepare

67
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,997
for our first Thanksgiving at the loft.

68
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,091
What about Joe and Cecile?

69
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:23,668
They're celebrating with
Cecile's family this year.

70
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,163
So, yeah, this year it's
just gonna be the five of us.

71
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,319
- I'm down.
- Six, actually.

72
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,416
Killer Frost just RSVP'd.

73
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,478
What... you guys can just
talk to each other now,

74
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,216
even without the mental
activity dampener?

75
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,845
Yeah, today's actually the first time.

76
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,525
Wow.

77
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:39,767
Oh, gosh.

78
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,783
- Hi, guys.
- Yo.

79
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,202
Sorry we're late. It seems like

80
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,012
everyone and their grandma is getting

81
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,357
pre-holiday manis and pedis.

82
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,692
Ooh, let's take photos and post them

83
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,321
on that old-fashioned Insta
thingy that you guys use.

84
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,626
Those two seemed to have
really patched things up.

85
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:59,916
Yeah, Nora's getting closer
to Iris than she is with me,

86
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,741
and the timing couldn't
have been better.

87
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,116
What do you mean?

88
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,326
I mean, Nora was so young

89
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,970
when I disappeared in her future,

90
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:09,664
so this would be her first
memory of Thanksgiving

91
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,966
with both her parents.

92
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,667
Feel like it's my job to make it

93
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,311
the most perfect Thanksgiving ever,

94
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:17,893
And #HandModels.

95
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:21,318
Wow, I feel famous already.

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,677
Oh, man.

97
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,488
Mom, um...

98
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,823
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,755
Sorry for what, Nora?

100
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:31,811
For not giving you a chance
to show me how great you are.

101
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,315
This year I'm just really
thankful to get to know you.

102
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,543
The real you.

103
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm thankful too.

104
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,673
You know, the West-Allens have
never missed a Thanksgiving.

105
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:45,174
No gorilla army, no evil speedster,

106
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:47,368
no giant wormhole in the sky

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,587
could break that streak.

108
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,330
Yeah, the singularity.

109
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,683
So the Flash Museum
has a 3-D model of Dad

110
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,727
just running straight
into it to save the city.

111
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,597
God, it must have been
so epic to be there.

112
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:01,507
Actually, it was...

113
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,219
terrifying to be there.

114
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,271
We didn't know if your
dad was gonna come back.

115
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,352
Ronnie didn't.

116
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,396
What?

117
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,692
The museum says that... That
Dad just saved everybody.

118
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,482
I guess there's things
the museum left out.

119
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:24,573
Like your Dad giving
himself to the Speed Force

120
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,907
to save the city.

121
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,911
That was another time we
said good-bye thinking...

122
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,847
might be a one-way trip.

123
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:35,967
Sounds a lot like what took
him from us in the future.

124
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,395
I didn't know dad had
so many close calls.

125
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,971
Look, your dad is always gonna

126
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,640
wanna put his life on
the line for others.

127
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,884
That is what I love most about him,

128
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:48,955
but, yeah, it... it
does keep me up at night.

129
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,820
Did he come back?

130
00:05:55,822 --> 00:06:00,108
No, the records I falsified
convinced him for now.

131
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,735
So we're safe?

132
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,114
Orlin, I think you need to stay away.

133
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,832
Good idea.

134
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,243
I won't visit till after the weekend.

135
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,913
No, I think you need
to stay away for good.

136
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,225
It's getting too risky.

137
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:19,127
You want me to give up Grace?

138
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,753
No, no, no, listen,

139
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,463
you can't put me on hold.

140
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,425
I don't care about
this next of kin crap.

141
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,636
I don't want this kid. Hello?

142
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,096
Hello?

143
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,032
Damn it.

144
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:35,527
Hey...

145
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,103
what?

146
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,706
It's breakfast.

147
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,962
Yeah, it is. Um...

148
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,340
Okay.

149
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,171
Now look, it's only a few days old.

150
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,889
It's still good, I swear.

151
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,824
I don't understand. Explain again to me

152
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,326
what the difference between this day

153
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,026
and every other day in America?

154
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,997
It's a holiday when we all get together

155
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,309
and celebrate and eat a ton of food.

156
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,088
Like, a gross amount.

157
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:44,208
Again, what the
difference between this day

158
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,755
and every other day in America.

159
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:46,990
- That's legit.
- Hi, guys.

160
00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:48,725
- What's going on?
- This guy,

161
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,319
he try to explain the
Thanksgiving holiday.

162
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:52,720
He's failing miserably.
What is this holiday?

163
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,865
- Please explain.
- It's very simple, actually.

164
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,557
It's just about getting
together to celebrate

165
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,226
our loved ones and family.

166
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,913
So simple, this is why I
don't understand this holiday.

167
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,940
- I don't have any family.
- Didn't you have, like,

168
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,951
- seven marriages?
- I did have seven marriages.

169
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,530
Five wives, seven
marriages, but no family.

170
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,467
This holiday is a cruel holiday.

171
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:23,876
- What's going on?
- I'm seeing a massive

172
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,920
electrical surge at the
downtown power station.

173
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,547
Barry, Nora, you're up.

174
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,821
Guys, what's the problem?

175
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,897
Everything looks...

176
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,566
I think we found it.

177
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,335
- It's lightning.
- Skies were clear

178
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:50,278
a minute ago. That storm
must have come out of nowhere.

179
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,422
Uh, we got a bigger problem.

180
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,374
There's an experimental cold fusion core

181
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,668
from Mercury Labs in the
plant, and if it blows...

182
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,579
It could take out the whole block.

183
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,955
I see it.

184
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:06,111
Nora, you've got to evac all
the workers to safety. Barry...

185
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,628
Yeah, I know, I got to grab the core.

186
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,848
No, no, no, something
doesn't feel right.

187
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,758
Just listen to Iris. Grab
the workers from inside.

188
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,450
Dad!

189
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,783
Dad!

190
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:39,553
Dad!

191
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,517
You guys, he's not breathing.

192
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,830
He's going into cardiac arrest.

193
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,998
She needs to restart his heart.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,658
What... how do I do that?

195
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,168
Rub your hands together
to create lightning,

196
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,720
and then give him a chest compression.

197
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,682
Okay! Okay.

198
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:58,052
Come on. Come on. Come on.

199
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,703
It's not working!

200
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,483
We lost him.

201
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,911
No! No!

202
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,530
No!

203
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,532
Please. Please. Please.

204
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:29,876
He's back.

205
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:43,340
- I promise I'm okay.
- Caitlin.

206
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,560
His vitals are stable.
Speed healing to the rescue.

207
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:46,798
He shouldn't have needed rescuing.

208
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,072
Nora, I know you're upset,

209
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,108
but if that core would have exploded

210
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,317
it would have caused a lot of damage.

211
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:52,551
It did cause a lot of damage. Dad died.

212
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:55,561
We made the best decision we
could, given the circumstances.

213
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:57,957
Maybe someone else should
be making our decisions.

214
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,660
Wow, all right, well,

215
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,070
so much for mother-daughter holiday time.

216
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,998
She did just have to
bring me back to life.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,159
- Let's give her a minute.
- Okay.

218
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:10,928
In the meantime, where
did that storm come from?

219
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,630
A storm like that coming and going,

220
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,338
disappearing in a matter of minutes,

221
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,841
it shouldn't be possible.

222
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,935
Unless someone was making it possible.

223
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,437
I mean, we've seen that before.

224
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,938
Weather Wizard. But
Mark Mardon is serving

225
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,464
a life sentence at Iron Heights.

226
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,299
Let's make sure he's doing just that.

227
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,967
Let us know if any
other weather anomalies

228
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,278
pop up on the radar.

229
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,779
Okay.

230
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:30,305
Will do.

231
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:39,198
I think it's time for
operation: Save the turkey.

232
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,654
What...?

233
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:47,656
Art is therapy.

234
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:48,737
So, Sherlock...

235
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,866
Sherloque, simple pronunciation.

236
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,870
We heard what you had to say
about not having a family.

237
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:56,474
- Right.
- And we here at Team Flash are

238
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,642
sort of a family, and you're
becoming part of that family,

239
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,345
so we would like to invite you

240
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,172
to celebrate Thanksgiving with us.

241
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:07,203
Caitlin, I'm afraid that
I must decline, all right?

242
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:08,969
Because I don't have a
lot of reason to celebrate,

243
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,155
and you of all people
should sympathize with that.

244
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:14,190
- Why should I sympathize?
- You lost your father, right?

245
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,410
And then you find him only
to discover that his body

246
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,329
is being possessed by a icicle demon

247
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,813
who's trying to kill all of Team Flash,

248
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,846
yourself included. Not great, right?

249
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,357
Okay, that's enough, Debbie Downer.

250
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,868
Don't listen to him. You know what?

251
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,662
Maybe you should lay
off the paint fumes.

252
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,321
Do you know what, young Ralph Macchio?

253
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:29,873
You have nothing to
celebrate either, right?

254
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,700
What your last year has been, huh?

255
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,785
Let me recap for you. First, heartbreak.

256
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,500
And then second, Cicada
crushes your powers

257
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,968
forcing you to fake your own death,

258
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,260
also not great, and as for me,

259
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,145
multiple divorces have left me

260
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,564
with a mountain of debt
that's insurmountable.

261
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:49,801
So this past year, not
been very kind to any of us.

262
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,654
Pardon.

263
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,968
She's had a few recent outbursts,

264
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,583
and we don't allow cursing here.

265
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,727
This type of behavior cannot continue.

266
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,345
Anyway, that's the long and short of it.

267
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,189
I'll give you two a moment.

268
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:39,494
You called a kid a rat bastard?

269
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,113
What's wrong with you? Don't you know

270
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:43,080
you can't go around
saying stuff like that?

271
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,385
Why?

272
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,555
Well, 'cause then I get a phone call.

273
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:49,068
You know, I had to take
off work to come down here.

274
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:51,905
- You don't even like your job.
- What?

275
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,533
You stay on the couch all day,

276
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:54,949
and then when work calls

277
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,409
you curse and slam the door.

278
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:59,430
"Rat bastards."

279
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:02,341
Look, I get where you heard it.

280
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,751
All right, but you
can't say those words.

281
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,127
- Rat bastard!
- Hey, quit it.

282
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,512
- Rat bastard!
- Stop.

283
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,922
- Rat bastards!
- Hey, listen to me!

284
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,632
I'm supposed to be the parent here.

285
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,502
No, you're not a parent!

286
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:16,262
Parents are supposed to me the
world better for their kids.

287
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:19,140
You make everything worse. I hate you,

288
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,809
and you hate you too.

289
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,700
You have to excuse our dim lighting.

290
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,151
Today's storm out at the power plant

291
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:31,870
knocked out our main generator,

292
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,039
So we're working off a
backup for the time being.

293
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,466
So does that mean you can't dampen

294
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,450
the meta prisoners' powers?

295
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:39,494
Prison-wide dampeners are down,

296
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,356
but we got every inmate into
meta cuffs incident free.

297
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:48,080
I hope you include that in your
article about our readiness.

298
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,796
After the corruption of the last warden,

299
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:51,390
I am eager to assure the public

300
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,591
that their safety is in good hands.

301
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,820
Now, our CSI's, which
inmate did you need to see?

302
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,348
And he's been here all day?

303
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,159
Never once out of our sight.

304
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:03,577
There was a crime committed today

305
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,145
with an MO similar to Mardon's.

306
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,022
Can I take a look at the security tapes?

307
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:09,346
Anything for our friends in the press.

308
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,412
Well, this is a bust.

309
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,531
Yeah, looks like you died for nothing.

310
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,009
Nora, hey, hey, look.

311
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,994
This has been a rough day for you,

312
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:23,255
but you can't blame
Iris for what happened.

313
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,713
She's doing the best she can.

314
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,000
Besides, we both decided on the plan.

315
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,686
Oh, I know.

316
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,148
What the...?

317
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,184
Hey, don't mind me.

318
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:46,662
I'm just here to pick up my dad.

319
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,356
Did she say "dad"?

320
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:51,524
Joslyn?

321
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,877
It's Joss.

322
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:02,961
Bring me my father! Now!

323
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,338
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

324
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,915
We'll see about that.

325
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,560
Bring my dad to Porter
Plaza in one hour,

326
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:12,378
or Central City is gonna get wrecked.

327
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,392
I didn't know that
Joss was busting me out.

328
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:27,049
I didn't know she'd do
half the things she does.

329
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,971
I haven't spoken to her in years.

330
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:30,814
And you expect me to believe she woke up

331
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:32,242
this morning and was like,
"You know what?

332
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,101
I wanna break my dad
out of Iron Heights."

333
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:37,748
I get it, but it's the truth.

334
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,694
Joss was born when me and her
mom were still in high school.

335
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:45,166
I never could work out
how to be with that woman.

336
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,275
Then when Joss came,
I thought the best thing to do

337
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:51,645
was to focus on my career.

338
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:54,041
Your criminal career?

339
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,877
That's why I left her with her mom.

340
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,818
Least until she ran away
because some of falling out.

341
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,779
What happened with Joss and her mom?

342
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:02,706
The last time I spoke to her

343
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,900
she told me that her
and Joss are broken.

344
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:07,443
You know how it is.

345
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:09,087
Sometimes mothers and daughters break

346
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,756
and there ain't no fixing 'em.

347
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:30,025
Okay, watch your step.

348
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:34,279
And open your eyes.

349
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:37,690
Whose house is this?

350
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,809
It's my cousin Robbie's.

351
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:42,269
He doesn't live here
anymore, but he said

352
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,040
if I fix it up, we could stay here.

353
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,150
What's this?

354
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:52,038
That is a dollhouse.

355
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,874
Or it can be

356
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,929
once we build it, and,
you know, you can...

357
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,958
Pick out furniture, and colors,

358
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,605
or wall paper, decorate it how you want.

359
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,225
Hey...

360
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:14,319
I know we didn't get
off to the greatest start

361
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,387
these past few months.

362
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,731
Okay...

363
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,659
it was a lousy start.

364
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:23,403
But I want to fix all that.

365
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:28,408
Well, I was thinking that
while I work on this place,

366
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:34,339
we could work on this
one too... together.

367
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:39,367
Listen, you were right, kid.

368
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,328
I do hate me.

369
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,998
I don't really know any other way to be,

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,520
but I want to do right by you, Gracie.

371
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:53,734
I want to keep you
safe, and warm, fed...

372
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:58,104
You know, just...

373
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:01,324
give you all the things
a kid should have.

374
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,875
Let's start with the dollhouse.

375
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:16,631
Okay.

376
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,303
Okay.

377
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,832
How's Dad's interrogation going?

378
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,043
Well, we'll know in a minute.
Hopefully, he'll find something

379
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:30,811
that'll help us profile
Mardon's daughter.

380
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:32,731
Okay, well, let me know.

381
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,400
Nora, look, listen, I
know you're upset with me

382
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:37,702
for sending your dad into
that situation earlier,

383
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:39,386
and I just...

384
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,639
- I wanted to say that I...
- Mom, it's okay.

385
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,224
I'm not upset with you.

386
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:45,017
- You're not?
- No, we're good.

387
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,852
I-I promise.

388
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,155
Okay, cool.

389
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:51,565
That's the other thing,
celebrating the decimation

390
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,577
of an indigenous culture so
a bunch of greedy colonizers

391
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,254
can get their turkey-lurkey on.

392
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:58,006
Do you know about this?
Do you know about the sham?

393
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,994
The sham we call "Thanksgiving."

394
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,093
Okay, I'm sorry, am I missing something?

395
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:04,596
Since when did you guys
become anti-Thanksgiving?

396
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:07,139
Since a bunch of guys
wearing hat-buckles

397
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:10,042
fed us some old bull, wrapped in lies,

398
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:12,345
stuffed in propaganda.

399
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,439
It's a deception Turducken.

400
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:16,107
Actually, I think the hat-buckles

401
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:18,592
- weren't real either.
- Don't encourage him.

402
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,603
- You get it.
- Okay.

403
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:22,138
Did you get anything from Mardon?

404
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,624
No, nothing that'll help
us find his daughter.

405
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:25,933
What about you guys? What'd you dig up?

406
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,601
Meet Joss Jackam.

407
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,104
She is a delinquent teen
turned amateur storm chaser.

408
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:32,573
A self-taught expert in
theoretical meteorology.

409
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:34,158
How do we know she's a storm chaser?

410
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,110
'Cause Helen Hunt here has a blog.

411
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,538
Mm-hmm. She lost her grant
from the Science Center

412
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,948
for doing too many dangerous
experiments on the weather.

413
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,752
Well, look like she's way
beyond the experimental phase.

414
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,888
Ooh, Weather Witch?

415
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,330
I'll allow it.

416
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,538
Dad, that weathervane,

417
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,459
doesn't it look a lot like...

418
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,213
The staff she was carrying, yeah.

419
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:55,999
Cisco, can you pull
up the security footage

420
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,390
from her attack on Iron Heights?

421
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,800
Sure can.

422
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:02,845
It's infected with a satellite shard.

423
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,398
She's got meta-tech. Like
Spencer Young's phone.

424
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,567
Look, she has instant
lightning on command.

425
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,809
There's no way you're gonna be able

426
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,144
to get that staff from her.

427
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,496
She's gonna have to
give it up willingly.

428
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:12,956
Okay, listen, we got 20 minutes

429
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,332
before she destroys the entire city,

430
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:16,233
so what is the plan?

431
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,736
We only have one choice.

432
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:20,947
We give her what she wants.

433
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,766
No Weather Witch in sight.

434
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,218
Okay, Singh cleared the perimeter,

435
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,512
so it's free of civilians.

436
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:29,830
And our satellites are on weather watch

437
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,832
for our Weather Witch. Nothing yet.

438
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,500
What?

439
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,353
I wouldn't say nothing.

440
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:37,181
My data leaves me to conclude

441
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:38,964
that there is artificially-created

442
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,633
pressure system of uncertain origin

443
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:43,219
headed rapidement
toward the downtown core.

444
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:45,083
Listen, Galileo, you
can lick your finger

445
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,604
and stick it in the wind all you want.

446
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,522
Why don't you leave
the actual calculations

447
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,777
to actual compu...
Oh, for Christ's sake.

448
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,521
And your exasperation
leads me also to conclude

449
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,374
that you have realized, although late,

450
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:59,127
that once again I'm right.
I'm right. I'm right.

451
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,481
I'm right. I'm right...

452
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:04,957
That's enough out of you.

453
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,996
She's here.

454
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:15,042
So the rotten apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

455
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:18,212
You're a poet. Awesome.

456
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,639
Where's my dad?

457
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,061
All right, Joss, we held
up our end of the bargain.

458
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:26,428
You got your dad.

459
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,930
There's no reason to hurt anybody...

460
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,482
Ah, so boring. Come on.

461
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,558
We'll handle it from here.

462
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,060
Hey, baby girl.

463
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:34,579
Dad.

464
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,272
That's a pretty cool staff.

465
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:37,940
Would you just... how
about you just power

466
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:40,999
that thing off for a
sec and let your dad try.

467
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,194
Try this.

468
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,892
Oh, no.

469
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,671
Oh.

470
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,733
Oh, oh, don't feel bad.
He was a selfish dick

471
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:00,754
who abandoned his family.

472
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:04,776
Anyway, thanks for helping
me drop a truck on my dad.

473
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,789
Uh... guys?

474
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:22,001
What now?

475
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,133
I didn't see the hummer coming.

476
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:31,660
I'm so pissed!

477
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,547
This city will drown,

478
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:38,125
crumble, burn, because of you!

479
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,225
Thanks.

480
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:48,189
I'm gonna follow her.

481
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:49,950
Wait, are you serious right now?

482
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:51,679
- What?
- You almost just died.

483
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,733
Again, and you don't seem to care.

484
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:54,909
Where is this coming from?

485
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,338
You know how dangerous our job is.

486
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:58,007
Yeah, but I don't
want to lose you again,

487
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,497
but you don't seem to
give a damn if you lose me,

488
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,266
and... and all for your job.

489
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:03,769
Nora.

490
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:24,381
How long you been holding that one in?

491
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:26,692
My best guess...

492
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,444
my whole life.

493
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:35,350
Growing up without
you, I was so angry...

494
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:39,896
but you were my hero, so...

495
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:43,525
it was easier to put my
anger for you not being around

496
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:49,197
on criminals and meta-villains...

497
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,175
a lot of times on Mom.

498
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:55,054
But when I saw you die today

499
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:58,724
it reminded me that

500
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:04,087
I'm mad at someone
else about losing you...

501
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:06,640
you.

502
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,152
I get it.

503
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:14,388
It's not easy having a parent

504
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,433
who puts their life
on the line for others.

505
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:18,893
I remember feeling
the same way about Joe

506
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:23,323
- being a cop when I was a kid.
- No, it's not the same thing.

507
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:25,733
Did he ever have to say
good-bye to you knowing

508
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:28,736
that he wasn't coming back?

509
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:30,738
You did...

510
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,822
and you're gonna do it again.

511
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,742
Nora, you got to remember
you're talking about

512
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:36,461
a future that we might be able to avoid.

513
00:25:36,463 --> 00:25:38,621
We still have time to
find our way to a solution,

514
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:40,248
and we will.

515
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,959
But there is a solution.

516
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:45,813
It's just one that you don't want.

517
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:50,517
Give up being The Flash.

518
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,611
Come on. It's the only way to guarantee

519
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:54,554
that you won't disappear
again in the future,

520
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:55,930
or any other time.

521
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:58,475
- Nora.
- Come on. Think about it.

522
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:00,452
You're not the only hero.

523
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:03,813
Let the others protect the world.

524
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:07,108
You don't have to keep
sacrificing yourself.

525
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,461
You give your life again and again.

526
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:12,005
How many times does it have to be you?

527
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:17,160
It hurt so much

528
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:20,046
losing you when I didn't even know you,

529
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:23,142
but now after all of these months

530
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:25,144
getting to know you I just...

531
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,220
Please, Dad, don't make
me go through it again.

532
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,940
I don't want to go through it again.

533
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:39,658
Nora, people need The Flash.

534
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,197
I need my dad.

535
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:13,675
This is the third ice
cream of the day, you know?

536
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:17,437
Something fishy's going on here.

537
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:20,390
Okay, you got me.

538
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:21,775
We're celebrating

539
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:25,779
because this is a very special day.

540
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:27,655
One year ago today,

541
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:29,282
I made you a promise

542
00:27:29,284 --> 00:27:31,234
that I would turn my life around

543
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:33,361
and make things better for you.

544
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:36,215
I can honestly say that my life

545
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:39,885
is a million times
better than what it was.

546
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,662
And it's all because of you, Gracie.

547
00:27:42,664 --> 00:27:44,455
So I got you something.

548
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:50,670
It's the set I wanted.

549
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:54,149
I thought your little
dollhouse could use a family.

550
00:27:58,072 --> 00:28:00,647
I already have one.

551
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,867
I love you, kiddo.

552
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:05,420
Purple.

553
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:10,440
You know, I think four ice
creams in a day would be the...

554
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,023
Gracie, run.

555
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:54,126
Run. Run. Come on!

556
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:59,322
Go this way! Go this way!

557
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,695
Help me!

558
00:29:21,697 --> 00:29:23,304
Help me, please!

559
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:26,307
- Sir.
- Somebody!

560
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:31,688
Save her, please.

561
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,292
Get him on a table.

562
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,379
Move!

563
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:43,991
Gracie...

564
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:48,329
Help her...

565
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:49,997
On the eve of Thanksgiving,

566
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,517
reports of devastating
weather phenomena

567
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,783
are streaming in from all over the city.

568
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:58,299
The exact cause of these
disturbances remains unknown.

569
00:29:58,302 --> 00:29:59,766
I can't believe she's actually willing

570
00:29:59,768 --> 00:30:02,194
to level the city to kill one man.

571
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:04,029
She doesn't know where Mardon is.

572
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:06,222
It's overkill, but it's the
only option we've left her.

573
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:07,941
Well, Caitlin's on radar,

574
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:09,517
and Cisco's trying to
juice the satellites,

575
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,579
but there's interference.
We can't locate Joss.

576
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:15,332
You okay?

577
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:20,120
Look, babe, you're gonna find the words

578
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,047
to make her understand. I know it.

579
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,199
Not sure I have the words
to make myself understand.

580
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:27,034
She's got a point.

581
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:33,767
We got a hit on Joss.

582
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,468
She's at Sheldon County Airport.

583
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,514
Barry, you got to move.

584
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,350
- You're good?
- Barry, do you have eyes on Joss?

585
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:54,663
No, she's damaged the terminal so badly

586
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,291
the hangar's the only safe place.

587
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:58,860
I'm evacuating everyone
trapped on the tarmac.

588
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,194
I think I can bring Frost out.

589
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:03,606
- What can we do?
- Flood control down at the Marina.

590
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:06,376
Guys, how do we fight weather?

591
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,280
We fight weather with weather.

592
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:12,966
Nora.

593
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:14,493
We still have Mardon's weather wand.

594
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:15,805
I need you to get it from the archives

595
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,331
and take it to Barry, okay?

596
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,264
Okay.

597
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,476
- Hey.
- Hey.

598
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:26,587
- Mardon's wand?
- Cisco says you can use it

599
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,389
to counteract Joss's weather.

600
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,840
Where is she?

601
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:36,180
Last chance. Where's my dad?

602
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,753
Joss, you know we can't give him up.

603
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:40,902
Then you know what happens next.

604
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:44,071
Joss, I deceived you, okay? Not them.

605
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:45,893
You want make someone pay, it's me.

606
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:49,243
This is how you make heroes pay!

607
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,330
By the beard of Zeus, she's making

608
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,392
a tornado out of lightning.

609
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:07,353
Cisco, how do I use
this wand to stop this?

610
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:09,229
You can attract all the
lightning to the wand.

611
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:11,858
That'll take down the
tornado, but all that energy

612
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,217
will go through your body.

613
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:15,139
You'll be a human lightning rod.

614
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,400
It's okay.

615
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:31,619
I know you have to go.

616
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:33,195
Run, Dad.

617
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:34,914
Run!

618
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:55,498
Back. Everybody, back.

619
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:50,790
Barry? Nora, do you see him?

620
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:55,819
I, uh...

621
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:58,089
I...

622
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,475
I see him. He's still here.

623
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,776
We live in a world full of meta-phones

624
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:29,289
and meta-weathervanes.

625
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,030
What's next? My electric toothbrush?

626
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:33,299
Till we figure out how
to remove those shards,

627
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,951
- better safe than sorry.
- Yeah.

628
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:37,637
Well, now that Mardon and his daughter

629
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,973
are all tucked away in Iron Heights.

630
00:34:39,975 --> 00:34:42,976
What do you say we spend
some time with our own family?

631
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:46,003
Well, might just be
us and Nora this year.

632
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,338
Caitlin and Cisco are
skipping Thanksgiving.

633
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:49,692
What? Why?

634
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:52,561
- Don't even ask.
- What?

635
00:34:52,564 --> 00:34:55,471
- A toast to...
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,640
The thankless.

637
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,517
- The thankless!
- The thankless!

638
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,994
The thankless!

639
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,403
Allez-oop.

640
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:04,164
- Mm.
- Mm.

641
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,908
Aw.

642
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,579
All right, boys, I'm tapping in.

643
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:13,052
Okay, let me get this straight.

644
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:15,340
You two losers are sitting here

645
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:18,807
in what I can only assume
is the cantina of a starship,

646
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,872
drinking and eating terrible food

647
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:24,592
when you could be drinking
and eating amazing food

648
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:27,187
with people who actually care about you.

649
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:30,523
All right, all right, look.

650
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,208
When you put it like that...

651
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:34,360
- She has a good point.
- You have a good point, yeah.

652
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:37,179
And, by the way, I have the
least to celebrate this year

653
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:40,775
because I spent most of it unconscious.

654
00:35:40,777 --> 00:35:43,060
You nerds come to Thanksgiving, or what?

655
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:53,237
So it wasn't so much the
taste as it was the crunch.

656
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,547
Wait, are you actually saying...

657
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:56,574
Yes, that was the year I found out

658
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:59,356
why Grandma Esther's
yams tasted so good,

659
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,620
because she never cleaned
her favorite skillet.

660
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:06,559
I take it this was also the year

661
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:09,303
you stopped eating
Grandma Esther's yams?

662
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:12,214
Uh-uh, I didn't say all that.

663
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:16,217
Allow me to propose a toast.

664
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,763
Well, first to clean dishware,

665
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,150
and also to... to family, all right,

666
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:26,454
and to friends, old and new.

667
00:36:28,866 --> 00:36:31,576
And to the colonizers
who conquered this land...

668
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:33,505
- What?
- And...

669
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,997
- the colonizers who grabbed...
- Remember... no...

670
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,757
What they want, they
just take what they want.

671
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:39,667
- Yes, I know, but our...
- To taking what you...

672
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,577
That's not... you know what? Let's go.

673
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,096
- Right now.
- Okay, you know what?

674
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:46,457
I think that it's time
to go carve a turkey.

675
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:47,767
Great.

676
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:50,085
Nora.

677
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:53,631
Um, we didn't have a chance
to talk since the airport.

678
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,016
Oh, Dad, I know what you're gonna say,

679
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,442
and you don't have to.

680
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,028
I saw what it was like

681
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:00,113
when you hesitated to save those people

682
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:04,284
because of me, and I felt...

683
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:06,977
- Horrible?
- Yeah.

684
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:09,530
And I never want to
feel like that again.

685
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:11,791
I get it.

686
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:17,505
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
yourself to save others.

687
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,966
Even if it means leaving
your family behind.

688
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:22,209
Not exactly.

689
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:26,472
Look, when I ran into
that storm I was thinking

690
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:29,475
I want to save everyone, but...

691
00:37:29,477 --> 00:37:33,646
the person I was thinking
about the most was you.

692
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:37,150
- Me?
- Yeah.

693
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,988
I don't choose being The Flash
over being with my family.

694
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,544
I'm The Flash for my family,

695
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:46,422
and I don't have to run to the future

696
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:49,450
to understand why I sacrificed myself.

697
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:53,982
I'd do it to save you, and your mom,

698
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:56,193
all the people I love.

699
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:59,172
You know, maybe one
day if I train enough,

700
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:01,198
I'll be able to save you.

701
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,384
I don't doubt it.

702
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:08,514
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

703
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:10,091
- Ah, yes.
- All right.

704
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,667
- Hey, thank God.
- Carve the turkey.

705
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,505
- Yeah, baby.
- Here we are.

706
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,295
- Each person gets a turkey.
- No.

707
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:17,005
- Oh.
- We have the one for everyone.

708
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:18,599
- You all right?
- Just Dad with a knife,

709
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,267
it's a little... It's the most fun part.

710
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:23,479
Oh, you're very good at that.

711
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,847
Am I?

712
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:36,250
Orlin.

713
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:41,122
I told you it's too risky.

714
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:44,833
CCPD's already looking for
you. What are you doing here?

715
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:49,482
It's Thanksgiving, Doc. I'm
here to be with my family.

716
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:02,575
I want you to be optimistic,

717
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:04,086
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

718
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:06,018
As far as how long,

719
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:08,390
with all the brain
hemorrhaging she suffered,

720
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:10,601
you have to prepare
yourself for the possibility

721
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:13,621
that she may never wake.

722
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:18,159
This is all my fault.

723
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:21,328
No, it's these metas.

724
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,447
Wreaking havoc unchecked.

725
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:26,700
She didn't deserve this, Mr. Dwyer,

726
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:28,335
and neither did you.

727
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:40,130
This was the scene Tuesday
night as, once again,

728
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:43,425
The Flash saved Central City
from certain destruction.

729
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:45,278
After a world-wide power outage

730
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,471
blanketed every country in darkness,

731
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:50,974
a bizarre purple...

732
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:53,268
The destructive
phenomenon emanated

733
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,978
from a satellite that had fallen

734
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,939
into a decaying orbit.

735
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,283
Thankfully, before the
satellite could strike

736
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:01,536
the city and create
what scientists believe

737
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:04,037
would have been "a
catastrophic event,"

738
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,966
The Flash was able to destroy it.

739
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,827
Once again, residents of our proud city,

740
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:12,853
and perhaps the entire
world owe The Flash

741
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:15,975
and his allies...

742
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,521
A new meta was last seen
jumping off a building

743
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:25,508
in order to evade capture
after stealing jewels...

744
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:30,013
It was reported that he
escaped Flash's grasp

745
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:33,493
after hijacking an armored vehicle.

746
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:50,751
I'm gonna make this right, Gracie.

747
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:54,755
Every meta...

748
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:57,258
will die.

749
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:06,383
Guys, this better be good.

750
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:08,269
Yeah, we've got an
after-Thanksgiving tradition

751
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:11,272
called sleeping, so what's up?

752
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:13,616
It's good. Trust us. Detective.

753
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,641
Well, it occurred to me that if you,

754
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:17,259
monsieur and madam West-Allen,

755
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:20,438
you want to spend this
holiday with your family.

756
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:23,284
Well, perhaps your
meta-killer does as well.

757
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:26,069
So I had monsieur Cisco
hack into the CCTV footage

758
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:30,073
of the hospital and this what we got.

759
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:32,576
Ever since Grace arrived,

760
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:35,871
only one man has come to visit her.

761
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:37,711
Every day.

762
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,867
Including tonight.

763
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,044
Team Flash, I give you...

764
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:46,381
Orlin Dwyer, also known as...

765
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,817
Cicada.

766
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,346
