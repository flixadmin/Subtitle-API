00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:15,329
The signatures are an exact match.

170
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,030
He called himself The Trickster too,

171
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:18,298
just like you.

172
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,401
He is nothing like me, Detective.

173
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:23,437
Nothing!

174
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,540
Do you know who he is?

175
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:27,574
[chuckles]

176
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:30,043
[sighs]

177
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:35,182
Oh.

178
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,756
If I did, I would tell you,

179
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:45,459
so you could find him, cut off his head,

180
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,661
and throw it right in his face.

181
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:50,697
No, this is obviously the work

182
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,367
of a rank amateur at best.

183
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:57,371
A mere pretender angling for my throne.

184
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,173
I hear you.

185
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:03,610
So...

186
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,579
help us catch him.

187
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,347
Prove there's only one Trickster.

188
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:10,984
[chuckles]

189
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,788
Trying to trick The Trickster, Joseph, hmm?

190
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,625
No.

191
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:23,964
There's only one way this could happen.

192
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:25,832
Whoever he is,

193
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,237
he must have found my lair.

194
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:33,040
I ask only one thing,

195
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,076
when you find this schtick stealer,

196
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,847
this gimmick grabber,
this pathetic wannabe, fake,

197
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:45,886
make sure your safety's off.

198
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:49,056

[siren wails]

200
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:55,262
(Iris) Something has
happened to Mason Bridge.

201
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,264
No one has seen or heard
from him in a week.

202
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,700
Well, he's a journalist, Iris.
Maybe he's on a story.

203
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,135
Then why hasn't he answered
his phone or his emails?

204
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,705
Maybe he stumbled on the wrong
story and he's laying low.

205
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,440
You don't know him like I do, Eddie.

206
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:09,209
When Mason is on a story,
nothing is getting in his way.

207
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,778
I mean, he considers threats
minor annoyances.

208
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,447
Then maybe he's on a bender
or he met a girl

209
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,449
worth disappearing for a week over.

210
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,484
Look, he also said that
something weird was going on

211
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,052
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

212
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,754
Eddie, something has happened to him.

213
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:22,756
Something bad. I can feel it.

214
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:23,924
Please.

215
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:25,459
Look, Captain Singh has everyone

216
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,860
on the Central City Park bomber.

217
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:29,196
But as soon as I can,
I'll look into Bridge.

218
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,998
I promise.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,166
Okay.

220
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,703
[sighs]

221
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:40,007
(West) This looks like nobody's
been here since the '90s.

222
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,509
Yeah, look at this thing.

223
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:43,777
You really think Jesse doesn't know

224
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,345
who this new Trickster guy is?

225
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:47,280
He seemed pretty ticked off that someone

226
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:50,317
was besmirching his bad name.

227
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:52,486
Joe.

228
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,732
Let's see what he's got stashed in there.

229
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:06,700
Yeah.

230
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:09,903
[ticking]

[sighs]

234
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:30,057
The copycat... he took everything.

[dramatic music]

Hey, c-can we have a second?

00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,237
- Yeah, sure.
- Just...

Barry.

Hey.

241
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,112
What are you doing here?

242
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,147
Uh, Joe and I have
some questions for an inmate

243
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,382
about a bombing case.

244
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:59,019
Dad, listen, I'm close.

245
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,554
The man that put you in here...

246
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:02,522
I'm getting close,
closer than I've ever been.

247
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:05,459
Barry, we have talked about this.

248
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:07,694
I know, and I'm done talking.

249
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:11,498
You're not gonna pay
for another man's crime anymore.

250
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,568
Just hang in there, okay?

251
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,205
Joe, what's he talking about?

252
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,576
Like he said, Henry, just hang in there.

What? No candy, fellas?

255
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,952
That storage space you
sent us to was booby-trapped.

256
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,888
[chuckles] You can never be too careful

257
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,623
with your private things.

258
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,158
You were protecting nothing.

259
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,659
Your secret stash was empty.

260
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,128
What do you mean?

261
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,096
No firearms, none of your explosives,

262
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:44,164
nothing.

263
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,398
Whatever you had in there,

264
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,467
it was stolen, all of it.

265
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:52,105
No. He's stealing my legacy.

266
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:54,841
Whoever this is, you need to find him.

267
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:56,777
I will not let this... this...

268
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,579
- Trickster?
- That is my name! Mine!

269
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:02,015
What was in that room?
What were you keeping there?

270
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:06,186
A bomb. A really big bomb.

271
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,355
How big?

272
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:11,057
Bye-bye, Central City.

guy just posted a vlog.

00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:17,864
You gotta see this.

00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:18,999
I'm sending you the link right now.

280
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:27,707

welcome to Boom Day. [chuckles]

I'm very proud to report
that my first trick

00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:35,148
was an exploding success.

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,149
Show him.

00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:38,785
But I think you all deserve

286
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,288
something much, uh, bigger.

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,958
- No, no, no, no, no.
- So for my next trick...

Whoever this Trickster is,
he's certainly not shy.

297

Well, not every criminal
likes to hide in the dark.

298
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:22,075
Cisco, can you trace
where the video was posted from?

299
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:25,311
I tried, but this guy is using some crazy

Felicity-caliber scrambler
like I've never seen.

301
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,449
The origin of the upload's
coming from hundreds

302
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:31,050
of different locations.

303
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:33,253
Until he uploads another video,
it's gonna be tough.

304
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:35,555
This psychopath has the
capability to destroy the city.

305
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,391
Hey, I said tough, not impossible.

306
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,894

00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,064

[sighs]

310
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:58,378
I know what's going on with you.

311
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:07,420
I know what you're thinking.

312
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:10,957
Do you?

313
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,759
I know going up to Iron Heights prison

314
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,094
and conversing with Mr. Jesse
has brought about feelings

315
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,095
of your father.

316
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:17,630
How could it not?

317
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:20,033
Yeah, no, it's, uh,

318
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:24,470
it's been really tough
knowing that my mom's killer

319
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:27,407
is still out there.

320
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,409
Of course.

321
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:32,412
But we'll find him, together.

322
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:33,913
You have my word.

323
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:36,482
Thank you.

324
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:38,651
For now, how about we focus

325
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:41,120
on finding this Trickster
before anybody else gets hurt?

665
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:16,575
Oh, that felt weird.

666
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:18,778
Oh.

667
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,613
I'm good.

668
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:23,616
- Ooh, I like it.
- Look at that.

669
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:26,385
Lobsters on me, kid.

670
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:36,495
It's okay. You've all been
given an antidote.

671
00:34:36,497 --> 00:34:38,264
That wasn't very sanitary.

672
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:39,698
Now where is Henry Allen?

673
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,602
You're going to prison either way, James.

674
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:46,505
[dramatic music]

675
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:04,623
[chuckles] All right.

676
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:13,466
[both laugh]

677
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:15,901
You always did look good in red.

678
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:19,038
[both laughing]

679
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:32,155
Wow.

680
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,934
Half of this stuff didn't even
exist when I was practicing.

681
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:37,902
Yeah, well, I'd be happy to give you

682
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:42,073
a crash course on all of it if you get out.

683
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,274
I'm gonna shut up now.

684
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:45,276
[chuckles] It's okay.

685
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,678
- Dr. Allen?
- Yes?

686
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:48,342
I'm feeling the need to give you a hug.

687
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:52,580
Absolutely. I will always accept a hug.

688
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,615
Thank you.

689
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:03,958
Wow. You gotta tell me.

690
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,893
What does it feel like when
you're running down the street

691
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:09,030
like a bat out of hell?

692
00:36:12,368 --> 00:36:15,770
There's no feeling like it.

693
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:19,474
I bet.

694
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:22,710
Actually, you're all heroes in my book,

695
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:25,413
especially you, Dr. Wells.

696
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:27,148
Thank you

697
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,317
for everything that you've done for my son.

698
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:32,620
Well, your son is
an extraordinary man, Dr. Allen,

699
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:34,622
and I will do everything in my power

700
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:37,759
to ensure Barry's future.

701
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:40,695
[gentle music]

702
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:56,511
It's time, Joe.

703
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:57,545
- No.
- No?

704
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:00,815
- No.
- Okay.

705
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:08,656
You seem like you could use a hug too.

706
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:11,459
Your father is an extraordinary man.

707
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:15,763
You're lucky to have him.

708
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:18,432
I'm lucky to have you too.

709
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:35,149
Ahh!

710
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:50,565
[grunting]

711
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,839
Who are you?

712
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,308
My name is Eobard Thawne,

713
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,810
but that name doesn't matter.

714
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:04,979
Not anymore.
It won't matter for many years.

715
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:08,749
The only thing that really
matters is who you are.

716
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,418
Harrison Wells.

717
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,486
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

718
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:16,991
In the year 2020,
you and your wife, Tess Morgan,

719
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:19,527
successfully launched
a Particle Accelerator

720
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,229
that changed the course of history.

721
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:24,265
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

722
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:27,902
Much sooner.

723
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:30,504
- What is that?
- My way home.

724
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:33,040
[police sirens approaching]

725
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:37,278
You see, they're not coming to save you.

726
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,148
They're coming to save me.

727
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,116
[grunts]

728
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:45,319
[sirens continue]

729
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,625
[grunting]

730
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:57,331
[both screaming]

731
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,449
[exhales]

732
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,893
Hey, Joe.

733
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,295
Desk Sergeant said you were looking for me.

734
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:30,097
Eddie, yeah. Uh...

735
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:36,604
Sit down.

736
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:40,041
It's about Iris.

737
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,476
She's looking into
Mason Bridge's disappearance.

738
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:44,312
We can't let that happen.

739
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:52,286
Detective.

740
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:10,604
Eddie, we need your help.

741
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:16,177
Brazil?

742
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:20,881
Why... why would Mason move to Brazil?

743
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:23,217
Apparently there was a girl involved,

744
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:27,989
and he decided to go hike
the Amazon with her for a year,

745
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:29,623
you know, live off the grid,

746
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,092
write his memoirs or something.

747
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:34,028
Wow. I guess you really don't know anyone.

748
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,930
No, you don't.

749
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:37,298
(West) Hey, baby, everything good?

750
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

751
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:41,802
Um, dinner will be ready in a jiff, okay?

752
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:43,337
Okay.

753
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,211
She buy it?

754
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:52,313
I think so.

755
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,415
Keeping her in the dark,
it's for her safety.

756
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:57,818
That is debatable,
and we will have that debate.

757
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,821
But for right now, what's our next move?

758
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,991
How do we figure out what Wells is up to?

759
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:08,195
When Wells was talking me through phasing

760
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:10,965
so I could get the Trickster's
bomb off my wrist,

761
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:15,002
the way that he described
my being The Flash, running,

762
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:20,007
feeling the wind and the power,

763
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:23,611
it's like he was talking from experience.

764
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:24,912
What are you saying?

765
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:26,647
I don't know how...

766
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,283
but he's the man in yellow.

767
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:32,887
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

768
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:38,893
I got an 11-80, possible 10-54,

769
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,695
County Road J,
requesting immediate assistance.

770
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:44,765
(man on radio) Copy that. Units
en route to your location.

771
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,368
[grunting]

772
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,403
Sir, we're gonna get you out of here.

773
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:50,671
Can you tell me your name?

774
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:54,408
Do you know who you are?

775
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,944
My name...

776
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:59,814
is...

777
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:03,651
Harrison Wells.
