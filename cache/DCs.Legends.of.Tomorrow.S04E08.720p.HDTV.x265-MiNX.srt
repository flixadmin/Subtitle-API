1
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:01,734
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,737 --> 00:00:02,984
I couldn't send Neron into hell

3
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:04,757
without sending Dez down with him.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,578
I killed the man I loved, and for what?

5
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:08,352
John, you have to stop this.

6
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:09,821
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell

7
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:10,929
and you don't join the Legends,

8
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:12,489
the effects could be cataclysmic.

9
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:14,459
History be bloody damned.

10
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,994
I really care about you.

11
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,817
This thing between us, it isn't real.

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,064
It never was.

13
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:25,102
- Uh...
- What's that?

14
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:26,638
I think John just broke time.

15
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:31,810
Oy, see, check this out.

16
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,411
I got my powers back.

17
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,093
Zari.

18
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,852
Constantine did it.

19
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:43,153
He changed the timeline
back in New Orleans.

20
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:44,689
He saved old Dez.

21
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:49,628
Unfortunately, I have no
idea why you're a cat, Z.

22
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,997
Oh, quit your whinging.

23
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,692
I know it's a pretty raw deal for you.

24
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:54,804
Especially 'cause...

25
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:56,768
Well, who knows what
they put in cat food.

26
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:02,841
On the plus side you are cute as hell.

27
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:06,473
Z, it has been an experience.

28
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:08,680
Now, I'm gonna set the autopilot

29
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:11,182
to take you back to the "Waverider,"

30
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:15,887
but first we're gonna drop
me off somewhere fabulous.

31

32
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:36,041
Hope y'all are thirsty for champagne.

33
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,110
Because I'm feeling a little bubbly.

34
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:42,180
Whoo!

35
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,123
Hello, Red.

36
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:56,494
Ms. Monroe. How's
lady luck treating you?

37
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,963
Ooh. Ooh.

38
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,168
Red, it's me. Charlie.

39
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,305
- Shapeshifter.
- Cheers to Saint Patrick.

40
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:08,740
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:11,076
I haven't seen you since
we escaped from that prison.

42
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:13,011
Yeah. Hey listen, mate.

43
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,879
You got to stop doing
your leprechaun magic

44
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,681
so out in the open like this, all right?

45
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:18,550
I do this all the time.

46
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,919
These humans, they
don't notice anything.

47
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,414
Watch.

48
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:28,693
Lucky 11. Winner!

49
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:29,861
Quit doing that.

50
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:31,763
But I'm just having a little fun.

51
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,498
What's got you so worried?

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,966
The Magic Police?

53
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,701
They're called the
Legends and I'm just trying

54
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,503
to stay off their radar
for a little while.

55
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,105
Sounds to me like you're scared.

56
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,421
What, of them?

57
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,990
No, no, no, they're not dangerous.

58
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,642
They're just annoying
little boy scouts, you know?

59
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:52,183
Reach for the sky, you filthy animals.

60
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,185
Pretty please.

61
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,154
He asked nicely.

62
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,455
Greetings, gentlemen.

63
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:59,824
Ah, the leprechaun.

64
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,292
You fellas play?

65
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:04,162
Ahh... no.

66
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,434
Oh, my God. Why did you do that?

67
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,005
Marilyn Monroe.

68
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,775
I am killing it at
historical figure bingo.

69
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:18,476
All right, everyone, calm down.

70
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:19,844
We just saved your butts

71
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,213
from a very dangerous magical creature.

72
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,749
Who are you guys?

73
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:51,294
Hi, Nate Heywood. Monster hunter.

74
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,364
Just wanted you ladies to
know you're in good hands.

75
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,484
Man, Garima is gonna flip

76
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,453
when she hears we met Marilyn Monroe.

77
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,521
Do you think a murderous alien queen

78
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,090
that sprang to life from Mick's
fantasies is into Marilyn?

79
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,460
Yes.

80
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:11,963
Hmm.

81
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,632
What is up with these guys?

82
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:17,312
Gideon, any messages while we were gone?

83
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,216
You missed calls from Barry Allen,

84
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,239
Oliver Queen, and Kara Zor-El.

85
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:23,408
Sounds like the annual crossover.

86
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,577
Yeah, that's gonna be a hard pass.

87
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,601
Did I tell you Oliver owes me money?

88
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,281
I bet this year they'll swap costumes.

89
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,354
Oh, Zari. Well, I'm glad to see

90
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:38,022
that you made it back to the ship okay.

91
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,160
Okay, I hear you.
You're still mad at me.

92
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:44,662
Listen, I really need your help.

93
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,099
All right, yeah, I can
see that being a cat

94
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,801
is your main concern right now,

95
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,837
but I still don't know why you're a cat.

96
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,639
Ms. Tomaz was turned into a cat

97
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,008
during the team's encounter
with a Fairy Godmother.

98
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,078
Whoa, Gideon, your
latest upgrade, smoking.

99
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,180
Thank you, Miss Jiwe.

100
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,616
Amaya Jiwe, yup, that's me.

101
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:07,548
And may I say your
new upgrade and accent

102
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,184
are also smoking.

103
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:10,321
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,789
You know, I'm just trying something out.

105
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,893
Yeah, okay, one last question.

106
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:17,159
Why are the Legends
homicidal wankers now?

107
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:19,429
If you're referring to the
Custodians of the Chronology,

108
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,998
their policy towards magical creatures

109
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,668
has been shoot on sight

110
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,036
since their disastrous
encounter at Woodstock.

111
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,373
Right. Thanks, Gideon.

112
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,175
Must be fallout from

113
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:32,911
Constantine altering the timeline.

114
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,960
Right, this zero tolerance
bollocks ends now.

115
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,419
Hey, people!

116
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,922
I have an announcement to make.

117
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:46,124
Please, gather around.

118
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,792
Come listen.

119
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:52,759
So I know our shoot-first,
ask-questions-never policy

120
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:57,331
has lead to some
interesting decorations,

121
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,200
but it's time to change.

122
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:01,806
From now on we are going to
capture the magical creatures

123
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:06,477
and bring them to the Bureau
like we are supposed to.

124
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,846
Why are you looking at me weird?

125
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,351
Well, just seems like a shame
to change our policy now.

126
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,621
Considering we're so close
to capturing our white whale.

127
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,289
That's a "Moby Dick" reference.

128
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,492
And what is your white whale?

129
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,843
The only creature we
haven't been able to capture

130
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,895
because it's quite elusive.

131
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe because it has the
ability to change shape.

132
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:31,302
Shapeshifter!

133
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,204
How dare you step on this ship

134
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,473
and pretend to be our dead captain.

135
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,774
What?

136
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,199
Wait, Sara's dead?

137
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:41,646
Yeah, that's why we
know you're not Sara.

138
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,441
Is that why you guys are like this?

139
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,543
Like what?

140
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:47,585
Hunting down magical
creatures like it's a...

141
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:50,288
Yes!

142
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,723
Damn it, Garima.

143
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,258
I called dibs on killing
shapeshifter last week.

144
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,765
You know what? He did.

145
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,152
You remember when we were roasting

146
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,965
that little baby Gryphon,

147
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,667
which was delicious, by the way,

148
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,302
but you guys got into an argument

149
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,537
about who actually killed
it, so then Ray got upset

150
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,207
and he was like, "Hey, I
wanna kill the shapeshifter."

151
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,754
Oh, it heals itself
and turns into Amaya.

152
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,012
This is not good.

153
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:17,415
- Kill her again!
- I get to kill her this time.

154
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,549
After her!

155
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,780
Zari.

156
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,016
Oh, bollocks.

157
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,920
- Go, go!
- Come on, Ray!

158
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,923
Check the library!

159
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,592
Make sure she doesn't steal anything!

160
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,532
They've become maniacs.

161
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:38,069
Okay, this is bad.

162
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,472
What, Constantine?
Yes, this is his fault.

163
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:45,009
He needs to help us fix
this, but where is he?

164
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,182
Nice work, Zari cat.

165
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,618
I can't very well walk
around here looking like this.

166
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,070
Oh, hush, it's still me

167
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:15,339
despite the insane grin on my face.

168
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,486
I don't remember there
being a memorial here.

169
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:32,223
Sara Lance struck down by unicorn.

170
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,392
Bollocks.

171
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,288
Gary, you're late.

172
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,962
Uh, sorry, Mr. Heywood,

173
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:43,000
my cat-sitter quit on me, so...

174
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,251
This place is going to
hell in a hand basket.

175
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,520
Yeah, it's my bad, sir.

176
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,906
Look, the Custodians of the Chronology

177
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,765
just destroyed a freaking leprechaun.

178
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,855
All right, you know
what? If you see them,

179
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:57,381
tell them they're getting
a scream-down from me.

180
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,617
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Heywood.

181
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:02,386
Have you seen John Constantine around?

182
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:03,855
Is that a joke?

183
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,124
He's been in confinement for months.

184
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,559
You put him there.

185
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,728
- Idiots.
- Right.

186
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,615
This isn't the when
when I'm supposed to be.

187
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,873
Johnny... Johnny...

188
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,377
No, the truth is not the truth!

189
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,845
All right, this is not the when

190
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,021
when I'm supposed to be.

191
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,123
You should go.

192
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:34,118
So what's real, Johnny?

193
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,121
Reality is fractured, but the pieces,

194
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,423
they speak to each other like light

195
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:43,161
between broken mirrors.

196
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:44,740
John Constantine.

197
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:47,231
Confined for becoming
dangerously unstable

198
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,034
after suspected time crimes.

199
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,702
Are you real?

200
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,438
Do you exist? Because it's
really hard to tell these days.

201
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,374
Yup, bloke's gone cuckoo.

202
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,777
Ha.

203
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,946
I sense a familiar face.

204
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,948
Who is that?

205
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,904
Z? Z, Is that you?

206
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:09,587
Why the transmogrification?
Let's get this sorted out.

207
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,357
Yeah, all right, I'm sorry,
but this is the only way

208
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,327
that you will know your true self.

209
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,966
Oh, finally.

210
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,808
Hairball.

211
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,080
Because of you dicks, I
have been a cat for so long.

212
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,150
Do you know where this tongue has been?

213
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,418
Places.

214
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,286
I wasn't sure that
reversal was gonna work

215
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,155
because I've been feeling a little,

216
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,623
you know, insane lately.

217
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,692
Yeah, well, you only
have yourself to blame.

218
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:48,993
Wait, what?

219
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,394
You created a time wave

220
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,763
when you changed your past with Desmond.

221
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,432
Because you're the epicenter,

222
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,934
your experience of this
timeline and that one

223
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,669
both exist in your brain.

224
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,371
Just give me a break here.

225
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,507
All right, what you're trying
to say is that I broke time?

226
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,077
Yes, back in New Orleans.

227
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,545
Sure, you don't have to live

228
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,113
with the guilt of damning Desmond,

229
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,150
but you also never joined the Legends.

230
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,420
Without John's help with
the unicorn at Woodstock,

231
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,040
Sara died, which made
the Legends into killers.

232
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,890
Well, there's only one way to fix this.

233
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,259
We go to back to
Woodstock and we save Sara.

234
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:22,894
- Yeah.
- No!

235
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,729
Guys, you're not listening to me.

236
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,802
You have to go to New Orleans
and set history back on track.

237
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,066
Whoa, whoa, Z.

238
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,168
You're suggesting a total
reset of the timeline.

239
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,337
What we need is a surgical strike.

240
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,286
Now, if we save Sara,

241
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:37,642
then the Custodians of
the Chronology never exist.

242
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,844
I keep my powers, Dez is de-demoned,

243
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,078
Bob's your uncle.

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,813
I'm sorry, guys.

245
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:46,183
I have to stop you before you
before you make this any worse.

246
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,518
Ow!

247
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,656
All right, then.

248
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:53,020
I'm sorry, love.

249
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:56,159
Until you can learn
to stay out of my way,

250
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:58,263
then you...

251
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:01,765
...are a cat.

252
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,334
In the mood for a prison break?

253
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:06,003
Oh, yes I am.

254
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,077
Is the coast clear?

255
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:20,157
How much of that did you hear?

256
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,593
Uh... nothing at all.

257
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:25,462
Nothing about breaking
out or hacking history.

258
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,314
Please don't turn me into a cat.

259
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,699
Well, I didn't turn her into cat.

260
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:30,000
I returned her to being a cat,

261
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,835
which is considerably
easier, believe me.

262
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:35,873
But if you gotta, maybe
a Calico and real fluffy.

263
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:37,574
Okay, I'm ready. Do it.

264
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,810
- What are we gonna do with her?
- I have no idea.

265
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:42,112
You don't have to do
anything. I wanna help.

266
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,647
You do?

267
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,619
The Custodians of the
Chronology must be stopped.

268
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,519
They turned my Kaupe friend into a rug.

269
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,421
So if you're trying to defeat them,

270
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,166
I want in.

271
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,659
Oy, watch the bumps, yeah?

272
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:58,772
- Oy!
- Shh, someone might hear you.

273
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:01,131
Red Alert, the "Waverider" is landing.

274
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,634
- Red Alert.
- Oh, man, the Custodians are here.

275
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,869
Could things get any worse?

276
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:08,087
Wait, stop right there.

277
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,681
Are you me?

278
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,333
Yes.

279
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,812
From the future.

280
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,949
Do I ever find love, or
at least my sunglasses?

281
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,150
They might be in my other pants.

282
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:21,919
Yes, Gary, all that and more.

283
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:24,821
It's the Custodians!

284
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:27,458
But right now, I need you
to delay the Custodians.

285
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,369
Okay. Oh, but be careful.

286
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,462
There's been reports of a
shapeshifter on the loose.

287
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:33,197
Yeah, I know that already.

288
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,066
Because I'm you from the future, dummy.

289
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,439
Secure the prisoners.

290
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,470
Lockdown protocols have
been activated. Hurry!

291
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:40,671
Okay.

292
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:41,772
Come on.

293
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,407
We gotta find a place to hide.

294
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,844
Knock, knock, anybody home?

295
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:54,184
Come on, hurry up! Let
me out of this thing.

296
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:56,520
Oh, God.

297
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,255
Where are we?

298
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:00,124
This is Ava's office,

299
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,634
but she's gone.

300
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,460
Gone, gone?

301
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:07,631
I'm right here, you idiots.

302
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:11,201
Dad, we tracked a shapeshifter here,

303
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:12,736
so we're gonna need you to stand down

304
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:15,072
and let us our job and bag it for you.

305
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,447
Your job, son, is to bring the creatures

306
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,510
back to the Bureau alive.

307
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:22,209
Not leave their insides
strewn through history.

308
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:24,381
It's called payback for
what they did to Sara,

309
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:26,650
and don't get in our way.

310
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:29,920
Sharpie? What happened to you?

311
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,970
I'm allowed to grieve in my own way.

312
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:33,524
Why the hell are you out of your cell?

313
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,218
Well, plans change, luv.

314
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:37,424
Are you sure you're
okay, Director Sharpe?

315
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,062
I'm fine!

316
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:41,098
I'm just taking some time
to get my head together

317
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,401
after Sara was unicorned.

318
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,304
I'm really sorry about that.

319
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:49,239
Things are not as they seem.

320
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,908
- Amaya?
- No.

321
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,043
Well, it's a long story, but time is...

322
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:54,778
Well, broken.

323
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,146
What are you talking about?

324
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:57,681
Well, you see, you're
living in a timeline

325
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,516
that doesn't exist, and
we are from a timeline

326
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:01,469
where your hair is still blonde.

327
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:03,538
Okay, I don't have time
for this timey-wimey crap.

328
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,055
No, no, this is the truth.

329
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:06,957
Now, listen. The
Custodians of the Chronology

330
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,535
are actually the Legends of Tomorrow

331
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:10,304
and they're the good guys, mostly.

332
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:13,230
Yeah, and the kicker is
Sara is supposed to be alive.

333
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,166
Did you say Sara's alive?

334
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:16,322
Yeah.

335
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:17,707
I knew it!

336
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,036
I knew something was wrong.

337
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:20,604
I mean, I like the Indigo Girls,

338
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,339
but they should not be a way of life.

339
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:25,008
Then let's help them set things right.

340
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,311
What do you guys need from me?

341
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:35,720
Well, well, well, look who's
helping our magical fugitive.

342
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:37,087
Take position.

343
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,317
We were looking for you.

344
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,990
Got eyes on suspects.

345
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:42,626
Thought you might want to have some fun.

346
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:45,660
I got 12 gauges of fun right here.

347
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,896
That's it.

348
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,832
I'm placing you all under arrest.

349
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:51,036
Shut your mouth, pops.

350
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,772
Go!

351
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:55,138
Take cover!

352
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,807
Get 'em out of here!

353
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:19,329
I'll cover you. Go save Sara.

354
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,608
Did they really all
just kill each other?

355
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,968
Don't think about it.

356
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:40,917
And we'll go back in
time and we'll fix things.

357
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,120
We have to.

358
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,422
Target ahead.

359
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:50,027
Arming the weapons now.

360
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,629
Is that what I think it is?

361
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:54,564
Twilight Sparkle come to life.

362
00:16:57,002 --> 00:17:00,737
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

363
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,607
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

364
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,377
- Yes!
- Nice shot!

365
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:15,752
Who the hell's in the jump ship?

366
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:17,988
Who cares? Mission accomplished.

367
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,824
And you guys thought
we needed Constantine.

368
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:23,994
Yeah, we saved Sara's life.
Now that should fix everything.

369
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:26,163
The Custodians should be
back to being the Legends,

370
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:29,963
and Zari should no longer be a cat.

371
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,902
All right, this might
be a crossed wired thing

372
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,171
in my brain, but that is still

373
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:34,627
a cat sitting there, isn't it?

374
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,605
Killing the unicorn
didn't solve the problem.

375
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:41,278
No, Zari, we're not
going back to New Orleans.

376
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,380
We need to find out what's
wrong with this timeline

377
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,681
and fix it.

378
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,316
All right, we go back to the Bureau,

379
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:48,314
figure out our next step.

380
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:51,988
Charlie, come on. Talk to me, luv.

381
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,458
What's happening? Is everything normal?

382
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,859
No.

383
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,595
In fact, things are
pretty far from normal.

384
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,437
No reason to panic. We still got this.

385
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,649
Right, we'll find out how the
boys died in this timeline,

386
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,028
then we'll go back and save them,

387
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,463
and hopefully when they return

388
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:17,055
they won't be magical
creature murderers.

389
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:20,001
Right, sounds so simple.

390
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:22,003
Hey, watch it.

391
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,484
Out of the way, suckers.

392
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,674
Make way for S.O.S.

393
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,343
What the hell is S.O.S.?

394
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,857
Good morning, Sirens.

395
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,592
Good morning, Hank.

396
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:19,360
Well, I hope you're
ready to go to work today

397
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:23,431
because we have one hell
of a case on our hands.

398
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,166
If anyone knows what
happened to the guys,

399
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,602
it'll be them. Hang tight on the ship.

400
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:30,039
Looks like I'm joining the S.O.S.

401
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:35,376
All right, ladies. Weapons check.

402
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:41,282
Way ahead of you, babe.

403
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:43,017
My pistol's hot and ready.

404
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,720
Hey, girls. Save some fun for me.

405
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:48,189
Amaya, what are you doing here?

406
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:50,458
We thought you went back to 1942.

407
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,594
I did, but then I heard
about your monster problem,

408
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:55,693
and, well, I couldn't stay away.

409
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,961
It's perfect timing.

410
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,474
We are up to our peaches
with magical creatures

411
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:03,204
and about to kick some ass.

412
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:05,673
I'm in.

413
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,979
Johnny, just be honest with me.

414
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,914
This thing between us, it isn't real.

415
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,882
It never was. It doesn't exist.

416
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:17,118
Get it together, John.

417
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,454
Come on. Get your head together.

418
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,424
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

419
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,059
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,828
You want me to put things
back the way they were,

421
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,922
but that's not gonna bloody happen.

422
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,632
No, I'm not all right to be honest.

423
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:35,737
So what kind of fun costumes

424
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,472
are we gonna need for this mission?

425
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:39,007
We don't do costumes anymore.

426
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,175
Yeah, we stopped so we
could streamline missions.

427
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:42,910
Yeah, why get all dressed
up if we're just wasting

428
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,712
these magical creatures straight away.

429
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,414
I mean, please tell me you don't keep

430
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,977
a trophy room of their skulls.

431
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:54,422
What do we look like? Barbarians?

432
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:57,396
- No, we just toss them.
- You what?

433
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,599
Yeah, ever since that
Fairy Godmother killed

434
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,796
Nate, Ray, and Rory we just waste

435
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:03,631
any magical creature
that comes in our path.

436
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:04,899
No questions asked.

437
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,934
Well, they can't all be bad.

438
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,070
We haven't met a good one.

439
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,506
Hey, how is Zambesi?

440
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:12,740
Hmm? Who?

441
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:16,544
Zambesi. Where you're from.

442
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:17,678
It's great.

443
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,780
Yeah, it's, like, chill.

444
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,282
Super chill.

445
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:28,156
If I do what you ask,

446
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:31,092
I'd be sending Desmond to hell.

447
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,366
Yeah, I know, maybe I
deserve this insanity.

448
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:39,934
Oh, you're all soft.

449
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:42,521
Oy, wake up, losers.
I know how to fix it.

450
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:45,273
Right, we got to take care of
the Fairy Godmother in Salem.

451
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,560
Fire up the ship. I'm
heading up there now.

452
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:49,644
Cor blimey.

453
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:54,036
No more tea and crumpets
for this dodgy doppelganger.

454
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,352
Hard Drive here knew you
weren't really Amaya all along.

455
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:01,089
I'm equipped to detect
shapeshifter pheromones.

456
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:04,926
How fortunate our white
whale swam right into our net.

457
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:08,329
What is with you guys and white whales?

458
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:10,565
Oh, you really think
you three can take me?

459
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,701
Oh, I can take you alone.

460
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:18,606
Damn it. Get back here!

461
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:21,781
Oh, hey. How were the
Sirens in Space-Time?

462
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:23,450
Well, they're not the Custodians.

463
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:25,746
They may actually be worse.

464
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:27,735
Now, let's go save the lads.

465
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:35,256
The three of you have been so
rude with your nasty attitude.

466
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:37,719
♪ It will be ever so sublime ♪

467
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:40,895
♪ To slowly choke you up with vines ♪

468
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:42,497
Whatever you're gonna do, Charlie,

469
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:44,799
you better make it fast.

470
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:45,967
I got this.

471
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,902
♪ A peach or a cherry ♪

472
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:52,840
♪ Any good thing to make us so merry ♪

473
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:54,475
Prudence.

474
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:56,844
Fairy Godmother, are you finished?

475
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:57,906
That was fast.

476
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,480
Yes, and I was thinking,

477
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,693
if I'm to be your Fairy Godmother,

478
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:05,820
you must start behaving
like a proper young lady.

479
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,221
How do you mean?

480
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,724
Oh, nothing dreadful
or out of the ordinary.

481
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:13,703
Just chores, daily baths,

482
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:16,030
church service each morning,

483
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:20,168
and you must start eating broccoli.

484
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,036
But I don't want all that.

485
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,306
Well, until our bond is severed,

486
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:28,309
I'm afraid that's the way it must be.

487
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:32,880
Now, eat the broccoli.

488
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:36,851
Fairy Godmother, I relinquish you.

489
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:39,253

00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:57,205
Oh, fiddlesticks.

494
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:05,313
You know, I hate to jinx us,

495
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:07,505
but I really think we
nailed it this time.

496
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,251
I just hope you guys are right.

497
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:13,446
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

498
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:17,104
There something on my nose?

499
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,707
Bollocks.

500
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,737
- Anything yet?
- Don't rush me, luv.

501
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,712
Who knows what surprises
wait for us in here.

502
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,977
Looks like there's
reptilians in the Renaissance.

503
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,909
Sounds like a team meeting.

504
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:29,574
I'll just pop in and say hello, shall I?

505
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:31,509
So put on your period-appropriate boots

506
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,615
because we are going lizard stomping.

507
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:36,284
Oh, hey, everybody, look.

508
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,719

Welcome to "DC's Puppets of Tomorrow."

522
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:15,337
"Fraggle Rock" is going on here?

523
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,694
Well, today we learned about
the importance of cooperating.

524
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,729
And about the number three.

525
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:25,199
And about a famous man
from history named Napoleon.

526
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,567
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

527
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,202
I think I need a drink.

528
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,938

No more singing.

534
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:43,651
Just tell me, why are you puppets?

535
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:47,094
Because Rory called us a
bunch of Time Bureau puppets.

536
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:50,291
Yeah, and then he ran off
with his new partner in crime.

537
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:06,423
So did you figure out how
I turned into a damn puppet?

538
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:07,975
Yeah, it's worse than I thought.

539
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:09,176
After we managed to separate

540
00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:10,344
the Fairy Godmother from Prudence,

541
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:13,214
she somehow glommed onto Rory.

542
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,173
You can probably figure out the rest.

543
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:17,685
Well, we're just gonna have
to keep fixing what's broken

544
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,587
- until we get it right.
- Yeah.

545
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,133
Damn it.

546
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,176
Nope.

547
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,129
Hmm.

548
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:56,573
No plaques.

549
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,899
No plaques. No plaques.

550
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:08,502
We did it. I'm shocked to bits.

551
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,938
Everyone's alive, Zari's human again,

552
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,306
and I still have my powers.

553
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,555
Ah, that's smashing news, luv.

554
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:16,710
Yeah. I mean, sure,
it's got a few cracks,

555
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:18,079
but fixed the timeline.

556
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:20,481
- See that, Zari.
- John, are you okay?

557
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:23,451
Yeah, yeah, it's... Never better.

558
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:30,791
John. John.

559
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:33,477
What happened?

560
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,795
Passed out, mate.

561
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,180
He didn't just pass out.

562
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:37,415
His brain can't handle

563
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:39,733
this wad of bandages
you call a timeline.

564
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:41,402
I can take the pain, luv.

565
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:42,837
What if you can't?

566
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,971
What if you die, John?

567
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:45,139
What happens to all the people

568
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:47,775
who need you alive and Constantine-y?

569
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:49,376
Yeah, well, you can leave
that to the real heroes,

570
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:52,780
all right, because
I'm done giving a damn.

571
00:27:52,782 --> 00:27:55,235
Oh, I see.

572
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:58,048
This is isn't about
saving Desmond anymore.

573
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,488
It's an excuse for you
to give up on yourself.

574
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,289
Whoa, whoa, whoa, just
leave him alone, will you?

575
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:05,326
You think because there's no
plaques the world is fixed?

576
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:07,661
I promise you, it's just
as messed up out there

577
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:09,029
as it is in John's brain.

578
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,576
I know you don't want
to send Desmond to hell,

579
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,813
but that doesn't have to
be the end of the story.

580
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:20,374
You of all people can find a
way to keep fighting for him.

581
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:24,044
Go to New Orleans and set things right.

582
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:25,546
Don't listen to her.

583
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:27,438
Come on, John. It's you and me.

584
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:29,383
We can make this timeline work.

585
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:31,185
No, Charlie.

586
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,053
We've tried over, and over, and over

587
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:36,390
to get what we wanted
and it hasn't worked.

588
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,058
Zari's right.

589
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,327
There's still hope for Desmond,

590
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:43,330
and maybe there's still
hope for your powers too.

591
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:45,499
Hope?

592
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:47,000
My powers aren't some magic trick.

593
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:48,369
They're who I am.

594
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:49,537
I'm not gonna just sit around

595
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,705
and hope that they come back.

596
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:53,107
I'll fight for them.

597
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:04,084
This ain't over.

598
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:06,066
Not by a long shot.

599
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,855
Ava, I wasn't expecting to see you here.

600
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:13,458
Yeah, the Bureau got an emergency alert

601
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,727
about a magical presence
in New Orleans, 2018.

602
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,165
I thought maybe we could
check it out together.

603
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,600
Let's get to work.

604
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:21,168
Cool.

605
00:29:45,758 --> 00:29:48,492
Jeez.

606
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,396
I didn't live this specific
moment, but I remember it.

607
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:53,477
It's all part of jumbled, bloody memory.

608
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,747
By the way, only about
10% of what you're saying

609
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,101
makes any sense, but
by all means continue.

610
00:29:58,104 --> 00:30:00,889
Right, so the earliest me
just left for the market.

611
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:03,318
The other one is upstairs
breaking up with Dez right now,

612
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:07,412
and when Dez leaves upset, I stop him.

613
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:08,780
Put things back to normal.

614
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:09,974
All right, good luck.

615
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,756
Blimey, that's a lot of ammo.

616
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,039
- Blimey?
- Huh?

617
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,193
Oh, I meant wow.

618
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,341
All right, boys, orders
are shoot to kill.

619
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:26,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

620
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:27,944
Shouldn't we discuss
what kind of creature

621
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:29,033
we're dealing with here?

622
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,702
We can't just go in guns a-blazing.

623
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,789
What if whatever's causing
this is just a little misguided?

624
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,182
It's a magical fugitive.

625
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:37,119
We kill those.

626
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:39,455
You two head out. Stay on the comms.

627
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,943
I killed the man I loved, and for what?

628
00:30:44,946 --> 00:30:46,805
To buy New Orleans a little more time?

629
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:48,107
Neron needs souls...

630
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,487
Okay, right, I think... I think that

631
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,946
something should be landing
right here any second now.

632
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:56,346
I work alone.

633
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,099
Got it.

634
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,767
All right, Gideon,
what are we looking at?

635
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:04,969
I've located multiple
targets on the ground

636
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:07,138
each one with a substantial
magical signature.

637
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,485
Do we have a visual yet?

638
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,021
Coming up now.

639
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:11,808
Wait, that's John Constantine,

640
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,511
and there's more than one of him.

641
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,947
Looks like our shapeshifter
has a shapeshifter friend.

642
00:31:15,949 --> 00:31:17,056
Wait a second, how do you know that

643
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,680
that's not really Constantine out there?

644
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:20,051
Because it's John Constantine.

645
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,235
He doesn't time travel.

646
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:22,711
Believe me. I tried to recruit him.

647
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,415
Okay, so why don't we
capture all three of them

648
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,324
so we can find out if any
of them are the real John?

649
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:29,761
What is wrong with
you? You feeling okay?

650
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,765
I'm fine. I'm just a firm
believer in taking precautions.

651
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,534
Precautions. Good one.

652
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:39,204
Ray, Rory, what's your status?

653
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:40,840
All right, we're in position,

654
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:42,852
with our sights on the shapeshifter.

655
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:44,172
When do we get to shoot?

656
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:46,909
All right, on my mark, open fire.

657
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:49,079
Sara, don't.

658
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:51,782
Damn it, Ava, why not?

659
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,625
'Cause I'm the shapeshifter.

660
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:58,389
Guys, stand down, we have
a code blue on the ship.

661
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:00,227
What the hell's a code blue?

662
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,330
Just don't shoot yet.

663
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,028
There's something going on in your life.

664
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,368
Just be honest with me.

665
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,171
Yeah, do you know what?
This thing between us?

666
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,579
It isn't real. It never was.

667
00:32:08,582 --> 00:32:10,657
It doesn't exist.

668
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,036
You should go.

669
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,307
Yeah, you're right. I should.

670
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,500
But this, this was real, Johnny.

671
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:33,094
Hey, you... you dropped this.

672
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,641
My phone.

673
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:37,372
How did you get down here?
You were just upstairs.

674
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,763
Yeah, never mind about that right now.

675
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:41,149
I have something really
important to tell you.

676
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:42,165
You know what? I think you've said

677
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,432
quite enough today already...

678
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:45,769
No, no, Dez, please.

679
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:47,839
Give me a minute, all right?

680
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,142
So you're the shapeshifter.

681
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:52,042
Why do you look like Amaya?

682
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:56,180
It is complicated, but
this is how you know me.

683
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,916
What's happened to the
Legends to make you like this?

684
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:00,313
What do you mean?

685
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:03,450
You guys are so intent on
killing magical creatures.

686
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:06,321
Can't you see that this is wrong?

687
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:11,448
Not really.

688
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,023
Look, now I know this sounds crazy,

689
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:18,527
but the me that you were
just speaking to upstairs

690
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,464
is my past.

691
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,501
So you break up with me out of the blue,

692
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,375
act like a total ass, and suddenly

693
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:28,844
that's in the past, just like that?

694
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:32,495
Listen, literally, that
is me from ages ago,

695
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:34,366
but the person who's standing
in front of you right now

696
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:37,221
is a little bit older and
he's a little bit wiser.

697
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,790
Sure. Still playing games, clearly.

698
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,392
Look.

699
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,394
I thought this was real.

700
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,188
Yeah, it is real, Dez, and that's why

701
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,844
I moved heaven and earth
so that I could save you

702
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:50,555
from a lifetime and eternity of anguish,

703
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,293
anguish that I caused.

704
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,063
Look...

705
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:58,141
I guess what I'm trying to say is

706
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:00,594
I'm sorry you ever even met me.

707
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:07,082
Don't be sorry.

708
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:09,819
Only a fool would fall in
love in John Constantine

709
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:13,090
and not expect it to be rocky.

710
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,393
I knew the risks

711
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:19,298
and I took 'em anyway for you.

712
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,008
I'm still pissed at you.

713
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,766
Why can't we just go back
to the ways things were?

714
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,344
That's exactly what I was thinking.

715
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:32,477
What is that?

716
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,380
Know one thing, Desmond.

717
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:37,217
I'm not quitting on you.

718
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,133
Sara, crazy-looking Constantine

719
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:48,563
just memory-flashed a civilian.

720
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:49,599
Can we shoot him yet?

721
00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:50,711
Wait for my signal.

722
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,368
I'm dealing with a
situation on the ship.

723
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:55,289
Constantine might be...

724
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:58,039
Sara? Sara?

725
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:00,108
Hold on a second, Ray.

726
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:02,178
Where did you get that?

727
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,118
Look, I don't know who you are,

728
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:06,543
or why you are on my ship,

729
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:08,360
but you're never leaving.

730
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,976
Oh, hello, handsome.

731
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,693
What are you doing standing
in the middle of the street?

732
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:21,092
I was...

733
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:23,460
You... you went to the market.

734
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:24,962
I did.

735
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:27,098
Next thing I know I was
standing in the street.

736
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,767
I don't know.

737
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:32,336
Wait, Sara, please.

738
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,926
Just tell me why

739
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:36,964
you're so intent on
killing magical creatures.

740
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,367
Because that's how we stay alive.

741
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:45,415
Stop doing that!

742
00:35:45,418 --> 00:35:47,818
- Don't you remember London?
- No.

743
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,164
When you and I first met

744
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,821
and I helped you see the
truth about magical creatures.

745
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:53,757
And how did you do that?

746
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,159
By being me?

747
00:35:55,162 --> 00:35:57,661
By showing you that I'm
not here to hurt humans.

748
00:35:57,664 --> 00:36:00,097
That not all monsters
need to be put down.

749
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,594
That's cute, but never happened.

750
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,996
What...

751
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,563
How can you not remember?

752
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:07,805
Bollocks.

753
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,610
Because of Constantine,
you and I never met

754
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:13,248
and you never changed.

755
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:14,650
I'm the missing ingredient

756
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:17,020
in every one of these botched timelines.

757
00:36:18,705 --> 00:36:20,137
I'm sorry,

758
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,985
but all I see is a threat
that needs to be taken out.

759
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:26,156
Ray, fire when ready.

760
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,458
- You got eggs.
- I got the eggs.

761
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:30,394
I got the bread. Got everything we need.

762
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,562
Soufflé?

763
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,477
Soufflé, but first things first, eh.

764
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:39,396
You need to be a part of the team.

765
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:41,866
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

766
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:44,168
- No!
- I know who's coming for you.

767
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,003
But choosing a life of magic,

768
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:47,641
it never leads to a happy ending.

769
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:49,607
That's the thing about time travel,

770
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:52,243
there's always a way.

771
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:53,977
I'm sorry, Dez.

772
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,442
John, you okay?

773
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:06,678
Yeah, well,

774
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,647
my mind is no longer split in two,

775
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:13,352
but can't say the same
about my heart though.

776
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:14,787
You?

777
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:18,061
Well, lost my powers.
Back to being mortal.

778
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:21,260
Sorry, guys. It had to be done.

779
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:24,147
Well, let's go on and
find the Legends, shall we?

780
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,964
Yeah, see if all this was worth it.

781
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:27,199
Yeah.

782
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:39,170
Well, everything seems
pretty normal so far.

783
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:42,092
This isn't over, you dingalings.

784
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:45,100
You better watch your knees, Sara Lance.

785
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:47,990
Oh, no, is everyone a puppet again?

786
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,129
What?

787
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:51,131
- What are you talking about?
- I'll kill you all!

788
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:54,084
I got an anti-magic isolation chamber

789
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,053
with your name on it, Mike the Spike.

790
00:38:56,056 --> 00:39:00,532
Ah, the usual insanity that
passes for normal around here.

791
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:02,367
What is this?

792
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:05,471
Why are you being so weird?

793
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,306
Well, I...

794
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:09,724
I do have a little bit of a
tale to tell, to be honest.

795
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:10,993
You fancy a drink?

796
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:13,227
Hmm, one of those stories.

797
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,548
Let's go.

798
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:21,019
Hey, Zari, I wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

799
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:22,819
For what? For stuffing me into a bag

800
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,555
or almost destroying all of history?

801
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:27,059
Well, yeah, that too, but
what I'm really sorry about

802
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:29,728
is that we got off on the wrong foot.

803
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,063
You're a shapeshifter.

804
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,597
Your whole deal is tricking people.

805
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,499
Yeah, but now I'm being honest with you.

806
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:35,801
You know, I could have been anyone

807
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:37,336
when I got my powers back.

808
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,438
Do you know why I kept
coming back to this form?

809
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,061
Because Amaya is very hot?

810
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:42,530
It's because this is the form I was

811
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:43,899
when I joined the Legends.

812
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:46,244
Now, I have been a part of many crews,

813
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:47,446
and you guys...

814
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:50,615
Well, you're not rubbish.

815
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:54,353
Listen, destroying
history for personal gain,

816
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:57,522
it's happened to almost everyone here.

817
00:39:57,524 --> 00:40:00,559
Rite of passage.

818
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:02,828
So you think I'm hot then?

819
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:12,436
I made snicker doodles with your recipe.

820
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:14,106
Not bad.

821
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:15,474
Hmm.

822
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:18,227
I'm reading your novel.
I'm on the last chapter.

823
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,246
Your females characters
are shallow, libidinous,

824
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,715
and so much fun to read.

825
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:25,016
Hmm. Thanks.

826
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:29,254
Yeah, good job, um, Rebecca Silver?

827
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:30,756
Nom de plume.

828
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:32,190
Got it.

829
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:34,079
So let me get this straight.

830
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:36,628
They're making love on
the surface of the sun?

831
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,631
It's a metaphor.

832
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:40,966
Got it.

833
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:43,535
And the worst part?

834
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,806
It didn't even make a bloody difference.

835
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,041
I was a fool thinking I
could outrun this fight

836
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:52,177
flying around with you lot.

837
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:56,214
Yeah, we tend to fly
directly into fights.

838
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:59,684
But we do it together,

839
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:02,254
and we have your back.

840
00:41:02,256 --> 00:41:03,588
Well, as long as you know

841
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,757
what you're getting yourself into

842
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:09,261
because a demon like Neron,
he doesn't just want to win.

843
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:13,733
He wants to win in the
cruelest possible way.

844
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,705
Yeah?

845
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:23,308
The Kaupe escaped?

846
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,843
Here's what I want you to do.

847
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:28,346
Track him down and
recapture him, or else.

848
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:35,086
Um, there's been a setback,
but we'll make it right.

849
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:40,281
Oh, you'd better.

850
00:41:40,284 --> 00:41:45,109
