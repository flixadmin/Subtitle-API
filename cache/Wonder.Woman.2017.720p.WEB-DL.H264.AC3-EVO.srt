1
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,068
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

2
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:51,836
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:55,667
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:00,263
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,827
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,432
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

7
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,226
<i>...the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,882
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:23,971
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:31,141
<i>What one does when faced with the truth..
is more difficult than you think.</i>

11
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,187
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

12
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,276
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,201
<i>And now...</i>

14
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,702
<i>...I will never be the same.</i>

15
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,836
Yeah.. Si.

16
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:51,170
Hello, Diana.

17
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,101
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

18
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:54,997
<i>Diana!</i>

19
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:57,433
Diana!

20
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,045
Come back!

21
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,438
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

22
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,488
How is she?

23
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:42,783
She's good.

24
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,292
- Keep working.
- I will.

25
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:47,322
Niobi.

26
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:09,934
Diana!

27
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,042
Diana, I see you.

28
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:21,534
Where are you going?
Slow down!

29
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:33,642
Hello mother.

30
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,744
How are you today?

31
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,864
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

32
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:43,451
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

33
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:45,910
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

34
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:47,976
Does she?

35
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,179
I could begin showing
her some things.

36
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,145
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

37
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:56,485
From whom?

38
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,567
In the event of an invasion.

39
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:02,069
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

40
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,572
...leading an entire army,
General?

41
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:08,737
I pray there will never come
when she has to fight.

42
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:12,012
But you know,
a scorpion must sting...

43
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,696
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

44
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,285
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

45
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,331
But, mother...

46
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,729
There will be no training.

47
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,977
What if I promise to be careful?

48
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:31,809
It's time to sleep.

49
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,806
What if I didn't use a sword?

50
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,708
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

51
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,633
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

52
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,904
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

53
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:50,798
I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.

54
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,564
...and begged Zeus
to give you life.

55
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,398
You've told me this story.

56
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,514
Which is why.. tonight
I'll tell you a new one.

57
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:03,326
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

58
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:04,386
Yes!

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,600
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

60
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:17,175
<i>Long ago, when time was new...</i>

61
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:20,805
<i>...and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

62
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,308
<i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i>

63
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,142
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

64
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:31,917
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

65
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,965
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

66
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,827
<i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

67
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:43,658
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

68
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:47,864
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

69
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:51,231
<i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

70
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,706
<i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i>

71
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:02,077
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

72
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:04,371
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

73
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:07,566
<i>...and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

74
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:12,682
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

75
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,331
<i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

76
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:18,030
<i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i>

77
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:24,155
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

78
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,479
<i>But it did not last.</i>

79
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:41,973
<i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i>

80
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:45,076
<i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

81
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:55,374
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

82
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,707
<i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i>

83
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,063
<i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

84
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,852
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

85
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:13,397
<i>...striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i>

86
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:15,794
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

87
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,133
<i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

88
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,069
<i>An endless war...</i>

89
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,658
<i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

90
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,226
<i>...and us with them.</i>

91
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i>

92
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,227
<i>...One powerful enough
to kill a god.</i>

93
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:40,447
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island...</i>

94
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,621
<i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i>

95
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:45,244
<i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

96
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,025
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

97
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:03,883
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

98
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,311
And the God Killer?

99
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,114
The God Killer?

100
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,830
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

101
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:18,154
Can I see it?

102
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:30,144
The Gods gave us many gifts.

103
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,345
One day, you'll know them all.

104
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,860
This great tower..
is where we keep them.

105
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,522
The God Killer.

106
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,769
It's beautiful.

107
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:57,727
Who would wield it?

108
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:02,881
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

109
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:06,571
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

110
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:08,983
And that's not you, Diana.

111
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,186
You see?
You are safe...

112
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:15,608
...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

113
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:30,581
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

114
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:33,010
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

115
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:34,666
No, I don't.

116
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:43,351
You arestronger than you believe.
You have greater powers than you know.

117
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,661
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

118
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:58,504
Are you hurt?

119
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,013
No, Mother, I'm fine.

120
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:01,907
- I was just...
- Training.

121
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,829
Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

122
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,349
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

123
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,700
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

124
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:11,962
Take her to the palace.

125
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,250
Off you go.

126
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,615
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

127
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:29,951
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

128
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,288
You speak of a time
that may never come.

129
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:38,394
He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.

130
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:41,306
Ares is alive.

131
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:45,011
You feel it as I do,
in your bones.

132
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,090
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

133
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:55,892
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.

134
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,781
Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.

135
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:03,327
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

136
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:17,724
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

137
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,137
Five times harder...

138
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:22,519
...ten times harder.

139
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,622
Until she's better
than even you.

140
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,025
But she must never
know the truth...

141
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,682
about what she is...

142
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:32,430
...or how she came to be.

143
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,086
Harder.

144
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:30,244
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

145
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,286
Again.

146
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,115
Never let your guard down.

147
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,952
You expect the battle to be fair.

148
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,714
A battle will never be fair.

149
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:10,734
Anti­ope!

150
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,649
Lay still..

151
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,176
You're bleeding.

152
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:18,678
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

153
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,151
What had I done?

154
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:29,425
I'm sorry.

155
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,696
Where did this fog come from?

156
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:09,317
There...
Go forward.

157
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,150
<i>There he is!</i>

158
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,882
<i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i>

159
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,902
Wow.

160
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,210
You are a man.

161
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,427
Yeah. I mean...

162
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,117
Do I not look like one?

163
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,853
Where are we?

164
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,845
Temiscira.

165
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:25,977
What?

166
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,552
Who are you?

167
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:38,542
I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.

168
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:39,748
What?

169
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,704
The German.
Come on, we need to get out of here.

170
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,651
- The Germans?
- Diana!

171
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:46,417
Step away from her.. now!

172
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,498
Ready your bows!

173
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:54,911
They have guns.
Right?

174
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:58,797
Fire!

175
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,137
Come on!

176
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,961
Stay down!

177
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:19,671
Shield!

178
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,434
No!

179
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:43,542
No!

180
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,311
No.

181
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:54,321
No. No.. Antiope.

182
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,074
Anti­ope, hey.

183
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:01,919
Diana.

184
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:05,605
- The time has come.
- No.

185
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,544
You... you must...

186
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:11,840
What?
What, Anti­ope?

187
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:17,077
God Killer!

188
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,807
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

189
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:21,795
- Where?
- Go...

190
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,224
No, please no.
No, no!

191
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,610
- No!
- Anti­ope!

192
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,575
No!

193
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:41,425
- You.
- No..

194
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:43,855
No mother no.

195
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,398
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

196
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,835
What man fights against
his own people?

197
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:48,753
These aren't my people.

198
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:51,088
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

199
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:54,146
I can't tell you that.

200
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:55,523
You need to tell us now!

201
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:56,514
What's your name?

202
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,276
I can't tell you that either.

203
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:03,124
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

204
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,451
If he dies...

205
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,001
...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

206
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,005
My...

207
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,185
Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

208
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,573
Serial number 8141921.

209
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:36,535
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

210
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:40,046
What the hell is this thing?

211
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:43,048
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

212
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:44,945
But it's really hot.

213
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,951
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

214
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,297
What is your mission?

215
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:54,160
Whoever you are, you are in more danger
than you think.

216
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,700
What is your mission?

217
00:23:58,829 --> 00:23:59,830
I am a...

218
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:05,529
I am a...

219
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,540
I'm a spy.

220
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,984
I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.

221
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:20,198
<i>British Intelligence got word...</i>

222
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:22,993
<i>...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.</i>

223
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,043
<i>...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i>

224
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,142
<i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i>

225
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,961
<i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i>

226
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,806
<i>...no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i>

227
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:41,570
<i>But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for 'em.</i>

228
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,913
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

229
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,522
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

230
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:52,265
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.</i>

231
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:56,602
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i>

232
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:59,014
<i>And for good reason.</i>

233
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:31,605
<i>From what I could tell if Dr Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

234
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:35,026
<i>...millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

235
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,188
<i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i>

236
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:40,434
<i>...but, I had
to do something.</i>

237
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,173
Which is.. I need more time.

238
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:53,945
Unfortunately,
Dr. we don't have more time.

239
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:56,435
This work, this...

240
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:03,688
Get that man!

241
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:04,777
Now!

242
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,516
But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

243
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:05,335
...it could stop
millions more from dying.

244
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:07,727
It could stop the war.

245
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,023
War? What war?

246
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:13,728
The War.

247
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,101
The war to end the all wars.

248
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,010
Four years...

249
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,879
27 countries...
25 million dead.

250
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:29,199
...Soldiers and civilians.

251
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,757
Innocent people...

252
00:27:32,437 --> 00:27:34,671
...Women and
children slaughtered.

253
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:39,258
Their homes and thier villages
looted & burned.

254
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,501
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

255
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,442
...ever imagine.

256
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:56,916
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

257
00:27:57,947 --> 00:28:00,054
It's like the world's gonna end.

258
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,173
Should we let him go?

259
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,277
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

260
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:08,350
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

261
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,322
Mother, excuse me...

262
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:14,605
...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

263
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,928
What are you talking
about, child?

264
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:19,400
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

265
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:22,148
Millions of people already dead.

266
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,789
Like nothing he's ever seen.

267
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:26,728
Only Ares could do such a thing.

268
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:32,022
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

269
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,553
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

270
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,412
...to go and fight their war.

271
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,332
It's not their war.

272
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:41,586
Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...

273
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:44,002
That was a story, Diana!

274
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:45,688
This much, you
do not understand?

275
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:46,690
Men are easily corrupted.

276
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,225
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

277
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:53,037
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

278
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,809
And stopping the God of war
is our fore ordinance.

279
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:59,718
As Amazons this is our duty.

280
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,174
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

281
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,110
So you will do nothing.

282
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:07,278
As your queen I forbid it.

283
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:21,564
Strange.

284
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:25,085
Is it true you saved his life?

285
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:26,792
Who told you that?

286
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,142
He did.

287
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,635
Ah.. I didn't see you come in.

288
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:04,496
Would you say you are a...

289
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,157
...a typical example
of your sex?

290
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,678
I am...

291
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,943
...above average.

292
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,916
What's that?

293
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,216
It's a...

294
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,324
Oh...

295
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,207
It's a watch.

296
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,030
A watch?

297
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,402
Yeah, it's a watch.

298
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,037
Tells time.

299
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:37,575
My father gave it to me.

300
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,769
Went through hell 'n back with him.

301
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:45,133
Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..

302
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,255
What for?

303
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:50,797
Because it tells time.

304
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,677
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

305
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,177
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

306
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:00,943
Yeah...

307
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:08,849
Can I ask you some questions?

308
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:12,092
- Where are we?
- Temiscira.

309
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:15,873
No, I got that before, but I mean..
Where are we?

310
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:18,769
What is this place?
Who are you people?

311
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:21,077
Why does the water do that?

312
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:23,539
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?

313
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,512
We speak hundreds of languages.

314
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,777
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

315
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,231
Right.

316
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:39,412
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this...

317
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:45,074
...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

318
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:47,884
Thank you...

319
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:50,813
...for what you
did on the beach.

320
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:59,790
So...

321
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,611
...you are here to let me go?

322
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,479
I tried, but it's not up to me.

323
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,865
I even asked them to
send me with you..

324
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:13,857
Or anyone.

325
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:15,219
In Amazon..

326
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,270
The Amazons.

327
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:18,480
The Amazons?

328
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:21,381
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

329
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:24,263
And I wish to go..

330
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,092
But my mother will not allow it.

331
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:32,566
Well...

332
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:35,454
I can't say I blame her.

333
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,656
The way this war's going...

334
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:40,157
...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

335
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:42,618
Then why do you want to go back?

336
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:45,265
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

337
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,620
I guess I gotta try.

338
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:54,223
My father told me
once he said...

339
00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:56,096
" If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

340
00:32:56,316 --> 00:32:58,919
"... you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

341
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:02,593
And I already tried nothing.

342
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:42,753
Nice outfit.

343
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:44,626
Oh, thank you.

344
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,475
Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...

345
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:50,805
...and you'll take me to Ares.

346
00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:52,906
Deal.

347
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:03,089
I am leaving on that?

348
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:04,596
We are..

349
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,967
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

350
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,569
Do you not know how to sail?

351
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,028
Of course I know how to sail.

352
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:13,018
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

353
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:15,488
It's been a while.

354
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,085
I am going, mother.

355
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:50,082
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

356
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,471
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

357
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:58,502
I have to go.

358
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,001
I know.

359
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:03,778
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

360
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:11,103
There is so much...

361
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,180
So much you do not understand.

362
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:14,402
I understand enough.

363
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:18,749
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

364
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:23,030
Like you once did.

365
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,638
You know that if you
choose to leave...

366
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,856
...you may never return.

367
00:37:30,444 --> 00:37:32,628
Who will I be if I stay?

368
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:44,557
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

369
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,057
...our beloved Anti­ope.

370
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,591
Make sure you're worthy of it.

371
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,751
I will.

372
00:37:55,893 --> 00:37:58,222
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

373
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,332
They do not deserve you.

374
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:09,719
You have been my greatest love.

375
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,164
Today...

376
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,845
...you are my greatest sorrow.

377
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,616
Should you have told her?

378
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:04,832
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

379
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,190
How long until we reach the war?

380
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,525
The war, which part?

381
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,361
The Western Front in France is...

382
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,764
...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

383
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,305
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

384
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,359
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

385
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,315
Ares as in..
the God of War?

386
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,416
The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

387
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:45,328
With this.

388
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,083
And once I do...

389
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,244
...the war will end.

390
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:59,532
Look. I appreciate your spirit...

391
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:01,471
...but this war is...

392
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:04,483
It's a great big mess.

393
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:07,882
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

394
00:40:07,915 --> 00:40:10,750
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

395
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:12,829
I'm the man who can!

396
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:15,049
Once I find and destroy Ares...

397
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,926
...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

398
00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:20,512
...they will good men again
and the world will be better.

399
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:26,143
Great.

400
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:27,880
You will see.

401
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:32,267
What are you doing?

402
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:35,411
I thought maybe you wanna...

403
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,615
...get some sleep.

404
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:43,486
What about you?
Are you not sleeping?

405
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:45,579
Does the average men not sleep?

406
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:52,626
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

407
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:53,913
You don't sleep with women?

408
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,976
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

409
00:40:58,413 --> 00:40:59,769
Yes, I do..

410
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,406
But out of the...

411
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:05,520
...confines of marriage.

412
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:11,079
Not polite to assume, you know?

413
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,427
"Marriage"?

414
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:18,312
Weird! You don't have that...

415
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,961
You go before a judge...

416
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:25,768
...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

417
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:26,970
...Until death do you apart.

418
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:29,792
And do they.. love
each other till death?

419
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,909
Not very often, no.

420
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:33,361
Then why do they do it?

421
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:35,967
I have no idea.

422
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:39,794
So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you..

423
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:41,621
I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

424
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:42,721
There is plenty of room.

425
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,313
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

426
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:48,148
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

427
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,358
Okay.

428
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:15,563
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

429
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:18,919
You know, um..
being a spy...

430
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:22,292
You have to show a
certain amount of...

431
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,141
...vigor.

432
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,808
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

433
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,657
I have no father.

434
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:35,952
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

435
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:38,368
...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

436
00:42:41,497 --> 00:42:42,792
Well that's neat.

437
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,505
Sorry.

438
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:51,997
Where I come from..

439
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:55,611
...babies are made differently.

440
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:58,508
You refer to
reproductive biology.

441
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,226
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

442
00:43:01,095 --> 00:43:02,539
I know all about that.

443
00:43:02,795 --> 00:43:05,626
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

444
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:07,855
The pleasures of the flesh.

445
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,308
Do you know about that?

446
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:17,596
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures

447
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,661
12 huh?

448
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,298
Did you bring any
of those with you?

449
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,068
You would not enjoy them.

450
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:30,503
I don't know.
May be.

451
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,724
No you wouldn't.

452
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:32,990
Why not?

453
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:36,630
They came to the conclusion that man
are essential for procreation...

454
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,655
...but when it comes
to pleasure...

455
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:40,853
...Unnecessary.

456
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:42,024
No.

457
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,335
Goodnight.

458
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:03,854
How long until we're operational?

459
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:05,476
Two days, sir.

460
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,359
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

461
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:11,704
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

462
00:44:11,705 --> 00:44:13,866
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

463
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:16,345
Do you hear me making excuses?

464
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,101
No.

465
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:19,044
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

466
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:21,689
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

467
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,222
...from any cover!

468
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:24,774
So let's you & I remind them...

469
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:25,962
...Shall we?

470
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,416
- Doctor.
- General.

471
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:43,647
Progress?

472
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:45,076
Not enough.

473
00:44:45,888 --> 00:44:47,719
It is over, General.

474
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,804
Germany is giving up.

475
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:53,898
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

476
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:56,188
We have run out of time.

477
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,543
As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...

478
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,515
...he will not
sign the armistice.

479
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:03,703
But without my notebook...

480
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:05,288
We will get your book!

481
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,800
It is you that I believe in,
not it.

482
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:12,280
I know what you can
and will succeed...

483
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:17,357
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

484
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:24,338
Something, did come
to me last night.

485
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:26,563
A different type of gas.

486
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:28,698
For you.

487
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:31,149
To restore your strength.

488
00:46:01,262 --> 00:46:03,925
I have got it!
I have got it!

489
00:46:04,214 --> 00:46:07,178
And if it's what I think...

490
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,345
It's going to be...

491
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:13,362
...terrible.

492
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:35,929
Morning!

493
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:39,019
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

494
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,705
Welcome to Jolly old London!

495
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:43,633
It's hideous..

496
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,646
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

497
00:47:07,653 --> 00:47:09,270
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

498
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:10,524
Oh no!

499
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:13,014
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

500
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,839
Come on!

501
00:47:18,423 --> 00:47:19,956
Why are they holding hands?

502
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:23,079
Probably because
they're together.

503
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,465
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

504
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,751
This way.

505
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:30,852
To the war!

506
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:33,695
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.

507
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,196
And where are we going?

508
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:37,188
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

509
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:38,509
Hey! Hey..!

510
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,681
No. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.

511
00:47:41,947 --> 00:47:43,679
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

512
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,142
And a deal is a promise.

513
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:47,284
And a promise is unbreakable.

514
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:50,239
Oi, damn it, alright.

515
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:53,022
Come with me first
to deliver this...

516
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:54,879
...and then we'll
give you a ticket...

517
00:47:55,896 --> 00:47:56,897
...to the war.

518
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,181
Deal?

519
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:00,815
- Let's go.
- Diana...

520
00:48:01,024 --> 00:48:01,840
What are you doing?

521
00:48:01,888 --> 00:48:04,281
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

522
00:48:04,306 --> 00:48:07,517
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

523
00:48:07,805 --> 00:48:09,722
What do these women
wear into battle?

524
00:48:09,747 --> 00:48:11,099
They don't...

525
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:12,962
A baby!

526
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,458
No, no.. No babies.

527
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,341
One's not made out of clay.

528
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:20,705
Come on.

529
00:48:20,924 --> 00:48:22,934
Diana! Please.

530
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:39,589
Thank God! You're not dead!

531
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:43,893
Hurray!

532
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:46,227
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

533
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:49,169
He's been gone for weeks..
Not a single word.

534
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:50,493
Very unlike him.

535
00:48:50,649 --> 00:48:52,949
I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

536
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:54,967
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

537
00:48:55,254 --> 00:48:56,452
What is a secretary?

538
00:48:57,106 --> 00:48:58,107
Well, I do everything.

539
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:00,761
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

540
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:03,261
Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.

541
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:04,534
I really like her.

542
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,121
Fantastic.
Ladies after you.

543
00:49:06,122 --> 00:49:07,291
Oh.. I do, I like her.

544
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:19,975
Is this what passes for
armor in your country?

545
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:22,607
Ah. well, "Oh my".
It's fashion.

546
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,240
Keeps our tummies in..

547
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:25,943
Why must you keep them in?

548
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:28,401
Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!

549
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:33,615
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

550
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,164
Try it on at least.

551
00:49:36,524 --> 00:49:37,542
Very well..

552
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:39,932
No!

553
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:48,309
Come on!

554
00:49:57,582 --> 00:50:00,244
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

555
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,633
Fight?

556
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,242
We use our principles.

557
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:05,146
I mean that's how we are
gonna get to vote.

558
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:09,027
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups..

559
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:10,952
...should the occasion arise.

560
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:13,612
Lovely.

561
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,576
It's itching.
It's choking me.

562
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:20,928
Can they blame it?

563
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,463
Etta.

564
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:23,741
Where is she?

565
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:26,225
She's trying on upto number 226.

566
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:39,138
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

567
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:40,378
...distracting.

568
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:43,907
May I?

569
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:49,746
Yeah, really? Specs?

570
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,122
Certainly she's not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

571
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:00,061
Better.

572
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:12,482
Yep, that's not gonna work.

573
00:51:12,761 --> 00:51:14,409
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

574
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:15,662
Diana!

575
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:17,884
Let me try it by myself.

576
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,190
After you, sir.

577
00:51:28,736 --> 00:51:29,766
Etta...

578
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,458
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

579
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,529
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

580
00:51:34,808 --> 00:51:35,809
Oh no, I don't think so.

581
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:37,639
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

582
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,647
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

583
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:41,934
Put the sword down,
first of all.

584
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:47,930
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

585
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:50,336
Yes... no.

586
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:52,529
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

587
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:54,706
- Shield.
- And the shield to her..

588
00:51:56,138 --> 00:51:57,170
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

589
00:51:57,195 --> 00:51:58,412
This is easy.

590
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:01,744
There we go.

591
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:30,757
What is it?

592
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,832
Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.

593
00:52:44,557 --> 00:52:46,599
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

594
00:52:56,398 --> 00:52:57,832
Captain Trevor.

595
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:01,745
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

596
00:53:03,506 --> 00:53:05,979
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

597
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:08,336
Give us Dr Maru's note book.

598
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,566
Where I put that thing?

599
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:13,543
Stand back!

600
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:25,729
Or maybe not.

601
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:42,816
Oh, tough luck.

602
00:53:49,598 --> 00:53:51,644
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

603
00:53:52,648 --> 00:53:54,335
Where do you think you're going?

604
00:54:01,077 --> 00:54:03,568
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

605
00:54:04,163 --> 00:54:06,476
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

606
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:08,176
Where will I find Ares?

607
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,389
He's... He's dead.

608
00:54:18,684 --> 00:54:19,843
Cyanide.

609
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,446
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

610
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:33,321
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

611
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:40,149
<i>Let him speak!</i>

612
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:41,507
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

613
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:46,156
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

614
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,314
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

615
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:52,341
<i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i>

616
00:54:52,342 --> 00:54:54,977
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

617
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:57,663
<i>...and restore world peace...</i>

618
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,937
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

619
00:55:01,744 --> 00:55:03,327
...an armistice.

620
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,533
<i>There's a woman.</i>

621
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:07,987
What is she doing here?
Get her out..

622
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:11,193
Ger her out..

623
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:12,837
Sorry.

624
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:15,340
Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom..

625
00:55:15,341 --> 00:55:17,519
I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.

626
00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:20,201
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

627
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:23,046
<i>...must be to achieve peace...</i>

628
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:25,050
<i>...at any cost!</i>

629
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,956
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

630
00:55:30,957 --> 00:55:32,568
Not right now!

631
00:55:37,563 --> 00:55:40,153
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

632
00:55:40,154 --> 00:55:42,166
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

633
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:44,384
This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.

634
00:55:44,484 --> 00:55:45,120
Notebook or notes...

635
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:46,048
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

636
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:47,827
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

637
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:49,910
You do not just barge in here.

638
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,678
Sir with all due respect..
What I saw in my last trip...

639
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:52,815
...will change the
course of war.

640
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,406
Captain Trevor!

641
00:55:56,528 --> 00:55:58,254
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

642
00:55:58,255 --> 00:55:59,686
...and yet here you are,
back from the dead...

643
00:55:59,687 --> 00:56:01,637
...and I see you
brought a friend with you.

644
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,428
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

645
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:05,097
No, no no... non sense.

646
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:07,065
Thanks to this young woman...

647
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:10,716
...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get atleast a few words in.

648
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,018
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

649
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,992
Diana, princess of the...

650
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:16,974
"Prince". Diana Prince.

651
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:18,890
She is...

652
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,141
and I..

653
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:21,308
...are...

654
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,471
...working together.

655
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:25,083
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

656
00:56:25,226 --> 00:56:26,888
That's from Dr Maru's lab.

657
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:30,180
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

658
00:56:30,495 --> 00:56:32,205
My.. God.

659
00:56:33,245 --> 00:56:35,152
- Dr Poison herself.
- Yes.

660
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:44,786
P s a g m e n o .com

661
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,548
Yes.

662
00:57:07,155 --> 00:57:08,356
Intriguing.

663
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:09,978
Any further intelligence?

664
00:57:10,224 --> 00:57:12,987
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

665
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:15,146
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

666
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:18,940
...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

667
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:20,814
Ottoman & Sumerian.

668
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,494
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

669
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:26,805
Who is this woman?

670
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:28,756
She is my...

671
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,591
...secretary, sir.

672
00:57:31,092 --> 00:57:33,324
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

673
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:35,199
She's a very good secretary.

674
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,178
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

675
00:57:40,409 --> 00:57:42,235
...we should hear
what she has to say.

676
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:44,132
Yes, very well.

677
00:57:50,317 --> 00:57:51,961
It's a formula...

678
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:54,941
...for a new kind of gas.

679
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:57,699
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

680
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,109
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

681
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,921
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

682
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,932
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

683
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,609
At the front?

684
00:58:06,822 --> 00:58:07,621
When?

685
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:08,989
It doesn't say.

686
00:58:09,443 --> 00:58:10,947
Wait. In "front" of what?

687
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:12,065
Sir...

688
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:13,721
...that is the
evidence we need.

689
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:15,548
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

690
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:16,925
You have to burn
it to the ground.

691
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:18,146
Destroy it.

692
00:58:18,222 --> 00:58:20,629
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

693
00:58:20,912 --> 00:58:25,012
We can't be seen in sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

694
00:58:25,313 --> 00:58:28,470
...As we are negotiating
their surrender.

695
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,374
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

696
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:33,267
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

697
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:34,138
They will all die.

698
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,328
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

699
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:40,097
Send me in.. with some
logistical support.

700
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:43,111
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

701
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:44,237
Are you insane?

702
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:46,697
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

703
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:47,634
Sir, I can take...

704
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:49,118
Now more than ever...

705
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:53,061
...the armistice is
off paramount importance.

706
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:56,910
It must be negotiated
it must be signed..

707
00:58:57,696 --> 00:59:00,395
It's the best way
of stopping the war.

708
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:02,510
Captain, you will do nothing.

709
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,828
And that's an order.

710
00:59:05,717 --> 00:59:06,718
Yes sir.

711
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:09,072
I understand, sir.

712
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:10,902
I don't!

713
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,671
Diana, I know this confusing...

714
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:15,085
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

715
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:16,202
She is with me, she is with us.

716
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:17,207
I'm not.. I am not with you!

717
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:20,446
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

718
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,910
...as if they mean
less than yours.

719
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:24,022
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

720
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:27,057
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

721
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:29,304
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

722
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:31,133
They die with them
on the battlefield!

723
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,858
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

724
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:33,931
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

725
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:36,005
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

726
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,128
Please slow down!

727
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:40,537
Is that your leader?

728
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:42,920
How could he say that?
Believe that?

729
00:59:43,238 --> 00:59:44,576
And.. and you!

730
00:59:44,806 --> 00:59:47,066
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

731
00:59:47,096 --> 00:59:47,427
No!

732
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:49,248
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

733
00:59:49,249 --> 00:59:50,921
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

734
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:54,309
This is Ares and
he's not going to allow negotiation,

735
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:55,659
...nor a surrender!

736
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:58,386
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

737
00:59:58,411 --> 00:59:59,771
We are going anyway!

738
01:00:02,118 --> 01:00:03,976
You mean you were lying?

739
01:00:04,377 --> 01:00:06,076
I'm a spy!
That's what I do!

740
01:00:06,176 --> 01:00:08,294
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

741
01:00:13,297 --> 01:00:14,853
I'm taking you to the front.

742
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:17,248
We are afraid you're gonna die.

743
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:20,275
This is a terrible idea.

744
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:26,713
We're gonna need reinforcements.

745
01:00:37,497 --> 01:00:39,487
These are the reinforcements?

746
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:40,513
Yep.

747
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:42,603
Are these even good men?

748
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:44,814
Well, relatively.

749
01:00:45,962 --> 01:00:50,004
Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.

750
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:54,310
The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!

751
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:56,698
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

752
01:00:57,259 --> 01:00:58,690
Which prince is that?

753
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:01,458
I decided to extend
your profanity...

754
01:01:01,459 --> 01:01:03,081
But seriously, which prince?

755
01:01:03,936 --> 01:01:06,550
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

756
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,500
<i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i>

757
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:11,204
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

758
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:13,873
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

759
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:17,212
I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...

760
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,325
Oh my goodness, gracious.

761
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:21,148
That's a work of art.

762
01:01:21,149 --> 01:01:23,427
Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!

763
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:25,705
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

764
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,539
"Sammy".

765
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,080
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

766
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,429
Sameer is a top undercover man.

767
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:33,099
He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.

768
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:36,108
<i>He doesn't look that impressive to me.</i>

769
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:37,761
<i>You do for me.</i>

770
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:41,046
<i>Your eyes, as soft as your smile.</i>

771
01:01:41,272 --> 01:01:42,223
<i>And your eyes...</i>

772
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:45,126
<i>...looks like they want something.</i>

773
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:47,484
<i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i>

774
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:49,768
<i>But, can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i>

775
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,132
Oh, you're done.

776
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:54,158
Where is Charlie?

777
01:01:58,286 --> 01:01:59,287
Voila!

778
01:02:02,016 --> 01:02:04,425
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

779
01:02:05,693 --> 01:02:06,826
That's not Charlie.

780
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:15,910
That's Charlie.

781
01:02:20,348 --> 01:02:21,349
Steven!

782
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:24,339
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

783
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:25,483
Good to see you.

784
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:28,952
So what were you fighting about?

785
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:32,686
I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.

786
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,421
This man is no fighter.

787
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:36,643
Charlie is an expert marksman.

788
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:38,525
Means he shoots people.

789
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,115
From very far away.

790
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,710
You never know what hit 'em.

791
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:45,940
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

792
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,303
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

793
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:49,901
You fight without honor.

794
01:02:50,209 --> 01:02:52,058
Who gets paid for honor?

795
01:02:53,433 --> 01:02:54,825
So, what's the job, boss?

796
01:02:56,323 --> 01:02:57,339
Two days tops.

797
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,962
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

798
01:03:00,062 --> 01:03:01,294
What's the going rate?

799
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:02,107
Better be a good pay.

800
01:03:02,108 --> 01:03:04,319
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

801
01:03:06,464 --> 01:03:07,434
..I told you it was going to be quick.

802
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,129
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

803
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,328
It's for a great cause...

804
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:15,628
...Freedom.

805
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:17,570
Friendship...

806
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:21,336
...ending the war, friendship...

807
01:03:21,337 --> 01:03:22,693
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

808
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:25,971
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

809
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:28,951
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

810
01:03:29,336 --> 01:03:30,286
<i>...because I'll go with you.</i>

811
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:32,358
What?

812
01:03:32,413 --> 01:03:33,483
What is this?

813
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:34,844
We're gonna drop her up at front!

814
01:03:35,135 --> 01:03:36,737
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

815
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:39,494
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

816
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:40,895
...with helping every last human.

817
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:43,541
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

818
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:00,439
I am both frightened and aroused.

819
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,612
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

820
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,256
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

821
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:13,292
- Sir Patrick.
- No... No..!

822
01:04:13,737 --> 01:04:15,771
Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit..

823
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,521
I assume you are here
planning something...

824
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:25,568
...that's going to get you
either court martial or killed.

825
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,809
And I assume,
you are here to stop us.

826
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:29,360
No.

827
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,651
Not at all in fact..

828
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:33,417
Well, look.

829
01:04:33,442 --> 01:04:34,609
I was an younger man once.

830
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:38,520
And had I been in better health,
I like to think that I might do the same.

831
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:42,054
It's very very honorable
thing you're doing.

832
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:42,781
Therefore..

833
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:45,133
...I am here to help.

834
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:47,107
Unofficially, of course.

835
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:49,476
What's your plan?

836
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:54,112
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

837
01:04:54,581 --> 01:04:56,389
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

838
01:04:57,478 --> 01:05:00,062
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

839
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,409
...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

840
01:05:05,763 --> 01:05:06,764
"Run"...

841
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:09,909
Also.

842
01:05:10,944 --> 01:05:13,402
...There is enough
here for a few days.

843
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:20,047
Thank you sir.

844
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,523
You're very welcome.

845
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:24,149
Take great care all of you...

846
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,175
...and good luck.

847
01:05:46,483 --> 01:05:48,385
<i>Fresh ice-cream.</i>

848
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,390
Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?

849
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:51,930
- Me?
- You hungry?

850
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,183
Yes.

851
01:05:53,624 --> 01:05:54,362
Thank you.

852
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:55,828
Eight pence please, sir.

853
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,292
There you go, and keep the change.

854
01:05:57,293 --> 01:05:58,835
Thank you very much sir.

855
01:05:59,986 --> 01:06:01,488
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

856
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:02,665
Yeah.

857
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,292
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

858
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:07,694
You should be very proud.

859
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,975
I hope I got niches here.
The chief's expecting us before dark.

860
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:23,228
Chief?

861
01:06:24,253 --> 01:06:25,834
Oh yeah.
A smuggler.

862
01:06:26,671 --> 01:06:28,028
Very reputable.

863
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:31,434
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

864
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:33,039
Lovely.

865
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:34,710
Careful, I might get offended.

866
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:36,236
I wasn't referring to you.

867
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:38,088
Really?

868
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,350
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

869
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:42,424
...I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.

870
01:06:42,425 --> 01:06:45,030
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

871
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,584
It's awful.

872
01:07:06,924 --> 01:07:08,367
That's why we're here.

873
01:07:26,506 --> 01:07:28,242
The gas will kill everything.

874
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:30,691
What kind weapons
kills innocents?

875
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:33,112
In this war...

876
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:34,381
...Every kind.

877
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:42,744
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

878
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:45,626
I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.

879
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:48,155
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

880
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:52,038
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

881
01:07:52,063 --> 01:07:53,294
We don't.

882
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:55,649
There are shortages of food...

883
01:07:55,674 --> 01:07:57,519
...meds and ammunition.

884
01:07:58,526 --> 01:08:02,410
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

885
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:05,267
One attack and the
world could be ours.

886
01:08:07,628 --> 01:08:09,659
As we speak, my chemistry...

887
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:11,831
We stand against you and your...

888
01:08:11,856 --> 01:08:13,095
...witch.

889
01:08:13,831 --> 01:08:19,010
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

890
01:08:19,035 --> 01:08:21,007
...this war will end.

891
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,191
It is over.

892
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,808
It's over for you.

893
01:08:29,712 --> 01:08:31,021
It is over for all of you..

894
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,648
But the mask won't help.

895
01:08:49,673 --> 01:08:50,916
They don't know that.

896
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:07,128
Let's go.

897
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:09,805
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

898
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,011
You're late.

899
01:09:13,312 --> 01:09:14,438
Cowboy sneak attack, chief!

900
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:16,782
How are you?

901
01:09:17,697 --> 01:09:19,693
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

902
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:23,934
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

903
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,328
Good to see you my friend.

904
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:28,315
Yaa beauty!

905
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,110
Who is this?

906
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,666
And I am Diana.

907
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:41,107
Where did you find her?

908
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:42,535
She found me.

909
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,128
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

910
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:46,741
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

911
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:48,143
What's there?

912
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:51,434
British tea from the Germans...

913
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,650
...German beer for the British.

914
01:09:53,675 --> 01:09:57,740
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

915
01:09:57,951 --> 01:09:59,252
And guns!

916
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:04,021
Well...
May we get what we want?

917
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:05,254
May we get what we need.

918
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:07,649
But may we never get
what we deserve.

919
01:10:07,674 --> 01:10:08,675
Bang!

920
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:17,523
Strange thunder.

921
01:10:19,038 --> 01:10:20,545
German 77's.

922
01:10:20,894 --> 01:10:22,316
Guns, big ones.

923
01:10:23,431 --> 01:10:24,877
It's the front out there.

924
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:30,105
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

925
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:31,399
I don't fight.

926
01:10:31,424 --> 01:10:33,289
You're here for profits then?

927
01:10:33,774 --> 01:10:35,735
No better place to be.

928
01:10:36,725 --> 01:10:39,207
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

929
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:41,783
I have no where else.
The last war took

930
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:44,448
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

931
01:10:45,143 --> 01:10:46,513
At least here...

932
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,299
...I'm free.

933
01:10:49,118 --> 01:10:50,883
Who took that from your people?

934
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:52,826
His people.

935
01:10:57,783 --> 01:10:58,831
<i>Don't go...</i>

936
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:02,481
<i>Don't go there.
Do not go!</i>

937
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,839
<i>Don't go in there.</i>

938
01:11:05,864 --> 01:11:06,962
You are safe.

939
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,793
You are safe.
Are you okay?

940
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:11,362
Shut up, you woman!

941
01:11:11,387 --> 01:11:13,140
Stop making a fuss!

942
01:11:13,463 --> 01:11:14,622
God!

943
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,082
He sees ghosts.

944
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,108
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

945
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:28,355
Oh I do...

946
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:31,285
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean any, alright?

947
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:53,464
These animals, why are
they hurting them?

948
01:11:54,011 --> 01:11:55,607
Because they need to move quick!

949
01:11:55,855 --> 01:11:58,052
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

950
01:11:58,252 --> 01:11:59,687
I could help them.

951
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:00,991
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

952
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:05,421
Mama!

953
01:12:10,183 --> 01:12:12,304
That man... he's wounded.

954
01:12:12,605 --> 01:12:14,762
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

955
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:16,344
We must keep moving.

956
01:12:37,629 --> 01:12:38,472
What is this?

957
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:40,579
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

958
01:12:40,646 --> 01:12:42,076
Then where are the Germans?

959
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,584
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

960
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:46,271
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

961
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,958
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

962
01:12:51,258 --> 01:12:53,423
Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!

963
01:12:54,608 --> 01:12:55,891
Alright, let's move.

964
01:12:57,124 --> 01:12:58,865
<i>Help me please.</i>

965
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:01,030
<i>They have taken everything...</i>

966
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:03,037
<i>...houses, food...</i>

967
01:13:03,281 --> 01:13:05,117
<i>...and those who
could not escape...</i>

968
01:13:05,334 --> 01:13:07,233
<i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i>

969
01:13:07,234 --> 01:13:08,476
<i>Where did that happen?</i>

970
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:11,757
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

971
01:13:11,758 --> 01:13:12,855
Diana, we have to go.

972
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:14,293
We need to help these people.

973
01:13:14,318 --> 01:13:15,465
We have to stay on mission!

974
01:13:15,466 --> 01:13:17,147
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

975
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,929
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

976
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,464
These people are dying.

977
01:13:21,713 --> 01:13:23,340
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

978
01:13:23,553 --> 01:13:24,995
- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.

979
01:13:24,996 --> 01:13:25,997
Women and children!

980
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,297
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

981
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:29,338
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

982
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:31,961
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

983
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,485
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

984
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,909
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

985
01:13:37,234 --> 01:13:39,492
...and they barely
gained an inch.

986
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:42,405
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

987
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:45,232
...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

988
01:13:45,483 --> 01:13:47,731
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

989
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:49,124
So what? So we do nothing?

990
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,215
No, we are doing something.

991
01:13:51,216 --> 01:13:52,595
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

992
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:54,231
We can't save
everyone in this war.

993
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:55,690
Steve...

994
01:13:55,923 --> 01:13:57,580
This is not what we
came here to do.

995
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:15,030
No...

996
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:16,982
...but it's what
I'm going to do.

997
01:14:32,256 --> 01:14:33,515
Diana!

998
01:14:55,702 --> 01:14:57,993
What the bloody hell she's playing at?

999
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:05,658
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1000
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,686
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1001
01:15:20,373 --> 01:15:22,262
Sniper! stay down!

1002
01:15:22,263 --> 01:15:23,810
Stay down! That's an order!

1003
01:16:16,997 --> 01:16:17,998
Come on!

1004
01:16:18,155 --> 01:16:19,902
She's done it!
Let's go!

1005
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:40,926
Steve!

1006
01:16:41,357 --> 01:16:42,504
Let's go!

1007
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:47,008
Come on, go!

1008
01:17:07,406 --> 01:17:09,017
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1009
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:45,833
- What the...
- Let's move.

1010
01:18:24,218 --> 01:18:25,645
We need more firepower.

1011
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:43,142
Sniper!

1012
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:44,419
Move!

1013
01:19:46,755 --> 01:19:47,520
Get in!

1014
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:49,228
Charlie, bell tower.

1015
01:19:57,484 --> 01:19:58,754
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1016
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,867
It's okay.

1017
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:08,847
Follow me.
Give me some cover.

1018
01:20:15,555 --> 01:20:16,609
Good!

1019
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:19,689
We're gonna put this on our
back and when I say go..

1020
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:20,875
- ...Lift hard!
- All right.

1021
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:24,059
Diana! Shield!

1022
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:28,757
Go!

1023
01:21:30,955 --> 01:21:33,334
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1024
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:34,997
Please. It's so important.

1025
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:40,137
Thank you very much.

1026
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,031
This has been such an honor
for me taking you photograph.

1027
01:21:43,056 --> 01:21:44,122
Thank you so much.

1028
01:21:50,558 --> 01:21:52,777
For obvious talk of shooting...

1029
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:54,869
...you cannot shoot.

1030
01:21:57,516 --> 01:21:59,934
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1031
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:02,981
Me, I'm an actor.

1032
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,443
I love acting.

1033
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:06,326
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1034
01:22:07,635 --> 01:22:08,976
But I'm the wrong color.

1035
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:12,278
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1036
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,239
Just as you're fighting yours.

1037
01:22:20,991 --> 01:22:22,895
<i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i>

1038
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:23,897
<i>Thank you.</i>

1039
01:22:28,012 --> 01:22:29,589
Hi.. I'm on the phone...

1040
01:22:30,007 --> 01:22:33,079
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1041
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:34,811
It's a tiny village.

1042
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:36,692
It may not even be on the map.

1043
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:38,008
Ooh! I found it!

1044
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:40,122
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1045
01:22:40,147 --> 01:22:41,861
No. No, but I located him.

1046
01:22:42,027 --> 01:22:44,898
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1047
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:46,639
...At German High Command.

1048
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:48,639
The German High Command?

1049
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:50,116
And to Intel report...

1050
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:52,608
...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala..

1051
01:22:52,824 --> 01:22:54,142
Sort of a last hara...

1052
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,969
...before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1053
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:59,849
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1054
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:02,502
As well as Dr. Maru.

1055
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:04,900
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1056
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:06,887
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1057
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:10,116
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1058
01:23:10,141 --> 01:23:11,678
...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1059
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:14,245
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1060
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,088
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1061
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:18,024
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1062
01:23:18,025 --> 01:23:20,018
.. once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1063
01:23:20,272 --> 01:23:21,326
Hold on one second, sir.

1064
01:23:21,351 --> 01:23:23,636
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1065
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:25,313
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1066
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:26,915
What?

1067
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:28,442
What is that?

1068
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:30,814
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1069
01:23:32,404 --> 01:23:35,490
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1070
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,192
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1071
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:39,151
I mean Ares.

1072
01:23:39,797 --> 01:23:41,955
Ludendorff is Ares!

1073
01:23:42,845 --> 01:23:44,887
Sir, this is our last chance...

1074
01:23:44,912 --> 01:23:46,662
...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1075
01:23:46,663 --> 01:23:48,988
...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1076
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:50,890
No... No.. No. I forbid it.

1077
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:52,065
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1078
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:53,816
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1079
01:23:53,841 --> 01:23:55,271
- Hello?
- Sir...

1080
01:23:58,574 --> 01:24:00,251
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1081
01:24:00,276 --> 01:24:02,560
Not very like convinced.

1082
01:24:08,188 --> 01:24:09,990
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1083
01:24:10,468 --> 01:24:11,582
Sammy, I have to work.

1084
01:24:11,989 --> 01:24:15,392
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.

1085
01:24:15,492 --> 01:24:16,690
That's easy, boss.
Come on.

1086
01:24:16,939 --> 01:24:18,481
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1087
01:24:18,482 --> 01:24:19,523
You said yourself, Steve.

1088
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:26,806
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1089
01:24:45,048 --> 01:24:46,239
You did this.

1090
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,554
We did.

1091
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:55,900
Do you have dancing on...

1092
01:24:56,949 --> 01:24:58,164
...Paradise Island?

1093
01:24:58,189 --> 01:24:59,910
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1094
01:25:00,891 --> 01:25:04,050
These people are just...
swaying.

1095
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:08,401
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1096
01:25:08,402 --> 01:25:11,822
...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.

1097
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:14,440
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1098
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:20,018
If you would...

1099
01:25:20,868 --> 01:25:21,869
Well...

1100
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:26,402
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1101
01:25:26,427 --> 01:25:27,562
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1102
01:25:27,563 --> 01:25:29,614
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1103
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:31,724
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1104
01:25:32,354 --> 01:25:34,705
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1105
01:25:34,954 --> 01:25:36,133
Be polite. Be polite.

1106
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,319
All right.
Give me your hand.

1107
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,593
Like so.

1108
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:46,485
And I'll put my arm...

1109
01:25:46,486 --> 01:25:48,350
...around you like so.

1110
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:51,162
And we just..

1111
01:25:51,501 --> 01:25:52,904
What do you call it? Sway?

1112
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:53,930
We'll just sway.

1113
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:56,188
You're awfully close.

1114
01:25:58,422 --> 01:26:00,475
Nice ritz.

1115
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,683
I see.

1116
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:15,630
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1117
01:26:32,967 --> 01:26:34,921
It's started to snowfall.

1118
01:26:39,256 --> 01:26:40,343
Touch it.

1119
01:26:43,816 --> 01:26:45,320
It's magical!

1120
01:26:45,885 --> 01:26:47,517
It is, isn't it?

1121
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:51,021
Yes, yeah.

1122
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,086
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1123
01:27:02,057 --> 01:27:03,058
Yeah.

1124
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:07,099
Yeah, this... and other things.

1125
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:08,772
What things?

1126
01:27:16,282 --> 01:27:17,825
They have breakfast.

1127
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,035
They really love a breakfast.

1128
01:27:20,063 --> 01:27:22,898
And they love to wake up...

1129
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:26,042
...read the paper
and go to work.

1130
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:28,739
They get married.

1131
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,228
Makes some babies and
grow old together.

1132
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:32,772
I guess.

1133
01:27:36,764 --> 01:27:38,315
What is that like?

1134
01:27:42,445 --> 01:27:43,879
I have no idea.

1135
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:20,318
The villagers gave them to us.

1136
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:23,706
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1137
01:29:24,283 --> 01:29:25,284
You are.

1138
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:27,646
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1139
01:29:28,944 --> 01:29:30,835
...I said this job
was 2 day's...

1140
01:29:32,877 --> 01:29:34,078
...and a deal is a deal.

1141
01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:37,683
You can't last without us.

1142
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:39,572
Yeah.

1143
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:41,948
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1144
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:44,282
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1145
01:29:44,987 --> 01:29:45,812
No more money.

1146
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:47,229
We have been paid enough.

1147
01:29:51,103 --> 01:29:52,607
No, Charlie.

1148
01:29:53,985 --> 01:29:55,942
Who will sing for us?

1149
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,949
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1150
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:01,055
Sing?

1151
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:03,445
You asked for it.

1152
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:05,970
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1153
01:30:06,447 --> 01:30:10,071
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1154
01:30:10,334 --> 01:30:13,861
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1155
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,097
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1156
01:30:17,314 --> 01:30:19,021
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1157
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:20,377
Every word.

1158
01:30:20,867 --> 01:30:22,131
Wait...wait.

1159
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:24,270
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1160
01:30:24,472 --> 01:30:26,076
And not a single man among them?

1161
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:28,417
How do we get there?

1162
01:30:29,697 --> 01:30:30,618
And she thinks..

1163
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:32,771
...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1164
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,589
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1165
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,942
Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.

1166
01:30:38,136 --> 01:30:40,039
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1167
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,135
The way she took out the tower?

1168
01:30:43,894 --> 01:30:45,293
May be it's true.

1169
01:30:46,431 --> 01:30:47,683
I think it's true.

1170
01:30:48,305 --> 01:30:49,319
I believe it's true.

1171
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:54,008
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1172
01:31:17,335 --> 01:31:19,459
Diana, Diana, hide in..

1173
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:23,650
How the hell do
we get into that?

1174
01:31:24,209 --> 01:31:26,867
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1175
01:31:27,122 --> 01:31:28,448
Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...

1176
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,214
...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1177
01:31:30,215 --> 01:31:31,006
I could get in.

1178
01:31:31,182 --> 01:31:33,192
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1179
01:31:33,217 --> 01:31:34,699
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1180
01:31:34,713 --> 01:31:35,983
And you are too distracting.

1181
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:38,260
Look, I will go in there, follow them to..

1182
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:40,989
...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.

1183
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,406
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1184
01:31:43,463 --> 01:31:45,395
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1185
01:31:45,921 --> 01:31:46,511
I don't know.

1186
01:31:46,512 --> 01:31:49,311
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1187
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:52,844
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1188
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:54,671
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1189
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,067
You cannot go into German high command
and kill anyone.

1190
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:59,421
You just can't.
You have to trust me.

1191
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:02,345
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1192
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,695
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1193
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:05,891
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1194
01:32:05,993 --> 01:32:07,237
Come on... come on.

1195
01:32:07,715 --> 01:32:08,716
Stay put!

1196
01:32:10,662 --> 01:32:11,537
Where this come from?

1197
01:32:11,737 --> 01:32:13,218
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1198
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:19,153
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1199
01:32:19,154 --> 01:32:21,023
...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.

1200
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:22,600
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1201
01:32:27,925 --> 01:32:28,926
Colonel.

1202
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:35,628
Steve, they have invitations.

1203
01:32:37,179 --> 01:32:39,457
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1204
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,182
Your invitation, please.

1205
01:32:45,207 --> 01:32:47,393
<i>Thank you sir.
The Colonel and I wish...</i>

1206
01:32:47,418 --> 01:32:49,765
...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1207
01:32:50,016 --> 01:32:53,525
Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.

1208
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:54,426
I am sorry.

1209
01:32:54,564 --> 01:32:57,166
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1210
01:32:58,182 --> 01:33:01,149
I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1211
01:33:01,441 --> 01:33:03,467
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1212
01:33:03,768 --> 01:33:06,380
You saying we travelled all the way
through the mud and rain...

1213
01:33:06,673 --> 01:33:09,869
- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1214
01:33:09,894 --> 01:33:12,040
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1215
01:33:12,065 --> 01:33:13,285
And you're right master...

1216
01:33:13,725 --> 01:33:15,082
Blessing will up on us.

1217
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:26,983
This is ridiculous.

1218
01:33:27,217 --> 01:33:29,233
I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.

1219
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:31,738
You stupid idiots!
Move your car!

1220
01:33:52,939 --> 01:33:54,826
What are you supposed to be?

1221
01:33:58,123 --> 01:33:59,997
What are you doing?

1222
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:25,707
Excuse me.

1223
01:34:28,253 --> 01:34:29,949
I don't drink.

1224
01:34:38,076 --> 01:34:39,101
Have we met?

1225
01:34:39,126 --> 01:34:40,886
No, but I have
been watching you.

1226
01:34:42,279 --> 01:34:43,628
Following your career.

1227
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:47,241
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.

1228
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:49,808
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1229
01:34:50,324 --> 01:34:51,744
I am a friend.

1230
01:35:02,818 --> 01:35:04,896
I hope I'm not causing any...

1231
01:35:06,631 --> 01:35:08,895
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1232
01:35:08,921 --> 01:35:09,886
...very close.

1233
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:13,431
We work well together..
Yes.

1234
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:16,998
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1235
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,655
I could provide a lot more.

1236
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,448
And who are you?

1237
01:35:21,654 --> 01:35:25,738
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1238
01:35:32,428 --> 01:35:34,999
I love fire. Don't you?

1239
01:35:37,391 --> 01:35:39,037
It is like...

1240
01:35:40,691 --> 01:35:42,793
...a living act of entropy.

1241
01:35:42,818 --> 01:35:45,433
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1242
01:35:46,118 --> 01:35:48,344
Reminding us that in the end...

1243
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:52,182
...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1244
01:35:54,688 --> 01:35:57,952
There is something reassuring about it.

1245
01:36:02,553 --> 01:36:04,666
I see all of that in your eyes.

1246
01:36:08,142 --> 01:36:10,354
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1247
01:36:26,389 --> 01:36:28,007
I hear it is...

1248
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:32,290
I hear it is extraordinary.

1249
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:36,879
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1250
01:36:36,904 --> 01:36:39,260
...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1251
01:36:40,047 --> 01:36:41,068
Besides...

1252
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:43,733
...Now I see your
attention is...

1253
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:48,211
...elsewhere.

1254
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:14,247
Enjoying the party?

1255
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,074
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1256
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:21,995
A German victory, of course.

1257
01:37:22,296 --> 01:37:23,003
Victory?

1258
01:37:23,024 --> 01:37:25,725
When I hear peace
could be so close.

1259
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,029
Peace?

1260
01:37:27,047 --> 01:37:28,916
It's only an armistice...

1261
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:30,723
...and an endless war.

1262
01:37:31,391 --> 01:37:32,846
Thucydides.

1263
01:37:33,253 --> 01:37:34,892
You know your ancient Greeks?

1264
01:37:35,156 --> 01:37:36,900
They understood...

1265
01:37:36,921 --> 01:37:38,364
...that war was a god.

1266
01:37:38,905 --> 01:37:41,585
A god that requires human sacrifices.

1267
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,850
And in exchange...

1268
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:45,615
...war gives man purpose...

1269
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,587
...meaning, a
chance to rise...

1270
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,990
...above his petty,
mortal little self...

1271
01:37:50,725 --> 01:37:52,040
...and be courageous...

1272
01:37:52,863 --> 01:37:54,254
...Noble!

1273
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:58,705
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1274
01:37:59,702 --> 01:38:01,288
And he was wrong.

1275
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:03,970
You know nothing of the gods.

1276
01:38:03,995 --> 01:38:05,502
<i>Herr General.</i>

1277
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:10,186
Enjoy the fireworks.

1278
01:38:15,799 --> 01:38:16,860
What are you doing?

1279
01:38:16,885 --> 01:38:18,326
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1280
01:38:18,456 --> 01:38:20,293
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1281
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:21,705
...we won't be able to stop anything.

1282
01:38:21,706 --> 01:38:22,885
I will stop Ares!

1283
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:24,443
What if you're wrong?

1284
01:38:26,013 --> 01:38:27,615
What if there's no Ares?

1285
01:38:29,378 --> 01:38:30,829
You don't believe me.

1286
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:32,666
I can not let you do this.

1287
01:38:33,328 --> 01:38:34,786
What I do is not up to you.

1288
01:38:41,592 --> 01:38:42,745
Diana!

1289
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:48,021
Diana...

1290
01:38:48,522 --> 01:38:49,523
The gas.

1291
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:52,538
The villagers!

1292
01:38:54,708 --> 01:38:56,340
What they cheering for?

1293
01:38:58,888 --> 01:38:59,967
Diana!

1294
01:39:02,358 --> 01:39:03,966
What did they fire?

1295
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:05,280
The gas.

1296
01:39:05,311 --> 01:39:07,351
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1297
01:39:07,352 --> 01:39:08,821
Wherever he goes you follow.

1298
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:11,055
How will you find us?

1299
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:12,975
I know how.

1300
01:40:30,784 --> 01:40:32,132
Diana!

1301
01:40:35,127 --> 01:40:37,789
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1302
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:40,356
I could have saved them.

1303
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:43,029
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1304
01:40:43,271 --> 01:40:45,247
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1305
01:40:45,448 --> 01:40:47,836
- No!
- Get away from me!

1306
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:49,528
I understand everything now.

1307
01:40:49,553 --> 01:40:51,339
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1308
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,657
It's you too.

1309
01:40:53,343 --> 01:40:54,370
All of you.

1310
01:40:55,565 --> 01:40:56,871
I'll find Ares...

1311
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:58,656
...and I'll kill him.

1312
01:41:01,977 --> 01:41:03,112
Diana!

1313
01:41:04,155 --> 01:41:05,263
That smoke...

1314
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,402
...it's the chief!

1315
01:41:07,423 --> 01:41:08,870
He followed Ludendorff.

1316
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:11,944
Follow the smoke!

1317
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:39,959
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1318
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:57,576
Come on. Let's go!

1319
01:42:19,656 --> 01:42:21,266
Ooh! what a surprise.

1320
01:42:21,892 --> 01:42:23,184
Strange.

1321
01:42:24,563 --> 01:42:26,668
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1322
01:42:27,726 --> 01:42:28,727
...to attend to.

1323
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:36,395
What are you?

1324
01:42:36,396 --> 01:42:37,635
You will soon find out.

1325
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,957
As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.

1326
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,791
We'll see about that.

1327
01:43:46,146 --> 01:43:48,129
I am Diana Temiscira...

1328
01:43:50,034 --> 01:43:51,891
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1329
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:55,296
...Queen of the Amazons.

1330
01:43:58,019 --> 01:44:00,767
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1331
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,751
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1332
01:44:21,002 --> 01:44:23,603
...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1333
01:44:23,889 --> 01:44:25,691
...by ridding this
world of you...

1334
01:44:25,946 --> 01:44:26,948
...forever!

1335
01:45:34,515 --> 01:45:35,516
Diana?

1336
01:45:41,253 --> 01:45:42,254
Diana!

1337
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:48,069
I killed him.

1338
01:45:49,698 --> 01:45:51,888
I killed him, but nothing stops.

1339
01:45:53,335 --> 01:45:56,009
You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1340
01:45:56,285 --> 01:45:58,275
Exactly what we have to do now.

1341
01:45:58,457 --> 01:45:59,858
We need to stop the gas.
Come on.

1342
01:46:00,071 --> 01:46:01,532
No. All this should
have stopped.

1343
01:46:01,641 --> 01:46:02,589
Diana...

1344
01:46:02,633 --> 01:46:04,620
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they?

1345
01:46:04,621 --> 01:46:06,696
I don't know! I don't know.

1346
01:46:06,917 --> 01:46:07,779
Ares is dead.

1347
01:46:08,018 --> 01:46:11,010
They can now stop fighting.
Why are they still fighting?

1348
01:46:11,218 --> 01:46:12,911
Because maybe it's them!

1349
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:14,332
Maybe...

1350
01:46:16,168 --> 01:46:18,723
Maybe people aren't always good.

1351
01:46:19,796 --> 01:46:21,644
Ares or no Ares...

1352
01:46:22,946 --> 01:46:26,261
...Maybe it's just,
who they are.

1353
01:46:29,197 --> 01:46:30,488
- Diana...
- No.

1354
01:46:30,819 --> 01:46:32,271
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1355
01:46:32,476 --> 01:46:33,815
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1356
01:46:33,816 --> 01:46:35,581
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1357
01:46:35,805 --> 01:46:37,012
Can not be!

1358
01:46:37,462 --> 01:46:39,543
They were killing each other.

1359
01:46:39,795 --> 01:46:42,326
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1360
01:46:42,606 --> 01:46:44,192
Children!

1361
01:46:44,427 --> 01:46:46,773
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1362
01:46:47,021 --> 01:46:49,348
Diana, people... I...

1363
01:46:49,606 --> 01:46:51,150
She was right.

1364
01:46:51,677 --> 01:46:52,686
My mother was right.

1365
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:54,732
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1366
01:46:54,934 --> 01:46:56,628
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1367
01:46:56,874 --> 01:46:59,431
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1368
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,326
Maybe we don't!

1369
01:47:02,987 --> 01:47:05,155
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1370
01:47:06,152 --> 01:47:08,966
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1371
01:47:10,451 --> 01:47:13,933
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that I was one bad guy to blame?

1372
01:47:14,564 --> 01:47:16,238
It's not!

1373
01:47:18,409 --> 01:47:20,089
We are all to blame.

1374
01:47:20,363 --> 01:47:21,364
I am not.

1375
01:47:22,973 --> 01:47:24,575
But maybe I am!

1376
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:29,453
Please.

1377
01:47:29,814 --> 01:47:31,673
If you believe that this
war should stop...

1378
01:47:31,674 --> 01:47:33,490
...if you want to stop it...

1379
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,263
...help me stop it right now.

1380
01:47:35,271 --> 01:47:36,572
Because...if.

1381
01:47:37,971 --> 01:47:43,276
If you don't, there will be thousands
more. Please, please come with me.

1382
01:47:43,301 --> 01:47:44,784
I have to go.

1383
01:47:51,305 --> 01:47:52,918
I have to go.

1384
01:48:04,741 --> 01:48:05,777
Hey!

1385
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,625
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1386
01:48:11,768 --> 01:48:14,580
- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?

1387
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,607
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1388
01:48:16,869 --> 01:48:19,203
...but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1389
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,840
How are we gonna get in there?

1390
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:23,674
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1391
01:48:23,903 --> 01:48:24,904
Come on!

1392
01:48:38,505 --> 01:48:40,250
Who's there?

1393
01:48:52,723 --> 01:48:54,633
Sir Patrick.

1394
01:48:55,342 --> 01:48:59,673
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1395
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:04,701
They only deserve destruction.

1396
01:49:06,064 --> 01:49:07,532
You...

1397
01:49:09,206 --> 01:49:11,165
You are him.

1398
01:49:14,633 --> 01:49:16,037
I am.

1399
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:21,050
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1400
01:49:41,694 --> 01:49:43,259
What is that?

1401
01:49:44,552 --> 01:49:45,870
Future.

1402
01:49:50,585 --> 01:49:52,591
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1403
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:58,360
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1404
01:49:58,595 --> 01:50:03,119
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1405
01:50:05,434 --> 01:50:09,105
They always been and
always will be...

1406
01:50:09,285 --> 01:50:13,246
...weak, cruel, selfish...

1407
01:50:13,346 --> 01:50:16,620
...and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1408
01:50:25,906 --> 01:50:27,356
All I ever wanted was...

1409
01:50:27,357 --> 01:50:32,416
...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1410
01:50:34,393 --> 01:50:35,538
But they refused.

1411
01:50:35,864 --> 01:50:37,105
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1412
01:50:37,266 --> 01:50:38,764
So I destroyed them.

1413
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:40,797
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1414
01:50:40,835 --> 01:50:42,867
...and I am here
to complete her...

1415
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,471
The God Killer...

1416
01:50:55,170 --> 01:50:57,192
My dear Child..

1417
01:50:58,519 --> 01:51:01,041
...that's not the God Killer.

1418
01:51:03,535 --> 01:51:05,036
You are.

1419
01:51:07,625 --> 01:51:10,763
Only a God can kill another God.

1420
01:51:11,807 --> 01:51:15,704
Zeus left the child he had
with the queen of the Amazon.

1421
01:51:15,931 --> 01:51:18,204
...As a weapon to
use against me.

1422
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:20,102
No. You liar.

1423
01:51:21,886 --> 01:51:24,199
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1424
01:51:26,502 --> 01:51:27,989
I am.

1425
01:51:54,393 --> 01:51:56,739
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1426
01:51:56,947 --> 01:51:59,415
I am the God of truth.

1427
01:52:00,948 --> 01:52:02,271
Mankind...

1428
01:52:02,905 --> 01:52:05,922
...Stole this world from us.

1429
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:11,426
They ruined it, day by day.

1430
01:52:11,427 --> 01:52:15,703
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1431
01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:19,925
...was left too weak to stop them.

1432
01:52:20,852 --> 01:52:24,478
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1433
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:26,631
...whispering into their ears.

1434
01:52:26,632 --> 01:52:31,451
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1435
01:52:32,365 --> 01:52:33,961
...weapons...

1436
01:52:36,623 --> 01:52:39,160
...but I don't
make them use them.

1437
01:52:40,219 --> 01:52:42,168
They start these
wars on their own.

1438
01:52:43,164 --> 01:52:46,982
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1439
01:52:47,256 --> 01:52:49,501
...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.

1440
01:52:51,559 --> 01:52:53,655
But it has never been enough.

1441
01:52:55,093 --> 01:52:56,192
Until you.

1442
01:52:58,842 --> 01:53:03,096
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1443
01:53:03,674 --> 01:53:06,806
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1444
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:10,883
...what the other
gods could not...

1445
01:53:12,257 --> 01:53:16,770
...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1446
01:53:17,043 --> 01:53:20,975
...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1447
01:53:21,196 --> 01:53:23,761
...destruction they bring.

1448
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:29,347
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1449
01:53:30,951 --> 01:53:32,681
Forever.

1450
01:53:35,572 --> 01:53:37,055
I...

1451
01:53:41,851 --> 01:53:44,585
I can never be a part of that.

1452
01:53:47,707 --> 01:53:50,483
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1453
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:52,863
But if I must...

1454
01:54:02,456 --> 01:54:04,311
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1455
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:06,084
Sammy, let's go!

1456
01:54:06,524 --> 01:54:08,012
Get these things out of here.

1457
01:54:37,947 --> 01:54:42,391
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1458
01:55:07,421 --> 01:55:09,906
Oh my God!

1459
01:55:10,379 --> 01:55:11,807
What are we gonna do?

1460
01:55:13,565 --> 01:55:15,658
There is not much we can do...

1461
01:55:15,805 --> 01:55:17,434
...if that's who I think it is.

1462
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:24,658
But we can stop that plane.

1463
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:39,760
If we could get on the radio...

1464
01:55:39,761 --> 01:55:42,346
...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1465
01:55:42,371 --> 01:55:45,647
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1466
01:55:45,672 --> 01:55:46,591
We gotta ground it!

1467
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,407
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1468
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:50,867
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1469
01:55:57,901 --> 01:55:59,844
Is it flammable, Chief?

1470
01:55:59,869 --> 01:56:03,347
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1471
01:56:10,488 --> 01:56:12,918
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1472
01:56:12,943 --> 01:56:15,095
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1473
01:56:17,117 --> 01:56:18,118
Come on!

1474
01:57:00,732 --> 01:57:03,156
Come on! This way! Steve!

1475
01:57:12,722 --> 01:57:14,569
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1476
01:57:14,983 --> 01:57:16,457
Steve!

1477
01:57:59,375 --> 01:58:02,501
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1478
01:58:28,961 --> 01:58:32,305
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1479
01:58:35,613 --> 01:58:37,369
Or you will die.

1480
01:58:47,432 --> 01:58:49,784
Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1481
01:58:52,966 --> 01:58:54,964
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1482
01:59:20,024 --> 01:59:22,769
Is that all you have to offer?

1483
01:59:39,065 --> 01:59:42,986
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1484
01:59:43,823 --> 01:59:45,532
Give up, Diana.

1485
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,222
Chief! Anything left?

1486
01:59:51,247 --> 01:59:52,182
I got nothing.

1487
01:59:52,207 --> 01:59:53,513
- Anything!
- No!

1488
02:00:11,353 --> 02:00:12,354
Steve.

1489
02:00:58,829 --> 02:01:00,281
Steve.

1490
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:07,179
No!

1491
02:01:40,399 --> 02:01:43,001
Yes, Diana!

1492
02:01:43,403 --> 02:01:45,969
Take them all!

1493
02:01:46,314 --> 02:01:49,400
Finally you see.

1494
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:52,399
Look at this world.

1495
02:01:52,698 --> 02:01:55,514
Mankind did this, not me.

1496
02:01:57,299 --> 02:01:59,372
They are ugly...

1497
02:01:59,397 --> 02:02:01,211
...filled with hatred...

1498
02:02:01,512 --> 02:02:02,595
...weak...

1499
02:02:02,996 --> 02:02:05,720
...Just like your
captain Trevor.

1500
02:02:06,288 --> 02:02:12,002
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1501
02:02:12,389 --> 02:02:13,974
Pathetic!

1502
02:02:15,348 --> 02:02:17,091
He deserved to burn!

1503
02:02:28,101 --> 02:02:32,237
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1504
02:02:40,644 --> 02:02:44,643
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1505
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:50,306
...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1506
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:53,957
Destroy her, Diana.

1507
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:58,399
You know that she deserves.
That they all do.

1508
02:03:01,621 --> 02:03:02,982
Do it!

1509
02:03:07,790 --> 02:03:09,492
Diana!

1510
02:03:12,701 --> 02:03:14,135
Diana...

1511
02:03:23,665 --> 02:03:24,666
What?

1512
02:03:25,166 --> 02:03:26,770
We have to go.

1513
02:03:29,516 --> 02:03:31,009
What are you saying?

1514
02:03:31,575 --> 02:03:32,621
Steve...

1515
02:03:33,453 --> 02:03:35,585
...Whatever it is, I can do it.

1516
02:03:35,911 --> 02:03:36,759
No.. No..

1517
02:03:36,886 --> 02:03:38,275
- Let me do it.
- No.

1518
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,152
It has to be me.

1519
02:03:40,177 --> 02:03:41,831
It has to be me.

1520
02:03:42,151 --> 02:03:45,399
I could save today.
You can save the world.

1521
02:03:54,217 --> 02:03:56,657
I wish we had more time.

1522
02:03:56,902 --> 02:03:59,681
What?
What are you saying?

1523
02:04:02,589 --> 02:04:03,590
I love you!

1524
02:04:15,532 --> 02:04:17,015
You are wrong about them.

1525
02:04:26,787 --> 02:04:28,450
They are everything you say...

1526
02:04:29,318 --> 02:04:30,907
...but so much more.

1527
02:04:31,177 --> 02:04:32,474
Lies!

1528
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:02,350
They do not deserve
your protection!

1529
02:05:04,126 --> 02:05:05,213
It's not about deserving.

1530
02:05:10,088 --> 02:05:11,992
It's about what you believe.

1531
02:05:15,628 --> 02:05:17,008
And I believe in love.

1532
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:22,289
Then I will destroy you!

1533
02:05:49,507 --> 02:05:51,236
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1534
02:09:23,404 --> 02:09:25,797
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1535
02:09:26,886 --> 02:09:30,627
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1536
02:09:31,381 --> 02:09:35,256
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1537
02:09:36,105 --> 02:09:38,370
<i>...and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1538
02:09:39,085 --> 02:09:41,371
<i>...there will always be both.</i>

1539
02:09:42,077 --> 02:09:44,933
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1540
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:48,629
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat..</i>

1541
02:09:49,975 --> 02:09:51,219
<i>And now I know...</i>

1542
02:09:52,391 --> 02:09:56,934
<i>...that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1543
02:09:58,656 --> 02:10:00,359
<i>So I stay...</i>

1544
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:02,780
<i>...I fight and I give...</i>

1545
02:10:05,768 --> 02:10:07,744
<i>...for the world I know can be.</i>

1546
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:13,988
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1547
02:10:16,859 --> 02:10:18,202
<i>Forever.</i>
