1
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,200
It was good...

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,078
that you called us.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,113
I don't know what happened.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,114
We were at the bar...

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,355
drinking...

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,199
having fun...

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,918
I don't even know...

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,594
how I got here.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,120
Come on, come on.
She's been under too long.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,189
You're the only one who can help me.

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,279
Come on, come on.

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,757
Tell me what I need to know.

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,115
Come on.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,353
They'll kill me.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,358
You asked for my help.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,710
Come on.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,590
Come on.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,874
The contact in Minsk...

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,555
The name, pal. Give us the name.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,832
Dimitri...

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,875
Miediev.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,790
What now?

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,235
Now we drink.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,039
Za druziye.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,035
Get rid of that scum.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,590
Hold her still.

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,155
Come on.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,789
Did we get it?

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,270
We got it.

30
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,231
Would you like to watch a movie,
Mr. Rosen?

31
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,469
No, thank you.

32
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,719
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Phelps?

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,279
No, I prefer the theater.

34
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,953
Would you consider the cinema
of the Ukraine?

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,398
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.

36
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,430
Thank you.

37
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,357
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,239
The man you're looking at
is Alexander Golitsyn...

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,789
an attachÃ© at our embassy in Prague.

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,718
He is also a traitor.

41
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,712
He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list...

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,390
a record of all our deep-cover agents
working in Eastern Europe.

43
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,398
For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.

44
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,633
The portion that Golitsyn already has
contains code names

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,836
but this half is useless
without its mate

46
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,474
which matches the code names
with their true names.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,231
It is this half which Golitsyn plans
to steal from the embassy

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,755
during a reception tomorrow night.

49
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,400
Your mission, Jim,
should you choose to accept it

50
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,518
is to obtain photographic proof
of the theft,

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,554
shadow Golitsyn to his buyer,
and apprehend them both.

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,989
I've already dispatched a team,
selected from your usual group.

53
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,151
Sarah Davies is already undercover.

54
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,518
Jack Harmon can hack
into any security system.

55
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,830
Hannah Williams
will handle surveillance.

56
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,594
Your wife, Claire, will cover transport,

57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,275
and Ethan Hunt will be
your point man, as usual.

58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,069
He is now in Kiev
and will rendezvous in Prague

59
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,071
at a safe house of your choosing.

60
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,392
As always, should you or any member
of your IM Force

61
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,278
be caught or killed,

62
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,876
the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.

63
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,953
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,030
Good luck, Jim.

65
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,833
A very straightforward objective.

66
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,469
We photograph Golitsyn stealing
the NOC list,

67
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,597
follow him to his buyer,

68
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,757
apprehend both of them.

69
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,675
Now here's the plot.

70
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,035
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character, during a party,

71
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,316
hide in plain sight,
highest possible profile.

72
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,032
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,514
Sarah, you're at the party already

74
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,671
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

75
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,792
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

76
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,400
I haven't a thing to wear.

77
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,598
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,714
You'll mark Golitsyn,
hand him off to Hannah.

79
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,314
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

80
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,392
- Find yourself a perch and stay on him.
- No problem.

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,879
- Jack?
- Yeah?

82
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,556
Fingerprint security, there's access
through the elevator shaft here.

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,873
So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.

84
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,519
Open, close, get out.

85
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,639
Zero residual presence.

86
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,073
Claire, you're cover outside
in the vehicle.

87
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,913
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,674
- You two stay on him from there.
- Okay.

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,513
Anything goes wrong, I call abort.

90
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,955
Everybody walk away immediately.

91
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,318
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m. That's 0400.

92
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,273
Any questions?

93
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,155
Yeah.

94
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,993
Can we get a cappuccino machine in here?

95
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,519
'Cause I don't know what you call this.

96
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,637
I call it cruel and unusual.

97
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,075
- I made that coffee.
- Exactly.

98
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,752
Is it possible it's even worse than
that sludge you made

99
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,473
- in that barn in Kiev?
- Thank you.

100
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,392
Take it easy on my wife's coffee,
will you?

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,392
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- Missed you too, Ethan.

102
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,676
Were you off on one of your
cushy recruiting assignments again?

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,671
Where'd they put you up this time?
The Plaza?

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,153
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

105
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,475
What a shame.

106
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,439
- 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

107
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,794
Fat expense account.

108
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,679
- Now he's getting soft in his old age.
- Yeah, he is. Look at him.

109
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,550
Okay, listen.

110
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,238
If that list gets out into the open

111
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,989
the names of our agents
in every country in Eastern Europe

112
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,350
will be up for grabs
to the highest bidders.

113
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,793
Third world terrorists, arms dealers,
drug lords,

114
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,111
any and everybody who'd love
to get rid of long-term covers like us.

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,670
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

116
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,792
So I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

117
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,633
Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.

118
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,474
There's a camera built
right into the bridge.

119
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,952
Whatever you see, it sees,
and then it transmits it back here.

120
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,630
See?

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,513
Can you hear me?

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,160
- Of course, I can hear you.
- No, in your...

123
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
You need an earpiece.

124
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,679
You have lovely eyes.

125
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,320
- Can you hear me now?
- Loud and clear.

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,079
If he has a car waiting and he rolls,

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,674
you stay with him no matter what.

128
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,910
You should take the afternoon,

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,752
drive the streets
around this little quarter.

130
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,553
They're confusing as hell.

131
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,911
What do you think
I've been doing all morning?

132
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,232
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

133
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,357
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?

134
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,916
Not this week.
This week, he's fly-fishing

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,150
at the Oughterard Slough
in County Kildare.

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,709
- With one of our best Irish guides.
- Yep.

137
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,950
And he won't be back anytime soon.

138
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,958
Irrelevant at best
or unconstitutional at worst.

139
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,678
With all due respect, Senator,

140
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,434
it sounds as if you want
to lead the kind of charge

141
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,717
that Senator Frank Church
led in the 1970s

142
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,950
and in the process destroy

143
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,110
the intelligence capability
of this country.

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,235
No, John.

145
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,311
I want to know who these people are

146
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,477
and how they're spending
our taxpayers' money.

147
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,996
We were living in a democracy
the last time I checked.

148
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,680
Stick of gum, right?

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,875
- No?
- No.

150
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,112
Red light, green light.

151
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,472
You come up against a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together...

152
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,436
hasta lasagna, don't get any on ya.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,513
You'll have about five seconds.

154
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,869
Just don't chew it.

155
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,472
Ethan, Jack's inside.

156
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,235
Let's go.

157
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,390
How do you do, Senator?

158
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,039
I'm Rand Housman,
the ambassador's aide.

159
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,793
- Hello, Mr. Housman.
- How was the opera?

160
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,113
It was boring.

161
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,829
Let me see if I can steer you
through this reception line.

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,313
- How do you do, Senator?
- His wife, Mrs. Reid.

163
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,232
Windows open by 2300.

164
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,749
- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague.
- How do you do, sir?

165
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,433
And Mrs. Brandl.

166
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,831
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

167
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,275
Why, of course I do.
How are you, Miss Norman?

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,715
He's in pocket, on the stairway.

169
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,159
Mr. Golitsyn, nice to see you.

170
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,195
Hannah...

171
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,955
Pull the shade.

172
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,874
Sarah, mark the package
and go to tunnel.

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,355
Your advance team mentioned
that you'd like a tour of the facilities

174
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,636
so I've gone ahead and set one up.
Excuse me.

175
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,949
This way. Thank you.

176
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,200
Oh, great.

177
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,910
Which leads to the denied area

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,311
which is the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

179
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,759
Governor's in position now.

180
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,035
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- I'm sorry.

181
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,556
As you can see, there's a Marine guard
and video surveillance

182
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,029
and this place is like...
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

183
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,918
I know it's in here somewhere.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,311
Now, Sergeant, why are you not
in your uniform this evening?

185
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,278
We've been ordered to wear
civilian clothes this evening, sir.

186
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,155
Be right back.

187
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,112
Tell me, Senator, do you not have
someone on your staff named Jack?

188
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,957
Jack?
Well, I think we did have a Jack.

189
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,510
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall, constantly late,

190
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,439
behind in his work.

191
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,398
We were forced to tie him behind
one of my best stallions

192
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,595
and drag him around

193
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,557
my barn for a few days.

194
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,109
Relax your crap, Foghorn.
I'm working on it.

195
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,120
Sorry, sir.

196
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,834
- Thank you.
- Have a nice evening.

197
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,910
Thank you.

198
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,752
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

199
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,995
Higher.

200
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,790
He's heading to the denied area.

201
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,555
Get moving, Ethan.

202
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,075
He's rolling to you.

203
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,790
Jack.

204
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,629
Jack, we're in position here.

205
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,437
- Jack.
- I didn't touch it.

206
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,433
What about my coat?
I'm going to freeze.

207
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,749
Jack, open the doors.

208
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,792
He's in the box, Ethan. He's in the box.

209
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,670
Okay.

210
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,114
We're taking Golitsyn's exit.

211
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,918
- Open these doors.
- Don't have it.

212
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,310
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

213
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,830
Go.

214
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,557
- He's got it.
- All right.

215
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,799
- Saved your ass again, Jack.
- Give me a break, pops.

216
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,793
Such a nice ass.

217
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,878
And a lonely ass.

218
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,678
- Transport in five minutes.
- Yes, indeed.

219
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,189
Jack, we're in position.
Open the doors and let the package roll.

220
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,677
Roger that. Opening doors now.

221
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,595
Stairway, you're wrapped.

222
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,314
Go to transport

223
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,390
Hey.

224
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,555
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

225
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,554
I don't have control, Jack.

226
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,470
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.

227
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,470
- Cut the power, Jack.
- Come on, Jack.

228
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,510
- Cut the power.
- Jack?

229
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,795
Jack?

230
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,675
Jack?

231
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,035
Jack?

232
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,870
Jack?

233
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,669
Jack, do you copy?

234
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,233
- Jack?
- Man down, Ethan.

235
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,474
Man down.

236
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,037
Ethan, stay where you are.

237
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,314
I'm coming to you.

238
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,232
The package is out in the open.

239
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,350
Jim,

240
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,079
he's in the open.

241
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,195
En route.

242
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,389
Jim, he's in the open.

243
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,751
Jim, the package is in the open.

244
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,073
- I've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?

245
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,914
No. Abort.

246
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,709
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

247
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,995
I can't do that.

248
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,039
We're being ambushed, Ethan. Abort.
That's an order.

249
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,760
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.

250
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,036
No, damn it! No! I said abort!

251
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,711
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming to you.

252
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,677
Jim gave an abort.
We should walk away.

253
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,515
No. We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?

254
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,795
Now, go.

255
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,230
Where are you?

256
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,512
About 200 yards from the bridge.

257
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,869
They're covering this frequency.

258
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,559
Cut all radio communication.

259
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,913
Repeat. Cut all radio communication.

260
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,070
Ethan!

261
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,030
Ethan...

262
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,111
Sarah, abort.

263
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,278
Repeat, abort.

264
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,955
Abort!

265
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,510
Do you read me?

266
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,797
Sarah? God!

267
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,589
Claire. Oh, my God.

268
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,675
My God.

269
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,195
Oh, no. Sarah.

270
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,909
My God.

271
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,159
Satcom seven.

272
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,553
- Central Europe, unsecured.
- Designator?

273
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,913
- Bravo-echo-one-one.
- Switching.

274
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,753
- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.

275
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,758
Okay, go ahead.

276
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,874
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

277
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,238
What? Who's dead?

278
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,073
- My team. My team is dead!
- Jesus.

279
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,113
Golitsyn's gone.

280
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,679
They knew we were coming, man.

281
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,479
They knew we were coming,
and the disk is gone.

282
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,950
Are you intact?

283
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,635
The disk is gone, did you...
Do you read me? The list is in the open!

284
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,114
Listen, I read you.

285
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,712
Let's just bring you in safely
and then we'll worry about that, okay?

286
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,913
Were you followed?

287
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,636
- I don't think so. I don't think so.
- Don't think. Be sure.

288
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,635
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

289
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,996
Okay. Location green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.

290
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,716
- You're in Prague?
- One hour.

291
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,029
I am...

292
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,711
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

293
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,437
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you, Ethan,

294
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,555
personally as well as professionally.

295
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,955
Yeah.

296
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,230
Here's a passport, visa. Usual drill.

297
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,038
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada, debrief you at Langley.

298
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,549
Throw the Prague police a bone or two.

299
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,711
You know, toss them a few suspects.

300
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,315
You follow me?

301
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,509
Yeah, I follow.

302
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,037
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

303
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,998
You mean, I've lost enough agents
for one night.

304
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,234
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

305
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,320
Who else is left?

306
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,112
Yeah. I see your point.

307
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,829
Why was there another team?

308
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,230
What?

309
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,554
Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

310
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,240
I don't quite follow you.

311
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,111
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.

312
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,752
The drunk Russians on the embankment
at seven and eight o'clock,

313
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,275
the couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at nine and eleven.

314
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,193
The waiter standing behind Hannah
at the top of the stairs.

315
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,839
Bow tie, 12 o' clock.

316
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,874
The other IMF team.

317
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,079
You're worried about me. Why?

318
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,597
Well, for a little over two years,

319
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,514
we've been spotting serious blowback
in IMF operations.

320
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,238
We have a penetration.

321
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,435
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet

322
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,750
from a Czech we know as Max.

323
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,679
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

324
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,517
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts,

325
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,197
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

326
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,555
This time, he'd gotten to someone
on the inside.

327
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,989
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

328
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,115
An operation he referred to as job 314,

329
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,158
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

330
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,434
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

331
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,473
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

332
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,074
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

333
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,639
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

334
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,880
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

335
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,710
Yeah.

336
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,594
The mole's deep inside

337
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,598
and like you said

338
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,714
you survived.

339
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,391
I want to show you something, Ethan.

340
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,873
Since your father's death,

341
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,032
your family's farm has been
in receivership

342
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,518
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

343
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,196
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.

344
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,320
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be a very expensive proposition.

345
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,395
So...

346
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,592
Why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

347
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,271
I can understand you're very upset.

348
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

349
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,990
Allright, Hunt. Enough is enough.

350
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,435
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed.

351
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,670
And you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

352
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,837
You want to shake hands with the devil,
that's fine with me.

353
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,752
I just want to make sure
that you do it in hell.

354
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,358
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

355
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,559
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet

356
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,995
from a Czech we know as Max.

357
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,033
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

358
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,834
An operation he referred to as job 314.

359
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,078
Job 314.

360
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,913
Job 314. I cant...

361
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,590
Job...

362
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,833
Job 3:14?

363
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,033
Job 3:14.

364
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,397
You son of a bitch.

365
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,036
Must meet to discuss ASAP.

366
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,189
Ethan,

367
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,112
what are you doing?

368
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,476
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you on the bridge,

369
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,631
but you weren't there.

370
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,999
Ethan.

371
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,509
Ethan.

372
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,915
Ethan?

373
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,199
Don't move.

374
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,794
Ethan.

375
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,319
Ethan, it's okay. Just calm down.

376
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,235
It's Claire.

377
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,110
- It's okay.
- You were in the car.

378
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,918
No, I wasn't.

379
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,234
I heard on the radio...

380
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,597
Shut up, I saw you. You were in the car.

381
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,352
No, I got out of the car.

382
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,432
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was just...

383
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,399
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.

384
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,279
- There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?

385
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,756
Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead!

386
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,237
They're dead! They're all dead!

387
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,949
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead?

388
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,350
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...

389
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,230
Take off your coat.

390
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,991
- Where were you?
- I...

391
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,913
Where were you?

392
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,396
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

393
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,949
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?

394
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,197
- Did they send you for me?
- Who's they?

395
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,873
Did they send you?

396
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,911
Look, who sent you? Who sent you?

397
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,150
No one sent me. No one sent me.

398
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,311
We were supposed to be
back here at 4:00.

399
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,231
4:00 if we abort.
We don't return here until 4:00, 0400.

400
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,312
4:00 a.m. 4:00, Ethan, 4:00.

401
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,714
If we abort...

402
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,314
4:00 a.m.

403
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,639
I've been disavowed.

404
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,833
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.

405
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,355
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

406
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,310
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing,

407
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,796
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max,

408
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,234
for the last two years

409
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,558
to get him our NOC list.

410
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,475
What are you gonna do?

411
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,790
I'm gonna get it for him.

412
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,109
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

413
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,309
Whoever the mole is,

414
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,873
I think goes by the name of Job.

415
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,269
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list,

416
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,355
he'll find me.

417
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,239
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna talk
fo Kittridge myself.

418
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,630
And I'm gonna tell him
you had nothing to do with this.

419
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,916
Claire, if you're not dead,

420
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,636
he's gonna assume you're with me.

421
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,753
The message is for Job.

422
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,631
That's right, and I'm gonna answer it.

423
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,995
Excuse me.

424
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,158
Can I trouble you for a match?

425
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,633
Would you remove your hat, please?

426
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,200
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

427
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,032
The price of admission.

428
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,472
- Thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood.

429
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,039
No one sees Max.

430
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,313
Then what the hell am I doing here?

431
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,160
Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.

432
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,073
Well, I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

433
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,357
Well, if Max doesn't like
what you have to say,

434
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,876
you'll be wearing
that shroud indefinitely.

435
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,318
I'm willing to take the chance.

436
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,240
Very well.

437
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,190
Who are you and what are you doing here?

438
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,436
I need $150,000.

439
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,269
Oh, really?

440
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,319
And you thought

441
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,869
if you simply showed up,
I might give it to you?

442
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,510
Why not? You gave Job $125,000.

443
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,875
The penny drops. You are not Job.

444
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,674
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

445
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,997
Then there was its tone,
aggressive but playful.

446
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,037
Job is not playful.

447
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,758
So you are something of a paradox.

448
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,956
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

449
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,678
Whether you like a paradox.

450
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,838
I want $150,000 today.

451
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,230
No, no.
That's quite out of the question.

452
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,237
The disk Job sold you, it's worthless.

453
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,918
I's bait, part of an internal
mole hunt.

454
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,357
And how might you know that?

455
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,277
Are you another Company man?

456
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,995
Like Job?

457
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,430
We're asking about you.

458
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,951
I'm NOC. Was.

459
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,957
Now, disavowed.

460
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,480
Why, may I ask?

461
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,475
That is the question I want to ask Job.

462
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,319
I don't know Job any more
than Job knows me.

463
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,959
Even so.

464
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,436
I'm sure you could arrange
an introduction.

465
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,794
Why should I?

466
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,633
Because I can deliver
the actual NOC list.

467
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,154
The one you have is
not only worthless,

468
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,038
it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device

469
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,031
to pinpoint your exact location.

470
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,834
Boot it up.

471
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,197
In anywhere from 30 seconds
to 10 minutes...

472
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,318
you'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like jackrabbits.

473
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,997
It's easy to say the disk is worthless

474
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,356
when you say I can't look
at the information

475
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,229
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.

476
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,398
Okay, use it.

477
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,556
But I'd suggest you pack first.

478
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,994
26, 27. So far, so good.

479
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,637
Not so good for you, my friend.

480
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,155
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

481
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,119
32 and 33.

482
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,352
Doesn't mean it's a signal.
Could just be the hard drive heating up.

483
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,559
44 and 45.

484
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,910
Now.

485
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,158
Man's gone black, Barnes.

486
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,551
He's under until he decides to surface.

487
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,193
Look, we can use somebody
at the embassy.

488
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,509
Involve the local authorities.

489
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,349
- We can cut off his transportation...
- What can we do, Barnes?

490
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,272
Put a guy at the airport?

491
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,552
How many identities
do you think Hunt has?

492
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,551
How many times has
he slipped past customs

493
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,472
in how many countries?

494
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,957
These guys are trained to be ghosts.

495
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,792
We taught them to do it,
for Christ's sake.

496
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,473
Well, what do you suggest?

497
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,036
Let's not waste time chasing after him,
just make him come to us.

498
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,392
Everybody has pressure points, Barnes.

499
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,632
You find something
that's personally important to him

500
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,313
and you squeeze.

501
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,949
Gunther will never let me have
one of his apartments again.

502
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,914
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You are a good sport.

503
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,399
Thanks, Max.

504
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,994
Or is it Maxine?

505
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,398
I don't have to tell you

506
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,393
what a comfort anonymity can be
in my profession.

507
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,911
It's like a warm blanket.

508
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,111
My deal with Job was subject
to a successful boot scan.

509
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,589
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

510
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,994
What was your deal with Job?

511
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,474
$6 million.

512
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,512
I'll give you the same,
but I want the complete list now,

513
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,034
not just Eastern Europe.

514
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,111
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

515
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,794
- I want the entire list.
- $10 million.

516
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,354
$10 million in negotiable
US Treasury certificates

517
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,551
in bearer form, coupons attached.

518
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,710
And one more thing.

519
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,430
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

520
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,519
Max made a deal with you?

521
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,957
I deliver the NOC list,
Max delivers Job.

522
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,639
We've got 75 rounds for your Beretta
but only 20 for the SIG Sauer.

523
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,760
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor,

524
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,271
plenty of passports, and...

525
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,309
What?

526
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,191
You said it yourself.

527
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,558
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

528
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,555
Are you sure about this?

529
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,073
Jim was my husband.

530
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,869
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

531
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,833
We're gonna need some help.

532
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,719
We don't have a lot of time,
so they're gonna have to be local.

533
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,515
What kind of help?

534
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,393
Simple game.

535
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,678
Four players.

536
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,951
Exfil opens the pocket.

537
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,792
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

538
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,360
Bank?

539
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,354
IMF mainframe.

540
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,479
Where exactly is it?

541
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,834
In Langley.

542
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,315
In Langley?

543
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,278
The one in Virginia, Langley?

544
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,360
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

545
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,949
Is he serious?

546
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,069
Always.

547
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,273
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

548
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,113
I can fly a helicopter right in
through the lobby

549
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,634
and set it down inside the vault,

550
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,793
and it would be a hell of a lot easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

551
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,200
What are we downloading?

552
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,798
- Information.
- What kind?

553
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,029
Profitable.

554
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,999
Payment on delivery.

555
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,635
I don't know.

556
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,189
I just don't know.

557
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,396
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

558
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,831
What did they used to call you,
the Net Ranger?

559
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,719
Phineas Phreak?

560
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,632
The only man alive
who actually hacked NATO Ghost Com.

561
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,196
There was never any physical evidence
that I had anything to do with that.

562
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,510
With that...

563
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,990
That exceptional piece of work.

564
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,314
You don't know what you're missing.

565
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,316
- This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
- Y'all are kidding yourselves.

566
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,114
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU-III...

567
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,350
Krieger can get it, right?

568
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,595
May take a little time.

569
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,239
What the hell do you mean,
a little time?

570
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,433
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.

571
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,117
Thinking-machine laptops.

572
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,434
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes

573
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,478
with the artificial intelligence
RISC chip.

574
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,630
24 hours.

575
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,070
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

576
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,674
Luther, I guess you're
all out of excuses.

577
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,710
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

578
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,800
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

579
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,517
It's in what we call the stand-alone,

580
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,959
which means I'd have to be physically
at the terminal.

581
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,514
Relax, Luther.

582
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,759
It's much worse than you think.

583
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,236
The terminal is
in a black vault lockdown.

584
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,393
The only person allowed in the room

585
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,154
has to pass through a series
of security checks.

586
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,594
William Donloe.

587
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,357
The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.

588
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,032
This only gets him into the outer room.

589
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,399
Next, he has to pass a retinal scan.

590
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,517
And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures

591
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,950
are only deactivated
by a double-electronic keycard

592
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,795
which we won't have.

593
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,510
Now, inside the black vault

594
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,393
there are three systems operating...

595
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,676
whenever the technician
is out of the room.

596
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,633
The first is sound-sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.

597
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,199
The second system
detects any increase in temperature.

598
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,400
Even the body heat
of an unauthorized person in the room

599
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,836
will trigger it if the temperature rises
just a single degree.

600
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,038
Now, that temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning

601
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,272
coming in through an overhead duct,
30 feet above the floor.

602
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,714
That vent is guarded by a laser net.

603
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,953
The third system is on the floor,
and is pressure-sensitive.

604
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,638
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.

605
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,197
And any one of these systems,
if set off...

606
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,840
will activate an automatic lockdown.

607
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,960
Now, believe me
when I tell you, gentlemen...

608
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,752
all three systems are state-of-the-art.

609
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,032
And you really think we can do this?

610
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,195
We're going to do it.

611
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,874
We picked up alarms
in Sector 3, 7, and 12.

612
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,679
Yeah, that's what I've got too.
What sector's the air conditioning?

613
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,354
21, but there's no alarm in Sector 21.

614
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,238
No, I gotta get in there
and shut it down.

615
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,998
I'm sorry,
but nobody gets into any sector...

616
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,115
where an alarm hasn't gone off.

617
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,038
You wanna blow the fire
through this whole building?

618
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,760
Look, no one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off...

619
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,911
- And it hasn't gone off in 21.
- Wait.

620
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,554
It's gone off. Let's go.

621
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,630
Let's move.

622
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,515
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

623
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,830
21's through here.

624
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,710
He's recruiting.

625
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,030
- For what purpose?
- Survival.

626
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,592
Too shortsighted. This guy initiates.
He's proactive.

627
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,071
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?

628
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,515
And Barnes, what the hell's that noise?

629
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,035
Fire alarm, Gene.

630
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,879
Do we have to evacuate?

631
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,309
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

632
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,120
Krieger! Zero body count.

633
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,115
We'll see.

634
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,715
Hi there.

635
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,719
One, two, three.

636
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,916
Toast. Toast.

637
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,837
- Check.
- Good.

638
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,479
Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

639
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,519
Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?

640
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,515
Damn.

641
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,480
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.

642
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,069
He's rolling to you.

643
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,318
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

644
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,715
William Donloe.

645
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,989
Outer room.

646
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,074
He's coming in the vault

647
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,395
Come on, move.

648
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,719
He's in the bathroom.

649
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,750
A-W-9...

650
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,390
6-B-6.

651
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,234
Holy mother of God.

652
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,195
The NOC list.

653
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,239
He's at the vault.

654
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,315
Four yellows.

655
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,710
One red.

656
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,150
Get moving.

657
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,710
Toast.

658
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,430
Toast.

659
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,515
Merci.

660
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,549
Oh, my God.

661
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,070
Yeah.

662
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,359
It's for you.

663
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,435
Kittridge.

664
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,872
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops, you understand?

665
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,598
It never happened.

666
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,670
What about him?

667
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,076
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

668
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,594
Just mail him his clothes.

669
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,035
You contacting your buyer?

670
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,395
Ethan.

671
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,709
Ethan.

672
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,510
Ethan.

673
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,591
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt.

674
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,551
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

675
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,920
My contact is extremely shy.

676
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,472
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders. Do you?

677
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,710
Not while I'm holding this.

678
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,197
- Krieger...
- Ta gueule.

679
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,875
Don't you mean this?

680
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,235
That's not the list.

681
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,560
Oh, what's the matter?
You, you've never seen this trick?

682
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,875
Where'd it go?

683
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,555
It's gone.

684
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,110
What?

685
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,875
- You.
- No.

686
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,950
No?

687
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,154
But not too far.

688
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,919
I know what you're thinking, Krieger.

689
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,718
You're thinking,
back in the computer room...

690
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,314
I was up here, he was down there.

691
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,474
Yes, and he was...

692
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,270
He was carrying two disks.

693
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,676
It's so hard
to keep track of these things.

694
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,915
Where is it?

695
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,840
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

696
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,154
Try any sleight of hand with my money,
I'll cut your throat.

697
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,554
You're off on one of your cushy
recruiting assignments again?

698
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,836
Yeah, where'd they put you up
this time, The Plaza?

699
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,433
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

700
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,640
I'm so sorry.

701
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,914
Krieger was my call.

702
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,155
I'm sorry, Ethan.

703
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,080
We did what we had to do.

704
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,638
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

705
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,713
Krieger did have the NOC list?

706
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,274
Now I want you to hold on to it.

707
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,475
What makes you trust me?

708
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,838
Because if you knew
what you were getting into...

709
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,910
you never would have done it.

710
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,316
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

711
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,155
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow,
on the train.

712
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,237
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.

713
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,075
What is the range of this thing?

714
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,279
It's hard to tell.
I'm gonna have to be close.

715
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,514
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

716
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,511
The unlikely setting,
a farm in the heartland of America...

717
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,159
the state of Wisconsin...

718
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,231
where federal agents claim to have found

719
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,880
the brains behind
an international drugs ring.

720
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,515
The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan Hunt

721
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,876
and her brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.

722
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,237
They were arrested this morning
by drug enforcement officers

723
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,833
in a major sting operation

724
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,878
designed to expose
the illegal manufacture

725
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,600
of the drug methcathinone,
known as khat.

726
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,672
I'm afraid what we have here is
a case of a naive and lonely widower...

727
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,795
Kittridge.

728
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,830
Kittridge.

729
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,957
I see you've been out
visiting the folks.

730
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,353
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

731
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,872
You've been watching a little TV,
have you?

732
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,149
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

733
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,192
- He's in England.
- Get MI5.

734
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,399
Ethan, I wanna assure you

735
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,916
that my first order of business
after you come in

736
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,470
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped

737
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,393
and eliminated completely
from their files.

738
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,869
Look, if you come in now,

739
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,316
we can plea down
the charges against you, as well.

740
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,112
Can ask you something, Kittridge?

741
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,194
Certainly, Ethan.

742
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,352
If you're dealing with someone...

743
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,910
who's crushed, stabbed...

744
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,949
shot, and detonated...

745
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,393
five members of his own IMF team...

746
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,871
how devastated
do you think you're gonna make him

747
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,157
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?

748
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,517
I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?

749
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,635
Lost him.

750
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,994
We needed three more seconds.

751
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,634
He wanted us to know he was in London.

752
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,119
You're a hard man to catch up with.

753
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,949
Next day I managed to drag myself
back to the safe house.

754
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,235
I must have just missed you.

755
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,472
Anyway, I checked our aliases.

756
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,113
And that's when you picked us up
in the States.

757
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,592
But you left before I could get there,
and I could check just so many places.

758
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,429
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

759
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,840
So I watched Europe.

760
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,792
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

761
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,596
You knew
I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.

762
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,557
Hey, I showed them to you.

763
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,510
I remember.

764
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,914
Jim, look, who do you think
you're kidding here?

765
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,310
A doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

766
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,913
I can sit up straight.

767
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,359
I just can't sit up straight very well.

768
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,554
Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.

769
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,510
Ethan...

770
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,713
I saw who shot me. I saw the mole.

771
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,878
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge.

772
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,433
Kittridge, Ethan.

773
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,838
Kittridge is the mole.

774
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,678
My God, of course. You're right.

775
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,793
He was at the embassy that night.

776
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,158
First, he took out Jack at the elevator.

777
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,839
He shot you on the bridge.

778
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,275
Ethan!

779
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,279
He must have had backup take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

780
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,999
How did he do Hannah?

781
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,792
No. No,
he could have done Hannah himself.

782
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,950
Why, Jim?

783
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,355
Why?

784
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,471
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable.

785
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,755
No more Cold War.

786
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,910
No more secrets
you keep from everyone but yourself.

787
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,195
Operations, you answer
to no one but yourself.

788
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,877
And then one day, you wake up,
the President of the United States is

789
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,712
running the country
without your permission.

790
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,638
The son of a bitch, how dare he?

791
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,038
Then you realize, it's over.

792
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,435
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

793
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,592
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

794
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:02,910
Kittridge.

795
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,714
We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch big time.

796
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,709
We won't have to. He'll come after us.

797
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,634
What's gonna make him do that?

798
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,911
What he didn't get in Prague.
The NOC list.

799
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,392
Jesus, Ethan.

800
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,389
Good for you.

801
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm meeting him tomorrow
on the TGV en route to Paris.

802
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,398
Tight security. No guns.

803
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,515
A real plus.

804
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,597
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list
to Max...

805
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,557
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

806
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,396
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

807
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,869
Krieger is gonna have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

808
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,470
Jim?

809
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,078
I was in a cafe waiting for you, Ethan.

810
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,029
And there she was...

811
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,473
standing in the rain,
alive and beautiful...

812
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,399
thinking I'm dead and gone.

813
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,080
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me

814
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,077
to keep going, get the job done.

815
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,439
She can't know about me, Ethan.

816
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,750
No one can, not till this is over.

817
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,470
You're probably right.

818
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,599
There's too much at stake.

819
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,999
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

820
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,719
- I'll call you from Paris.
- You got it.

821
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,470
What happened?

822
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,313
I sent the message to Max.

823
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,275
We're on for tomorrow.

824
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,475
Okay.

825
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,310
Come here.

826
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,630
Sir.

827
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,437
- What's this?
- Incoming, sir, for you.

828
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,160
X-ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

829
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,749
Gene?

830
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,913
- How long to the London Terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

831
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,638
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

832
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,352
- Yes?
- Give me Max.

833
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:41,350
It's him.

834
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,958
This was not what we discussed.

835
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,600
My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.

836
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,277
There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.

837
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,839
Tear it away, you'll find the disk.

838
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,718
Dear boy...

839
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,670
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

840
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,757
Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.

841
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,393
The mere possibility is
worth $10 million.

842
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,596
Baggage car, rack 3.

843
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,435
Silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

844
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,633
What about Job?

845
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,270
Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

846
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,714
What's the matter?

847
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,394
- It's not transmitting.
- Try it. Try it again.

848
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,915
Damn it, I've got to get this through
before we hit the Chunnel.

849
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,869
- What's the problem?
- Connection denied.

850
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,720
I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

851
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,791
I always check the batteries.

852
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,520
Don't you give me that.
Run it through from the top.

853
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,435
This is bullshit.

854
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,193
We don't even know what Max looks like.

855
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,158
Look, we don't need to know.

856
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,437
If he's got that list,
he's gonna want to check it.

857
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,749
And that means laptops.

858
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,353
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

859
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,670
Hello? Hello?

860
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,560
I can't hear anything.

861
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,953
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's just the battery is gone.

862
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,155
It's working.

863
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,319
He's in the baggage car.

864
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,709
Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.

865
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,074
I'm right behind you.

866
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,476
The money's in the baggage car.
I'll meet you there.

867
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,755
Barnes?

868
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,474
Ethan's right behind me.

869
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,470
Listen, Jim,
is it such a good idea to kill him?

870
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,915
Kittridge is here.

871
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,230
We take the money.

872
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,839
Ethan takes the blame.

873
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,352
No one else has seen you alive.

874
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,312
No one will believe him.

875
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,709
Of course...

876
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,633
I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

877
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,272
- Ethan.
- Yes.

878
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,234
Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

879
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,919
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

880
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,319
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

881
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:04,629
Mind telling me, Ethan?

882
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,832
Before or after I showed up in London?

883
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,594
Before London...

884
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,998
but after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

885
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,075
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn Gideons.

886
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,877
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

887
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,952
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk?

888
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,838
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

889
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,149
And you are the answer.

890
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,913
I knew about Jim.

891
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,113
But he didn't know about you.

892
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,429
In all fairness, Ethan...

893
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,593
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

894
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,997
But I was supremely confident,
having tasted the goods.

895
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,709
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife, Ethan.

896
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,869
Let's just get the money
and get out of here.

897
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,189
Yes, let's get the money.

898
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,398
Ethan, the money.

899
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,115
Give her the money.

900
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,355
You've earned it.

901
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,838
All $10 million.

902
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,118
You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.

903
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,350
What's that?

904
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,592
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

905
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,511
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

906
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,152
You son of a bitch.

907
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,590
It's over, Jim.

908
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,279
Don't. Don't, Jim.

909
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,350
Don't, Jim.

910
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,395
Damn!

911
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,398
No, it's in the tunnel!

912
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,431
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

913
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,158
Accelerate! Accelerate!

914
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,509
Red light!

915
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,034
Green light!

916
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:33,713
Look, we cannot just be
sitting around, okay? We need...

917
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,632
I think this is what you're looking for.

918
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,959
Hello, Max.

919
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,918
My lawyers are going
to have a field day with this.

920
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,640
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

921
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:54,111
Well, maybe we'll
just leave the courts out of this one.

922
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:01,397
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

923
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,074
In a freak accident,

924
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,551
a helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel

925
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:10,838
and collided with a high-speed train
on its way from London to Paris.

926
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,870
The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt.

927
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,915
Authorities have attributed the accident
to instrument failure.

928
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,794
Reach your folks? How are they feeling?

929
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:22,950
About what?

930
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,150
The apology from
the Justice Department, VIP treatment,

931
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,953
you know, the whole nine yards.

932
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,436
Well, my mom was a little confused

933
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,114
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald

934
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,396
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

935
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,750
Cheers.

936
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,916
To you, Luther,
for being off the disavowed list.

937
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,434
Hey, I'm the flavor of the month.

938
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,280
Why don't you come back with me?

939
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,350
I just...

940
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,753
I just don't know why I'd be doing it.

941
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,080
Gotta go catch my flight.

942
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,917
So how's it feel
to be a solid citizen again?

943
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,834
Man, I don't know.

944
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,118
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

945
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,837
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better...

946
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,079
I'll always think of you that way.

947
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,399
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

948
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,754
Would you like to watch a movie?

949
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,029
No, thank you.

950
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,069
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?

951
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,160
Aruba, perhaps?
