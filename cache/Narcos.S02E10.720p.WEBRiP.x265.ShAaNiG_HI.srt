00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,825
I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

164
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,830
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

165
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,206
You can survive prison.

166
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,421
We both know that won't happen.

167
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,798
[Hugo Jr.]
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

168
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,968
- [Tata] Listen to me, Pablo.
- They're talking.

169
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,971
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

170
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,308
You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

171
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,934
My man.

172
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,438
My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

173
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,356
The people love you and follow you.

174
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,401
[Pablo]
Tata, Limón wants me off.

175
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,654
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

176
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,742
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

177
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,455
They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

178
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,457
They gave him the Nobel Prize.

179
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,462
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

180
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,464
Of the same country that imprisoned him.

181
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,609
[Pablo] I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

182
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,313
[Hugo Jr.]
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

183
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,179
[Tata] All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

184
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,139
It's very important.

185
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,267
It's our only way out really.

186
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,937
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

187
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,814
Colonel!
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.

188
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,817
Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

189
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,277
I'll think about it.

190
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,488
All right?

191
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,951
I love you very much.

192
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,442
Where are you going?

193
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,319
To Medellín.

194
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,949
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

195
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,827
My son needs me.

196
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,204
How so?

197
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,289
What you want...

198
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,169
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

199
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,037
I don't want them to kill him.

200
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,288
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

201
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,925
They won't if he turns himself in.

202
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,886
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

203
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,805
No! No, ma'am.

204
00:16:54,888 --> 00:17:01,311
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

205
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,274
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

206
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,111
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

207
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,238
We can't even leave the country.

208
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,244
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

209
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,247
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

210
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,630
My son...

211
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,217
needs his mother.

212
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,060
Hermilda.

213
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,447
Please be very careful. Please.

214
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,200
Tell the children...

215
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,621
[whispers] I'll tell them.

216
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,558
[in Spanish] We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

217
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,146
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

218
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,775
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

219
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,654
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

220
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,908
Now, if he resists...

221
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,745
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

222
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,414
I want you to take his life. Understood?

223
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,250
- [all] Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

224
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,168
[engines revving]

225
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,717
[Limón]
Everything all right, boss?

226
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,990
Tata wants me to surrender.

227
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,331
[sighs]
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

228
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,625
Nelson Mandela?

229
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
Who's that, boss?

230
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,308
Did you buy more rolling papers?

231
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,477
Sorry, no, boss.

232
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,320

I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

236
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,121
[man over radio]
He's not here.

237
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,755
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

238
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,801
This is my city, Limón.

239
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,515
These are my people.

240
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,397
Medellín will never betray me.

241
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,154
- [low chatter]
- Colonel.

242
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,698
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

243
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,618
- Looks like your little machine is broken.
- [men chuckle]

244
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,745
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

245
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,623
Excuse me, Colonel.

246
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,964
[man] Listen up! Take down
the staging area and head back to Holguín.

247
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,187
[Hugo Jr.] Son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

- [kids chattering]
- [water splashes]

249
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,112
- A ghost.
- What's that?

250
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,658
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

251
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,828
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

252
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,711
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

253
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,548
Give me the keys!

254
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,300
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

265
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,248
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

266
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,500
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

267
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,894
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

268
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,817

- Thank you.

Sir.

[church bell ringing]

278
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,806
[Gustavo] You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

279
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,100
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

280
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,855
They're offering seven million dollars
for your head,

281
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,190
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

282
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,988
You look just like Che Guevara.

What's beautiful is always beautiful.

You look like you ate Che Guevara.

What? You don't miss me or what?

286
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,302
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

287
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,555
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

288
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,099
Thank you, Gustavo.

289
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,148
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

290
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,319
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

291
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,987
Never letting anything stop him.

292
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,575
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

293
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,413
You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

294
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,792
- Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.
- Mmm.

[sighs] Tata wants me to surrender.

296

Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

297
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,096
Maybe it's a good idea.

298
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,853
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

299
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:18,316
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

300

The legend grows.

301
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,946
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

302
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:29,077
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

303
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,790
Let's cut the bullshit.

00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,628
We are bandits, Pablo.

305
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,463
Right?

306
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,263
What do you think?

307
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,351
[sighs] I think...

308
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,983
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

309
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,906
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

310
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,377

00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,506
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

316
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,178
It worked perfectly.

317
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,561
You're a good man, Limón.

318
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,857
Thank you.

319
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,860
Thanks a lot.

- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,535
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

322
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,911
I'm hungry.

323
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,457
[Pablo] Tata?

324
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,545
Pablo?

325
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,298
There's the love of my life.

326
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,053
- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

327
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,597
I feel good.

328
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,519
And ready to talk to those reporters.

329
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,106
Good, my love.

330
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,275
Does that mean you're turning yourself in?

331
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,238
No, Tata.

332
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,366
I'll never surrender.

333
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,205
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

334
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,042
You have to.

335
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,423
I'll never surrender, my love.

336
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,564
I know, Pablo.

337
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,902
But what's your plan?

338
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,573
All right.

339
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,825
I know what we're going to do.

340
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,207
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

341
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,250
That's what we are going to do.

342
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,212
[signal breaking up]

343
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,717
- [Pablo] ...foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

344
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,637
...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

345
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,348
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

346
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,481
We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

347
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,945
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

348
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,782
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

349
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,951
You have to believe me.

350
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,746
- We will succeed.
- [softly] Stop, stop, stop, stop!

351
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:30,253
As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

352
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,421
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

353
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,758
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

354
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,677
And listen...

355
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,349
I will not rest until that happens.

356
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,811
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

357
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,608
[Tata] I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

358
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,323
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

359
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,867
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

360
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,285
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

361
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,037
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

362
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,333
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

363
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,670
[Martinez]
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

364
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,130
Colonel, I found him.

365
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,132
Who? Escobar?

366
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,676
Yes, Colonel.

367
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,344
He's in Los Olivos.

368
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,934
Son, are you sure? We can't afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

369
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,229
I'm sure. I saw him.

370
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,691
What do you mean you saw him?

371
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,904
Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

372
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,823
And did he see you?

373
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,618
No, I don't think so.

374
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,455
Listen up, Lieutenant.

375
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,041
There's still some men
in the staging area.

376
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,711
I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

377
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,963
Copy that, Colonel.

378
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,966
One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

379
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,596
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

380
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,849
Hello, Dad.

381
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,768
How's it going, son?

382
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,396
You wanted to ask me something or what?

383
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,731
Yes, sir.

384
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,234
What wish did you make for your birthday?

385
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,779
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

386
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,907
Tell me! Don't be like that!

387
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,409
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

388
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,912
is that it was a very good wish.

389
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,871
You know,

390
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,415
you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

391
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,054
Thank you, my love.

392
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,766
Captain.

393
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,436
- [Martinez] Captain, can you hear me?
- Yes, Colonel?

394
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,897
How many men are left
in the provisional base?

395
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,775
- Counting me, about 12.
- Listen up.

396
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,780
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- Shit! Let's go!

397
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,366
- Everybody to Los Olivos!
- [overlapping shouts]

398
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,076
[Manuela] Hello.

399
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:11,539
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

400
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,622
Good.

401
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,460
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

402
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,004
[giggles]

403
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,556
Perez!

404
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,393
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

405
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,769
[in English] This is the house.

406
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,065
[Pablo in Spanish]
Get your mom on the phone, okay?

407
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,192
Pablo.

408
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,796
- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

409
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,740
The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

410
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,369
"How do you feel after
all these days on the run?"

411
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,664
Write this down.

412
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,044
"It's been very hard
being far from my family,

413
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,047
who I love more than anything
in the world."

414
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,550
- Sergeant, go around.
- "But I feel good.

415
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,177
I feel strong.

416
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,057
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

417
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,770
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

418
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:22,860
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

419
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,656
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

420
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,955
The government
is holding my family hostage.

421
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,377
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

422
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,588
that calls itself democratic.

423
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,175
My little kids are innocent children

424
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:50,721
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

425
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,480
All we want from the government

426
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,483
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

427
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:08,697
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

428
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,950
- Without that..."

You just shot Pablo Escobar!

457

Is he alive?

458
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,264
[Steve]
All that time hunting him...

459
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,893
and just like that,
I'm looking down at Pablo fucking Escobar.

460
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,523
For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.

461
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,859
What a monster he'd be. [chuckles]

462
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,237
But here's the thing.

463
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,116
When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.

464
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,243
Just a man.

465
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,995
Beard grows if he doesn't shave.

Fat and shoeless.

[no audible dialogue]

481
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,649
- [no audio]
- [guitar song continues]

482
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,683
- [no audible dialogue]
- [song continues]

483
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,022
My son! My son...

484
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,927
[no audible dialogue]

485
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,380
[Hermilda]
I pray to God that other mothers

486
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,551
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

487
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,513
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

488
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,641
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

489
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,851
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

490
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,229
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

491
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,482
He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.

492
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,526
No one has paid attention to that.

493
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,738
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

494
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:08,450
[dialogue fades] He was the noblest
of men. Not just as a son...

495
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,842
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

496
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,263
[celebratory shouting]

497
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,440
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

498
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,900
Thank you.

499
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,908
Talk to me.

500
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,497
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

501
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,625
He told you that?

502
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,090
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

503
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,217
you were once associates and friends.

504
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,845
[laughter, loud chatter]

505
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,226
You were saying?

506
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:22,441
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

507
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,069
That you would forgive us.

508
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,073
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

509
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,746
How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?

510
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,415
In property? In cash?

511
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,463
I can find out.

512
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,635
That's good.

513
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,346
Because I want all of it.

514
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,886
[Javier in English]
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

515
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,265
You're the review board, right?

516
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,062
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

517
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,108
We're not the review board.

518
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,029
So who are you?

519
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,242
We're from Operations.

520
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,540
What do you want from me?

521
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,960
- [laughter, chatter]
- [in Spanish] All right, gentlemen!

522
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,628
Gentlemen!

523
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:12,759
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

524
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,720
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

525
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,013
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

526
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,684
311 metric tons.

527
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,981
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

528
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,985
And when your rival no longer exists.

529
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,486
[laughter]

530
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:38,034
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

531
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,579
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

532
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,664
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

533
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,083
And cocaine production goes up.

534
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,253
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

535
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,672
but how well one has prepared for them.

536
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:55,093
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

537
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,846
Can you imagine what happens next year?

538
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,976
[Gilberto] And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

539
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,354
We will do it covertly.

540
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,232
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

541
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,650
we'll no longer be there.

542
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,486
- No, sir!
- [laughter]

543
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,905
- Cheers!
- [all] Cheers!

544
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,617
Now the king is dead. Long live the kings.

545
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,709
Agent Peña, how much do you know
about the Cali cartel?

546
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,716
[pop song plays]
