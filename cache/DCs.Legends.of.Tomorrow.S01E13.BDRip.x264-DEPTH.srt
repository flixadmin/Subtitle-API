1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,713
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,718
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:10,178
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:13,098
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:17,185
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed
by the body I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

7
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,728
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:21,147
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,694
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,907
<i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

12
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,910
<i>The flashes I've been having.</i>

13
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,662
<i>They're of Carter.</i>

14
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,247
It must be really weird

15
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:38,891
feeling like you're cheating
on me with him.

16
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:39,999
No, Ray.

17
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:44,421
I feel like I'm cheating on him with you.

18
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,799
We need to move swiftly
to locate Vandal Savage.

19
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,010
There is one place in time
that we know Savage to be.

20
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,470
2166.

21
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,222
<i>We have, quite literally,</i>

22
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,349
run out of time.

23
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,097
We're gonna need to find a safe
place to set down, Gideon.

24
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,513
<i>I don't believe there are
any safe places, Captain.</i>

25
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,674
<i>Are we over London, yet?</i>

26
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:12,824
What's left of it.

27
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,159
Why is London shooting at us?

28
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,453
No, it's Savage's forces
that are doing the shooting.

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,205
Here in 2166, they've
subjugated most of the globe.

30
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,545
Maybe picking up here
wasn't the brightest idea.

31
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:27,392
Unfortunately, we no longer
have the luxury

32
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,674
of blindly searching for Savage
throughout history.

33
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,509
Indeed. We have to target Savage

34
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:32,719
<i>at the time and place</i>

35
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:34,321
that we are certain he will be, which is...

36
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,514
Right before he wastes your family.

37
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:38,725
What?

38
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,351
Yes, Mr. Rory,

39
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,204
Savage will kill my wife and son
in three days' time.

40
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,023
But we can save them, and the world,

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,816
by stopping Savage now.

42
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,572
<i>Captain, I've managed</i>

43
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,049
<i>to slip beneath their artillery fire.</i>

44
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,201
Set us down on the outskirts
of the city, Gideon.

45
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,204
<i>Near the encampment of
the remaining resistance forces.</i>

46
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,414
We are going to need to proceed swiftly.

47
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,975
I realize your family is in jeopardy,

48
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,185
but perhaps some deliberation...

49
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,729
We really don't have the time, Martin.

50
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:07,545
<i>According to Gideon,</i>

51
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,173
Savage is going to be
out in the open tonight.

52
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,050
Vulnerable.

53
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,511
Now, in order to capture him,
I require the services of...

54
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,554
Killer, klepto and pyro.

55
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:17,847
Bingo.

56
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,768
<i>Here we stand at the edge of history.</i>

57
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:25,230
<i>But as tempting as it might be</i>

58
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:28,733
<i>to celebrate our previous victories,</i>

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,945
<i>it is only for the next and final battle</i>

60
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,822
<i>that you will be remembered.</i>

61
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,115
There's no way we can grab him here.

62
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,827
Not with an army standing between us.

63
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,120
Shh. I'm trying to listen to this guy.

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,790
He gives a hell of a speech.

65
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,251
<i>Onward to victory!</i>

66
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>Onward to immortality!</i>

67
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,317
<i>All set on our end.</i>

68
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,933
Jax is in the Jumpship,
ready to extract you guys.

69
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,978
Especially if, and by if, I mean when,

70
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,729
this thing goes south.

71
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,614
Savage's lady friend just made us.

72
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,449
Have faith, Mr. Snart.

73
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,126
Gideon, push in on the woman.

74
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,256
That bracelet she's wearing,

75
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,174
can you get a clearer image?

76
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,976
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,815
If we don't move real soon,

78
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,293
we're gonna get ourselves killed.

79
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,985
How about we play this like Chicago?

80
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,320
Could work.

81
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,183
What the hell did you do that for?

82
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,250
We'll take Savage. You tie up the guards.

83
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,865
Sara, the woman you're fighting,

84
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,992
<i>you need to take her bracelet.</i>

85
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,204
Are you seriously
jewelry shopping right now?

86
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,119
We're outnumbered.

87
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:53,920
Fall back!

88
00:04:57,048 --> 00:05:00,093
Mr. Jackson, now would be
a good time to pick us up!

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,569
What exactly do you think
you were doing back there?

90
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,073
Distracting Savage's pals,
which worked, by the way.

91
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,592
Yes, well, I could've been killed.

92
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,118
Never said it worked perfectly.

93
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,553
At least it wasn't a complete bust.

94
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,413
We found out about Kendra's bracelet.

95
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,040
What bracelet?

96
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,960
My bracelet.

97
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,962
I was wearing it
the night of my first death.

98
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,380
That's great.

99
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,966
Not the death part, that's terrible.

100
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,259
But you told us that

101
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:42,569
objects present the night of your death

102
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,673
can be used to kill Savage.

103
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,888
I'm your fiancé. I listen to you.

104
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:49,100
And that's sweet,
but there's still one small problem.

105
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,309
It's a bracelet.

106
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,196
How are you supposed to
kill Savage with it?

107
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,551
A question we will answer
the moment we have obtained it.

108
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,442
We need our resident kleptomaniacs
to steal that bracelet.

109
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,777
<i>Captain, I've detected movement</i>

110
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,947
<i>300 meters southwest
of our position and closing.</i>

111
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,574
- Savage's army?
<i>- Negative.</i>

112
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,051
<i>I believe they are all that remains</i>

113
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,160
<i>of the resistance forces.</i>

114
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,762
I'm going to make contact with them.

115
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,455
They might have information on Savage

116
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,081
that we can use to our advantage.

117
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:15,126
In the meantime, Ms. Lance,
get Ms. Saunders ready.

118
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,419
Ray.

119
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,481
How am I supposed to teach
someone to fight with a piece of jewelry?

120
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,590
Good question.

121
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,633
It wasn't rhetorical.

122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,474
Thank you, gentlemen,

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,476
for accompanying me on this excursion.

124
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,977
Oh, no problem.

125
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,584
I just love hiking through the woods

126
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,980
in the middle of World War III.

127
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,459
What if, instead of encountering
these resistance fighters,

128
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,985
we meet up with more of Savage's forces?

129
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,821
Why else do you think
I brought along Firestorm and the Atom?

130
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:49,077
Give me one good reason

131
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,923
why we shouldn't blow you
straight to hell.

132
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,081
Better yet, give her several good reasons.

133
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,042
My wife and son live in Whitechapel.

134
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,088
- It was hit hard.
- I know.

135
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,341
And the same fate will befall you
if you don't accept our help.

136
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,945
How do we know you're not with Savage?

137
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,346
Because, if we were,
you'd be dead right now.

138
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,389
Look, feel free to shoot us,

139
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,016
but from the looks of it,

140
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,185
you can use all the allies you can get.

141
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,525
Whitechapel fell 11 days ago.

142
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,111
We have a lot of refugees.

143
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,321
Do you think your wife and son
are among them?

144
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,532
Sadly, I'm confident that they're not.

145
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,160
Still, we would like to help
in whatever way we can.

146
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,370
Very well.

147
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,657
Get yourselves acclimated
and I'll rejoin you shortly.

148
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,257
Hey.

149
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,686
Uh, I would've brought more, but...

150
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,153
Jefferson... Jefferson,
let's return to the ship,

151
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,739
and we'll bring back
those additional provisions.

152
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,449
Don't worry.

153
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,256
There's plenty more where that came from.

154
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,663
We'll be back.

155
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:20,877
So, what did you mean back there,
about your family?

156
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,503
I'd rather not discuss it.

157
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,714
Yeah, I picked up on that.

158
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,733
I also picked up on the fact
that we're in London

159
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:31,053
just a few days before Savage
tries to kill your wife and son,

160
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,014
and you're not trying
to get them to safety.

161
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,894
After my first attempt on Savage
in ancient Egypt,

162
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,730
my very next stop was here in 2166.

163
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,775
I found Miranda and Jonas
exactly where I'd left them

164
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,612
and we raced towards the <i>Waverider.</i>

165
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:53,326
But we had a run-in
with Savage's shock troopers.

166
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,163
Miranda and Jonas were cut down.

167
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:05,421
So, uh, I jumped even further back.

168
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,467
And the outcome was exactly the same.

169
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:15,139
I watched my family die countless times

170
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,350
at the hands of Savage and his forces

171
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,268
before I realized that...

172
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,606
Time wants to happen.

173
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,337
It's a funny feeling knowing that

174
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,113
the universe itself doesn't
want you to save your family.

175
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,117
All right, what are you all playing at?

176
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,702
I retina-scanned the four of you.

177
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,229
There's no record of you anywhere.

178
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,498
And you and your friends
disappeared 150 years ago.

179
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,792
Believe me when I tell you

180
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,144
it will take about that much time

181
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,503
for us to tell the whole story.

182
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,129
But the most important thing

183
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,899
is that we get as close
to Vandal Savage as possible.

184
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,342
No one gets close to Savage.
Especially not now.

185
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,470
Some idiots made an attempt
on his life earlier tonight.

186
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,359
He's gone to ground
in the citadel's bunker

187
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,848
and he's holed up good and tight.

188
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,493
<i>Delta Camp is under attack!</i>

189
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,852
<i>Taking heavy fire. We need air support.</i>

190
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,187
Where is Delta Camp?

191
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,858
Establish a perimeter!

192
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,277
<i>Once it's secure,</i>

193
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,696
<i>we'll search for survivors.</i>

194
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,323
Last week, Savage's forces
laid waste to Tokyo.

195
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,784
London is the last patch
of free ground on the planet.

196
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:20,371
<i>Savage's armies have cut down
the most formidable militaries</i>

197
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,539
<i>in the world.</i>

198
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,750
What do you men think you can do
against an evil like this?

199
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,534
There were no survivors from the attack.

200
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,455
No, whatever weapon
Savage used against the rebels

201
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,648
was quite effective.

202
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,960
Maybe Professor Stein and I
should survey the wreckage,

203
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,068
analyze some soil samples,

204
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,487
determine what kind of weaponry
Savage is using.

205
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,382
Until we figure out a way
to thwart his firepower,

206
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,646
the rebels are as good as dead.

207
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:57,908
Remember why we're here.

208
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,494
To stop Savage, not to slow him down.

209
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,663
Do we have a plan
for stealing this bracelet?

210
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,873
We're on it.

211
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,225
Please don't tell me the plan is

212
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,877
to walk into Savage's citadel
and steal it off her wrist.

213
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,087
All right, I won't tell you that.

214
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,258
All right, well, we still have the issue

215
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,760
of how to turn a piece of jewelry

216
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,178
into a lethal weapon.

217
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,138
Perhaps there is a reference
to the bracelet

218
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,765
in Professor Boardman's diary.

219
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,476
I doubt it.

220
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,896
I've read through my son's
research 1,000 times.

221
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:30,524
Savage has a devastating weapon
at his command.

222
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,318
And here, now,

223
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,944
at the eleventh hour,

224
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,322
we could sorely use a weapon of our own.

225
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,408
I'll look into it.

226
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,412
This is such a waste of time.

227
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,789
I've already looked through

228
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,291
every single page of Aldus' notebooks.

229
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,727
If he'd written something specific

230
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,187
about the bracelet and killing Savage,

231
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,712
I would've known it already.

232
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,758
Well, here it is.

233
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:02,807
You ever think about him?

234
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,308
Carter?

235
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,728
I try not to.

236
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,980
It's not like I'll ever see him again.

237
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,525
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

238
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,861
Besides, Carter is my past.

239
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,239
Ray is my future.

240
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,535
Still, 4,000-year-long relationship,

241
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,141
seems like it'd be hard to get over.

242
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:25,996
Yeah.

243
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,834
Maybe when Savage is gone,
I can finally start to.

244
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:48,853
Wow, what's the, uh, occasion?

245
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,521
I'll give you one guess.

246
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,690
Our anniversary?

247
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,001
Look, I'm sorry, but in my defense,

248
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,461
there's quite a few of them to remember.

249
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,614
We were only married in eight lifetimes.

250
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,032
That's a lot.

251
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,452
But I do remember

252
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,287
your Victorian England incarnation

253
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,330
being particularly tough
to be pinned down.

254
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,378
Why are you handing this to me?

255
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,046
It's an anniversary gift.

256
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,875
Oh. You have got to stop
giving me weapons as presents.

257
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,897
I think it's time you learn how to use it.

258
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,180
But it's your weapon.

259
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,973
Savage has murdered us countless times,

260
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,142
and we aren't always
lucky enough to die together.

261
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,352
This is awfully depressing talk
for our anniversary,

262
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,729
don't you think?

263
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,230
Kendra, this is important.

264
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,233
I need to know that if I go first,

265
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,040
you have everything you need to face him.

266
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,821
I don't want to think about facing Savage.

267
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,531
Or life without you.

268
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,334
You'll never be without me.

269
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,836
No matter what, I'll always be near.

270
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,255
Just give it a try.

271
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,322
Who's to say I'll ever be strong enough

272
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,722
to kill Savage by myself?

273
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,099
Just trust me.

274
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,602
You have everything you need.

275
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,737
<i>What is it?</i>

276
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,949
I think I know what we can use
to kill Savage.

277
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,470
Savage has warned you all

278
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,138
about the radicals who oppose us.

279
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,433
They will not show you
the mercy I just did.

280
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,894
Dismissed.

281
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,945
I said you're dismissed.

282
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,160
We thought you said, "Missed."

283
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,496
Whoever you are,
you're certainly persistent.

284
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,999
Not really.

285
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,334
We just like bright, sparkly objects

286
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,586
<i>like that bracelet.</i>

287
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,631
You'd risk dying for a bauble?

288
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,842
It works with my outfit.

289
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,349
What now, Mr. Snart?

290
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,019
How do you know my name?

291
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,360
And there I was thinking we could go

292
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,087
a whole week without kidnapping anyone.

293
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,324
I think you'll find it would've
been better to simply kill me.

294
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,533
I agree.

295
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,368
It's a little more complicated than that.

296
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,037
She knew who I was.

297
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,788
I know who all of you are.

298
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,542
It's a pleasure to meet you, Gareeb.

299
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,379
I see Savage has been rather chatty

300
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,839
with his lieutenants.

301
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,384
If you think I am merely Savage's soldier,

302
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,553
you're more idiotic than he claimed.

303
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,724
I'm not his lieutenant.

304
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,227
I'm his daughter.

305
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,743
Vandal Savage has a daughter?

306
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,245
Apparently it's true,
there is a lid for every pot.

307
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,997
And this lid is gonna be very upset

308
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,083
when he finds out that we took his pot.

309
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,877
You know what I mean.

310
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,212
So, what's the problem?

311
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,923
It's not like we're on
Savage's Christmas card list.

312
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,841
And we snagged the bracelet.

313
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,218
You're welcome, by the way.

314
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,695
<i>We need to weaponize that thing</i>

315
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,013
before Savage knows that
it and his daughter are missing.

316
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,973
Actually, I think
I've got that figured out.

317
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,476
But I'm gonna need you
to burn something for me.

318
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,769
About time.

319
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,104
We also need to figure out

320
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,022
what we're going to do with our new guest.

321
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,899
She's seen us and the ship.

322
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,234
If she runs back to Savage,

323
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,944
we're giving him a huge advantage.

324
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,029
So, we make her our advantage.

325
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,864
We send Papa Savage a finger.

326
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,075
<i>And we keep sending them</i>

327
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,202
<i>till he puts his own head
on the chopping block.</i>

328
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,287
That is a positively lurid idea.

329
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,134
I know we're in the midst of a war,
but can't we maintain our honor?

330
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,376
I'd rather maintain my life, Professor.

331
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,336
If she is Savage's daughter,

332
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,505
then she would know
the details of his defenses.

333
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:27,673
Yes, well, how exactly

334
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
are we going to get
those details out of her?

335
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,260
I'm on it.

336
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,476
Hello, Kassy. May I call you "Kassy"?

337
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:40,769
Here's the deal.

338
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,439
You have information. I want it.

339
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,109
The question is, how am I gonna get it?

340
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,740
I'm the daughter of Vandal Savage,

341
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,576
<i>the immortal ruler of the world.</i>

342
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,996
Do you think he hasn't
prepared me for this?

343
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,843
Do you think I haven't already been taught

344
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,478
to endure the most extreme suffering?

345
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,670
You know, your father
sounds a lot like mine.

346
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,839
He could never really say, "I love you."

347
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,592
Except with his fists.

348
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,096
Our fathers are nothing alike, Mr. Snart.

349
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,102
Fourteen years ago,
the world was ruled by a madman.

350
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,146
Per Degaton.

351
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,940
He unleashed the Armageddon Virus

352
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,859
in order to conquer the globe.

353
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,278
It tore through the world like a fire.

354
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,866
Millions died, including my mother.

355
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,746
There were riots, wars, hell on Earth.

356
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,749
No one dared to stand up to Degaton,

357
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,876
except for my father.

358
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,881
He may not be a kind man,
but he is the only one capable

359
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,509
<i>of putting this world back together.</i>

360
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,721
So, you can torture me if you like,

361
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,934
my suffering's a small price to pay.

362
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,729
Who said anything about torture?

363
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,364
Are you sure you can do this?

364
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:18,742
Bash Savage's skull with Carter's mace?

365
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,244
You got a better plan?

366
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,246
It's not the weapon I'm worried about.

367
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,207
Thousands of years in reincarnation,

368
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,085
and I'm guessing you've killed
a grand total of nobody,

369
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,547
yet here you are entering
into the Olympics of murder.

370
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,173
What's your point?

371
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,969
Are you sure you can look Savage
in the eye and kill him?

372
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,889
I'm sure.

373
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,599
Well, you better be.

374
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,643
Otherwise, you're gonna end up

375
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,020
like the last guy who swung that thing.

376
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,493
Savage's super weapon isn't an explosive.

377
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,537
The exact conclusion I've just come to

378
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,998
after examining soil samples
from the attack site.

379
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,165
How did you determine it?

380
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,002
Gideon. She found a defunct spy satellite.

381
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,336
Look at the photos here.

382
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,255
This is the camp,

383
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,299
and here is the camp destroyed.

384
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,802
Look at the impact craters,
sort of squint your eyes.

385
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,470
What do they look like?

386
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,431
What am I supposed to be seeing?

387
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,767
Oh, my God.

388
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,478
Those are not impact craters.

389
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:32,983
They're footprints.

390
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,664
Sir, we've located the rebels

391
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,434
responsible for your daughter's abduction.

392
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,668
The Leviathan is two clicks
from their encampment.

393
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,088
Find my daughter,

394
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,174
and burn them all.

395
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,262
He's coming for me.

396
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,682
Yeah, you and a bunch
of innocent refugees.

397
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,225
If they were innocent,

398
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,561
they wouldn't have rebelled
against my father.

399
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,358
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.

400
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,860
Well, we're a little short on weapons.

401
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,029
If we can't outrun it,
we'll just have to fight it.

402
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,530
Well, indeed, we can.

403
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,202
But what about them?

404
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,503
This way. Move along.

405
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,296
Everything's all right. Move along.

406
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,673
Everything's fine.

407
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,884
What the hell do you think you're doing?

408
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,678
Saving a township, by the looks of it.

409
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,564
Since when did my vessel
become a life raft?

410
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Since I decided

411
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,283
we can't leave these people here
to be slaughtered.

412
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,059
You recruited us to save the world.

413
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,560
That includes everyone here.

414
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,315
Gideon, power the engines
and get us into the air

415
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,357
the moment the last refugee is aboard.

416
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,901
And get the weapon system online.

417
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,529
What's happening?

418
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,382
It seems Savage has come back
for his baby girl.

419
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,384
<i>The last of the refugees
are aboard, Captain.</i>

420
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,450
Strap yourself in.

421
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,577
Gideon, external floodlights to maximum.

422
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,758
- That's...
- Incredible.

423
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,269
Fire! Now!

424
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,441
Hold on to something!

425
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,039
Fire, Gideon! Fire everything!

426
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,669
Now might be a good time to start praying.

427
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,652
Gideon, what's our status?

428
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,154
I'm gonna go with lousy.

429
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,549
Shut down all essential systems
so Savage's robot doesn't...

430
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,613
<i>Too late, Captain.</i>

431
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,594
<i>Apparently it has determined
you are still alive</i>

432
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,012
<i>because it is closing in on our location.</i>

433
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,037
What happened?

434
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,164
We seem to have encountered
Savage's mega-weapon.

435
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,499
And he kicked our ass.

436
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,985
Gideon, how much time do we have?

437
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,853
<i>I estimate the robot
should reach our location</i>

438
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:39,878
<i>within the hour.</i>

439
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,725
<i>Our propulsion engine was severely damaged</i>

440
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,560
<i>in the crash and is no longer functioning.</i>

441
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,008
So, where does that leave us?

442
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,903
All right. Our only option
is to take the Jumpship

443
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:47,928
and try and outrun it.

444
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,596
The Jumpship seats seven.

445
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,282
The cargo bay's filled with refugees.

446
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,306
I'm well aware.

447
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,826
Well, we can't just leave them there.

448
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,185
We...

449
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,189
Martin.

450
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,444
Professor, you are gonna be
just fine. I promise you.

451
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,238
- Grey, what happened?
- Jefferson.

452
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,448
You'll have to take care of them.

453
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,842
Don't worry. We got the team's back.

454
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,909
No, the people.

455
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,454
Those children. You can't leave them here!

456
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,375
You can't leave them here.

457
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,186
<i>I've administered a mild sedative.</i>

458
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,461
<i>He should be comfortable.</i>

459
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,588
Which is more than can be said
for the rest of us.

460
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,512
I was wrong. Your dad's a gem.

461
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,181
He's just doing what he must
to save his daughter.

462
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,891
Whatever you say. Now, where was I?

463
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,394
Right. Convincing you to help us.

464
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,689
What a charming euphemism
for interrogation.

465
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:41,976
I know what you're thinking.

466
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:46,444
"My dad may not be perfect, but
deep down, he's not a bad guy."

467
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,158
What are you doing?

468
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,369
Showing you that
when it comes to crap fathers,

469
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,247
there is no deep down.

470
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,040
After you.

471
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,599
These are the ones we could save.
The rest are ash.

472
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:16,892
<i>Much like Delta Camp.</i>

473
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,227
You don't know my father at all,

474
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,688
if you think his daughter
could be so easily manipulated.

475
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,356
Just trying to show you the truth.

476
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,775
The truth is,
my father was trying to save me.

477
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:26,985
From what?

478
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,654
Untrained civilians
with barely any weapons?

479
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,656
Your father sent a 200-foot robot

480
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,158
to level a bunch of tents.

481
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,577
The people in that camp were rebels.

482
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,870
Dangerous radicals.

483
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,873
Please. Do these people
look like radicals to you?

484
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,458
<i>They're nobodies.</i>

485
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,503
Everyday folk, hoping to survive
your father's reign of terror.

486
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:50,634
Look, it took me a long time to
accept my old man was a monster.

487
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,761
I'm betting you're smarter than I am.

488
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,721
At last.

489
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,223
Something we agree on.

490
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:02,145
Oh, Per Degaton didn't release
the Armageddon Virus.

491
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,855
That was your father.

492
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,524
Impossible.

493
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,568
He was only Per Degaton's tutor.

494
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,196
One, Per Degaton was only
a teenager at the time.

495
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,907
Two, he was hardly a criminal mastermind.

496
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,034
Your father, however...

497
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,662
What makes you think
I'd believe anything you tell me?

498
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,580
Because seeing is believing.

499
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,458
Gideon, show her the footage.

500
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,545
<i>Kasnia, November 3rd, 2147.</i>

501
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:32,384
<i>The world's population is
unsustainable at current levels.</i>

502
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,178
<i>The herd must be thinned.</i>

503
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,180
This isn't true.

504
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,268
You're a liar.

505
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,603
Correct, but not about this.

506
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,023
And you know it, deep down.

507
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,039
How are repairs coming?

508
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,875
Are repairs coming?

509
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,711
Not in 30 minutes,

510
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,437
which is about as much time as we have.

511
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,298
We brought all those people onboard

512
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,465
and all we've bought them

513
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,232
is an extra few minutes to live in fear.

514
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,585
Well, I guess the question is,

515
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:17,947
what do we do with those minutes?

516
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,973
The ship is crippled.

517
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,392
Everyone aboard is as dead as my...

518
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,477
Family?

519
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:29,232
<i>Look, I know you think
the universe wants them dead.</i>

520
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:34,070
But I don't believe in fate.
I believe in choices.

521
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:39,242
And we can choose. We can choose to fight.

522
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,078
<i>Even if that fight may be futile.</i>

523
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,913
We can save your family, Rip.

524
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,582
It's not impossible.

525
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:48,209
- All we have to do...
- Is kill Vandal Savage.

526
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,670
The chances of which appear to be fading.

527
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,089
Not anymore.

528
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,632
I figured out how to do it.

529
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,427
And my new bestie and I can get us in.

530
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,096
And I think I've got a way

531
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,515
to stop the giant robot
that's coming to kill us.

532
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,357
Now, you may not believe in fate, Raymond,

533
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,443
but I certainly do.

534
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,112
And perhaps it was fate that compelled me

535
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,614
to bring you seven together,

536
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:22,118
so we can change this future,
once and for all.

537
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,709
- Hey.
- Hey.

538
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,545
So, I'm gonna take on an immortal madman

539
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,714
and you are fighting a giant robot.

540
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,884
I can't believe this is our life.

541
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,805
Well, take him out and it won't be.

542
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,475
You can do this.

543
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,312
- Ray, if anything...
- No, no.

544
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,316
Save it for after you destroy Savage.

545
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,586
Sounds like it's getting closer.
How's it going back there?

546
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,672
You tell me. This is your nutso idea.

547
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,006
It's not that nutso

548
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,692
when you consider
the theoretical possibility

549
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,136
that siphoning power
from the auxiliary time drive

550
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,114
should provide enough power
to reverse the polarity

551
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,222
of the dwarf star matrix.

552
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,808
Sorry, Ray, I'm falling asleep
back here, man.

553
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,478
Okay, I think we're done.

554
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,258
You know, if this doesn't work...

555
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,733
I'll turn every cell in my body
inside out?

556
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,570
I was gonna go with "die," but, yeah.

557
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,030
You know, we could've escaped
on the Jumpship,

558
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,032
but we're doing this to save everybody

559
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,909
that we brought on the <i>Waverider.</i>

560
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,036
You're the real hero here, Ray.

561
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,581
All right. Stand back.

562
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,296
No. Like, way back.

563
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,053
All right. Here we go.

564
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,319
It works. I'm not dead.

565
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,450
Yet.

566
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,744
Okay, let's do this.

567
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,567
Okay, come on. Ray, you got this.

568
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,413
The Leviathan is encountering resistance.

569
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,123
Impossible.

570
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,670
Dr. Palmer.

571
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,964
- Clever.
<i>- Sir.</i>

572
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,091
What?

573
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,850
I've been so worried.

574
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:36,479
How did you...

575
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,147
I am your daughter.

576
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,068
Did you really think some rebel
could hold me captive?

577
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,778
Rebel?

578
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,948
These are the time travelers
I warned you of.

579
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:50,868
Father?

580
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,373
Your bracelet...

581
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:57,917
It's gone.

582
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,797
I... I must have lost it in my escape.

583
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,219
As the person who tutored you
in the art of deceit,

584
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:10,847
you cannot fool me, Kassandra!

585
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,724
Like you fooled me?

586
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,019
You told me my mother died
from the Armageddon Virus.

587
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,021
But you were the one who released it.

588
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,398
Tell me it isn't true.

589
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,900
I might even pretend to believe you.

590
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,171
Let me go.

591
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,548
Call them.

592
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:50,011
Call the ones that you no doubt
helped gain access to my bunker!

593
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,430
No need to trouble yourself, Ms. Savage.

594
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,599
We're already here.

595
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,187
Oh, I admire your command
of irony, Gareeb.

596
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,108
Using my own child against me.

597
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,944
Sorry to say, it didn't take much.

598
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,488
None at all, you ass.

599
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,698
They showed me the truth
of what you've done.

600
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:11,908
The innocent...

601
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,077
Do not speak as if you know anything

602
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,703
about ruling a people!

603
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:20,500
Do you really want to align your fate

604
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,753
with these pretenders?

605
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,924
They're nothing but grains
of sand in the desert of time.

606
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:30,593
You are a monster.

607
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,529
Don't just wrestle with him,
remember you got laser blasters.

608
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,364
Actually, they're compressed light beams.

609
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,616
Well, whatever they're called,
just hit him with 'em.

610
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:56,953
Oh, come on!

611
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,751
She's here.

612
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,629
I can sense her.

613
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:12,260
You do realize that she can do me no harm.

614
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,512
Clearly, you didn't get the memo.

615
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,220
I could really get used to this.

616
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,444
Stay on him, Ray! Stay on him!

617
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:38,095
I had it covered.

618
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,722
Sure you did.

619
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,399
<i>Get up, Ray!</i>

620
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,109
Ray, get up!

621
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,491
This is for Carter.

622
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:41,993
Your love, reincarnated.

623
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,163
<i>He doesn't even remember who he was.</i>

624
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:50,209
- And he never will.
- What?

625
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,254
When I first discovered him,

626
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:57,300
<i>when I found out that he had
no idea about his real identity,</i>

627
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,343
<i>I took my precautions,</i>

628
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,679
and I locked his mind away.

629
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,641
- You brainwashed him!
- Come on!

630
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,646
Strike me down! Kill me!

631
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,733
But do so knowing that I am the only one

632
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,276
holding the key to his mind.

633
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,953
<i>Get up, Ray. Get up.</i>

634
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,163
<i>Rip said you told him,</i>

635
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,249
you don't believe in fate, just choices.

636
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,752
<i>Well, you got a choice to make right now.</i>

637
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,504
You gotta choose to get up and fight.

638
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,715
<i>You gotta choose to live!</i>

639
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,280
Whoo, come on!

640
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,539
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

641
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,549
Kendra, what are you
waiting for? Finish him!

642
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,469
Destroy me and you doom him.

643
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:24,720
It's Carter.

644
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,350
The reinforcements are coming!

645
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,312
Whatever you plan on doing, Kendra, do it!

646
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:39,110
If I kill Savage, his mind will be lost.

647
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,528
<i>And if you don't,</i>

648
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:44,240
I will lose my wife and son.

649
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:46,909
Well, my love, what's it gonna be?

650
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,285
Huh?

651
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:49,787
Come on.

652
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,127
I can't.

653
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,256
I'm so sorry, Rip. I can't...

654
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:08,639
We need to get them back to the ship.
Both of them.

655
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:14,979
<i>You!</i>

656
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,024
What's to keep me from
killing you where you stand?

657
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,401
Because she is an asset to the cause.

658
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,987
My father may be incapacitated,

659
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,614
but his forces are still strong.

660
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,201
I know their tactics, their weaknesses.

661
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,246
Why the change of heart?

662
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,374
Ask him.

663
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,301
Hey.

664
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,969
I saw Sara,

665
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,655
she said you brought Savage
back on to the ship,

666
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,723
but she was a little stingy
on the details.

667
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,976
Is everything okay?

668
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,023
Ray,

669
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:02,401
we need to talk.

670
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:14,789
Welcome back.

671
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,082
Ah.

672
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,085
Well, the team managed to capture Savage,

673
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:22,338
battle his army and a giant robot,

674
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,840
and you managed
to sleep through all of it.

675
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,050
Hmm.

676
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,386
- The refugees?
- They're safe.

677
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,911
Every one of them is alive and well.

678
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,600
But for how long?

679
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,896
Apparently, time wants to happen.

680
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:45,069
Oh, I think you'll find that time,
for once, is on our side.

681
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:50,699
Now, if you'll excuse me.

682
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,537
I have to pay a visit to an old friend.

683
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,919
Well, you seem quite happy
for a man behind bars.

684
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:04,046
Why shouldn't I be happy?

685
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:07,383
Seems that you once again
have failed to kill me.

686
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,718
A momentary setback, I assure you.

687
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,220
Assure yourself.

688
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,305
<i>Providence has allowed me</i>

689
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,893
to place Chay-Ara
in an impossible situation.

690
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,731
A choice between
her own soul mate, Carter,

691
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,108
and yours.

692
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:28,571
<i>You know, a friend
recently suggested to me</i>

693
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:31,574
that there is no such thing as fate.

694
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:37,329
Destiny is nothing more
than the sum of our own choices.

695
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,747
I see.

696
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,751
So, you still think there is hope, then,

697
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:43,961
for your family?

698
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,258
Time will tell, Captain.

699
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,471
Time will tell.

700
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:26,795
