1
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,239
The lore tells us
of a Valiant few

2
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,199
who stood above the fray
and fog.

3
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,160
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

4
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,538
Which brings us
to our current exhibit,

5
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,999
the mythical staff of the gods.

6
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,709
In homer's tale,

7
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:28,380
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

8
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,174
Oh. Welcome, proud soldiers.

9
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,676
What did I say?

10
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,136
Museums are fun.

11
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,222
Amusement parks for the brains.

12
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,974
- Whoa!
- Okay,

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,309
there's no reason to get pushy.

14
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,019
Everyone will get a chance
to see it.

15
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,271
Carved from a heartwood

16
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,648
not seen in over 2,000 years,

17
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,109
the two halves
of this ancient replica

18
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,570
were recently discovered in,
of all places,

19
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,032
a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,450
So strong, they reportedly broke.

21
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,704
Okay, um, friends,
that's enough.

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,123
I'm, I'm sort of the star
of the show here...

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,875
Stop!

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,043
Stop! Sir!

25
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,129
Sir!

26
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,507
Hey!

27
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,884
Hey, what are you doing?

28
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,847
Unleash the chaos.

29
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,856
Unleash the chaos.

30
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
Unleash the chaos.

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,180
Wait, wait. Move, move, move!

32
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,557
No, no!

33
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,393
Help me!

34
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,582
No!

35
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,251
Ladies, please just let me go.

36
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,550
Oh, my god! Look out!

37
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,554
Turns out museums are fun.

38
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,684
Let's have more of it.

39
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,562
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

40
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,690
The champions of this realm
outnumber us.

41
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,276
Human champions are still humans

42
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,654
and we are gods.

43
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,573
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

44
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,867
To protect the power
of the gods,

45
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,662
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

46
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,457
the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions

47
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,876
this realm has ever witnessed.

48
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,378
I'm an idiot.

49
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,631
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

50
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,299
Like, what am I even contributing?

51
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,301
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

52
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,511
with a lightning bolt on it

53
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,513
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

54
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,600
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

55
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,768
and Batman is so cool!

56
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,770
And I'm just me.

57
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,164
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

58
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,788
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

59
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,233
but I feel like

60
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,818
a fraud.

61
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,319
You understand I'm a

62
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,864
pediatrician,

63
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,825
right?

64
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,578
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

65
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,204
by another patient, Billy bat son.

66
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,205
It doesn't matter.

67
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,416
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

68
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,543
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

69
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
All right, look.

70
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,588
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

71
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,506
but it sounds to me like

72
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,800
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

73
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,679
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

74
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,639
so if you don't mind me asking,

75
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,850
how well do you remember
your childhood?

76
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,727
Like it was today.

77
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,605
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

78
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,148
I mean, I never met my dad.

79
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,610
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

80
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,212
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

81
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,404
ran away from 11 homes,

82
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,487
got into a lot of fights.

83
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,865
Then I was abducted by a wizard

84
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,948
who gave me superpowers

85
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,076
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,328
That's not a small amount.

87
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,787
A doctor conjured seven demons

88
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,140
and held my whole family hostage,

89
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,764
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

90
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,292
and then everybody
got superpowers,

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,978
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

92
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,105
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

93
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,590
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

94
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,426
Right? Rejected by your parents,

95
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,011
then by the system,

96
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,722
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

97
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,515
I never said I was rejected by my city.

98
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,936
"Rejected by city."

99
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,063
That's the tribune.
Nobody reads the tribune.

100
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,273
- I do.
- Anynnay, okay, well, um...

101
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,526
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

102
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,614
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

103
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,408
- Hostage situation?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,919
I suck balls at this.

105
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,339
Why do we always have
to play war games?

106
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,216
Hey, it's practice
for our other job.

107
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,009
I'm serious.

108
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,303
Military strategy,
multiple team members,

109
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,097
each with a special skillset

110
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,015
unleashed against an unknown enemy.

111
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,226
I know how it sounds,

112
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,954
but the house keeps getting
struck by lightning, Leo.

113
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,062
I'm telling you.

114
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,481
Besides, you're the one
always talking about teamwork.

115
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,733
But we don't need guns!

116
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,235
Darla?

117
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,129
This is it. This is big time.

118
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
- We are the guns.
- Darla!

119
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,217
Why were there skittles in my pockets?

120
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,326
It was supposed to be a surprise.

121
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
It was.

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,705
Hmm, she's very moody lately.

123
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,665
Why do you think
I put skittles in her pocket?

124
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,917
- Oh.
- Whoo! Olé.

125
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,269
Is this an army of unicorns

126
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,087
- killing genghis Khan?
- Yes.

127
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,296
Unicorns aren't real.

128
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,507
It's called speculative history, Eugene.

129
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,151
- Look it up.
- Billy, you can't just leave.

130
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,385
Your guy's gonna die!

131
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,554
Whoo!

132
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,868
I told you you would get into it

133
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,060
if you gave it a chance.

134
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,604
Yeah, I'm really starting
to see the appeal.

135
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,334
What's going on?

136
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,993
Dude, what are you doing?

137
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,971
Possible 10-99 in progress.

138
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,621
Multiple reports of cracking on roadway.

139
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,498
Fraying suspension cables.

140
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,834
All units to the Ben Franklin bridge.

141
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,545
- Yeah. It's crazy music, Freddy.
- It is, isn't it?

142
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,297
Very urgent melody to it.

143
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,482
We should see it performed live.

144
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,650
I was thinking the same thing.

145
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,402
I feel like we can get tickets
to that concert.

146
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,136
Two. Maybe not six.

147
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,472
All or none. That's the rule.

148
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,308
Yet I'm still gonna walk backwards now.

149
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,894
So, now's your last and final chance.

150
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,687
Billy bat son, come with me.

151
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,481
No, no, no!

152
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,484
Man, it sure is a beautiful
day in Philadelphia!

153
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,861
Is it though?

154
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,362
- Almost finished.
- Again?

155
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,406
- Okay.
- This better be good.

156
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,828
Whoa, whoa!
Where's everyone going?

157
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,455
Um...

158
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,581
To fight crime?

159
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,668
- Okay.
- Bye, mom.

160
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,753
- Bye, mom.
- Bye, mom.

161
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,255
- Bye.
- Bye, Rosa.

162
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,925
Give it time.

163
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,435
You guys ready?

164
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,105
Shazam!

165
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,005
Oh, my god.

166
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,134
It's gonna break!

167
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,762
Run!

168
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,485
I need a hero.

169
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,698
I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night

170
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,366
he's...

171
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,581
No, no, no.

172
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,465
No way, shut up!

173
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,926
Did I just save you
while you were listening to this song?

174
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,638
No! I got you, I got you.

175
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,319
No need to panic.

176
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,987
Captain every power is here.

177
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,072
Oh.

178
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm just kidding, it's real easy.

179
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,881
Hi!

180
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,593
Oh, my gosh. Kittens!

181
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,764
Oh! They're so cute!

182
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,977
Did she just leave us?

183
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,021
Okay, let's go.

184
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,233
- Okay.
- No, no, no, I got ya!

185
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,318
That's my sidekick.

186
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,528
Captain every power junior.

187
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,905
Hey! Junior?

188
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,324
You're gonna wanna hold on tight.

189
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,596
Everyone's safe.

190
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,680
Awesome job, Mary.

191
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,058
Circle up, fam!

192
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,607
All right, here's the situation.

193
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,193
We have one more job to do

194
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,363
and that's to keep this bridge
from collapsing.

195
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,492
The Ben Franklin bridge
has collapsed.

196
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,202
Fortunately, there are
no casualties

197
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,912
thanks in part
to our local heroes,

198
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,038
one with me now.

199
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,748
It's great to be here, Nancy.

200
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
What can I say?

201
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,210
It's all in a day's work.

202
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,896
Right. Well, how do you feel
about being dubbed

203
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
the Philadelphia fiascoes?

204
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,924
Given that that's not an official title,

205
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,007
we feel nothing about it.

206
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,967
That is not our name.

207
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,570
Right, but
the important thing is...

208
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,429
What is wrong with these people?

209
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,391
Have you ever no...

210
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,726
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

211
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,996
Yeah, you should.
God only knows what they're up to.

212
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,938
Probably drugs, right?

213
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,981
Probably taking selfies
while vaping on tiktok.

214
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,066
Oh.

215
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,779
Is that a kitten?

216
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,410
"Destroy bridge"?

217
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,328
What?

218
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,247
Not saving is different than breaking.

219
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,206
Am I wrong?

220
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,124
Am I wrong about this?

221
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,001
Also, we saved countless lives.

222
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,920
A hundred sixty-two.
It's countable.

223
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,047
Emotionally countless,

224
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,551
where's Eugene?

225
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,969
Where he always is.

226
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,888
Mapping out the room of doors.

227
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
Eugene!

228
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,688
Hey, buddy! Where you at?

229
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,650
Hey, Eugene.

230
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,239
Hello? We have a meeting, Eugene.

231
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,121
Oh.

232
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
You're late.

233
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,667
Do not go in there.

234
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,132
All right, fam-jam, let's jump in.

235
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,762
All right, big day,

236
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,846
big bridge,

237
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,598
kind of a couple blunders, right?

238
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,761
But we're gonna meditate
on those mistakes right now.

239
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,732
Organic chem is my meditation.

240
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,069
Said nobody with friends ever, really.

241
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,821
In point of fact, I'd have friends

242
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,905
if I had gone to college.

243
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,092
"In point of fact"
is exactly the kind of

244
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,135
smart thing that a smart person

245
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,786
who doesn't need
to go to college says.

246
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,747
Let's go back to the tape.

247
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,499
Now, guys, as you can see,

248
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,460
we started off real, real,
real, real strong, right?

249
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,213
Right up top, all that
cohesiveness, energy,

250
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,839
terrific!

251
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,925
Oh, sorry, coach.

252
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,134
Gotta fly irl.

253
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,278
No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.

254
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,887
I know. And I love these daily recaps.

255
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,390
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

256
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,642
- It helps keep me loose!
- Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

257
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,411
We'll go have a group hang in the air.
That sounds great.

258
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,875
I gotta test this slime for toxicity

259
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,939
'cause I'm starting to... tingle.

260
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,942
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game just came on

261
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,695
so I'm gonna go ahead
and, uh, watch baseball.

262
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,155
It's right that I give tawny back.

263
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,343
Oh, come on! What is happening?

264
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,327
What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

265
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,972
If you say you have to work...

266
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,122
I have to work.

267
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,624
Why do you even have a job?

268
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,851
Wonder woman doesn't have a job!

269
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,085
- Stop.
- No, seriously.

270
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,563
Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses

271
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,647
and, hke, nobody recognizes her

272
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,505
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

273
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,589
Just stop.

274
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,717
You are holding on too tight.

275
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,012
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

276
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,431
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

277
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,516
Or me wanting to go to college

278
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,976
means I'm abandoning the family.

279
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,603
Oh. Okay, cool,

280
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,438
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

281
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,564
Yeah.

282
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,149
Do you really not see yourself?

283
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,991
You turn 18 in five months.

284
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,409
They're not gonna kick me out.

285
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,492
They didn't kick you out.

286
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,953
Victor and Rosa are saints, yes,

287
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,954
but you're about to age out

288
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,914
of the foster system just like I did.

289
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,250
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

290
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,877
Do you?

291
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,464
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

292
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,592
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

293
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,761
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

294
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,765
I don't care if wonder woman has a job.

295
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,142
I want to contribute.

296
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,977
At some point, Billy, like

297
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,271
everyone on earth,
we have to get a job or...

298
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,272
Leave home.

299
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,614
Nothing lasts forever.

300
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,417
I mean, it's literally called
the rock of eternity.

301
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,881
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

302
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,753
Leave me to die.

303
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,090
Oh, but we come bearing gifts.

304
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,227
Magic.

305
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
Impossible.

306
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,356
This realm was sealed off from magic.

307
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,861
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

308
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,488
From every god in this realm.

309
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,407
From me.

310
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,203
Do you not remember
what you took?

311
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,123
What my particular power was?

312
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,959
The power of elements.

313
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,042
No.

314
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,671
I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

315
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,256
from entering the human realm.

316
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,800
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if...

317
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,385
Someone broke this?

318
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,472
How did...

319
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,890
Where is the champion?

320
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,018
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

321
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,353
and yours that will mend it.

322
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,480
I told you.

323
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,648
I would die before I help you.

324
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,920
Now, say the word.

325
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,005
Never. Never!

326
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,882
Never say never.

327
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,849
Say the word.

328
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,443
Say the word. Say the word.

329
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,987
Shazam!

330
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,311
Now we get to have our fun.

331
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,647
Fun is for children, dear.

332
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,149
We are at war.

333
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,295
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my goodness.

334
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,397
- I am so sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

335
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,672
No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

336
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,816
No, it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

337
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,859
- I'm okay, yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

338
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,884
- I'm always okay.
- Good.

339
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,512
Uh, actually, do you...
Do you know where this is?

340
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,532
Miss Saunders!

341
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,474
Yeah, absolutely

342
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,619
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

343
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,371
Oh, no, no worries.
If it makes you feel any better

344
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,497
it's nothing compared
to the amount

345
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,707
that you're blushing right now.

346
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,971
Oh, I blush when I'm confident.

347
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,632
There she is.

348
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,903
- Hey.
- New girl. First period.

349
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,071
- Yeah.
- I'm Brett. This is Burke.

350
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,948
Listen, if you need anything at all,

351
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,783
we're your guys. We got it.

352
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,136
Brett and Burke breyer.

353
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,387
They got it all.
I mean, what is it,

354
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,329
narcissistic personality disorder,

355
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,205
chlamydia, they got it.

356
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,665
Plenty of it to go around, too.

357
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,919
This is thundercrack's
make-a-wish kid.

358
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,837
Fanboy here thinks
he's a big boy now.

359
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,189
Yeah, he doesn't know
where he belongs.

360
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,900
Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

361
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,484
'Cause that's... I'll smell
like human garbage,

362
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,428
do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!

363
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,847
Down goes Freeman.

364
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,223
Hey, hey! Look!

365
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,769
- Now I'm a superhero.
- Nice!

366
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,898
What is this thing doing here?

367
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,900
Janitors.

368
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,127
Get up, man. What are you doin'?

369
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,235
Come on.

370
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,946
You're gonna want
to get this fixed, huh?

371
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,822
Yeah, that's probably why you fell.

372
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,258
- Yeah.
- Bye, new girl.

373
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,659
Jeez, thanks, Mr. Geckle.

374
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,285
Don't sweat it. That trash can

375
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,129
was like a second home to me
when iwent here.

376
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,499
Hey.

377
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,376
You knew those guys
were gonna hit you,

378
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,294
but you stepped in anwvay.

379
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,178
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

380
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,881
The funnier I am,

381
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,634
The more I get punched.

382
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,345
Well, it made me laugh.

383
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
Hero.

384
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,234
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

385
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,337
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

386
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,071
Why would I wanna do that? Yes!

387
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,781
Thanks.

388
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,075
So, from the top.

389
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,370
What is thundercrack's
make-a-wish kid?

390
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,416
Yeah. Um, it's real inside baseball,
but basically,

391
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,876
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

392
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,878
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

393
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,257
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

394
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,258
- That was you?
- Yeah.

395
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,592
And they're still dicks to you?

396
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,737
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

397
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,430
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

398
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,473
You seem pretty cool to me.

399
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,435
Freddy!

400
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,480
Is my name.

401
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,066
Sorry, that was weird and loud.
I'm Freddy,

402
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,110
he said in a normal voice.

403
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,194
I'm Anne.

404
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,489
Anne.

405
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,075
- Nice!
- Bulls eye.

406
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,744
Hey, you gotta fix that crutch, bro!

407
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,371
What?

408
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,450
Good, little one.

409
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
Well done.

410
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,289
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

411
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,225
Wow. Um...

412
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,143
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

413
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,064
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

414
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,774
Romantic setting

415
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,819
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

416
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,403
I mean, you went all out.

417
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,615
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

418
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,825
I'm just not sure

419
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,327
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

420
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,038
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

421
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,583
I promise this is not about you.
Okay? Look...

422
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,503
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

423
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,586
You and me.

424
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,633
The dynamic duo.
The hottie god dies.

425
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,593
She-zam.

426
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,807
I guess I'm just afraid that I'm
gonna let 'em all down.

427
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,890
You know?

428
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,346
That I'm gonna let you down.

429
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,401
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

430
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,694
Let's try this crazy thing.

431
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,904
Maybe we'll, uh...

432
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,700
Seal it with a kiss?

433
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,966
Billy bat son!

434
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,301
You are a fool of a champion.

435
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,678
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

436
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,114
What happened to her beautiful face?

437
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,681
Also, aren't you, like, dead-ass dead?

438
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,100
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

439
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,060
The daughters of atlas
are coming for you.

440
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,228
Daughters of atlas?

441
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,771
They're coming to unmake your world

442
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,816
and torture mankind for all eternity

443
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,235
- in the pit of endless agony.
- Okay, I feel like maybe

444
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,679
I should be writing all this down.

445
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,821
- Quiet!
- Okay, okay.

446
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,185
You don't know what you've done.

447
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,408
I regret ever choosing you.

448
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,951
Because of you,

449
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,412
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

450
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,206
They will be hunting
for you now.

451
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,290
Hunting your family.

452
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,335
Hmm?

453
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,172
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

454
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,382
The fate of your world depends on it.

455
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,344
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

456
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,721
the daughters of atlas to do is...

457
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,409
Hey, Freddy?

458
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,840
Nope, over it. Done it.

459
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,802
Check fraud?
What, are you kidding me?

460
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,096
Armored car heist?

461
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,181
I think I got that in the bag.

462
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,602
Shazam!

463
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,316
Whoo!

464
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,905
Bon appétit.

465
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,452
- Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
- Hi.

466
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,954
Um, you wanna show me

467
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,831
where you were sitting
when it happened?

468
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,418
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

469
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,752
- Yeah. Follow me.
- Okay, yeah.

470
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,505
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

471
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,760
So I was sitting, yeah...

472
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,305
Basically, I was sitting right here,
and he was sitting

473
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,723
right there.

474
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,325
- Here?
- Right there, yeah.

475
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
Oh, sorry. Overbearing brother.

476
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,688
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

477
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,273
Always has to know where I am.

478
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
Right.

479
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,775
I feel that, clearly.

480
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,211
Always thinks she knows better, too.

481
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,963
Even when it's been
factually proven othennise?

482
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,989
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

483
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,232
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone...

484
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,826
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

485
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,971
- From the moment you wake up!
- 'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

486
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,372
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

487
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,376
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

488
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,547
Oh! Billy! What...

489
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,090
What a coin kid ink! Um...

490
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,925
I was just telling my friend Anne

491
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,844
- what a great guy you are.
- We need to talk.

492
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,572
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

493
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,307
- He's a great talker.
- Freddy.

494
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,659
I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back.

495
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
Okay.

496
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,563
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

497
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
The skin peeled off his face.

498
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,608
He turned into a literal pile of ash.

499
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,318
- Yeah, seems definitive.
- I dunno.

500
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,529
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

501
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,591
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

502
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,700
Could be
astral projection powers.

503
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,660
- What's that?
- Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

504
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,472
- from the great beyond?
- That's it, I'm calling

505
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,723
an emergency meeting aflerschool

506
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,587
- I want you there.
- Where else am I gonna go?

507
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,292
- What?
- Dude.

508
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,838
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

509
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,232
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

510
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,925
What is that, the tribune?
It's fake news!

511
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,343
Freddy, we only have one rule.

512
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,528
- All or none.
- All or none.

513
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,012
And it's a stupid rule, by the way.

514
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,889
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

515
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,599
A girl. For the first time in my life!

516
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,660
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

517
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,977
but I'll never find out

518
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,789
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

519
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,933
Just be at the rock, Freddy.

520
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,733
Okay. Mmm.

521
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,444
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

522
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,946
Total control freak.

523
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,406
I think you guys
would get along.

524
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,907
Think you'd love her, actually.

525
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,676
Look, look, look. Fam,

526
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,119
I know it sounds crazy.

527
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,328
And, and obviously

528
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,705
I don't know exactly what this all means

529
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,457
but, but he was super aggro

530
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,621
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

531
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,728
He was yelling about all this

532
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,504
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

533
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,298
Do you have to talk so loud?

534
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,175
Yeah, Mary,
'cause this is not that loud.

535
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,339
I think this is a perfectly

536
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,053
acceptable indoor voice volume.

537
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,377
What is the deal? Are you okay?

538
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,722
- Yeah.
- Why do you have

539
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,807
sunglasses on?

540
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,364
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

541
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,480
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

542
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,275
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

543
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,694
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

544
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,281
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

545
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,491
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

546
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,784
No, she_.

547
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,578
Yeah. Can we get back on track?

548
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,371
Listen, he's yelling at me

549
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,373
and he's saying the daughters of atlas

550
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,208
are coming to hunt us.

551
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,626
So, check out what I found.

552
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,350
"The daughters of atlas
are the offspring"

553
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,671
"of the titan atlas..."

554
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,131
Which is obvious,

555
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,385
but also nyx, the goddess
of night and death.

556
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,095
Well, good things
can happen at night.

557
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,347
And death.

558
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,849
Let me see this.

559
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,232
"The daughters
guard the mythic tree of life

560
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,028
"which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

561
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,946
"which gave birth to their realm

562
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,448
"protected by a

563
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,575
- "dragon."
- hey, now.

564
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,803
And I am suddenly here for this.

565
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,870
I know, right?

566
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,753
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

567
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,582
- On the other hand, dragon!
- Dragon!

568
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,250
Mary. What are we doin'?

569
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,128
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

570
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,756
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

571
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,508
and, and, and look,

572
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,843
I often think that you think
better than me.

573
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,787
The wizard did not exactly give me

574
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,430
a tutorial here, guys, okay?

575
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,058
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

576
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,227
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

577
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,454
that is, like,
constantly burning

578
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,896
which is super weird but also

579
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,373
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

580
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,400
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

581
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,736
And it's not like I'm not tryin'.

582
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,030
But I really,
really need your help.

583
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,993
Uh, I might know somebody that can help.

584
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,625
Shut up. That lights up?

585
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,338
Shut up.

586
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,206
So, I'm mapping out the entire lair

587
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,374
and you withhold this?

588
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,726
And you have really
been holding out on us.

589
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,750
Jeez Louise, dude.

590
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,172
- Whoa!
- "Whoa" what?

591
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,841
- "Whoa" what?
- Look!

592
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,564
Hey, Steve.

593
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,013
What? You call the pen "Steve"?

594
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,696
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

595
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,683
He totally looks like a "Steve."

596
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,687
"'Crime and punishment, '
a book report by Pedro pena?"

597
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,896
Yeah.

598
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,316
Pedro.

599
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,277
- Dude, that's cheating.
- I mean, he knows everything.

600
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,237
- Hmm.
- Seriously. Ask him.

601
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,947
You can just ask him stuff?

602
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,824
- Pretty much.
- Slick. Okay, cool.

603
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,535
Steve, we're looking
for information

604
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,537
about the daughters of atlas.

605
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,623
Can you please help us
with that?

606
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,757
- These are book titles.
- Okay.

607
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,318
Let's just all pick a book,
or something.

608
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,761
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

609
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,012
Definitely his thing.

610
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,307
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

611
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,315
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

612
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,692
Don't lie.
This is where you hang out

613
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,527
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

614
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,331
No, actually, why would
they ever have to...

615
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,322
Why would they ever come here?

616
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,085
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

617
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,117
Do you actually know those guys?

618
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,787
Or is this like a
"Canadian girlfriend" situation?

619
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:04,996
Oh, you mean collette?

620
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,123
Well, she and I aren't
really exclusive, as of now.

621
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,660
Do you wanna meet one of them?

622
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,338
Meet, like how?

623
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,881
Like, face-to-face, right now.

624
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,258
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

625
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,843
And today is your lucky day,

626
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,679
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

627
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,014
Her?

628
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,098
No, the male hot one.

629
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,308
Him?

630
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,810
What? Him?

631
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,312
Look, I mean,
it's all subjective, right? But, um...

632
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,439
Captain every power usually
tops most online polls

633
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,607
so... it's no big deal.

634
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,069
Is this a joke, Freddy? 'Cause

635
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,192
I didn't mean to make you
actually prove it, really.

636
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,326
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

637
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,179
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

638
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,205
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

639
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,208
Hey, captain every power.
What's goin' on?

640
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,002
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

641
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,313
Remember that time
I saved your life?

642
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,417
No, no, no, the other time.

643
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,506
Yeah.

644
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
Well, I'm calling in

645
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,426
that favor.

646
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,061
You must be Anne.

647
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,772
Oh, my god.

648
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,775
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

649
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,820
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

650
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,576
You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

651
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,744
but that kid,

652
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,287
he's the real hero.

653
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,414
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

654
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,082
I've never met anyone like him.

655
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,460
He's... genuine

656
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,254
and warm and funny.

657
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,109
- That's a lot of nice things.
- Yeah.

658
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,217
How did you two meet?

659
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,343
Comic con.

660
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,512
- What's comic con?
- What?

661
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,740
According to this,

662
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,016
gods considered humans servants,

663
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,934
toys to be played with,

664
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,686
children to be punished.

665
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,064
Thanks, Steve.

666
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,525
Until the rebellion,
when the humans turned on the gods.

667
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,277
I'm reading about that right now.

668
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,987
So, apparently, all of this

669
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,989
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

670
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,074
So atlas, uh, the father

671
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,285
of the daughters of atlas,
obviously, yeah,

672
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,208
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the tree of life

673
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,873
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

674
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,751
but also to take powers away
from others.

675
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,421
So, the staff's where atlas
stored all supernatural power.

676
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:22,133
Yes, exactly.
It's like a, a battery for magic.

677
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,760
But when things got bad,

678
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,805
a council of human wizards
got together and they

679
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,968
stole the staff from atlas.

680
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,450
And they used that to take
his powers away.

681
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,577
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

682
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,201
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy.

683
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,468
This is the wizard that I know!

684
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,272
What do these say?

685
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:42,946
"The wisdom of Solomon,

686
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,906
strength of Hercules,
stamina of atlas,

687
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,349
power of Zeus,
courage of achilles,

688
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,242
speed of Mercury."

689
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,993
These are the powers they stole.

690
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,374
Whoa, guys, look!

691
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,559
This is what the name means.

692
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

693
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,144
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

694
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,439
If I may point out one
of the powers

695
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,424
that may be possibly Mia. Boop.

696
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,342
I'm sorry,

697
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,262
are you very unsubtly implying

698
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,514
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

699
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,891
- solo man?
- Yeah.

700
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,972
Well, maybe it comes later.

701
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,604
I mean, you do usually
ask Mary what to do.

702
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,689
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah.

703
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,982
This is very, very hurtful.

704
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,292
I just want you all to know that.

705
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,651
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

706
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,236
Oh.

707
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,904
What else have we learned, fam?

708
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,575
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

709
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,705
the wizards apparently
encased the god realm in some

710
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
magical sphere

711
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,834
sealing it away forever.

712
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,918
Cut off from magic.

713
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,130
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

714
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,383
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

715
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,679
A bizarre and gruesome scene
unfolded

716
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,306
in Athens, Greece this morning.

717
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,367
Two women, dressed in what
appears to be ancient Greek...

718
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's the wizard's staff.

719
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,643
How did they get that?

720
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,395
So, all those statues
used to be people.

721
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,065
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

722
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,567
where Greece is at?

723
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,822
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

724
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,616
You want it back?

725
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,822
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

726
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:15,955
So, that's probably

727
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,248
where the journey started.

728
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,249
- You know?
- What?

729
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,573
What do you mean, "what?" What?

730
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,426
- You just left it there?
- We were all there.

731
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,671
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

732
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,835
You're welcome, by the way.

733
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,734
And then I had to break it
in half so sivana didn't do

734
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,885
super bad-guy stuff with it, okay?

735
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,261
You broke the staff,

736
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,388
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

737
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,723
Which we now know.

738
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,516
We also now know
what they look like,

739
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,494
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

740
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
- coming a...
- Three.

741
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,687
What?

742
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,066
Atlas had three daughters.

743
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,526
Kalypso, hespera,

744
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,236
an the a.

745
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,948
Anne... thea.

746
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,869
You know, I'm not just a superhero.

747
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,372
I'm a super listener.

748
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,582
And

749
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,875
isense_.

750
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,045
That you may have feelings for Freddy.

751
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,631
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

752
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:08,984
Don't want him to get hurt.

753
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,345
Oh, well, Anne...
I mean, we can't choose

754
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,972
the people we fall for.

755
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,056
What?

756
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,433
I'm not talking about that.

757
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,269
If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.

758
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,771
Whoa! Look who you're with.

759
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,065
What could possibly
be dangerous?

760
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,987
Okay.

761
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,071
I see how it is.

762
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,905
Let's dance.

763
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:35,952
Oh, my god.

764
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,536
Freddy?

765
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,498
Oh, Freddy, I, I didn't know.

766
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,083
I never meant for you to get hurt.

767
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,002
Oh, I'm not the one
who's gonna get hurt.

768
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,837
Shazam!

769
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,423
Shazam!

770
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,508
Shazam.

771
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,635
- What's going on up here?
- Mis...

772
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,053
Freddy, are you all right?

773
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,489
Get back inside. Just get back
inside, Mr. Geckle.

774
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,557
I'm okay. Go back inside.

775
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,058
Who are you?
Do you have kids here?

776
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,494
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

777
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,187
I won't touch him.
You have my word.

778
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,782
Mr. G. Wha...

779
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,306
What did she say?
What are you doing?

780
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,370
What are you doing?

781
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,951
What are you... no, no, no!

782
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,725
Stop, stop, stop! Wait,
wait, wait! Hey, no, no, no!

783
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,334
Vvah, no, no, no! No!
No, no, no!

784
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,799
I forgot how easily they burst.

785
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,009
Why would you do that?

786
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,011
Like grapes.

787
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,099
What the... huh?

788
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,156
Now, child, tell us where
to find the others.

789
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,449
No need.

790
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,915
Clip his wings, an the a.

791
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,575
Wait.

792
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,454
There are more.

793
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,296
- Perfect. We take them all.
- No.

794
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,631
That's not why we're here.

795
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,134
We're here for the seed of life.
Yield, sister.

796
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,927
We stick to the plan we have.

797
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,262
Father would never yield.

798
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,721
And father is dead.

799
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,349
Now, you know your place, sister.

800
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,059
Or I will show it to you.

801
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,397
We do this our way, not theirs.

802
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,239
Make one move...

803
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,454
And I will snap
this child's neck.

804
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,443
Oh, Freddy.

805
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,451
Billy, no!

806
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,546
Billy, stay back!

807
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,322
They're using the staff
to take our powers.

808
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,917
What? What?

809
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,600
Sorry!

810
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,271
I'm sorry,

811
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,897
I'm sorry, just, just save yourself.

812
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,108
No, no, all or none.
We stick together.

813
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,772
And that you will

814
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,236
because you cannot leave.

815
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,946
Let's see how you like being

816
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,031
sealed off in a dying world.

817
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,616
No!

818
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:28,828
Freddy!

819
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,091
From city line
Avenue in the north

820
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,215
to the western shore
of the schuylkill river

821
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,133
to cobbs creek.

822
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,385
The unidentified barrier appears

823
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,886
to be in the shape of a dome

824
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,015
with no one allowed
into the city or out

825
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,977
with some suggesting
this strange magical element

826
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,857
may be the doing, or undoing,
of the Philadelphia fiascoes.

827
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,113
[Yelpsi.

828
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,377
- Holy sh...
- Shh!

829
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,671
I'm trying to sleep.

830
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,216
It is the only escape
from the tortures here.

831
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,510
Okay. Bleak.

832
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,221
Wait a second.

833
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,141
Hagrid beard, Batman voice.

834
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,685
You're the wizard.
You're the wizard! Oh, my...

835
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,369
You're back!
Billy told me all about you.

836
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,564
Billy? You know Billy bat son?

837
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,042
Billy bat son. Yeah,
he's my best friend.

838
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,193
I'm... I'm Freddy Freeman,
captain every power.

839
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,028
Well, used to be.
It's complicated now.

840
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,196
She... it's complicated.

841
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,199
That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of shazam?

842
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,426
Yeah, he did. And he said that

843
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,930
you turned into ash, but, but didn't?

844
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,497
Once I gave him the power

845
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,332
I could no longer remain
in my realm.

846
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,918
But death would have been a luxury

847
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,961
compared to being trapped in this cell

848
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,631
with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

849
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,632
Mostly with you.

850
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,068
A little more sarcastic than Billy said,

851
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:07,635
but, hey, all good.

852
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,072
- Let's just get out of here.
- "Let's just get out of here."

853
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,347
Yeah, sure.

854
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,057
I sound nothing like that, but okay.

855
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,260
Here's what we've got, um...

856
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,227
A cranky wizard with a cynical streak

857
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,288
and a precocious young man
with an encyclopedic knowledge

858
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,855
regarding magical shit.

859
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,775
There is no way these sisters
are keeping us in here.

860
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,868
These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!

861
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,906
- What spells do you know?
- Please, stop talking.

862
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,199
How about an arcane focus?

863
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,534
I don't even know what that is.

864
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,429
Fine, then let's make a potion.

865
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,997
Like a potion of, um, giant
strength or diminution.

866
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,791
Oh! Gaseous form!

867
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,876
Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

868
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,672
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

869
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,675
We will die here, free by.

870
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,428
It's Freddy, by the way-
"free by"? Where do you even...

871
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,971
The sooner you accept it,

872
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,140
the easier it will be.

873
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,642
Is this a tooth?
There's a tooth in here!

874
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,436
Hmm.

875
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,072
"Power of elements.
Power of chaos."

876
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,241
"Power of axis."

877
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,909
These are primordial forces.

878
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,744
I don't know how we fight
powers like this.

879
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,621
I tell you how we fight it.

880
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,206
With the wisdom of...

881
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,334
- Solomon.
- Exactly.

882
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,128
We, we set up a meeting.

883
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,589
Yeah, we tell 'em we want to negotiate.

884
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,883
Offer up our powers for Freddy.

885
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,801
But then we grab one of them

886
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,553
and that's what we really use to trade!

887
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,096
But what if they steal our powers?

888
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,348
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

889
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,660
You know what I mean?
If they just point that staff at us,

890
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,911
we dodge.

891
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,935
Like dodge ball.

892
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,898
- Hmm.
- Dude, I suck at dodge ball.

893
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,108
Well, maybe Pedro sucks
at dodge ball,

894
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,109
but not super Pedro.

895
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,778
No, super Pedro also sucks at dodge ball.

896
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,238
Fine. Listen, all I know

897
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,841
is that there's five of us
and three of them.

898
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,201
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

899
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,787
Okay.

900
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,539
So, Steve says that this paper

901
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,000
is a stack of magical parchment.

902
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,085
You write a message
on the magical paper

903
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,963
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

904
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,382
and then the paper folds
into a...

905
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,219
Oh, my god, yes!

906
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,888
A paper bird.

907
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,515
And it flies to the god.

908
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,159
Well, that's kinda cute.

909
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,811
Hey, what about demigods?
Uh, you know, like, wonder woman?

910
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,940
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

911
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,276
Did the pen just shrug?

912
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,530
Hey, Steve, do I just dictate to...

913
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,407
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

914
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,784
All right.

915
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,119
Letter...

916
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,582
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

917
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,203
I was just talking out loud.

918
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,211
That's not a part of the letter.
Wad that up, too.

919
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,797
Maybe, if you try

920
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,466
- speaking from the heart.
- Hmm.

921
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,343
"Dear daughters of atlas,"

922
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,346
"violence is not the answer."

923
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,536
Child,

924
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,122
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

925
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,206
Honesty.

926
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,252
Yeah, wow, very, um,
ironic subject choice.

927
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,379
The other champions...

928
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,756
Are they children like yourself?

929
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,633
What even is a child?

930
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,428
I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.

931
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,096
Yes or no?

932
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,307
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

933
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,550
to Grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

934
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:48,147
- Give us their names.
- The names of the champions?

935
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,900
Um, well, there's Brett
breyer, and, uh, Burke breyer.

936
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,136
Are you guys taking this stuff in?

937
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,696
Writing this down? No?

938
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:56,822
They drive a dodge ram.

939
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,948
He's lying.

940
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,242
That's your superpower, not mine.

941
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,546
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

942
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:04,747
One of you.

943
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,914
Probably you.

944
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,126
Hold him.

945
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,422
Don't... What's happening?

946
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,798
What is that? What's she doing?

947
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,008
Power of chaos.

948
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,802
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

949
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,472
Oh. My mind is already trash,

950
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,807
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

951
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,060
Because nobody has the balls

952
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,187
to handle what's
inside my brain.

953
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,439
Say their names.

954
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,656
Say their names.

955
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,533
Say their names.
Say their names.

956
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,415
Destiny's child did it better.

957
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,958
He is stronger than he looks.

958
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,962
- Say their names.
- Stop!

959
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,716
Billy...

960
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,638
Billy bats...

961
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,935
Billy b...

962
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,018
Stop.

963
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,649
This is from the champions.

964
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,985
"Dear daughters of atlas,

965
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,488
violence is not the answer.

966
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,533
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

967
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,993
- "We'd like to make a trade."
- What?

968
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,537
"We'll give up our powers

969
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,873
if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

970
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,918
othennise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

971
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,336
Smart, Eugene.

972
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,797
Steve, add 'unharmed'

973
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,133
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

974
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,969
no, 'sincerely, best'.

975
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,930
'Maybe just signed
'the champions.'

976
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,724
should we proofread it?

977
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,892
Naw, Steve doesn't make mistakes,

978
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,436
just writes what you say.

979
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,856
Great. I feel good about this.
Me, too.

980
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,859
Anyone else want a gatorade?

981
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,152
"Do we have red?"

982
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,863
What is this gatorade?

983
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,575
[Ye! Losi

984
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,076
- is it a weapon?
- Sister.

985
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,162
We need not torture him any longer.

986
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,245
You heard the letter.

987
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,083
- Throw them in the pit.
- Wait.

988
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,669
They want to make a trade.

989
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,840
And we will meet, sister.

990
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,550
But humans are not to be trusted.

991
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,345
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place, right?

992
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,056
Right?

993
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,409
Are you hurt?

994
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,787
No, just worthless.

995
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,998
- Well, you must get up.
- For what?

996
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,459
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just

997
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,480
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

998
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,714
Oh, feelings.

999
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,981
- I see something moving.
- Yeah, I see it too.

1000
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:35,666
Oh, shit.

1001
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,085
What is that?

1002
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,461
Ladon.

1003
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,797
The guardian of the garden of atlas.

1004
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,268
- Run.
- I can't. I can't!

1005
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,538
You're okay! You're okay.

1006
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,248
I don't feel okay at all.

1007
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,333
That's the power of the dragon.

1008
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,544
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

1009
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,338
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

1010
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,716
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

1011
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,386
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

1012
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,305
- very rare.
- An the a!

1013
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,639
I must go.

1014
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,226
The door back to your world is
at the center of the labyrinth.

1015
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,477
Right, left, left

1016
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,563
and then follow the right-hand
wall to the center.

1017
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,524
- You'll need this.
- How did you find this?

1018
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,151
You once protected me
from the bullies

1019
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,236
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

1020
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,613
Now I've protected you in mine.

1021
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,953
Hero.

1022
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,040
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

1023
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,708
I was about to rearrange those boys'

1024
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,376
internal organs
when you stepped in.

1025
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,129
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1026
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,007
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1027
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,761
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1028
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,307
How lovely for both of you.

1029
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,643
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get...

1030
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,479
You should go.
My sisters don't need you anymore.

1031
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,064
All they require now is the seed.

1032
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,650
- The seed?
- Yes.

1033
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,152
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1034
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,075
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

1035
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,448
Did you just call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1036
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,838
Hi, god... no?

1037
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,010
Yo, low voltage.

1038
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,597
When you fixing
this dome shit, man?

1039
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,182
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

1040
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,600
I have a plan.

1041
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,977
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1042
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,740
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1043
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:02,854
No, these sandwiches?

1044
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,207
No, these sandwiches
are important.

1045
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,524
They're, they're for a meeting.

1046
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,569
Yeah, sure, colonel cheese steak.

1047
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,779
Colonel?

1048
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,699
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

1049
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,204
Quiet one, she is.

1050
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:22,332
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1051
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:24,960
Is that...

1052
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,212
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

1053
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,925
Right, so, look, here's the thing,
um, you're upset.

1054
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,736
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

1055
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,096
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

1056
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,182
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

1057
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,600
like, really personally

1058
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,078
and, like, I don't even
know you, lady, right?

1059
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,646
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1060
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,857
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

1061
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,276
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1062
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,237
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1063
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,464
dropped the money on the ground

1064
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,324
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1065
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,578
Now, imagine it is not money,

1066
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,539
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1067
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,583
The last breath of your mother.

1068
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,085
The power of all the gods,

1069
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,297
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1070
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,050
And now this magic courses
through you,

1071
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,843
and you have the gall

1072
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,512
to believe that you deserve it?

1073
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,017
This is very personal,

1074
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,269
Billy.

1075
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,191
You are very menacing.

1076
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,526
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1077
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,111
I see the presence
that you have,

1078
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,279
and that goes a long way.

1079
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,825
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1080
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,845
- There is no compromise.
- There is no compromise.

1081
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,746
I knew you were gonna say that.

1082
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,082
Wisdom of saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1083
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,166
Give us back Freddy,

1084
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,667
you take down this

1085
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,879
sphere-y dome-y magic bowl thing

1086
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,214
and then, you know,

1087
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,299
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1088
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,634
It's a good offer.

1089
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,717
I'm being serious.

1090
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,346
You play the part of a man,

1091
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,348
but you do not play it well.

1092
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,684
Give us the powers, child.

1093
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,019
All of them.

1094
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,605
You are no leader, Billy.

1095
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,358
You are a lost boy

1096
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,653
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1097
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,030
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1098
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,949
'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,

1099
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,742
but I think I have
a few experiences

1100
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:21,827
that you don't have.

1101
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,370
'Cause I've seen all of the

1102
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,996
fast and the furious movies, lady.

1103
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,207
And let me tell you something.

1104
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,460
It's all about family!

1105
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,967
Family!

1106
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,402
Guys, that was the signal.
We practiced this,

1107
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,262
like, 12 times. Thank you.

1108
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,431
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, goddess?

1109
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,644
No, human.
You forgot about mine.

1110
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,197
Come on!

1111
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,282
- Let's go.
- Pedro!

1112
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,528
You're wasting my time, boy.

1113
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,235
Yeah.

1114
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:19,903
Whoo!

1115
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,571
She sure didn't see that coming

1116
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,658
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor.

1117
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,535
Uh, Darla, that was, 'cause...

1118
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,038
A euphemism. It was a euphemism.

1119
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,922
No!

1120
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,079
We've taken the power from two

1121
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,896
in your family already.

1122
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,565
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1123
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:59,734
So you can keep playing soldier?

1124
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,897
My father was atlas.

1125
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,693
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1126
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,157
His magic and power
may course through you,

1127
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,535
but you will never be a true god.

1128
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,579
Oh yeah? Did your dad
have super speed?

1129
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,294
Nope!

1130
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,552
You okay? That was fun.
Let's go.

1131
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,850
Come on. Come on, come on.

1132
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,228
Hurry, everyone!

1133
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,813
Let's go, let's go.

1134
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,783
What?

1135
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,637
You thought you were just goin'

1136
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,301
into some regular port a-potty,
didn't ya?

1137
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,415
Which I can somehow still smell.

1138
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,709
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks around.
It's crazy, right?

1139
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,794
- Yeah.
- Like, permeates

1140
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,420
the air. Doesn't matter. Anwvay,

1141
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,963
welcome to the rock of eternity.

1142
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,840
Only champions

1143
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:48,635
can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1144
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,054
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1145
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,099
Guys, that's what I call
a total success.

1146
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,435
Okay, maybe, like, a partial total win.

1147
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,479
- Told you I suck at dodge ball.
- Yeah,

1148
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,939
you do, yeah, but you know,

1149
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,291
look, Pedro, we all have our weak spots.

1150
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,733
You know what I mean?

1151
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,402
And hers...

1152
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,945
Lack of strategic thinking.

1153
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,238
Now for the real trade.

1154
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,783
Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom.

1155
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,886
And get rid of the dome.

1156
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,953
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,454
And get rid of the dome.

1158
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,790
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1159
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,083
is gettin' a little moist.

1160
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,545
Word choice, man.

1161
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,022
Yeah, I regretted it as soon as

1162
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,246
it was coming out of my mouth.

1163
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,358
It's just one of those words...

1164
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,422
I know. I just...

1165
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,682
"Dear daughters of ass hat-las."

1166
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,016
Burn!

1167
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:38,601
I just came up with that.

1168
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,079
Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,

1169
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,354
so it's really clear. Okay.

1170
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,402
Man, it's so good having
Steve cover grammar and

1171
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,693
spelling and stuff, it makes
me sound so much smarter.

1172
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,028
So...

1173
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,573
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1174
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,283
"How's that feel?

1175
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,576
"Also,

1176
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,369
"how are you actually sisters,
because

1177
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,581
"the age difference is
very noticeable, and"

1178
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,224
"slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1179
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,687
Even though I don't like you
very much,

1180
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,713
I believe everyone
deserves human rights,

1181
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,465
but you don't deserve strawberry.

1182
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,384
You only get yellow.

1183
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,012
She's gone!

1184
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,640
Wait, what?

1185
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,320
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1186
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,404
She wanted to get caught.

1187
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,742
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1188
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,504
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1189
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,763
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo.

1190
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,807
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1191
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,351
I don't know.

1192
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,937
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1193
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,022
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1194
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,568
You're the wizard.

1195
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,653
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

1196
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,113
Now let's see if that

1197
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,823
girlfriend of yours can be trusted.

1198
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,091
Get back, get back. Get back, get back.

1199
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,138
Okay, I think
the coast is clear. Let's go home.

1200
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,205
One moment.

1201
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,291
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1202
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,793
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1203
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:09,794
What's the big deal?

1204
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,339
The golden apple.
From the tree of life.

1205
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,507
From the tree of life.

1206
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,010
Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1207
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,431
- Billy!
- Billy. Gosh.

1208
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:25,643
Where are you going now?

1209
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,694
Nope.

1210
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,529
She's not in there.

1211
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:38,573
Nope.

1212
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,074
No, no, no. That's a hard pass.

1213
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,493
- That's a hard pass.
- Yo, Billy,

1214
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:43,596
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1215
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,460
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1216
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,624
Like an ancient Greek

1217
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,907
- labyrinth?
- Guys...

1218
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,210
Porta-potty.

1219
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,796
Mmm.

1220
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,015
Hespera.

1221
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,980
It's over, sisters.

1222
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,651
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1223
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,279
Or we plant it in their realm.

1224
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,908
But that would destroy
their world.

1225
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,161
Just as they destroyed ours.

1226
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,663
You can't be serious.

1227
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,207
- Yes.
- No.

1228
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,833
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1229
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,585
An the a, you simpering bore.

1230
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,212
She's right, we've spent ages

1231
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,755
waiting for this moment.

1232
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,173
We have the seed.

1233
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,133
We have the staff and its powers.

1234
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,577
We are not squandering it

1235
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,428
for your personal satisfaction.

1236
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,181
No, I should go, not you.

1237
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,867
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1238
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,035
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly

1239
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,060
sing "sneak thief."

1240
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,978
But here's the deal.

1241
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,373
Your knees crack like crazy
when you walk.

1242
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,582
It's pathetic.

1243
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,607
See?

1244
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,193
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1245
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,445
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1246
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,740
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1247
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,035
That's it. You nailed it.

1248
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:07,734
I'll see you on the other side.

1249
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,141
Even if we did, the tree of life

1250
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,542
would not thrive in their soil.

1251
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,962
It would despoil,
it would disfigure into something...

1252
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,380
Monstrous?

1253
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,090
That is what humans are.

1254
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,110
It is only fitting that we bring

1255
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,719
our monsters to their world

1256
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,221
and do to them as they did to us.

1257
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,977
We agreed to restore balance

1258
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,145
and vengeance has great

1259
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,188
measure of weight on those scales.

1260
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,316
An the a, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1261
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,735
- No, not all.
- All.

1262
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,237
Sister, I fear your rage

1263
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,480
has gotten the better of you.

1264
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:43,865
Why?

1265
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,492
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1266
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,578
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1267
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,164
They actually pray for order and peace

1268
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,167
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1269
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,794
An the a, I want you to take the apple

1270
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,755
and plant it in our garden.

1271
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,483
Of course you turn to her.

1272
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,217
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1273
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,971
Where did that even come from?

1274
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,516
- Hi!
- You favor her, hespera,

1275
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,018
and see how she betrays us.

1276
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,332
Deliver him to his proper fate, sister.

1277
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,650
- No!
- Kill him!

1278
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,197
What is that?

1279
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,616
Great question. No idea.

1280
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,785
But made you look.

1281
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,703
Billy!

1282
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,664
Oh!

1283
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,000
Your crutch!

1284
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,795
Oh! Shazam!

1285
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:39,879
- Yes!
- No!

1286
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,802
So, we have a lot to talk about.

1287
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,147
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1288
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,859
You are not fit to wield it.

1289
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,110
More fit than you.

1290
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,029
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1291
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,865
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1292
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,409
but everyone here
has become weak.

1293
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,704
Ladon, world-eater,

1294
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,666
rise from the pit!

1295
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:26,843
Go, go, go!

1296
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,403
Captain every power!
Where's he going?

1297
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,427
What the...

1298
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,280
Victor?

1299
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,781
Victor, wake up.

1300
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,201
Hello. Oh, god, woman. What?

1301
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,953
Dad. We gotta go!

1302
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,497
- We gotta get out of here.
- We have to go right now!

1303
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,541
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1304
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,060
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1305
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,084
Just don't freak out.

1306
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:08,735
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1307
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,237
Rosa, it's Billy, okay?
And that's Eugene,

1308
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:11,596
- and that's Freddy...
- It's me.

1309
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,139
That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

1310
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,724
and then Pedro,
just normal Pedro.

1311
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,120
Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1312
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,344
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1313
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,981
- We're superheroes.
- I'm gay.

1314
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:23,982
Yeah, we know, bud.

1315
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,193
- You knew?
- Yeah.

1316
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,363
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1317
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,449
- I'm the wizard.
- Oh, this is the wizard.

1318
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,968
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1319
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,911
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1320
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:35,912
You gotta put on these clothes.

1321
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,622
This is so weird.

1322
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:38,706
Yep, yep.

1323
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,417
You guys are the Philly fiascoes?

1324
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,753
Okay. This is in no way

1325
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,230
an acknowledgement
of that stupid nickname

1326
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,065
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1327
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,050
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1328
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:50,842
Dragon?

1329
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,983
You okay?

1330
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,007
Okay.

1331
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,719
I know this is a lot to take in,

1332
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,763
but I promise to explain it all later.

1333
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:36,764
Explain what?

1334
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,034
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1335
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,869
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1336
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,104
- Yeah.
- Wait, you bought the house?

1337
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,522
Yeah.

1338
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:52,965
Run! Go!

1339
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,581
Oh, no.

1340
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,335
Get down.

1341
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,045
Okay, that's it!

1342
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,216
Again?

1343
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,885
Freddy!

1344
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,349
Hey, hey!
This is what you want, right?

1345
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,157
Come on, we're good. We're good.

1346
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,840
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

1347
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,104
No.

1348
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,771
Hey. Are you okay?

1349
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,480
You okay?

1350
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:52,982
All right.

1351
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,570
Now, where is this dragon?

1352
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,100
Fitting place for a garden.

1353
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,118
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1354
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:02,965
Go! Let's go, let's go!

1355
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,472
Oh, god, I'm slipping! Slipping!

1356
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:13,600
My shoe!

1357
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:34,913
Holy moly.

1358
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,145
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1359
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,856
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1360
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:05,652
Your world will not
survive this.

1361
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:06,820
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1362
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,030
He's right.

1363
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,199
Anne!

1364
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,369
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm okay, I'm fine.

1365
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,163
In the god realm, this tree

1366
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,291
is a thing of beauty.

1367
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,584
Of peace.

1368
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,337
It was not meant
for the soil of this realm

1369
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,899
and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.

1370
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,092
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1371
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:29,593
I must try to sway hespera.

1372
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,221
Only she can subdue our sister.

1373
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,264
I will give it my all, or die trying.

1374
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,682
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1375
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,486
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1376
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,520
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1377
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,355
I've lived a long life.

1378
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,582
What are you talking about,
"lived a long life?"

1379
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:43,958
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1380
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,235
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1381
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,736
Oh?

1382
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,239
You look great.

1383
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:58,414
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1384
01:21:58,914 --> 01:21:59,915
Yeah.

1385
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,134
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1386
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,885
We have to figure something out.

1387
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,178
Take my powers back.

1388
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:15,681
- No, Billy!
- No, no, no.

1389
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,765
Hey, take my powers back.

1390
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,576
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1391
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,936
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1392
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,247
You think I know how to fix this, dude,

1393
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,564
but I really don't, okay?

1394
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,233
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1395
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,961
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1396
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,403
which means you know what to do.

1397
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:30,487
And you were right.

1398
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,240
You picked the wrong champion, man.

1399
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,677
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1400
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,703
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1401
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,958
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1402
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:44,459
No.

1403
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,170
You don't have a shred of wisdom

1404
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:47,713
in that brain of yours.

1405
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,716
But your heart is wise.

1406
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,760
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1407
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:58,432
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1408
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,269
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1409
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,229
with my brothers and sisters.

1410
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,648
But when you shared your powers,

1411
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,318
you did not hesitate.

1412
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,778
For you, everyone can be worthy

1413
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,280
if given a chance.

1414
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,033
Now, go fight for your family.

1415
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,285
Go fight for the world.

1416
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,371
I chose right when I chose you.

1417
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,210
Billy?

1418
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,045
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1419
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,606
Same thing we always do, Freddy.
Save the god...

1420
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,757
Darn world.

1421
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,026
Now, I'm gonna go get that staff

1422
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,718
and I need you to lure
these things away

1423
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:37,387
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1424
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,473
Wait, wait, wait, Billy, Billy.

1425
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,725
Can I just see you, before you go?

1426
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,310
Not this version.

1427
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,729
You... you.

1428
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,146
My Billy.

1429
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,195
Shazam!

1430
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,648
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1431
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,162
Hey.

1432
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,089
I promise after this

1433
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,007
if I don't get eaten
by a dragon,

1434
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,302
I'm not gonna force you
to keep me.

1435
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,721
- Okay?
- What?

1436
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,515
I know I age out soon.

1437
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:23,684
Billy.

1438
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:27,980
My wonderful, kind, brave, son.

1439
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,315
You will never age out of your home.

1440
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,235
Neven

1441
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:38,824
now, do me a favor

1442
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,286
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1443
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:44,913
go kick their ass, okay?

1444
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:47,207
I love you, mom.

1445
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,793
Me too.

1446
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,714
Shazam!

1447
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,804
That's gonna take
some getting used to.

1448
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,098
Everybody to the battle wagon!

1449
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,600
The battle wagon?

1450
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,618
Trying to get into the spirit of things.

1451
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,748
Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1452
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:28,832
I do.

1453
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,376
And what I see is just.

1454
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,919
Hespera, look at this tree.

1455
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:35,130
It is blighted.
It is unnatural here.

1456
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,466
We made a vow
to restore our realm,

1457
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:38,717
not destroy another.

1458
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,927
A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1459
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,305
They did not know their place,

1460
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,848
so I am showing it to them.

1461
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:48,477
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1462
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,604
No. I'm putting an end to this.

1463
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,406
Hespera.

1464
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,123
Hespera.

1465
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,461
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1466
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,838
then perhaps you should
be human.

1467
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,813
Help, somebody!

1468
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,690
Somebody help!

1469
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:17,899
Somebody help!

1470
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,806
Okay, now what?
There are only so many minotaurs

1471
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:32,990
I can run over with this Van.

1472
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,587
Hey, Steve.

1473
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,798
What are monsters afraid of?

1474
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:46,636
"The king of beasts."

1475
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,804
Lions?

1476
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:48,972
Unicorns.

1477
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:51,183
Really? I love unicorns.

1478
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,101
Yet, the unicorn
does not love you.

1479
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:55,270
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

1480
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,189
What?

1481
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,818
- Oh, my...
- Ah!

1482
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,403
I guess maybe it's not so crazy.

1483
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,447
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature

1484
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,698
of its realm.

1485
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:07,824
Ruthless and cruel,

1486
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,576
not like the ponies
from your storybooks.

1487
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,119
They loathe humanity.

1488
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,871
Is there anything they do like?

1489
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,416
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1490
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,019
Ambrosia. It's like
the nectar of the gods.

1491
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:19,523
It's supposed to be sweet,
like honey.

1492
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:20,921
I have an idea.

1493
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,547
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1494
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:25,258
Guys, get as many of these
people to safety as you can.

1495
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,301
Kids?

1496
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,350
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go!

1497
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,518
Wizard?

1498
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:36,894
I'm going with them.

1499
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:38,647
Freddy?

1500
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,066
Anne?

1501
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,610
Anne!

1502
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:45,945
Anne!

1503
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,535
I am not entirely sure
how to parent here.

1504
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:00,794
Hey! Khaleesi!

1505
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:17,143
Whoo! That was really satisfying.

1506
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,228
How was that for you?

1507
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,330
Yeah.

1508
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,374
We love you, thunder crack.

1509
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,001
You're the best, captain marvel.

1510
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,378
- Yeah, go, high voltage!
- Oh, wassup, bro?

1511
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,006
It's maximum voltage actually,
amongst other names.

1512
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,729
We're still kinda work shopping it, so...

1513
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,183
You thought you were invulnerable.

1514
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,476
But, no.

1515
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,770
Magical fire.

1516
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,689
Magic can kill magic.

1517
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
"magic kills magic."

1518
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:05,734
Way ahead of you, lady.

1519
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,169
I'm just trippin' out
because I've never seen

1520
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:08,361
my suit burn like this.

1521
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,156
Also, nobody messes with my town!

1522
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,991
Know what I'm saying?

1523
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,118
I defeated my traitor sister.

1524
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,538
You think I won't destroy you?

1525
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,128
The staff is absorbing it all.

1526
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,130
Like a battery.

1527
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:16,721
That's right.

1528
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:18,264
Run!

1529
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:20,141
This is a terrible idea.

1530
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,811
You don't understand
the savagery, the barbarity.

1531
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,232
Oh, no.

1532
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,054
- Hello.
- No.

1533
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,018
It's okay. Come here.

1534
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,898
Darla...

1535
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,359
It's okay. Good girl.

1536
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,744
- Whoa, watch out!
- Whoa!

1537
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,204
Dada!

1538
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:46,519
Taste the rainbow.

1539
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:49,981
Good, isn't it?

1540
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,067
It's the closest to ambrosia we have.

1541
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:18,218
Good girl.

1542
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,266
Whoa!

1543
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:36,933
We're gonna need more skittles.

1544
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:15,400
Taste the rainbow, motherfu...

1545
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,672
No, no, no.

1546
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,048
Lady, lady, you can't die!

1547
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,176
Come on, Billy, come on!
Powers, powers, powers.

1548
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,679
Medical powers. No.
How-to-fix-dead-people powers.

1549
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,855
Clear?

1550
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,900
Whoa! Come on!
One more time. Clear!

1551
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,026
Stop! Stop!

1552
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,862
Let me go to the undennorld
in peace, please.

1553
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,823
Oh, lady, lady,
listen to me, listen to me, okay?

1554
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:05,283
I don't want anyone else to die.

1555
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,760
Not my family, not an the a,
not anyone,

1556
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,203
and we can save them.

1557
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,638
This all came from the tree, right?

1558
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,289
I think I might know a way to destroy

1559
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,725
the tree and the dragon all in one.

1560
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:16,211
Ladon's powers are too great, boy.

1561
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,129
Well, not if I can overload the staff

1562
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,173
- with enough lightning.
- A bomb?

1563
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:22,735
Is that enough to kill the dragon?

1564
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:23,759
And more.

1565
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:27,096
You would annihilate

1566
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,307
everything that's inside
the dome.

1567
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,644
Well, then I have one more favor to ask.

1568
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,607
Let's go, let's go. Let's go.

1569
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:38,775
There's shelter ahead.

1570
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,152
There's shelter ahead. Let's go.

1571
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:43,238
Walk, don't run.
There's shelter ahead.

1572
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,114
Let's go, let's go.

1573
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,326
Keep going. Keep going!

1574
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,702
Anne!

1575
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:50,912
Anne!

1576
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:52,830
Anne!

1577
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:02,173
Go. Run.

1578
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:04,550
Watch that rear.

1579
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,564
Go, go, go!

1580
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:27,907
Back away!

1581
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:30,493
Run, run, run!

1582
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,712
Anne!

1583
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:41,796
Ladon,

1584
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:43,840
kill the traitor.

1585
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,166
Impossible.

1586
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,667
Bow him!

1587
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,475
I lost it. Freddy, I can't.

1588
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,727
What is a god without her power?

1589
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:40,063
The most powerful thing
about you

1590
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:41,314
is you.

1591
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:42,398
You taught me that.

1592
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,617
Kill them!

1593
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,387
Boom!

1594
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:14,889
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

1595
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,473
Assuming that you are one.

1596
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:20,478
I mean, you fly,
and you breathe fire,

1597
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,897
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1598
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,982
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

1599
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:27,652
Freddy, an the a, don't!

1600
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:33,032
Ah, made you look!

1601
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:34,450
Oh, lady, that's twice.

1602
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,744
And I didn't even need
a flaming violin that time.

1603
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,331
You want the staff? Come get it.

1604
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:16,784
Now, hespera.

1605
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:20,705
Now, hespera.

1606
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,293
Now. Now.

1607
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,522
No.

1608
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,232
No! No!

1609
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:54,549
Remove the dome.

1610
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:56,634
As long as I still breathe,

1611
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,345
the dome still stands.

1612
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:04,058
Till I see you
on the other side, sister.

1613
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:48,685
Billy!

1614
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:50,872
- Get out of there.
- I can't.

1615
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:52,064
Billy.

1616
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:53,566
I have to do this.

1617
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,428
Billy, what are you doing?

1618
01:41:57,486 --> 01:41:58,714
You're not supposed
to be in there.

1619
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:00,740
Yeah, I am.

1620
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:03,927
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1621
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,536
that I didn't deserve my powers,

1622
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:08,936
but there's something that I can do.

1623
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:10,165
No.

1624
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,251
I can save all of you.

1625
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,420
But it's all or none!

1626
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:15,630
Yeah.

1627
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,953
All of my family gets to live
and none of them gets hurt.

1628
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,058
Freddy, I've never had a family.
You know that.

1629
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,949
Everybody I've ever cared
about, they all left me.

1630
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,683
My mom, my dad, everyone.

1631
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,908
So when I found you guys,
I had to hang on

1632
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,338
and I've been hanging on
too tight.

1633
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:35,191
I should have let you
do your own thing.

1634
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,277
Now it's time for you to fly.

1635
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:40,278
What about you?

1636
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,952
I'm captain every power junior.

1637
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:50,581
Don't you forget it.

1638
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,136
We end this now.

1639
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:47,680
Yeah. We do.

1640
01:43:58,691 --> 01:43:59,692
Come on, Billy.

1641
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,513
He's got this. We got this.

1642
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,515
He's got this. He's got this.

1643
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:32,600
Billy.

1644
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,189
Fly.

1645
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:51,702
Billy.

1646
01:44:52,703 --> 01:44:54,288
Come on, baby.
Come on, let's go!

1647
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,464
No!

1648
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,173
Whoa!

1649
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,201
Shazam!

1650
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:14,886
Billy.

1651
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,806
A true god,

1652
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:19,058
after all.

1653
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:13,278
He did it.

1654
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:22,246
We must go.

1655
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:30,753
Billy?

1656
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:32,338
Billy?

1657
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:34,591
Billy!

1658
01:48:36,385 --> 01:48:37,428
Billy!

1659
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:40,931
Billy. Where are you?

1660
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,641
Billy!

1661
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:45,727
Billy?

1662
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,525
Billy! Billy.

1663
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,319
Billy!

1664
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:56,363
Billy!

1665
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:58,824
Billy!

1666
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:00,200
Dude, wake up. You did it.

1667
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,663
Okay. You're supposed to wake up.

1668
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:05,974
It's the part where
you're supposed to wake up,

1669
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:07,517
you're supposed to
open your eyes and laugh,

1670
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:10,753
and you're supposed to say
you got me, 'cause you got me.

1671
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,630
Dude. Joke's over, man.

1672
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:15,674
Billy!

1673
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:19,720
Billy. Billy, come on.

1674
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:23,682
Freddy.

1675
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,187
What did you do?

1676
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:31,565
Wake up, Billy.

1677
01:49:31,648 --> 01:49:33,442
- Billy?
- He's over here!

1678
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:37,488
Billy.

1679
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:41,366
You asshole!

1680
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:44,703
We're a team! We're a team!

1681
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:47,122
Oh, Billy.

1682
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,540
Billy.

1683
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,877
Oh, my baby. No.

1684
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:57,841
He was a hero.

1685
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:01,553
He was a hero and a god.

1686
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,348
And he should be laid
to rest like one.

1687
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:09,978
Hey, pal.

1688
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:19,840
Will this land ever come back?

1689
01:51:21,383 --> 01:51:23,093
The staff is drained of magic.

1690
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:27,014
Only the spark of a god
can restore its power

1691
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,308
and there are no gods left.

1692
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:32,102
There is one.

1693
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:51,914
What?

1694
01:52:28,242 --> 01:52:29,534
Whoa.

1695
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:50,639
Whoa.

1696
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:20,668
It's a zombie!

1697
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,964
Guys!

1698
01:53:24,881 --> 01:53:26,091
What the hell?

1699
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:27,384
You buried me?

1700
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,304
In what, like, two minutes?

1701
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:31,722
Oh, Billy!

1702
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:34,474
Hey.

1703
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,935
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

1704
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:40,896
Hi. Hey.

1705
01:53:42,774 --> 01:53:44,192
Oh, my god. Hi.

1706
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:45,861
Why didn't anybody tell...

1707
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:47,946
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

1708
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:50,198
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

1709
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:52,200
I was dead at the time.

1710
01:53:53,201 --> 01:53:54,369
So, you, uh...

1711
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,621
You got my bird letter?

1712
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:58,915
Oh, I, uh...

1713
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,294
I think you've got something...

1714
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:05,046
On my...

1715
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:06,840
Where... oh.

1716
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:08,507
What?

1717
01:54:09,509 --> 01:54:10,510
That's a spider.

1718
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,970
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

1719
01:54:12,054 --> 01:54:14,514
Also,
That's really embarrassing.

1720
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:15,682
Yes, it is.

1721
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:17,559
But it was an amazing thing you did.

1722
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:19,811
The sacrifice you made.

1723
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:22,022
You brought this world
back to life.

1724
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:25,359
Maybe this time, gods and humans

1725
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:26,777
can learn to live in peace.

1726
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:28,444
Yeah.

1727
01:54:29,613 --> 01:54:31,615
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

1728
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:35,410
Be well, Billy bat son.

1729
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:40,374
Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

1730
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,541
is surging through me,

1731
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,086
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

1732
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:45,379
and I'm gonna be 18

1733
01:54:45,462 --> 01:54:47,182
in, like, five months, so...

1734
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:49,674
Stick to saving the world, kid.

1735
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:51,635
Yeah, you know, like,
that's... okay, cool.

1736
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:53,011
See ya.

1737
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,138
What's with our boys
and older women?

1738
01:54:57,974 --> 01:54:58,974
Hey.

1739
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,013
Who wants their powers back?

1740
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:04,397
We can do that, right?

1741
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,483
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay, good.

1742
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:07,566
Good, good, good.

1743
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:09,611
I'd like our house back.

1744
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:11,113
Can we do that?

1745
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:14,783
- Dinner!
- Coming.

1746
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:17,035
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

1747
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:22,833
An the a.

1748
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,227
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

1749
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:26,753
about that god realm of yours?

1750
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:28,088
Well, actually I'm gonna take

1751
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:29,464
some time off while it heals.

1752
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:31,133
Spend some time
with the common folk.

1753
01:55:31,716 --> 01:55:33,135
Learn some about your world,

1754
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:35,679
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

1755
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:37,389
Number one sign of wisdom:

1756
01:55:37,472 --> 01:55:39,182
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

1757
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:40,642
I'm coming around to it.

1758
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:43,602
I got it.

1759
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:49,192
Whoa.

1760
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:51,319
Uh, guys?

1761
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,113
Guys!

1762
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:01,788
It's the wizard.

1763
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,500
- Oh, my god!
- No way!

1764
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:07,002
- Yes.
- Look at this guy!

1765
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,420
Look at him, he's so handsome.

1766
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:10,046
You pimpin' now, what is this?

1767
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,774
- You look amazing.
- You look great!

1768
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,025
Well, I was in the neighborhood

1769
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:15,552
and, um, I just wanted
to express my gratitude

1770
01:56:15,635 --> 01:56:18,096
before I go.

1771
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:21,641
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

1772
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:23,916
Not everything.

1773
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:28,398
You were just in the neighborhood?

1774
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:30,692
Okay, I came for the staff.

1775
01:56:30,775 --> 01:56:32,736
Perhaps I will hold onto it for now.

1776
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:36,781
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

1777
01:56:36,865 --> 01:56:38,492
before I turn into a pile ofash.

1778
01:56:38,575 --> 01:56:39,910
- Wait, what?
- No!

1779
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:42,162
I am making a joke.
I have an uber waiting.

1780
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,538
And besides...

1781
01:56:43,622 --> 01:56:46,625
I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

1782
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:48,668
It's time to see your world.

1783
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:50,045
It's been an honor,

1784
01:56:50,879 --> 01:56:52,797
a privilege, watching you all soar.

1785
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,609
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

1786
01:56:54,633 --> 01:56:55,717
Thank you, Jeff.

1787
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:57,928
It never ends.

1788
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:00,347
Also,

1789
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,391
what's my superhero name?

1790
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:08,313
Your name is

1791
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,273
shazam.

1792
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:12,399
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1793
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:17,656
I still think we can beat it.

1794
01:59:57,607 --> 01:59:59,234
My feet hurt. How much further?

1795
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:00,402
About ten seconds less

1796
02:00:00,485 --> 02:00:02,028
than the last time you asked me.

1797
02:00:02,112 --> 02:00:03,697
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

1798
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,007
have parked a little bit closer.

1799
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:06,175
He doesn't know we're coming,

1800
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,534
and I didn't want to spook him.

1801
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,994
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

1802
02:00:10,078 --> 02:00:11,079
All right, let's go.

1803
02:00:11,496 --> 02:00:13,540
And then you can tell waller
that even though

1804
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:15,863
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

1805
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:17,460
we never actually met him

1806
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:19,838
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

1807
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:21,840
Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

1808
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:23,550
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

1809
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:24,819
I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.

1810
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:25,844
Shut up.

1811
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:29,389
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

1812
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,890
but a little immature.

1813
02:00:31,683 --> 02:00:32,684
Oh, great.

1814
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:36,187
Whoo!

1815
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,573
- Billy bat son.
- Yeah?

1816
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:47,741
I mean, no.

1817
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:50,160
I've never heard that name in my life.

1818
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:51,554
I don't know who
you're talking about.

1819
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:53,204
But I'd like to meet that person

1820
02:00:53,288 --> 02:00:54,914
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

1821
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,834
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

1822
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,169
but like in a dangerous way.

1823
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,171
What the hell
are you talking about?

1824
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:02,839
Relax. We know who you are.

1825
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,675
- How?
- Don't worry about that.

1826
02:01:06,676 --> 02:01:07,761
Who are you guys?

1827
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:09,137
Don't worry about that either.

1828
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:10,847
Look, we've seen what you can do.

1829
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,682
And we're here
to make you an offer.

1830
02:01:12,766 --> 02:01:13,806
How would you like to join

1831
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:14,851
- the justice...
- Yes!

1832
02:01:15,185 --> 02:01:16,352
A thousand times yes!

1833
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:18,313
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

1834
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,458
Well, I mean, not this exactly.

1835
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:21,667
Like, normally,
it's wonder woman

1836
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:22,691
in the dream, but...

1837
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:24,277
Huh?

1838
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,779
Well, that was easy.

1839
02:01:26,571 --> 02:01:27,906
Welcome to the justice society.

1840
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,991
Yeah! A we so... wait, what?

1841
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:31,284
The justice society?

1842
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:32,803
Is that different
than the justice league?

1843
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:34,704
Yes. The justice society

1844
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:36,015
is different
than the justice league

1845
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:37,749
because of how words work.

1846
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:39,709
I just want to be
in the wonder woman group.

1847
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:42,003
- So, that's you guys, right?
- No.

1848
02:01:42,086 --> 02:01:44,130
Why are you so obsessed
with wonder woman, dude?

1849
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:45,214
He's joking, right?

1850
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:48,843
- No?
- Okay. I'm out.

1851
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:51,346
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

1852
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:53,389
Can you drive by and get me?

1853
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,975
Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

1854
02:01:56,059 --> 02:01:57,328
It's pretty confusing
that there are

1855
02:01:57,352 --> 02:01:59,229
two separate groups
of superheroes

1856
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:00,563
that are totally unaffiliated,

1857
02:02:00,647 --> 02:02:02,565
but both have "justice"
in their name, you know.

1858
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:03,834
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing

1859
02:02:03,858 --> 02:02:04,943
a rebranding of sorts?

1860
02:02:05,026 --> 02:02:08,196
'Cause just a quick search
on thesaurus. Com,

1861
02:02:08,279 --> 02:02:09,739
you got so many options, man.

1862
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:11,991
Like, "authority society." Eh?

1863
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:14,911
Uh, uh, "code society."
That's stupid.

1864
02:02:14,994 --> 02:02:16,162
These are, like, legal terms.

1865
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:19,249
"The avenger society."

1866
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:22,335
I like that, for some reason.

1867
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:01,776
Well, well, doctor.
We meet again.

1868
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:03,653
Where in the hell have you been?!

1869
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:06,781
To implement
the perfect plan, doctor,

1870
02:09:06,864 --> 02:09:09,116
one must have Patience.

1871
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,451
What are you talking about?

1872
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:14,330
It's been two goddamn years!

1873
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:19,168
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

1874
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,753
A meaningless measure.

1875
02:09:20,836 --> 02:09:23,381
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

1876
02:09:23,464 --> 02:09:26,592
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

1877
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:28,803
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

1878
02:09:28,886 --> 02:09:31,097
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

1879
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,808
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

1880
02:09:33,891 --> 02:09:36,894
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

1881
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:40,106
I just slither around endlessly.

1882
02:09:40,189 --> 02:09:42,316
But not for long.

1883
02:09:45,528 --> 02:09:47,613
Tell me everything.

1884
02:09:48,739 --> 02:09:50,491
Just one more thing
I need to do.

1885
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:52,994
What? No!

1886
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,038
Oh, goddamn it!
