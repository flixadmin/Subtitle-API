1
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,030
Head caught to the left.

2
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:45,540
Partial deafness in ear.

3
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:47,478
First point of attack.

4
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:52,094
Two, throat. Paralyze the
vocal cords, stop screaming.

5
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,886
Three, got to be a heavy drinker.
Punch the rib to the liver.

6
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,855
Four, finally, drag the
left leg. Fist the patella.

7
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:04,441
Summary prognosis
Exactly 90 seconds

8
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,911
Complete recovery of the colleges
Unlikely.

9
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,900
- I like the hat.
- I just picked it up.

10
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:26,171
You remember your revolver?

11
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,766
I knew I'd forgotten something.

12
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,701
- I thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

13
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:34,747
I think that's quite enough.

14
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,280
You're a doctor, after all.

15
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,376
Always nice to see you,
Watson.

16
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,033
Where is the inspector?

17
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:51,179
He's getting his troops lined up.

18
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,316
That could be all day.

19
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,732
Sherlock Holmes.

20
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,516
And his loyal dog.

21
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:58,828
Tell me, doctor

22
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,862
As a medical man, have
you enjoyed my work?

23
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,310
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

24
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:06,955
Watson! Don't!

25
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:12,708
Observe.

26
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,126
How did you see that?

27
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,626
Because I was looking for it.

28
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,587
Lord Blackwood!

29
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:28,649
You seem surprised.

30
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:31,665
I would say that the girl deserves
our attention more than he.

31
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,256
Indeed.

32
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,598
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boyo.

33
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,756
Good lad.

34
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,258
Impeccable timing,
Lestrade.

35
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:51,759
We've one for the doctor,
and one for the rope.

36
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,138
- Clarky?
- Sir.

37
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,127
This woman needs
a hospital immediately.

38
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,983
- Put her in the back of the maraya.
- Right lads, that's it.

39
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,923
If you don't mind.

40
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:10,327
Get him out of my sights.

41
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,141
And you were supposed
to wait for my orders.

42
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,456
If I had, you'd be
clearing up a corpse.

43
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:23,144
and chasing a rumor.

44
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,503
Besides, the girl's parents
hired me, not the Yard.

45
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:29,456
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me?

46
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,394
- Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.
- Indeed.

47
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,011
- Congratulations, Lestrade.
- Bravo, Inspector.

48
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,453
Have a cigar.

49
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:38,954
Gentlemen...

50
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,557
Cheese!

51
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:18,615
156 over 80.

52
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:19,802
Very good.

53
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,888
Me nerves have been
the best in years, thanks to you.

54
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,336
Oh, tell me something:

55
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,889
Your new premises,
when you moving in?

56
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,630
I should be moving
within the week.

57
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:32,606
Cavendish Place.

58
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:34,746
And there will be a
womens touch too.

59
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,588
- That's marvelous.
- Indeed.

60
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:39,481
Good god!

61
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,486
- This was gunfire!
- No, no, no, no.

62
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:45,872
Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

63
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,997
My colleagues, probably just...
putting up a painting.

64
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,063
I'll go and check.

65
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,501
- Your colleague?
- Yes

66
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:55,724
He wont be moving
with you, will he?

67
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,149
No, he wont.

68
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:02,863
Mrs. Hudson...

69
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,961
I wont go in there by myself.
No one has got a gun in this house.

70
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:08,550
You will not need to go in there
at all. Give me the paper.

71
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,086
What will I do when
you leave, Doctor?

72
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,432
He'll have the whole house down!

73
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,879
He just needs
another case, that's all.

74
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:14,693
Couldn't you have
a longer engagement?

75
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,122
I smell gunpowder. It's not right you know!
Not in a domestic environment.

76
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:22,319
Thank you, Captain Phillip.

77
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,305
Perhaps a nice cup of tea...

78
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,000
Same time next week.

79
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:28,991
Come on, Captain.
It's quieter downstairs.

80
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,468
Mrs. Hudson?  Bring
something to cheer him up.

81
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,826
Permission to enter the armoury.

82
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:45,680
Granted.

83
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:51,118
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device

84
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,231
that depresses the
sound of a gunshot.

85
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:57,954
It's not working.

86
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:00,520
Oh, may I see that?

87
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,126
You know it's been three
months, since your last case?

88
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,708
Gently. Gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me.

89
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:23,226
Don't you think it's time
you found another one.

90
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,413
I can't but, agree.

91
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:30,193
My mind rebels techniques
give me problems, give me work.

92
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:32,601
The sooner the better.

93
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:35,288
- Paper.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:37,997
Let's see then.
There's a letter here.

95
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,883
from

96
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:42,072
Mrs. Ramsey, of Queenspark.

97
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:43,541
Her husband's disappeared.

98
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,283
He's in Belgium, with the scurry maid.

99
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,262
Is it November?

100
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,167
Yes, Holmes.
Alright.

101
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,667
Lady Rathford reports...

102
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,927
her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

103
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:57,450
An insurance swindle.

104
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,576
Lord Rathford like's fast
women and slow ponies.

105
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,813
I see you're the attending
physician, at Blacwood's hanging.

106
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:05,125
Yes

107
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,666
It was our last case together

108
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,092
and I wanted to see it
through to the end.

109
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,168
A Mr. Louis...

110
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:20,460
There's only one case, that
intrigues me at present.

111
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:22,393
The Curious Case of Mrs. Hudson

112
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,457
The absent tea landlady.

113
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:26,515
I've been studying her
comings and goings

114
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:30,752
- and they appear most... sinister.
- Tea, Mr. Holmes?

115
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,519
Is it poisoned, "Nanny"?

116
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:34,583
There's enough of
that in you already.

117
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,159
Don't touch. Everything
is in it's proper place.

118
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:40,018
As per usual, "Nanny".

119
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,286
Oh, his killed the dog... again.

120
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,802
What have you done
to, Gladston now?

121
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:48,512
I was simply testing
a new anesthetic.

122
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,616
He doesn't mind.

123
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,076
Holmes

124
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,617
as your doctor...

125
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,116
He'll be good in no time.

126
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,493
As your friend...

127
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:03,531
You've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

128
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,267
There's nothing of interest,
for me, out there on Earth.

129
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:11,718
- So, you're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

130
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,183
- Dinner?
- Wonderfull.

131
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,591
- The Royal?
- My favourite.

132
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,996
Mary's coming.

133
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,455
- It's not fair.
- You're meeting her, Holmes!

134
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,405
Have you proposed yet?

135
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:25,626
No, I haven't found the right ring.

136
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,907
Oh, then it's not official.

137
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:29,707
It's happening, whether
you like it or not.

138
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,158
20:30, the Royal.

139
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,852
- Where a jacket.
- You wear a jacket.

140
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,231
Holmes!

141
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,293
You're early.

142
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:15,739
Fashionably.

143
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:18,513
Miss Mary Morsten.

144
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:20,204
Oh my goodness. What a pleasure.

145
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,766
For the life of me, I don't know why it's
taken him so long to introduce us properly.

146
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:26,204
The pleasure is mine.

147
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,878
It really is quite a thrill
meeting you, Mr. Holmes.

148
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:36,173
I've heard so much about you.

149
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,229
I have a pile of detective
novels at home... Collins, Poe.

150
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:41,491
It's true.

151
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,678
It can seem a little

152
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:47,258
far fetched though, at times. Making these
grand assumptions out of tiny details.

153
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:48,838
That's not quite right is it?

154
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,203
In fact, the little details are
by far, the most important.

155
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,299
- Take Watson...
- I intend to.

156
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,390
You see this walking stick, a
rare African snake wood.

157
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:06,217
hiding a blade

158
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,985
Few were rewarded to the
veterans of the afgan war,

159
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:12,465
so I can assume, he's
a decorated soldier.

160
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,768
Strong, brave, born
to be an adventurer.

161
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:17,813
and neat, like
all military men.

162
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,314
Now, I check his pockets.

163
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,445
Ah, a stamp from a boxing match.

164
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:26,907
Now, I can assume
he's a bit of a gambler.

165
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,088
I'd keep an eye on
that dowry, if I were you.

166
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:31,067
- Those days are behind me.
- Right, behind you.

167
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:33,305
It's cost us the rent,
more than once.

168
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,010
Well with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
You know John very well.

169
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,285
What about a complete stranger?

170
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,973
What can you tell about me?

171
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:43,538
- You?
- I don't think that's...

172
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,023
- I don't know if that's...
- Not at dinner.

173
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,353
- Perhaps another time.
- I insist.

174
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,038
- You insist?
- You remember tht we discussed this.

175
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,494
The lady insists

176
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:58,247
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

177
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:00,605
Yes, well done. Shall we... Waiter!

178
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:03,418
Your student...
It's a boy of eight.

179
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,668
Charlie is seven, actually.

180
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,062
So he's tall for his age.
He flicked you with ink today.

181
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,786
- Is there ink on my face?
- There is nothing wrong with your face.

182
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,788
There are two drops
on your ear infact.

183
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:18,030
India blue is near
impossible to wash off.

184
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,530
Anyway, rather
impetuous of that boy,

185
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,952
but you're to experienced to
react rashly, which is why

186
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:25,446
the lady for whom you work
lent you that necklace.

187
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,318
Pearls, diamonds, flawless rubies.

188
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:30,606
Hardly the gems of a governess .

189
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:36,051
However, the jewls you
are not wearing, tell us rather more.

190
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:37,536
- Holmes!
- You were engaged.

191
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:41,914
The ring has gone, but
the lighter skin suggests

192
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,071
that you spent some
time abroard proudly

193
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,429
that is until you were
informed that it's true

194
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,323
and then you broke of the engagement
and returned to, England

195
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,932
for better prospects.
A doctor perhaps?

196
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:02,888
You're right on all accounts
Mr. Holmes, apart from one.

197
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,224
I didn't leave him.

198
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,290
He died.

199
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,126
Well done, old boy.

200
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:50,392
Get up and fight!

201
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,488
Come on!

202
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:54,159
Come on!

203
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,318
That's it. We're done.

204
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:10,542
You won. Congratulations.

205
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,148
Oy, we aint done yet.

206
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,211
This must not register
on an emotional level.

207
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,048
First, distract target.

208
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,089
Then block his blind jab.

209
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,551
Counter with cross
to the left cheek.

210
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:32,691
Discombobulate.

211
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:36,673
Dazed, he'll attempt a wild hit.
employ the elbow block.

212
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:38,858
And body shot.

213
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:41,156
block next left.

214
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:42,641
weaken right jaw.

215
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,733
Now fracture.

216
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,189
Break right ribs.

217
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,035
Traumamatize, solar plexus.

218
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,866
dislocate jaw entirely.

219
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,255
Kick in the diaphragm.

220
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,024
In summary:

221
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,988
jaw fractured, three
ribs cracked four broken,

222
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:07,137
diaphragm haemorrhaging.

223
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,191
Physical recovery: 6 weeks.

224
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,475
For psychological recovery: 6 months.

225
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,434
Capacity to spit tobacco:

226
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,265
Neutralized.

227
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,293
Where did that come from?

228
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:25,864
What the hell's going on here, Charley?

229
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,700
Lord Blackwood's put him
on some kind of spell, sir.

230
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,728
It's like he's burning
from the inside out!

231
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,679
Shut up!

232
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:38,995
Charley. Charley!

233
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,572
Take this man to the infirmary!
Now!

234
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,981
What's this all about then, Blackwood?

235
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,243
There's someone I want to see.

236
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,284
- Watson?
- Right.

237
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,015
Let's go.

238
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,766
What started as
a mere experiment

239
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,329
has brought me to the
threshold of monumental discovery

240
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,990
Now if I play, chromatic scale

241
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:38,290
there's no measurable response.

242
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,302
You do know, what you're
drinking is meant for eye surgery.

243
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:42,945
But... now,

244
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:44,571
and this is remarkable

245
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:47,552
if I change to
eight tone clusters

246
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,459
Voila!

247
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,370
They fly in counter-clockwise,

248
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,084
synchronized in circles.

249
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,310
Watson this is exceptional.

250
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,211
I, using musical theory,
have created order out from chaos.

251
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,189
How did you lure them in?

252
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:06,648
Excellent question.

253
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,813
Individually, I've been
at it for six hours.

254
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,211
And what happens if I do this?

255
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:17,784
Clean yourself up.

256
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:19,878
You are Blackwood's last request.

257
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,258
Look at those towering structures.

258
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:38,626
It's the first combination of a
suspension bridge ever attempted.

259
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,448
Most innovative.

260
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,573
What an industrious empire!

261
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,482
Oh, I have your
winnings from last night.

262
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:53,846
You weren't there, so I
made your customery bet.

263
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:58,345
You're right. I'll keep
it with your checkbook,

264
00:21:58,345 --> 00:21:59,890
locked safely away in my draw.

265
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:04,736
Did you know the opera house
is featuring "Don Giovanni"?

266
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,329
I could easily procure
a couple of tickets

267
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,913
If you had any cultural
inclinations this evening.

268
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,259
You have a grand gift of silence,

269
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,613
Watson, it makes you quite
invaluable as a companion.

270
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:22,491
I knew she'd been engaged.

271
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:24,743
She told me.

272
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:26,320
So that's, no to the opera then.

273
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,134
That was my waistcoat.

274
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:36,211
I thought we agreed
it's too small for you.

275
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:37,703
- I'd like it back.
- I thought we agreed.

276
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,182
I want it back.

277
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,569
This way, Mr. Holmes.

278
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:19,349
Blackwood seems to have got the
crowd into some what of a fear frenzy.

279
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,009
I'm sure it will disperse
once his feet stop twitching.

280
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:24,350
Care to come along?

281
00:23:24,882 --> 00:23:26,225
No, you're on your own, old cock.

282
00:23:26,225 --> 00:23:27,997
I have no business with him
whilst he's alive.

283
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,526
Suit yourself, "mother hen".

284
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:45,418
It seems you still have
lots of rooms to let.

285
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,343
We had to move the prisoners, sir.

286
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:49,731
Otherwise we're gonna
have a riot on our hands.

287
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:53,733
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

288
00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:57,570
As though, he can get inside their heads.

289
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:04,328
I'm sure I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

290
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,487
Much obliged, sir.
Thank you.

291
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:15,979
<i> ... and the dragon of the sea.
And I saw the beast out of bodies of water </ i>

292
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,114
<i> ... had ten horns and seven heads,
with ten crowns on his horns, </ i>

293
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:20,585

294
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,054
<i> And people have glorified ...
dragon which he gave the beast </ i>

295
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:23,335
to e are glorified and the beast, saying, </ i>

296
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:24,774
<i> "What is like the beast?" </ i>

297
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:26,478
<i> beast which I saw
has the body of a leopard, </ i>

298
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:29,307
<i> but had feet of a bear
and was the lion's mouth. </ i>

299
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,074
<i> The dragon gave power unto the beast,
his throne and great authority ...</ i>

300
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,168
I love what you done to the place.

301
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,262
So glad you can accept my invitation.

302
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:41,904
I just have a small point of concern.

303
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,749
How can I help?

304
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,496
I've already followed the
murders with some intrest.

305
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:49,095
and although my heart went out primarily
to the families of the victims

306
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:51,033
I couldn't but notice
a criminal mastery.

307
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,875
And the stroke of your brush.

308
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,061
You're too kind.

309
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,096
However, by comparison,
your work in the crypt

310
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,894
looks more like a finger painting.

311
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:06,036
So now you're curious
if there's a larger game afoot?

312
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:07,940
Either that or, um...

313
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:11,757
shortly my friend, you'll
be pronounced dead

314
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,288
and I thought I might
keep him company.

315
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,913
Your mistake is to
imagine that anything

316
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,756
that is earthly has
led us to this moment.

317
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,197
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush.

318
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:22,790
I'm merely a channel.

319
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,042
My only wish is that
I could have caught you sooner.

320
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:28,031
You see? Five lives
might have been spared.

321
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,282
Those lives were a necessity.

322
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:34,160
Sacrifice.

323
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:37,984
Five other wise meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

324
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:40,702
I wonder if they'll let me and
Watson dissect your brain.

325
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:42,482
After you hang, of course.

326
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:48,204
I'd wager, there is some deformity
that would be scientifically significant.

327
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,660
Then you too, could serve
a greater purpose.

328
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,142
Holmes, you must
widen your gaze.

329
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,803
I'm concerned, you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

330
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:05,489
You and I are bound together on a journey
that would twist the very fabric of nature.

331
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:09,949
But beneath your mask of logic
I sense a frailty...

332
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:12,772
That worries me.

333
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,867
Steal your mind, Holmes.

334
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:18,835
I need you.

335
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:21,587
I'd say, you've come a long way
down from a house of Lords.

336
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:23,059
- I will rise again.
- "Bon voyage".

337
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,370
Pay attention!

338
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,422
Three more will die and there is nothing
you can do to save them.

339
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,236
You must accept that this
is beyond your control.

340
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,921
by the time you realise
you made all of this possible

341
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:37,215
it will be the last sane
thought in your head.

342
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:47,391
What did he want?

343
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,003
I'm not sure.

344
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,868
But I don't think you
need to follow. Not this one.

345
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:57,971
Lord Henry Blackwood,
you are sentenced to death

346
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,662
for the practice of black magic

347
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,522
the unholy murder of
five innocent young women

348
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:07,084
and an attempted
murder of a sixth.

349
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,653
Do you have any final words?

350
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,821
Death... is only the beginning.

351
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:52,611
That is the end of
Lord Blackwood.

352
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:16,837
London's so bleak
this time of year.

353
00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:20,619
Not that I'm pining
for New Jersey,

354
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,497
but much prefer to travel in winter.

355
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:29,466
Here, I bought you these.
All the way from Syria.

356
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,935
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan.

357
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:34,407
and your favorite...

358
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:37,114
Olives from the Cyclades.

359
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,545
I thought we might
have a little tea party.

360
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:42,814
and while I was setting
the table, I found this.

361
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,552
A file with my name on it.

362
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:49,051
"The theft of the Velasquez portrait
King of Spain.

363
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:53,805
Missing naval documents lead to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister

364
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,459
scandalous affair
ends engagement of... "

365
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:04,696
"Prince Romanov. "of Austria and
Princess.

366
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:08,693
I'm simply studying your methods.

367
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:11,071
Should the authorities ask me
to hunt you down.

368
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:15,353
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

369
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,137
But your signature was clear.

370
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:20,775
Is that the Maharaja's missing diamond?

371
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,170
Or just another souvenir?

372
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,498
Let's not dwell
on the past.

373
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,284
Shall we?

374
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:34,562
Now, by the looks of things,
I'd say you were between jobs.

375
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:35,911
And you between husbands.

376
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:37,674
How much did
you get for the ring?

377
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:40,550
He was boring and jealous
and he snored.

378
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:46,206
I'm Irene Adler, again.

379
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,116
Thank you.

380
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,197
I need your help.

381
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:05,670
I need you to find someone.

382
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:09,960
Why are you always so suspicious.

383
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,671
Should I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

384
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:15,775
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

385
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:22,058
I think you'll find
all the information inside.

386
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,215
Who are you working for?

387
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:29,125
So I'll have to find
out the hard way.

388
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,282
Keep your money,
I didn't say I'll take the case.

389
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:34,499
Consider it a wager
that you will.

390
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,257
You remember the Grandl?

391
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:40,005
They gave me our old room.

392
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:56,771
Hold the door.
Thank's, doctor.

393
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,533
Ma'am.

394
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:27,609
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

395
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:31,505
That's precisely why
I hired you.

396
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,031
I'll wager, he'll have our man
in the next 24 hours.

397
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:36,758
He'd better.

398
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:39,530
Reordan is the key to what
Blackwood was doing.

399
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,212
He's essential to my plan.

400
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,611
Damn! What are you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

401
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,636
Get of my way!

402
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:55,681
A little ride, I've come along way, sir.

403
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,137
God save the queen!

404
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:01,681
God save the Queen, sir.

405
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:02,930
Get off out of it!

406
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:08,423
Look at you?

407
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,453
Why is the only woman
you've ever cared about

408
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:11,888
a world class criminal?

409
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,964
Are you a masochist?

410
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,056
Allow me to explain...

411
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:15,266
Allow me!

412
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,298
She's the only adversary,
who ever out smarted you. Twice.

413
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:20,780
Made a proper idiot out of you.

414
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,247
Right, you've had your fun.

415
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:24,404
- What she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.

416
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,146
What could she possibly need?

417
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,972
It doesn't matter.

418
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,783
An alibi, a beard. A human canoe.

419
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,628
She can sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

420
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:37,048
That's no consequence
to you really, is it Watson?

421
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,377
We've done our, last case together.

422
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,596
I've already read it.

423
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,252
Missing person.

424
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:43,941
Luke Reordan.

425
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,943
4 foot 10, red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.

426
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,068
You're obviously not her type.

427
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:50,819
She likes gingered dwarfs.

428
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,099
Midgets.

429
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,509
- So, you agree.
- No, I don't agree.

430
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,166
It's more than a technicality, you see.

431
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:59,529
You are misrepresenting the
dimensions of short peoples.

432
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,947
I've said too much.
I can tell, I've upset you.

433
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,822
No, I'm just simply
stating, that one has...

434
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:05,508
What were you doing?

435
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,875
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

436
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,882
- Holmes? What are you doing?
- Nothing.

437
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:36,251
- Are you wearing a...
- A false nose? No.

438
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,553
Tell me, that was...

439
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,143
Holmes! Where are you going?

440
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:48,895
Watson?

441
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,007
Help! Watson!

442
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,527
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.

443
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,780
Cut you a deal, cos you're so pretty.

444
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:18,924
Oh, my lucky day!

445
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:22,446
Hello gorgeous, you
got something for me.

446
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,344
Don't move!

447
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:33,586
Now, what have we got here?

448
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:40,471
Thank you.

449
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,285
That's the Irene I know.

450
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:38,177
This man Intrigues me, Watson,
His got her on the edge.

451
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:39,880
And she's no mean feet.

452
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,021
She's intimidated,
she's scared of him.

453
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,741
Yet she work's for him.

454
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:47,030
Right.

455
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,416
It is nothing to do with me, but I
advise you to leave the case alone.

456
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,824
I may not always have a choice.

457
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:55,778
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon. Thanks to you.

458
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:57,792
Get that out of my face.

459
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,213
It's not "in your face"
it's in my hand.

460
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,996
Get whatever's in your
hand out of my face.

461
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:02,861
- Mr. Holmes!
- Clarky!

462
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,245
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks
you come with me at once.

463
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,371
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

464
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:10,296
Watson drop a compass, he needs us.

465
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,063
No, you means you.

466
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,829
It's Lord Blackwood,
sir. He...

467
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:18,835
Well... it appears he's come
back from the grave, sir.

468
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:30,223
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

469
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:32,395
I pronounced the man dead myself.

470
00:36:34,524 --> 00:36:35,899
What are the facts?

471
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:39,005
Groundkeeper, claims he saw him walking
through the graveyard just this morning, sir.

472
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,680
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

473
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,429
I have an appointment with, Mary.

474
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:46,601
It's not my reputation at stake here.

475
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:49,369
- Don't try that.
- Has the newspaper

476
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:52,004
- got wind of it yet.
- Well that's what we're trying to avoid, sir.

477
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,293
Certainly.

478
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:57,950
- What's the major concern?
- Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

479
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,356
Indeed.

480
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:01,200
You're not taking this seriously, Holmes?

481
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,326
Yes, as you should.

482
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,639
It's a matter of
professional integrity.

483
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,285
No girl wants to
marry a doctor

484
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,110
who can't tell
If a man's dead or not.

485
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,175
Who do you think won the match,
Clarky?

486
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,448
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

487
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:36,161
Your boys have done a magnificent
job of obliterating any potential evidence.

488
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:38,898
Yes, but atleats they
never miss an opportunity...

489
00:37:39,147 --> 00:37:40,649
to miss an opportunity.

490
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:45,077
You took your time, Holmes.

491
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:47,699
And on the third day...

492
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,922
These slabs are sand stone,
they half a ton each

493
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,420
and they were smashed
open from the inside .

494
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:57,746
Lestrade. What of the coffin?

495
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,652
We are in the process of
bringing it up now.

496
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:01,792
Listen...

497
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:04,772
Hmm... Right.

498
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,186
At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

499
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,239
And how is our witness?

500
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:12,876
He's over there.

501
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,002
And apparently he's got ca...
ca... ca...

502
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:18,065
Catatonic, sir.

503
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:20,533
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes

504
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:27,242
If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch
of quivering milk maids, you're on double time.

505
00:38:27,622 --> 00:38:30,381
Now you get down there, and
you bring that coffin up, now!

506
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,535
Good day, sir!

507
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:38,133
It's alright.

508
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,650
I'm a doctor.

509
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,564
The man's in shock.

510
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:55,264
- He may need a few moments
- The witness states that

511
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:57,529
he saw, lord Blackwood,
rise from the grave.

512
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,545
- Well?
- Well?

513
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,396
You pronounced him dead.

514
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,234
He had no pulse.

515
00:39:26,726 --> 00:39:28,098
Good lord.

516
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,211
That's not Blackwood.

517
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:36,239
Well, now we have a
firm grasp, of the obvious.

518
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,557
Time of death?

519
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:51,652
2 thirds of an inch

520
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:54,872
which would put the time of death
at between 10-12 hours ago.

521
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:57,778
May I borrow your pen?

522
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,516
- Headless dwarf.
- Midget.

523
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:16,756
I know what I saw!

524
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,540
It was Blackwood!

525
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,586
As clear as I see you.

526
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:27,007
And when the dead walk...

527
00:40:28,575 --> 00:40:30,900
the living will fill
these coffins.

528
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,963
Well...

529
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:42,526
Right, put the lid on
and clean this up.

530
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,314
You really believe he was resurrected?

531
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:47,499
The question is not "if" but "how."
The games afoot.

532
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:50,418
Follow your spirit and
upon this charge cried

533
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:52,688
god for Harry,
England and St. George.

534
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:59,696
Here you are. Why that
certain fish and chips store

535
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:01,960
- I don't understand
- Well there's a particular pier

536
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,493
they use out in the back,
northern stout, to be exact.

537
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:06,317
You know, Holmes

538
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,933
I've seen things in war
I don't understand.

539
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,463
In India, I once met a man
who predicted his own death

540
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:15,101
right down to the number and placement
of the bullets that killed him.

541
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:17,787
You have to admit, Holmes

542
00:41:18,098 --> 00:41:23,122
that a supernatural explanation
to this case, is theoretically possible.

543
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,102
Agreed.

544
00:41:25,102 --> 00:41:28,356
But, it is a huge mistake to
theorize before one has data.

545
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:31,969
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts to shoot
theories, instead of theories to shoot facts

546
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,541
That said I believe

547
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,825
our midget is the key to this.

548
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:42,377
Right. Scratches around the
key hole where the watch is wound.

549
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:43,702
What does that tell you?

550
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,514
The man was most likely
a drunk.

551
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:48,451
Every time he wound the watch,
his hand slipped, hence the scratches.

552
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:50,141
Yes
Very good, Watson.

553
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,300
You have developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

554
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:57,079
Let's see now. There are several
sets of initials.

555
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,456
- Porn brokers marks.
- Excellent.

556
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:02,314
Most recent of which are:
"M.H. M.H. M.H...

557
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:04,584
- M.H is for...
- "Maddison and Haig.

558
00:42:09,552 --> 00:42:10,959
They should be able
to give us an address.

559
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,167
What a coincidence.

560
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:21,241
There's one thing you failed to
deduce from the watch, Holmes.

561
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:22,495
I think not.

562
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:23,920
The time.

563
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,360
I have to get back, Holmes.

564
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:28,173
Taking tea with the in-laws..

565
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,525
- Can I predict your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

566
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:32,216
No thank you, ma'am.

567
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,558
You need to hear what
I have to tell you.

568
00:42:33,558 --> 00:42:35,893
We have no need of your
lucky heather Gypsy women.

569
00:42:35,893 --> 00:42:37,581
Even if it's to do with Mary.

570
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,362
I see two men.

571
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:49,970
Brothers. Not in
blood, but in boned.

572
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:55,180
What of Mary?

573
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,065
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

574
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:01,117
Go on.

575
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,099
I see patterned table
cloths and china figurines.

576
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:07,870
and lace doilies...

577
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:10,320
doilies...

578
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,303
Lace doilies...

579
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:14,474
doilies... Holmes.

580
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:18,945
- Does your depravity know, no bounds?
- No.

581
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:22,101
Oh she turns fat and has a beard...

582
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:23,785
And what of the warts?

583
00:43:23,785 --> 00:43:25,228
- She is covered in warts...
- Enough, enough.

584
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:27,781
- Are they extensive?
- Please, enough!

585
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:33,657
It's the most apt prediction,
Flora's made in ages.

586
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,283
And precisely the reason you
can't find a suitable ring.

587
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:38,081
Do you have my money?

588
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:40,474
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of a macabre.

589
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:41,628
Do you have my cut?

590
00:43:41,628 --> 00:43:43,257
- Admit it, admit it!
- Give me my money!

591
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:44,685
Holmes.

592
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:49,253
Oh I see.

593
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,049
Thank you.

594
00:43:58,993 --> 00:44:01,750
Well you've got your ring, and I've got
the address for my ginger midget.

595
00:44:02,213 --> 00:44:03,192
Should be just there.

596
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:06,726
I think she'll really like this.

597
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:08,781
And I have some change in my pocket.

598
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:15,502
- Should I look after it for you?
- No, no.

599
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:19,072
- Don't give it away here.
- No!

600
00:44:19,696 --> 00:44:21,094
I have to go see Mary.

601
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:23,048
Give them my best.

602
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:25,752
And the family as well.

603
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,497
It does make a considerable difference
to me, having someone with me

604
00:45:08,846 --> 00:45:11,452
on whom I can throughly rely.

605
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,932
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

606
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:19,359
He clearly fely something
was coming to get him.

607
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,161
Or something did.

608
00:45:22,662 --> 00:45:24,108
Irene was here,

609
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,864
either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

610
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:33,820
Ah, putrefaction.

611
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,957
Ammonium sulphate,
among other aromas.

612
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:47,661
Phosphorus.

613
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:50,668
Formaldehyde.

614
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,376
It looks like he was
attempting to combine

615
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:11,315
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

616
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:21,154
More importantly...

617
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:23,752
What he was trying to dispose of.

618
00:46:25,627 --> 00:46:27,003
Potassium and magnesium.

619
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:28,390
sulfuric acid.

620
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,557
Why the iron went out of the ink
as long as it's not to burnt

621
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:48,709
Peculiar.

622
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,779
Hydrated rhododendron.

623
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:21,797
Holmes.
Look at the crest.

624
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:25,199
Reordan was working with, Blackwood.

625
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,528
Of course he was.

626
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:29,388
Question is, to what end.

627
00:47:33,577 --> 00:47:36,312
Whatever he was working
on, clearly suceeded.

628
00:47:37,068 --> 00:47:37,937
How so?

629
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:40,203
Otherwise, he'd still alive.

630
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,647
Which is why Miss Adler is
so desperate to find him.

631
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:44,587
Yes.

632
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:48,472
There's something I can't
quite put my finger on.

633
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:49,962
Is it candy floss?
Molasses.

634
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:53,236
Maple syrup. Ah, barley sugar.

635
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:55,456
Toffee apple.

636
00:48:01,262 --> 00:48:02,528
Let me guess.

637
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:05,478
Judging by your arsonist tool kit

638
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:08,468
You're here to burn down the building
and estinguish all the evidence therein

639
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,695
Just one minute boys..

640
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:13,325
Oh, Draga!

641
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,285
Is there a problem?

642
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:34,773
Meat...

643
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:36,491
or potatoes?

644
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,304
My 10 minutes are up.

645
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:33,352
You alright?

646
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,803
Come!

647
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:50,339
Holmes.

648
00:50:51,302 --> 00:50:52,435
What is that?

649
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:22,081
Holmes!

650
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:17,230
Watson...

651
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,465
What have you done?

652
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:32,680
I haven't slept all night.

653
00:55:33,302 --> 00:55:34,600
Not a whink.

654
00:55:36,524 --> 00:55:38,053
Why I ever believed...

655
00:55:39,054 --> 00:55:43,308
that I would get to have
tea with Mary's parents? is beyond me

656
00:55:43,784 --> 00:55:45,392
having been talked
into going with you.

657
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,293
We were set upon man,
it was self-defense.

658
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:51,958
I've been reviewing my notes, of our
exploits over the last seven months.

659
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,223
would you like to know my conclusion?

660
00:55:53,802 --> 00:55:56,046
I am psychologically disturbed.

661
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:57,327
How so?

662
00:55:57,327 --> 00:56:01,710
Why else would I be
continually led into situations

663
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:05,064
where you delibrately, withhold
your plans from me?

664
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,815
Why else?

665
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:10,000
You never complained
about my methods before.

666
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,051
- I'm not complaining.
- You're not?

667
00:56:12,379 --> 00:56:13,461
- What do you call this?
- How...

668
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,349
How am I complaining? I
never complain, when do I

669
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:17,901
ever complain about you practicing
the violin at three in the morning.

670
00:56:18,146 --> 00:56:20,601
or your mess,
your general lack of hygiene

671
00:56:20,601 --> 00:56:22,254
or the fact that you
steal all my clothes.

672
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,472
We have a barter system.

673
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:26,210
When do I complain about
you setting fire to my room?

674
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,446
- Our rooms.
- The rooms,

675
00:56:27,446 --> 00:56:30,226
When do I ever complain that
you experiment on my dog?

676
00:56:30,226 --> 00:56:32,149
- Our dog! It's our dog.
- On the... the dog!

677
00:56:32,149 --> 00:56:38,186
But I do take issue, is your campaign
to sabatage my relationship to Mary.

678
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,317
I understand.

679
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:48,673
- You do?
- I do.

680
00:56:50,451 --> 00:56:52,282
- I don't think you do.
- You're overly tired.

681
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:54,953
- Yes.
- You're feeling a bit sensitive.

682
00:56:55,422 --> 00:56:56,723
I'm not sensitive.

683
00:56:56,723 --> 00:56:58,565
What you need is to rest.

684
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:01,446
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

685
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:03,602
Beautifull grounds...

686
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,517
- We could throw a land on the spit...
- We?

687
00:57:06,517 --> 00:57:10,043
Holmes, if I were to go to the country
it would be with my future wife.

688
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:11,414
Well certainly, if you must...

689
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:13,582
No not you, Mary and I.

690
00:57:13,582 --> 00:57:15,370
- You are not...
- What? Invited?

691
00:57:15,759 --> 00:57:18,802
Why would I be not invited to my
own brothers country home, Watson?

692
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,991
- Now you are not making any sense!
- You're not human!

693
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:24,459
- John Watson?
- Yes.

694
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:27,116
You bail has been posted.

695
00:57:33,214 --> 00:57:34,433
Mary!

696
00:57:38,111 --> 00:57:39,497
Just Watson.

697
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:51,373
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because my boys, are getting hungry.

698
00:58:00,823 --> 00:58:03,210
Back off! Back off!

699
00:58:03,782 --> 00:58:06,958
To which the barman says:
"may I push in your stool?".

700
00:58:10,097 --> 00:58:11,722
Right you, you're out..

701
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,587
- Until next time.
- It's always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

702
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:20,311
Thank God you're here, Lestrade
I'd almost ran out of jokes.

703
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:22,384
In another life, you'd have
made an excellent criminal.

704
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:23,936
Yes, sir and you an
excellent policemen.

705
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:25,351
Tomsky! Thank you.

706
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:29,215
Now please tell me you have answers.

707
00:58:29,993 --> 00:58:32,333
All in good time, Lestrade.

708
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,355
All in good time? what is this some parlour
game where we have to guess what you're thinking.

709
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:37,542
I've got a public in
frenzy out there

710
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:40,360
and if you don't fill me in, I'll have you
in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker
than a bookies runner

711
00:58:42,996 --> 00:58:44,984
Now, clean up and
make yourself presentable.

712
00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:47,528
For whom?

713
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:49,036
Friends in high places.

714
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:50,359
They're the ones
who bailed you out.

715
00:59:02,131 --> 00:59:04,674
I'm terribly sorry to
inconvene you, sir.

716
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:07,230
But I'm going to have
to put this on you.

717
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:15,381
Mr. Holmes, apologies for
summoning you like this.

718
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:19,451
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to
where you are and who I am?

719
00:59:20,399 --> 00:59:22,025
As to where I am...

720
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,790
I was admitedly lost for a moment,
between Charing Cross and Holborn,

721
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,947
but I was saved by the Bread
shop on Southford Hill.

722
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:34,590
The only baker to use
the certain french glaze on a sage

723
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:36,342
after that the carriage
fought left and right

724
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:38,682
until bump the Fleet conduit

725
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:41,122
And as to who you are? that
took every ounce of my not

726
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:43,311
inconsiderable experience.

727
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:46,017
The letters on your desk were
addressed to a Sir Thomas Rodrum.

728
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,594
Lord Chief Justice. That
would be the official title

729
00:59:48,594 --> 00:59:53,251
Who you really are... is of
course another matter entirely.

730
00:59:54,003 --> 00:59:55,968
Judging by the sacred
ox on your ring.

731
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,222
you're the secret head of the
Temple of the Four Orders

732
00:59:58,222 --> 01:00:00,079
in who's headquarters we now sit.

733
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:03,378
Located, north-west corner
St. James square I think

734
01:00:03,972 --> 01:00:07,941
That's the mystery, the only mystery is to
why you bothered to blind fold me at all.

735
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,130
Yes... well, standard
procedure I suppose.

736
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:19,371
I dare say we have the
right man, gentlemen.

737
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:20,445
Sherlock Holmes.

738
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:23,593
U.S. Ambassador Standish
and Lord Coward, the home secetary.

739
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:28,593
I suppose you already have some
notion as to the practices of our order.

740
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:33,188
Yes. They are practically intresting.

741
01:00:33,637 --> 01:00:34,702
Be as sceptical as you like.

742
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:39,299
but our secret system has steered
the world to good for centuries.

743
01:00:39,377 --> 01:00:41,629
There danger is they can also be
used for more nefarious purposes.

744
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:45,768
What some call the dark arts
or practical magic.

745
01:00:46,097 --> 01:00:48,909
We know you don't believe
in magic Mr. Holmes

746
01:00:49,657 --> 01:00:52,215
We don't expect you
to share our faith

747
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,805
merely our fears.

748
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:55,725
fear is the most
infectious condition.

749
01:00:56,805 --> 01:00:58,283
In this instance.

750
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:02,727
fear of your own child.

751
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,711
Blackwood is your son

752
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:12,899
You have the same irises, a rare dark
green, the diamond shaped hazel flex

753
01:01:13,605 --> 01:01:17,511
together with the identical outer ears or
pinner, which are only past down through
direct blood line

754
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:19,783
which makes by
necessity either brothers

755
01:01:20,248 --> 01:01:23,097
or in this case, more
likely father and son.

756
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,767
Very few people have
paraded that information.

757
01:01:31,503 --> 01:01:34,638
And we'd want to
keep it that way.

758
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:40,283
He was concieved
during one of our rituals.

759
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:42,890
His mother wasn't my wife.

760
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:46,233
But she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerfull practitioner.

761
01:01:46,778 --> 01:01:49,514
though not enough to
survive giving birth to him.

762
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:53,352
Death followed him
where ever he went.

763
01:01:53,673 --> 01:01:56,084
Those five girls were not
the first to be butchered.

764
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:59,067
He killed many more to use
them to enhance his powers.

765
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:02,726
No one could prove anything
of course, but we already knew.

766
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:06,398
The boy was a curse.

767
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:08,613
We'd done our best to
stop him ourselves, but its not enough.

768
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:11,415
His power grows daily.

769
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:13,448
His resurection is evidence of that.

770
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:15,511
But what he does next
will be far more dangerous.

771
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:19,586
The secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

772
01:02:20,806 --> 01:02:23,524
His going to raise a force that will
alter the very course of the world.

773
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:26,452
I want you to find him and
stop him before he does.

774
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:29,578
We'll give you any
assisatnce that we can.

775
01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:35,268
As home secretary, I have a
considerable influence over the police.

776
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:38,954
- Oh, yes
- So...

777
01:02:40,515 --> 01:02:43,248
Name your price?

778
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,607
Well a great benefit to the social deficit.
I, can pick and choose my clients.

779
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,625
Consider it done, I'll stop him.

780
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,300
But not for you. And
certainly not for a price.

781
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:01,753
I do have a parting
query sir, Thomas.

782
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:03,128
What is that?

783
01:03:03,128 --> 01:03:04,676
We the rest of his family dead...

784
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:07,494
how long do you expect to survive?

785
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:09,538
Food for thought.

786
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:37,173
Well perhaps you'll have
better luck opening that.

787
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:41,107
Margot '58.
comet vintage.

788
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:45,451
How fascinating that a astronomical
event can effect the quality...

789
01:03:46,078 --> 01:03:48,552
How is it going with our
case that you refused to take.

790
01:03:49,164 --> 01:03:50,391
...wine.

791
01:03:51,422 --> 01:03:53,126
Or I've hit a dead end. Literally.

792
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:59,121
I found your man. He's
buried in Blackwood's tomb.

793
01:04:00,738 --> 01:04:02,240
If you still need him.

794
01:04:04,138 --> 01:04:05,678
Oh dear...

795
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:10,897
I hope my client doesnt
come looking for a refund.

796
01:04:11,495 --> 01:04:12,990
He's a professor, isn't he?

797
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:15,524
I couldn't see his face, but I spotted
a bit of chalk on his tappan.

798
01:04:16,243 --> 01:04:20,335
I've never known a professor to carry a
gun, and on such a clever contraption.

799
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:26,603
Eyepatch. Nice touch...

800
01:04:27,557 --> 01:04:29,885
So... case closed.

801
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:32,731
Which makes this a social visit.

802
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:36,047
No. It's you're in over
your head Irene, visit.

803
01:04:36,718 --> 01:04:39,271
Who ever killed, Reardon they
were covering their tracks,

804
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:42,989
which means that you're the next
loose end that needs to be snipped.

805
01:04:43,595 --> 01:04:44,874
Let it breathe.

806
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,406
I've never been in over my head.

807
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:51,430
Leave now, dissapear.
You're good at that.

808
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,500
Or stay. And volunteer
for protective custody.

809
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:02,350
If I'm in danger,
so are you.

810
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,822
Come with me.

811
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:12,635
What if we trusted each other.

812
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:18,335
You're not listening. I'm taking
you, to either a railway station

813
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,434
or the policestation.

814
01:05:32,135 --> 01:05:33,702
So...

815
01:05:36,444 --> 01:05:38,722
What is it to be?

816
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:41,923
You decide, which will it be?

817
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:46,907
I told you to let it breathe.

818
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,734
Can you taste the comet?

819
01:05:56,349 --> 01:05:58,946
Why couldn't you
just come away with me?

820
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:50,386
Madam, I need you to remain calm.

821
01:07:50,637 --> 01:07:53,465
Trust me, I'm a professional.
but underneath this pillow

822
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:55,380
lies the key to my release.

823
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:58,797
Of course, she misinterpreted
my intention entirely.

824
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:03,171
- Naturally sir.
- Thats why I find this modern
religious fellow so troubling.

825
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:05,067
There's no latitude
for misunderstandings.

826
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,296
It runs right over reason, sir.

827
01:08:06,296 --> 01:08:08,608
And chambermaids were
once such a liberal breed.

828
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:11,644
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

829
01:08:12,663 --> 01:08:17,071
Anyhow, its a good thing she was a friend,
otherwise we may never have found you.

830
01:08:17,854 --> 01:08:20,350
The inspector's been over at Baker
Street himself this morning, sir.

831
01:08:25,332 --> 01:08:26,959
Just joking about the wife, sir.

832
01:08:32,117 --> 01:08:35,460
We've checked everything.
There's no sign of a break in

833
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:38,233
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

834
01:08:38,545 --> 01:08:40,860
So body in the bath tub,
his eyes were wide open

835
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,743
and the only thing missing was...

836
01:08:44,275 --> 01:08:46,214
His ring, sir.

837
01:09:02,498 --> 01:09:04,181
Why did you drain the water?

838
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,678
Out of common decency.

839
01:09:05,678 --> 01:09:07,407
Crime is common.
Logic, is rare.

840
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:13,160
The decent thing to do is catch the killer,
not to provide conflict to the cause.

841
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:28,371
What is that?

842
01:09:31,841 --> 01:09:33,093
Jasmine bath salt, sir.

843
01:09:33,093 --> 01:09:35,554
Super. Probably comes
from a larger container.

844
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,729
It would either be in the pantry.

845
01:09:38,155 --> 01:09:43,033
High up where it's warm and dry.
Or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

846
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:45,668
Oh and constable, you could
do worse than to check the

847
01:09:45,918 --> 01:09:47,559
ground under the rear window
for any signs of footprints

848
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:50,262
data, data, data. I can not
make bricks without clay.

849
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:51,244
Charles?

850
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:01,462
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry.

851
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,601
It was in the pantry, sir.

852
01:11:04,572 --> 01:11:06,259
I don't know what to make of this.

853
01:11:06,617 --> 01:11:07,750
Wxcellent work.

854
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:09,950
Adieu.

855
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:50,897
What's the meaning of this, Coward?

856
01:11:50,897 --> 01:11:52,366
Why have you called this meeting?

857
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:54,365
Sir Thomas is dead.

858
01:11:56,334 --> 01:12:00,368
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the Order.

859
01:12:02,306 --> 01:12:03,649
Have you lost your mind?

860
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,056
You know damn well
what his capable of.

861
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,219
Of course he does.

862
01:12:10,589 --> 01:12:11,892
That's why we're here.

863
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:15,467
That's why, we're all here.

864
01:12:21,595 --> 01:12:25,560
My powers and my assets were
given to me for one purpose.

865
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:29,282
Magnificent was a simple purpose.

866
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:32,392
To create a new future.

867
01:12:33,563 --> 01:12:38,815
A future ruled... by us.

868
01:12:41,034 --> 01:12:46,004
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

869
01:12:47,504 --> 01:12:49,164
Magic will lead the way.

870
01:12:49,444 --> 01:12:51,412
Once the people of England
see our new found power

871
01:12:51,412 --> 01:12:53,102
they'll bow down in fear.

872
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:01,759
Across the Atlantic, lies a
colony that was once ours.

873
01:13:02,572 --> 01:13:04,065
It will be again.

874
01:13:04,807 --> 01:13:06,482
The civil war has
made them weak.

875
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,480
Their government is as corrupt
and ineffective as ours.

876
01:13:12,484 --> 01:13:13,886
So we'll take it back.

877
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:18,060
We will remake the world.

878
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,945
Create the future.

879
01:13:23,548 --> 01:13:26,080
These men are with me,
Standish.

880
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:29,599
But... are you?

881
01:13:30,988 --> 01:13:34,516
No, sir. I am not.

882
01:13:34,862 --> 01:13:37,939
These powers that
you're playing with...

883
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,130
no man, can control.

884
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:46,506
Well gentlemen... Someone
has to stop them

885
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,921
even if you won't.

886
01:13:51,921 --> 01:13:53,496
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

887
01:14:16,365 --> 01:14:19,155
Gentlemen... don't be afraid.

888
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,179
As you can see,
we are protected.

889
01:14:27,517 --> 01:14:29,282
Come... drink your allegience here.

890
01:14:36,411 --> 01:14:39,944
You control the
police, now use them.

891
01:14:51,913 --> 01:14:53,321
I didn't know you were here.

892
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:56,227
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilise it?

893
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,197
Be my guest.

894
01:15:00,782 --> 01:15:03,325
- In here chaps.
- Where shall we put him, sir?

895
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:05,012
Anywhere's fine.

896
01:15:15,795 --> 01:15:17,045
Who is he?

897
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,952
His the one who tried to kill
you at Reardon's lodgings.

898
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:21,862
I suppose his neck didn't survive the
impact of Draga landing on him.

899
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,828
Yes... Thanks for that by the way.

900
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:33,474
But there is still some consolation in
the knowledge that he can still be of service
to his fellow man.

901
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,825
Elbow is now stained with blood.

902
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,714
But it's older than his own injuries.

903
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:52,093
Not if it's not human. There's
an odd butcher. Let me see...

904
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,888
Yellow Flame. Green bursts.

905
01:16:05,226 --> 01:16:06,616
An industrial worker.

906
01:16:11,104 --> 01:16:13,397
Coal. Hint of silt.

907
01:16:13,546 --> 01:16:16,835
And the stains on his trousers,
should put him squarely in...

908
01:16:16,835 --> 01:16:18,273
Nine Elms.

909
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:19,524
Sorry what?

910
01:16:19,524 --> 01:16:21,578
The area you're looking
for is, Nine Elms.

911
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:26,712
Do you remember where I put the
Lord's registerer of members intrests?

912
01:16:27,386 --> 01:16:28,587
On the step ladder.

913
01:16:39,817 --> 01:16:42,967
Blackwood was involved in everything
that's corrosive to the spirit.

914
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,876
Woolidge Arsenal.

915
01:16:46,124 --> 01:16:47,625
Limehouse Chemical Works.

916
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,830
Probably be a factory
by the river.

917
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:50,970
What's that?

918
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,953
Never mind.

919
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:56,972
You don't know where
my rugby ball went do you?

920
01:16:57,532 --> 01:16:58,867
No, not a clue.

921
01:16:59,221 --> 01:17:01,019
Queensithe slaughterhouse

922
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,581
Nine Elms.

923
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:05,458
A factory by the river.

924
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:08,098
Well done, Watson. That should
lead us right to Blackwood.

925
01:17:08,507 --> 01:17:09,722
Dead or Alive.

926
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:11,009
Not us.

927
01:17:12,725 --> 01:17:14,118
You.

928
01:17:14,928 --> 01:17:16,087
Yes...

929
01:17:17,775 --> 01:17:19,103
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

930
01:17:29,105 --> 01:17:30,764
He's left it there on purpose.

931
01:17:51,449 --> 01:17:54,305
More coal doctor.

932
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:00,304
That's a good one.

933
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,304
Glad to see you two
are working hard then.

934
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:06,883
And I thought you were
trying to be discrete.

935
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:10,445
You would not last
one day in the navy.

936
01:18:13,683 --> 01:18:15,633
Holmes, are you
sure that there is no

937
01:18:15,633 --> 01:18:17,483
alternative means of
water transportaion, than that.

938
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:20,010
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

939
01:18:21,456 --> 01:18:23,017
Tanners practically a fish himself.

940
01:18:23,838 --> 01:18:25,137
At least he certainly drinks like one.

941
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:26,999
Oh you've found your
sense of humour, doctor.

942
01:18:27,454 --> 01:18:28,825
If only just a sense.

943
01:18:30,093 --> 01:18:33,013
I better take over.
A bit tricky down here.

944
01:18:55,294 --> 01:18:56,406
Come on...

945
01:19:12,508 --> 01:19:13,767
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

946
01:19:14,237 --> 01:19:17,769
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

947
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:30,679
They cleared something away from here.

948
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:31,982
Not minutes ago.

949
01:19:31,982 --> 01:19:33,074
Like what?

950
01:19:33,713 --> 01:19:35,569
I'm not sure. Something mechanical.

951
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,804
Holmes, look at this.

952
01:20:04,937 --> 01:20:06,784
- 1:18
- Chapter and verse.

953
01:20:06,784 --> 01:20:09,815
Revelations. 1:18.
"I am here liveth

954
01:20:09,815 --> 01:20:14,219
- and was dead."
- And behold of the life for ever more.

955
01:20:15,517 --> 01:20:17,442
I warned you, Holmes to accept

956
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:18,899
that this was beyond your control.

957
01:20:19,221 --> 01:20:21,688
beyond what your rational
mind could comprehend

958
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:26,254
What if this, is the after
life that you're having.

959
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:27,727
I want you to bear witness.

960
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:32,381
Tomorrow, at midday, the
world as you know it, will end.

961
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:35,414
Show me your face and it will
be the end of your qorld right now.

962
01:20:35,682 --> 01:20:37,071
Save the bullets, Watson.

963
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,245
A gift for you.

964
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:46,626
What was that about saving bullets?

965
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:55,075
She followed you here, Holmes.

966
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,745
You reared your lamb to slaughter.

967
01:21:03,343 --> 01:21:04,301
Holmes!

968
01:21:06,138 --> 01:21:07,687
This game was designed to hurt.

969
01:21:19,692 --> 01:21:20,723
Watson!

970
01:21:25,307 --> 01:21:27,055
It's warm in here, Watson!

971
01:21:33,965 --> 01:21:35,412
In over your head yet, darling?

972
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:44,976
- Hold on there!
- I can't.

973
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:47,376
Let me take your weight.

974
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,228
Hold the leg up, old boy.

975
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,996
These jamming locks always
give me trouble.

976
01:21:59,672 --> 01:22:01,012
To bad a saw.

977
01:22:04,841 --> 01:22:06,485
No matter. We have plenty of time.

978
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:09,924
Holmes...

979
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:21,143
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

980
01:22:28,534 --> 01:22:30,334
Holmes! Hurry up.

981
01:22:37,236 --> 01:22:39,173
You're not getting excited...

982
01:22:39,814 --> 01:22:41,128
Turn of that valve.

983
01:23:05,324 --> 01:23:06,958
And we bounce in... Three

984
01:23:07,104 --> 01:23:07,807
...two,

985
01:23:07,807 --> 01:23:09,403
...one.

986
01:23:20,486 --> 01:23:21,734
Thank you.

987
01:23:22,754 --> 01:23:24,110
I'm gonna get after, Blackwood.

988
01:23:34,206 --> 01:23:35,394
Thank you.

989
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:37,958
We should go help the doctor.

990
01:23:50,586 --> 01:23:52,024
Holmes!

991
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:54,664
Lord. Coward has issued
a warrant for your arrest.

992
01:25:57,172 --> 01:26:00,142
Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir. Go.

993
01:26:18,366 --> 01:26:19,803
Will the train be departing on time?

994
01:26:19,803 --> 01:26:21,900
The train's been delayed, madam.

995
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:23,865
Shouldn't be long now though.

996
01:26:41,019 --> 01:26:43,810
The train will depart
when I tell it too.

997
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:49,280
And you will leave my
employment, when I allow you too.

998
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:55,277
I fulfilled my contract.

999
01:26:56,245 --> 01:26:57,791
I found Reorden.

1000
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:59,559
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

1001
01:27:00,057 --> 01:27:01,422
So that's me finished.

1002
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:05,153
Your job was to munipulate,
Holmes' feelings for you.

1003
01:27:05,842 --> 01:27:07,307
Not succomb to them.

1004
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:12,123
You have fulfilled nothing.

1005
01:27:12,408 --> 01:27:15,097
I want what, Reardon
was making for Blackwood.

1006
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:20,867
finish the job, or the next dead
body will be of Sherlock Holmes.

1007
01:27:48,814 --> 01:27:50,470
The surgeon should
be along shortly.

1008
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,090
He should be
able to rest now.

1009
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:02,345
Excuse me.

1010
01:28:06,382 --> 01:28:08,197
Is that the best you can do?

1011
01:28:08,476 --> 01:28:09,792
Yes for now.

1012
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:12,245
I must attend to
my other patients.

1013
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:15,508
Doctor...

1014
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,322
Doctor!

1015
01:28:17,816 --> 01:28:19,534
Please!

1016
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,942
I know that you care
for him as much as I do.

1017
01:28:27,544 --> 01:28:29,657
This is not your responsibility,
It was his choice.

1018
01:28:31,905 --> 01:28:34,060
He'd say it was worth the wounds.

1019
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:42,606
Solve this.

1020
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:45,256
Whatever it takes.

1021
01:29:00,453 --> 01:29:01,924
It's Lord Blackwood, sir.

1022
01:29:02,228 --> 01:29:03,954
I've never been in over my head.

1023
01:29:04,242 --> 01:29:06,730
It's nothing to do with me, but I'd
advise you to leave the case alone.

1024
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,442
You're not taking this
seriously are you, Holmes.

1025
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:11,081
I told you to accept, his
was belond your control

1026
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,552
Tomorrow at mid-day, the world will end.

1027
01:29:14,552 --> 01:29:15,819
Holmes.

1028
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:45,646
You and I, are bound on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1029
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:47,812
Steal your mind, "Holmes.

1030
01:29:49,366 --> 01:29:51,192
He will raise a force that will
change the very course of the world.

1031
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:52,500
His power grows.

1032
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,674
This is the source of his power.

1033
01:29:53,906 --> 01:29:54,780
I need you.

1034
01:29:54,984 --> 01:29:56,553
The secret lies in the book of spells.

1035
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,792
Three more will die...

1036
01:30:28,323 --> 01:30:30,119
and there's nothing
you can do to save them.

1037
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:33,604
We know you don't believe in magic.

1038
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:37,118
Reardon was working with Blackwood.

1039
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,153
The only thing missing
was his ring.

1040
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,282
Give up, Holmes.

1041
01:30:57,093 --> 01:30:59,531
This is a riddle you can not solve.

1042
01:31:06,036 --> 01:31:07,378
Good morning.

1043
01:31:10,814 --> 01:31:13,693
Now, you need to work.

1044
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,848
Familliar artwork?

1045
01:31:19,037 --> 01:31:20,707
You look gorgeous.

1046
01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:25,414
Some how, I knew you wouldn't leave.

1047
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,902
You made the front page.

1048
01:31:35,902 --> 01:31:37,451
Only a name, and no picture?

1049
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:42,564
So it looks like, you'll be needing
to work outside the law now,

1050
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:46,127
and that's my area of expertise.

1051
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:47,200
I feel safer already.

1052
01:31:49,536 --> 01:31:51,299
You seem to be making a rapid recoverey.

1053
01:31:52,922 --> 01:31:54,204
Yes...

1054
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,874
I took this shrapnel out myself.

1055
01:31:57,446 --> 01:31:59,697
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1056
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:08,488
Well I'm... I'm just so...

1057
01:32:09,111 --> 01:32:15,271
very glad that you're
um... well, with us.

1058
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:21,729
Now that youre sitting
comfortably, I shall begin.

1059
01:32:23,243 --> 01:32:26,154
My initial approach
was far to narrow.

1060
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:28,542
When Blackwood invited
me to Pentonville prison

1061
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:30,404
he suggested I widen my gaze.

1062
01:32:30,404 --> 01:32:32,018
and at minimum, I have done just that.

1063
01:32:32,587 --> 01:32:37,435
In fact, I may well have reconciled thousand's
of years of theological disparities.

1064
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:41,018
But that's for another time.

1065
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:44,060
Blackwood's method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system

1066
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,559
that's been employed by the Temple
of the Four Order for centuries.

1067
01:32:47,908 --> 01:32:52,430
To fully understand the
system, to get inside it,

1068
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:54,483
I recreated the ceremony
we interuppted at the crypt,

1069
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:57,080
with a few enhancements of my own.

1070
01:32:58,283 --> 01:33:01,624
my journey took me further down
the rabbit hole than I intended

1071
01:33:01,624 --> 01:33:04,524
and though I dont need
my fluffy white tail.

1072
01:33:04,524 --> 01:33:07,090
I have emerged, enlightened.

1073
01:33:08,128 --> 01:33:10,965
The fraternity who
decidedly control the empire

1074
01:33:10,965 --> 01:33:13,929
who share the belief of kings,
pharaohs  and emperors of old

1075
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,996
that the Sphinx was a door
to another dimension.

1076
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:19,132
A gateway to immeasurable power.

1077
01:33:19,417 --> 01:33:20,779
It's made up of four parts.

1078
01:33:21,031 --> 01:33:24,216
The foot of a lion, the tail of
an ox, the wings of an eagle

1079
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:26,136
and the head of a man.

1080
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:29,572
In sir Thomass secret chamber,
I found a bone of an ox

1081
01:33:29,795 --> 01:33:32,620
the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and a hair of a man.

1082
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:34,198
Map.

1083
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:40,761
The points of the stars represent
the the five murdered girls

1084
01:33:41,075 --> 01:33:43,253
but the cross is what
were now intrested in.

1085
01:33:44,205 --> 01:33:49,046
Its a wildly held belief, that within
the architecture of the great cities

1086
01:33:49,046 --> 01:33:51,328
are coded references to the system

1087
01:33:52,173 --> 01:33:54,760
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood's killed three men.

1088
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,754
Each murder was committed at a location that
has a direct connection with the temple

1089
01:33:58,754 --> 01:34:00,349
therefore a system .

1090
01:34:01,478 --> 01:34:03,981
Reardon, the ginger midget.

1091
01:34:04,475 --> 01:34:06,007
represents man. We found his body here.

1092
01:34:07,301 --> 01:34:10,927
Sir Thomas... master of the
temple, wore the ox ring.

1093
01:34:11,397 --> 01:34:12,919
He died here.

1094
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:17,647
Standish, the ambassador to the U.S..
Where the eagle has been a national

1095
01:34:17,881 --> 01:34:19,994
emblem over a hundred years .

1096
01:34:20,215 --> 01:34:22,296
The headquarters of the Temple of the
Four Order is where he died,

1097
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:24,701
this here.

1098
01:34:26,182 --> 01:34:29,307
Corresponded, the map will tell
us the location of Blackwood's final act

1099
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:34,344
So we have man, the ox,
eagle, only the lion remaining.

1100
01:34:35,338 --> 01:34:37,139
Right here.

1101
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:39,717
Parliament.

1102
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:49,334
Alright you four stay here and
the rest of you come with me.

1103
01:34:51,428 --> 01:34:52,813
Right this way.

1104
01:34:56,214 --> 01:34:57,692
Ladies first.

1105
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,130
Follow these instructions.

1106
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:09,227
Hello, hello, hello...

1107
01:35:10,099 --> 01:35:12,208
Did the devil turn up?

1108
01:35:13,412 --> 01:35:16,073
Well never mind.

1109
01:35:17,438 --> 01:35:19,001
You've got the next best thing.

1110
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:46,117
Beg your pardon my lord,
I know its unorthodox

1111
01:35:47,794 --> 01:35:52,214
But Mr. Holmes here has been making
some serious accusations about you

1112
01:35:54,391 --> 01:35:56,355
and The Order.

1113
01:35:57,982 --> 01:35:59,452
I see.

1114
01:36:00,857 --> 01:36:03,766
At least this solves the great mystery
of how you became inspector.

1115
01:36:08,894 --> 01:36:10,265
Excuse me, my lord.

1116
01:36:11,328 --> 01:36:13,873
But I've been wanting
to that for a long time.

1117
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:17,304
Well inspector, have five minutes
before my next engagement.

1118
01:36:18,249 --> 01:36:21,282
So why dont you engrail me
with your stories of conspiracy

1119
01:36:24,595 --> 01:36:26,065
Thank you Lestrade.

1120
01:36:26,838 --> 01:36:28,111
My lord...

1121
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:37,067
I'm curious, Coward. Did you help
Blackwood in all his murders.

1122
01:36:37,413 --> 01:36:39,475
or just the one I prevented?

1123
01:36:40,652 --> 01:36:42,792
Very distinctive, those hand
made shoes of yours.

1124
01:36:45,604 --> 01:36:49,105
But the price of quality is often
the leaking print they leave

1125
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:54,168
Nonetheless I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1126
01:36:55,244 --> 01:36:57,629
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1127
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:02,068
Fortunately theres nothing
more stimulating than a

1128
01:37:02,068 --> 01:37:03,357
case where everything
goes against you.

1129
01:37:04,597 --> 01:37:07,066
How many members of parliament do
you intend to murder at noon today.

1130
01:37:08,359 --> 01:37:13,288
Man, ox, eagle, lion. The
lion's parliament isn't it?

1131
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:16,724
Very clever.

1132
01:37:17,674 --> 01:37:19,583
But it's not murder,
Mr. Holmes.

1133
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:21,830
It's mercy.

1134
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:24,551
We are giving the weak
masses a strong Shepard.

1135
01:37:25,084 --> 01:37:26,791
Don't you see,
it's for their own...

1136
01:37:30,488 --> 01:37:33,050
No. But I don't care
much what you think.

1137
01:37:33,268 --> 01:37:36,170
I just simply wanted to know the
location of Blackwoods final ceremony.

1138
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:37,757
And now you've given it to me.

1139
01:37:37,757 --> 01:37:39,396
I've told you nothing.

1140
01:37:39,396 --> 01:37:42,274
But your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope.

1141
01:37:42,964 --> 01:37:45,807
The mud smeared on your boots
from where youve been walking.

1142
01:37:46,313 --> 01:37:49,484
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where youve been kneeling.

1143
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:53,809
A small bandage on your thumb
from where youve been vowing.

1144
01:37:54,215 --> 01:37:57,420
A faint aroma of excrement from
where youve been standing.

1145
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:03,895
You and Blackwood laid the final
toches to your ceremony in the sewers

1146
01:38:03,895 --> 01:38:05,123
beneath parliament

1147
01:38:05,373 --> 01:38:06,718
less than an hour ago.

1148
01:38:07,639 --> 01:38:09,267
Both houses meet today.

1149
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:12,022
The whole government will be present.

1150
01:38:21,785 --> 01:38:24,256
It's a shame you made an
enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1151
01:38:25,535 --> 01:38:27,192
You would have
made a valuable ally.

1152
01:38:34,913 --> 01:38:36,695
How terrible is wisdom.

1153
01:38:36,934 --> 01:38:39,197
when it brings no
profit to the wise.

1154
01:38:41,185 --> 01:38:42,960
We take power at noon.

1155
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,946
Then isn't anytime to waste then.

1156
01:38:44,946 --> 01:38:46,791
Guess not?

1157
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:15,081
told you hed be coming out of
that top window soldier boy.

1158
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,905
There isn't any way hed be
coming out of that terrace.

1159
01:39:17,147 --> 01:39:19,988
Technically that isnt the
top window, is it Sailor boy.

1160
01:39:20,552 --> 01:39:22,836
- Where was he?
- It's the middle window.

1161
01:39:23,043 --> 01:39:27,520
Anyway, youd be pleased to know
that Lustrate played in his role perfectly

1162
01:39:28,336 --> 01:39:29,949
Actually, I think
I rather enjoyed it.

1163
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:31,919
I hope you know what
you're doing, Holmes.

1164
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:33,823
Here's the key.

1165
01:39:34,212 --> 01:39:35,794
You got what you
needed from, Coward?

1166
01:39:35,794 --> 01:39:37,778
Yes, I smoked him out
of the room with ease.

1167
01:39:39,153 --> 01:39:40,430
- Taylor?
- Yes?

1168
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:43,202
If you would captain,
take us onto the bridge

1169
01:39:43,202 --> 01:39:48,014
Port side. proximately 100 yards beyond that you
will find a tunnel, that leads us to the sewers.

1170
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,204
Alright, sir.

1171
01:39:58,672 --> 01:40:02,332
Blackwoods come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land

1172
01:40:49,838 --> 01:40:52,035
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1173
01:40:52,568 --> 01:40:53,629
What does it do?

1174
01:40:53,629 --> 01:40:54,975
It's a chemical weapon.

1175
01:40:55,444 --> 01:40:56,584
The first of its kind.

1176
01:40:56,787 --> 01:40:57,780
You deduced that, how?

1177
01:40:58,746 --> 01:40:59,849
From my pocket.

1178
01:41:00,681 --> 01:41:03,246
I snipped this of a rather common
rat at the slaughterhouse.

1179
01:41:03,838 --> 01:41:05,121
Notice the bluish discolouration.

1180
01:41:05,321 --> 01:41:09,071
The faint smell of almonds,
and traces of cyanide.

1181
01:41:14,218 --> 01:41:15,730
Now we know what the
ginger midget was working on.

1182
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:19,848
- It will revolutionise warfare.
- Yes killing a lot of people.

1183
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:24,105
Now, there's 7 minutes until
noon. What are we gonna do?

1184
01:41:29,752 --> 01:41:31,658
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1185
01:42:04,565 --> 01:42:07,960
Shoot him! Now please!

1186
01:42:20,566 --> 01:42:22,961
My lords! My lords.

1187
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:28,564
Time has come for any of
those who believe, to remain.

1188
01:42:30,658 --> 01:42:33,096
Behold... Lord Blackwood.

1189
01:42:46,756 --> 01:42:49,188
You seem surprised.

1190
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:54,666
I have returned from beyond the
grave to fulfil Englands destiny.

1191
01:42:56,085 --> 01:42:58,643
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1192
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,362
Listen to the rabble outside.

1193
01:43:04,939 --> 01:43:06,301
Listen...

1194
01:43:06,702 --> 01:43:08,079
to the fear.

1195
01:43:08,467 --> 01:43:11,028
I will use that as a
weapon to control them...

1196
01:43:12,674 --> 01:43:14,157
and then the world.

1197
01:43:18,438 --> 01:43:20,562
I've never seen anything
like it. Look at this.

1198
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:26,805
Its specifically designed to
prevent us from disarming it.

1199
01:43:29,994 --> 01:43:32,724
These components seem to be specifically
designed to receive some sort of signal.

1200
01:43:32,724 --> 01:43:34,552
Electromagnetic waves?

1201
01:43:34,806 --> 01:43:36,913
When triggered, the electrodes
will send a charge

1202
01:43:37,152 --> 01:43:38,834
converting the chemial into gas.

1203
01:43:39,037 --> 01:43:40,850
and the gas will travel up that shaft

1204
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:44,009
and filter through the ventilation
system that leads directly to parliament.

1205
01:43:44,412 --> 01:43:48,636
Within seconds, the administration the most
powerfull men in the world will be choking
to death

1206
01:43:49,561 --> 01:43:51,876
Blackwood must have
some sort of transmitter

1207
01:43:51,876 --> 01:43:53,185
that connects them remotely.

1208
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:54,693
Three minutes and ten seconds.

1209
01:43:54,693 --> 01:43:58,853
I will create an empire that
will endure for a millennia

1210
01:43:59,455 --> 01:44:01,904
Indestructible and eternal.

1211
01:44:03,368 --> 01:44:05,987
Move it! Move it!

1212
01:44:06,587 --> 01:44:11,013
We don't have to actually disarm the device,
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1213
01:44:11,764 --> 01:44:12,891
Yes.

1214
01:44:12,891 --> 01:44:17,620
Except that they're welded in. What
we need is a controlled expolsion.

1215
01:44:18,129 --> 01:44:22,571
We need a container to direct the blast
my clay pipe should service that ambition

1216
01:44:43,216 --> 01:44:45,097
I rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene.

1217
01:44:51,485 --> 01:44:55,414
On the twelfth chime, I will
summon the dark powers.

1218
01:44:57,285 --> 01:45:00,393
All of those who are with
me shall be protected.

1219
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:04,162
All others will perish.

1220
01:45:11,748 --> 01:45:13,256
I need your pipe.

1221
01:45:16,614 --> 01:45:18,273
Nut him!

1222
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:28,775
A new order... begins now.

1223
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,381
What are you waiting for?

1224
01:46:41,257 --> 01:46:42,445
That.

1225
01:46:58,271 --> 01:47:00,349
- Can you manage?
- Of course I can.

1226
01:47:27,383 --> 01:47:29,632
Relax. I'm a doctor.

1227
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,707
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?

1228
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:47,642
We're safe now.

1229
01:48:48,579 --> 01:48:50,001
Interesting assessment .

1230
01:48:52,337 --> 01:48:53,767
Run off.

1231
01:48:55,831 --> 01:48:58,490
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1232
01:49:00,107 --> 01:49:01,562
Fair thee well.

1233
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:09,001
I don't want to run anymore.

1234
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,240
I'll tell you everything.

1235
01:49:13,647 --> 01:49:14,802
I wish you would.

1236
01:49:38,007 --> 01:49:39,044
No!

1237
01:50:45,525 --> 01:50:47,154
There was never any magic.

1238
01:50:49,057 --> 01:50:50,919
Only conjuring tricks.

1239
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:56,915
The simplest involves
paying people off.

1240
01:50:57,464 --> 01:51:00,244
Like the prison guard who pretended
to be possessed outside you cell.

1241
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:03,149
Your reputation and the
inmates fear did the rest.

1242
01:51:04,785 --> 01:51:07,113
Others required more
elaborate preparations.

1243
01:51:07,424 --> 01:51:10,020
It was sand storm slab
that covered your tomb.

1244
01:51:11,383 --> 01:51:13,322
you had it broken before your burial

1245
01:51:13,322 --> 01:51:15,789
then put back together
using a mild adhesive.

1246
01:51:17,108 --> 01:51:18,888
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe.

1247
01:51:19,618 --> 01:51:24,341
A mixture of egg and honey, that
was to be washed away by the rain.

1248
01:51:29,732 --> 01:51:31,138
Holmes!

1249
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:33,999
Arranging for your father to
drown in his own bathtub

1250
01:51:34,203 --> 01:51:35,951
required more modern science.

1251
01:51:35,951 --> 01:51:38,616
Very clever of, Reordan
to find a paralytic

1252
01:51:38,826 --> 01:51:41,876
that was activated by the
combination of copper and water.

1253
01:51:41,876 --> 01:51:45,663
and therefore was undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1254
01:51:47,321 --> 01:51:48,589
It would have been
quite a challenge for me,

1255
01:51:48,589 --> 01:51:52,591
had he not also tested it on
some unfortunate amphibian.

1256
01:51:57,112 --> 01:51:59,496
The death of Standish
was a real mystery

1257
01:51:59,496 --> 01:52:03,627
until you used the same
compound, to blow up the wharf.

1258
01:52:03,936 --> 01:52:07,550
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid

1259
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:10,312
yet it burned with
an unusual pink tissue.

1260
01:52:11,829 --> 01:52:14,064
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple.

1261
01:52:14,064 --> 01:52:18,067
All it took was a spark.

1262
01:52:22,443 --> 01:52:24,348
A simple rigged
bullet in his gun.

1263
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,472
Ingenious.

1264
01:52:27,472 --> 01:52:31,452
Like all great performers, you saved
your pierce do rsistance for the end.

1265
01:52:31,452 --> 01:52:34,139
A chemical weapon,
distilled from cyanide.

1266
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:35,974
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1267
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:39,957
Had it worked, your followers in
parliament would have watched unharmed

1268
01:52:40,363 --> 01:52:42,771
as their colleagues were
dying around them.

1269
01:52:43,597 --> 01:52:45,458
They didn't know that you'd
given them the antidote.

1270
01:52:45,957 --> 01:52:48,268
Instead they would have
believed it was magic.

1271
01:52:48,268 --> 01:52:50,835
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1272
01:52:51,369 --> 01:52:55,490
and the world would have followed in
fear, in the most powerfull weapon of all.

1273
01:52:57,101 --> 01:52:59,523
You'd better hope it's
nothing more than superstition,

1274
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:02,462
as you performed all
the rituals perfectly.

1275
01:53:03,306 --> 01:53:05,336
The devil's missing
its soul, I'd say.

1276
01:53:07,276 --> 01:53:10,118
For god's sake,
Holmes cut me loose!

1277
01:53:20,574 --> 01:53:23,154
First, the world will see
you for what you are.

1278
01:53:23,529 --> 01:53:25,144
A fraud.

1279
01:53:25,513 --> 01:53:28,328
Then you will be hanged
properly this time.

1280
01:53:28,692 --> 01:53:31,127
It's a long journey
from here to the rope.

1281
01:54:22,701 --> 01:54:25,139
I've never woken up
in handcuffs before.

1282
01:54:26,316 --> 01:54:27,751
I have.

1283
01:54:29,166 --> 01:54:30,649
Naked.

1284
01:54:34,852 --> 01:54:36,432
A storm is coming.

1285
01:54:37,336 --> 01:54:39,727
Well... we've still got a moment.

1286
01:54:44,668 --> 01:54:46,838
- Moriarty...
- What?

1287
01:54:47,994 --> 01:54:49,641
That's his name.

1288
01:54:50,376 --> 01:54:51,993
And he is a professor.

1289
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,184
Everyone has a weak spot.

1290
01:54:57,205 --> 01:54:59,025
And he found mine.

1291
01:55:00,776 --> 01:55:02,676
What was it precisely?

1292
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:15,424
Please don't underestimate him.

1293
01:55:16,945 --> 01:55:18,771
He's just as brilliant as you are.

1294
01:55:19,645 --> 01:55:21,631
and infinitely more devious.

1295
01:55:24,057 --> 01:55:25,596
We'll see about that.

1296
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:43,088
You'll miss me, Sherlock?

1297
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:47,986
Sadly... yes.

1298
01:56:16,349 --> 01:56:20,120
- Afternoon, sir. I put the notebook
in this one, sir.
- Thank you.

1299
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:21,472
What's in these, John?

1300
01:56:21,775 --> 01:56:23,540
- Scribbles.
- Scribbles?

1301
01:56:23,927 --> 01:56:25,599
- Notes.
- The're your adventures!

1302
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:27,322
I'd like to read them.

1303
01:56:33,466 --> 01:56:35,540
Come on, what's wrong?

1304
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:37,886
I think his finally come
to terms of you leaving?

1305
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:40,761
Mary, look at the
ring his given us.

1306
01:56:42,105 --> 01:56:43,937
Now 5 minutes here,
and we'll go home.

1307
01:56:44,604 --> 01:56:45,669
Our home.

1308
01:56:46,327 --> 01:56:47,573
Carefull on the stairs.

1309
01:56:55,955 --> 01:56:57,422
Don't worry, dear.

1310
01:56:58,077 --> 01:57:01,496
Suicide is not in his repertoire. He's
far to fond of himself for that.

1311
01:57:02,268 --> 01:57:03,592
Holmes!

1312
01:57:07,115 --> 01:57:08,499
Good afternoon.

1313
01:57:08,756 --> 01:57:12,052
I was trying to deduce in which the
manner Blackwood survived his execution.

1314
01:57:12,469 --> 01:57:14,023
Clearing your good
name as it were.

1315
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:17,409
But it had a surprising
suffocating effect on, and

1316
01:57:17,409 --> 01:57:19,314
I was carried off in
the hands off, Morpheus

1317
01:57:19,781 --> 01:57:22,307
like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.

1318
01:57:22,962 --> 01:57:24,347
Get on with it, Holmes.

1319
01:57:25,178 --> 01:57:27,430
Cleverly concealed in the
hang-mans knot, was a hook

1320
01:57:28,664 --> 01:57:31,631
Oh dear, I think my legs have fallen
asleep I should probably come down.

1321
01:57:31,994 --> 01:57:33,559
John, shouldn't we
help him down?

1322
01:57:33,559 --> 01:57:36,398
No, no, I hate to
cut him off midstream.

1323
01:57:36,398 --> 01:57:37,692
Carry on.

1324
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,663
Well the executioner
attached it to a harness.

1325
01:57:41,663 --> 01:57:44,322
Thus lowering the weight
contributed around the waist and

1326
01:57:44,722 --> 01:57:46,123
the neck to remain intact.

1327
01:57:46,466 --> 01:57:48,071
Oh my lord, I can't feel my cheeks.

1328
01:57:48,071 --> 01:57:50,057
Might we continue
this at ground level?

1329
01:57:50,292 --> 01:57:51,888
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1330
01:57:52,244 --> 01:57:55,544
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1331
01:57:56,415 --> 01:57:59,128
Please, Watson, my tongue is going,
I would be of no use to you at all.

1332
01:57:59,699 --> 01:58:01,297
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1333
01:58:02,670 --> 01:58:06,544
None of this, explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse

1334
01:58:06,644 --> 01:58:08,067
Right.

1335
01:58:09,142 --> 01:58:11,862
Now the medical mystery.

1336
01:58:11,862 --> 01:58:13,664
We must restore your reputation,Watson.

1337
01:58:14,288 --> 01:58:17,924
There is a toxin refined from the
nectar of rhododendron ponticum.

1338
01:58:18,329 --> 01:58:21,520
It's quite infamous in the region of Turkey,
near the Black Sea, for it's

1339
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:24,053
ability to induce an
apparently mortal paralysis.

1340
01:58:24,426 --> 01:58:28,161
Even for a logical and well trained mind,
even one as tenacious as your own.

1341
01:58:28,615 --> 01:58:30,398
It's known locally as...

1342
01:58:30,398 --> 01:58:31,850
What's wrong with Gladston?

1343
01:58:32,068 --> 01:58:33,492
Mad honey's diesease.

1344
01:58:33,492 --> 01:58:36,138
His demonstrating the very
effects that I just described.

1345
01:58:37,389 --> 01:58:38,868
He doesn't mind.

1346
01:58:41,478 --> 01:58:43,767
Mary don't worry.
he's seen far worse.

1347
01:58:44,703 --> 01:58:46,087
Mr. Holmes?

1348
01:58:47,964 --> 01:58:49,231
Doctor, Miss Mary...

1349
01:58:49,966 --> 01:58:52,089
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks
you come with me right away.

1350
01:58:53,674 --> 01:58:55,170
What is it this time, Clarky?

1351
01:58:55,394 --> 01:58:57,497
Its one of our sergeants, sir.

1352
01:58:57,497 --> 01:58:59,486
He went missing in the sewers the
day, you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1353
01:58:59,486 --> 01:59:02,890
Im afraid the sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir

1354
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:06,721
We believe the sergeant,
was the first man at the scene...

1355
01:59:07,687 --> 01:59:09,251
Can I help you, offcer?

1356
01:59:09,845 --> 01:59:11,315
Shot in the head.

1357
01:59:12,957 --> 01:59:14,504
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1358
01:59:14,792 --> 01:59:15,990
Yes.

1359
01:59:18,335 --> 01:59:20,053
Was there powdered
burns on his eyebrows?

1360
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:21,803
Indeed, sir.

1361
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:25,771
Point blank range.

1362
01:59:26,211 --> 01:59:27,802
Moriarty.

1363
01:59:28,586 --> 01:59:30,294
Professor Moriarty.

1364
01:59:33,567 --> 01:59:35,065
There's a good boy!

1365
01:59:35,449 --> 01:59:36,796
Everything's gonna be fine.

1366
01:59:38,348 --> 01:59:39,857
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1367
01:59:39,857 --> 01:59:41,546
Secret Service have it, sir.

1368
01:59:41,546 --> 01:59:43,049
They've taken over the case.

1369
01:59:43,454 --> 01:59:44,857
I bet there's a piece missing.

1370
01:59:47,786 --> 01:59:50,438
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine.

1371
01:59:51,193 --> 01:59:52,368
Not the poison.

1372
01:59:52,368 --> 01:59:54,552
Theres nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1373
01:59:55,072 --> 01:59:57,393
The wire free invention
was the goal all along.

1374
01:59:58,003 --> 01:59:59,770
And Addler was just the diversion.

1375
02:00:00,145 --> 02:00:01,460
He knew I'd chase after her,

1376
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:03,303
there by leaving the machine accessible.

1377
02:00:03,705 --> 02:00:06,724
The technology of that kind can
be worth, an untold fortune.

1378
02:00:07,648 --> 02:00:12,335
Imagine being able to control a radio device
simply by sending a command via radio waves.

1379
02:00:13,763 --> 02:00:15,430
It's the future, Watson.

1380
02:00:18,835 --> 02:00:20,748
I've loaded the last
of your boxes, sir.

1381
02:00:24,508 --> 02:00:25,980
- Well...
- Well...

1382
02:00:27,153 --> 02:00:28,352
Gladston!

1383
02:00:28,352 --> 02:00:29,824
Stop him before he
gets to the front door.

1384
02:00:30,886 --> 02:00:32,354
Clarky?

1385
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,066
Case reopened.

1386
02:00:36,601 --> 02:00:46,498
THE END
