1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,086
Walk slowly from the teacher's room

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,170
to the main gate.

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,755
What is this picture?
Didn't I ask you what this picture is?

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,133
To threaten Min Seonha
to drop out. Don't come near me, please!

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,597
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,016
Uh, I...

7
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,603
just finished working out
at the sports park,

8
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,105
so I'm just on my way back
to pick up my bike.

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,573
Oh...

10
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,368
I've never taken this route before,
so I was just trying it out.

11
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,079
There aren't any traffic lights,
so I thought it'd be faster.

12
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,081
It doesn't make much of a difference
which route you take at this hour.

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,416
Oh... I see.

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,294
When you go down that way,
there's a bit of a downhill slope.

15
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,837
There's actually a pothole over there.

16
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,383
-So you have to watch out for it.
-Oh, really? I'll be careful.

17
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,510
Take care.

18
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,887
Okay.

19
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,472
See ya.

DIED DEC 25TH 2021

24
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,827
When I heard
that Park Wonseok was dead,

25
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,205
I was genuinely really happy.

26
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,833
Why did you live like that?

27
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,505
What should I do now?

Soomin. How are you?

31
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,087
It's been three years already.

32
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,340
I'm doing fine, and Mom's doing well too.

33
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,388
Well, that's a lie.

34
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,641
I'm not doing so great,

35
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,810
but I'll take care of myself.

36
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,895
So, Soomin...

37
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,564
please look out for Mom.

That's my older brother.

Oh.

44
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,740
You didn't know my brother
or anything like that, did you?

45
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,909
Oh, no, no, no way.

46
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,537

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,916

00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,627
the truth is...

YULGOK BUS TERMINAL
NEULPURUM MEMORIAL PARK

50
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,376
I had no idea

51
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,796
that Park Wonseok would be here too.

52
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,840
Can I ask you for a favor?

53
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,677
Can you keep it a secret

54
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,596
that Park Wonseok and I are twins?

55
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,228
The reason I don't want other people
to know is because

56
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,605
I don't want anyone
treating me differently.

57
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,275
I'm worried they might stop
telling me the truth

58
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,153
about Park Wonseok
if they were to find out.

59
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,534
Are you hungry?

60
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,703
What?

61
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,081
There's a steamed bun restaurant
near here. They make fantastic buns.

62
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,585
Let's go.

63
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,678
WE'RE CLOSED TODAY

HANBONGAM BROWN RICE STEAMED BUN

65
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,249
We could at least eat this...

66
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,751
No, I'm good.

67
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,586
I can eat at school.

68
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,422
It doesn't feel right to eat this, right?

69
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,801
No, no, I didn't mean that...

70
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,346
My brother used to love hamburgers.

71
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,601
Hey!

72
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,019
Where do you think you're going? Stop him!

73
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,562
-What did you say to me?
-You shouldn't do that.

74
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,190
It all started when my brother
was singled out

75
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,441
by the bullies for no reason.

76
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,734
-Come here.
-Dude, you're strong, huh?

77
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,944
Stop it!

78
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,737
They wouldn't let him go to the restroom.

79
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,740
They made him cry and beg...

80
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,159
...and kneel before them
until he was just crawling on the floor.

81
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,538
That's when they finally
let him go to the bathroom.

82
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,373
Huh?

83
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,832
On that day,

84
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,544
He fought his way out,
instead of crying and begging.

85
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,795
Come here!

86
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,588
-Stay still! Stay still, shit.
-Hey, relax, take it easy, yeah?

87
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,674
Look at him all tensed up.

88
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,884
-Seriously? God...
-Hey, he's peeing.

89
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,930
-He peed himself.
-I really should be recording this, right?

90
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,099
-Yikes.
-Look over here, just once.

91
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,183
But it didn't work out for him.

92
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,269
-Come on, just one time?
-Hey, who did this?

93
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,562
He tried, but it didn't work.

94
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,356
Good afternoon.

95
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
When my mother was on her way
back home that day...

96
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,903
Hold on a second, please!

97
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,574
She heard something drop
with a loud thud.

98
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,784
-Call 119, 119, 119, 119!
-Oh, my god!

99
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,202
Yes, yes.

100
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,705
This is so scary.

101
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,501
It was my brother.

102
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,753
And my mother saw the whole thing.

103
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,089
No...

104
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,219
Soomin! Soomin!

105
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,724
Soomin, no, no, no, no, no, no!

106
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,934
Soomin, Soomin!

107
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,062
Soomin, no!

108
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,023
Soomin!

109
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,762
Hey, so...

110
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,392
What was Park Wonseok's real name?

111
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,021
Ok Chankyu.

112
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,732
Ok Chankyu.

113
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,659
YONGTAN HIGH
READING DISCUSSION

114
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,869
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

115
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,956
He dropped out.

116
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,918
That rapist Sa Junggyeong
dropped out of school!

117
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,087
-What?
-How does that make any sense?

118
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,254
After all he's done to come back
to this school,

119
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,756
why would he drop out all of a sudden?

120
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,883
Trust me! The teacher's room
is in utter chaos right now.

121
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,927
I heard Junggyeong just came
with his parents and dropped out.

122
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,762
Oh! Hey, look! There's Sa Junggyeong!

123
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,225
Bye, bye now!

124
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,894
Good bye! Yeah!
Get lost, you son of a bitch!

125
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:29,980
I knew you'd end up like it!

126
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,190
Don't ever come back, Sa Junggyeong!

127
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,608
Watch your back! I'll be watching you!

128
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,151
Be a decent human being!

129
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,736
Yeah, keep on living like that forever!

130
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,322
Stop being so despicable,
you son of a bitch!

131
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,703
-Awesome!
-Good bye! You were terrible.

132
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,163
That's how
you'll live the rest of your life!

133
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,624
Next time I run
into you at night, consider yourself dead!

134
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,376
Hey, get lost!

135
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,002
Watch your back!

136
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,004
Why is Sa Junggyeong
leaving in a wheelchair

137
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,589
through the main school gate
when he can simply ride away in a car?

138
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,633
He's just giving these guys
a sight to see.

139
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,177
I heard that's what the guy
who beat him up told Junggyeong to do.

140
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,971
What?

141
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,181
To drop out of school,
then walk all the way to the main gate.

142
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,767
Wow, shit.

143
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,479
This is crazy, just crazy.

144
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,481
Why is Sa Junggyeong in a wheelchair?

145
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,151
I heard someone literally
crushed his feet last night.

146
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,819
-Where?
-In the photography dark room.

147
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,696
I heard his toes are completely crushed.

148
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,990
That damn rapist deserved it.

149
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,825
I also heard the attacker threatened him
to leave the school

150
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,327
or he'll snap his neck. That's why
he's leaving without making a peep.

151
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,496
-Whoever that is, they're so cool.
-I agree.

152
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,331
-Wow, they're a hero, really.
-Seriously.

153
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,627
-I heard someone saw the hero last night.
-There's a witness for our hero?

154
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,504
-That's not good.
-Who was the hero?

155
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,507
We don't know.
They were alone wearing a mask.

156
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,967
Someone saw them in front
of the photography building

157
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,887
-jumping over the wall.
-Oh, they wore a mask. Phew.

158
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,138
Ah, what a relief.

159
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,347
-What a relief.
-What a relief.

160
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,974
-Ah, that's a relief.
-Seriously, that's a good thing.

161
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,067
-What's going on?
-Did something happen?

162
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,225
What's that?

163
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,768
Well, who do we have here?
Ji Sooheon and Ok Chanmi?

164
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,604
Did they ditch class together
and then come back together?

165
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,283
Class four! Class four! Let's go!

166
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,120
Class three! Class three! Class three!
Class three! Class three!

167
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,373
What's wrong with her?

168
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,460
Class three! Class three!
Class three! Class three!

169
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,546
Where did you and Sooheon go this morning?

170
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,339
What?

171
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,925
-You were with Sooheon, weren't you?
-Uh...

172
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,010
I was, I guess.

173
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,179
Where did you guys go?

174
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,391
It's nothing. Just somewhere we had to be.

175
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,642
Are you guys going out?

176
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,811
What? No way.

177
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,272
Good.

178
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
What's good?

179
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,194
I was about to start hating you.

180
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,779
Push, push!

181
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,948
Hey, stop him!

182
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,991
YONGTAN HIGH

183
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,790
Ji Sooheon, you're so cool!

184
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,958
Ji Sooheon!

185
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,670
Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon!
Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon!

186
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,716
Let's go! Let's go!

187
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:54,643
Gi Osung! Gi Osung! Gi Osung!

188
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,479
Gi Osung! Gi Osung! Gi Osung!

189
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:03,903
YONGTAN HIGH

190
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,613
Do you think you'll be able
to handle this?

191
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,573
Gi Osung's the one who got her pregnant,

192
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,074
so why are you acting all crazy,
Park Wonseok?

193
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,784
Did you really think
you'd be able to rip him off

194
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,202
by lying about your pregnancy?

195
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,288
Did you really think
we're all stupid idiots?

196
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,207
Your scam doesn't work on him, damn it.

197
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,137
-Block him!
-Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon!

198
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,180
Nice.

199
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,351
-Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon!
-Ah, sorry.

200
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:41,607
Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon!
Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon! Ji Sooheon!

201
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,323
Stop the game!

202
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,699
Hey, move! Move!

203
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,993
Hey, Sooheon!

204
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,913
Sooheon? Sooheon?

205
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,998
Sooheon, can you hear me, Sooheon?

206
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,668
Come on Sooheon, get a grip on yourself.
Sooheon!

207
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,338
Wake up! Wake up!

208
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,340
One, two, three!

209
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,634
Class presidents, get everyone organized
and head back to class.

210
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,514
Hey, Gi Osung.

211
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,848
Aren't you ashamed?

212
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,183
For what?

213
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,267
Didn't you push him like a coward

214
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,769
because you knew
you were no match for him?

215
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,562
Come on.

216
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,065
Look, it's totally normal
to compete for the ball like that.

217
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,025
You pushed him
like you were trying to kill him!

218
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,319
-What the hell are you on about?
-Why are you the way you are?

219
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,154
You're a pathetic idiot, seriously.

220
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,614
Kook Jihyun, you got a death wish?

221
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,074
So do you just go around killing people
you don't like?

222
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,534
-Shut your mouth!
-Hey, hey, hey!

223
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,493
-You gonna beat me?
-Hold on, hold on.

224
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,495
Hey, why don't you come hit me!
You pathetic idiot.

225
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,538
Let me go, seriously!

226
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,747
I'm going to teach
that psycho a lesson today.

227
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,124
-Hey, calm down, calm down.
-Come on!

228
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,250
-Who are you ordering around?
-Don't listen to him.

229
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,710
Ugh, come on! Shit!

230
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,422
-Hey! Let me go! Shit!
-Hey!

231
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,390
Ok Chanmi.

232
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:57,891
Yeah?

233
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,023
-Seok Jaebum.
-Yeah?

234
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,150
Can you do me a favor?

235
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,986
Favor? What is it?

236
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,426
Are you okay?

237
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,970
You sure did sweat a lot.

238
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,182
Huh? Thanks.

239
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,975
I think I'm fine.

240
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,269
The doctor said you had a minor concussion

241
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,855
and that you were going to sleep
until the tranquilizer wears off.

242
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,398
At least I got to sleep well.

243
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,900
Is that mine?

244
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,027
Yeah.

245
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,821
It's your uniform and backpack.

246
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,741
Thank you.

247
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,285
Hey, don't you have like after-school
classes, or something?

248
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,080
It's okay.

249
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,712
I'm hungry. Do you wanna eat something?

250
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,507
You pick the menu. This way,
I can repay what you did for me.

251
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,884
How about something spicy?
That'll help you wake up.

252
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,010
Sure.

253
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,221
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,018
Ugh, how rude.

255
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,144
Excuse me!

256
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,398
Let's just go. I'm hungry.

257
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,528
Okay.

258
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,071
I guess I'll forget all about it
once I eat something spicy.

259
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,868
-So what should we eat?
-Um...

260
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,579
Whatever you want.

261
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,248
What I mean is,
what type of spicy food do you want?

262
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,676
He left without saying a word,

263
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,053
even while the other kids were
booing and clapping their hands.

264
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,555
He was literally kicked out of the school.

265
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,808
You have no idea how good it felt
to see that little shithead Sa Junggyeong

266
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,101
getting kicked out of school...

267
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,021
Hey, why are you crying?
You should be smiling from ear to ear.

268
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,731
I'm just so happy...

269
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,403
I don't feel any pain in my
body or my heart anymore.

270
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,739
They say this bastard in a wheelchair
may never walk on his own two feet again.

271
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,949
By the way,

272
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,286
who did this to him?

273
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,621
No one knows.
The person was wearing a mask.

274
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,249
Everyone went crazy
and started praising him as a hero.

275
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,665
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

276
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,042
Yes.

277
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,253
Detective Jin.

278
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,673
GI WANGDO, CHIEF OF YONGTAN POLICE STATION

279
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,760
Did you get the reports
from Yongtan High assault cause?

280
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,969
Yes, sir.

281
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,888
The case was assigned to me a minute ago.

282
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,515
The perpetrator really crossed a line,
don't you think?

283
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,936
How could they smash
a student's toes while at school?

284
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,188
This is unforgivable.

285
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,731
We'll arrest the perpetrator as quickly

286
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,191
as possible and punish them
with a zero-tolerance policy.

287
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,026
Yes, sir.

288
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,578
What did you want to talk about?

289
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,206
Was it not appropriate
to discuss at school?

290
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,708
I had to ditch my after-school class

291
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,210
because Jaebum insisted
that I meet you here.

292
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,045
Thank you.

293
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,005
Actually, I have something to ask you.

294
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,550
I'd appreciate it
if you could answer honestly.

295
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,512
Oh, what is that? I'm so curious.

296
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,931
You know...

297
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,975
Park Wonseok?

298
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,187
Yeah...

299
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,438
Um, so I met up with Im Somi,

300
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,940
the one who transferred
out of the school, and...

301
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:15,899
Yeah...

302
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,734
Isn't it true that Im Somi threatened you

303
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,153
to take responsibility
for getting her pregnant,

304
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,323
and that Park Wonseok figured out
she was lying?

305
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,786
Sorry.

306
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,790
Did I jump into things too quickly?

307
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,500
So what exactly
did you want to talk about?

308
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,085
Osung, why did you have
Park Wonseok clean up your mess

309
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,837
instead of doing it yourself?

310
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,255
Why did Park Wonseok have to do
the dirty work

311
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,591
of confronting and yelling at Im Somi?
Why didn't you do it yourself?

312
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
You know, Park Wonseok...

313
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,220
is no longer with us...

314
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,850
I don't think we should be talking
about this, for his sake.

315
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,437
Are you saying that we'd be talking
badly about him

316
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,022
if we were to go into detail
about what happened?

317
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,648
How do you know him anyway?

318
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,942
We met in a shooting club.

319
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,405
I just want to know why Wonseok
had to fight your battles.

320
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,699
-Why do you want to know?
-I mean...

321
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,492
I'm just curious.

322
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,037
I heard Park Wonseok was
the best at fighting in the school.

323
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,080
I mean, if he's the best fighter,
he wouldn't have had to do

324
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,583
-what you told him to do, am I wrong?
-He was just helping me out, no reason.

325
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,835
We were close.

326
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,253
He's always been good to me.

327
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,131
He was a really nice guy.

328
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,759
He was a nice guy?

329
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,598
I mean...

330
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,100
What kind of person
was Park Wonseok exactly?

331
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,435
Was he actually a good person?

332
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,354
Or a terrible guy who deserved to die?

333
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,981
I just don't think he killed himself.

334
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,318
It's kind of hard for me to talk about.

335
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,029
If you two were close,
you must know, right?

336
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,448
What happened that day?

337
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,534
Did you notice anything that might
indicate that he would kill himself?

338
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,037
Do you really think it was suicide?

339
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,373
I'm sorry,
but let's just not talk about it.

340
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,167
-I'm gonna head out then.
-Hey, um...

341
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,210
GI WANGDO

342
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,962
Gi Wangdo,

343
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,297
Gi Osung.

344
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,050
They both share the same last name. Gi.

345
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,733
Who is it?

346
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,652
Hello, I'm...

347
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,363
I'm a student at Yongtan High.

348
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,450
I'm the friend of the student
that lives here.

349
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,453
Oh, of course. One moment, please.

350
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,489
Kook Jihyun?

351
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,166
Why... how... why are you here?

352
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,252
You...

353
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,587
Do you live here?

354
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,048
Hey, what are you doing here?

355
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,467
Oh, here.

356
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,053
I came to return this cellphone.
Gi Osung left it behind.

357
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,500
What? Why are you in my room?

358
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,169
Did you meet up with Ok Chanmi?

359
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,590
She brought this to the house.

360
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,050
Ok Chanmi came to our house?

361
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,012
And you're saying Chanmi saw you?

362
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,724
I guess everyone will know
by tomorrow morning, no?

363
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,519
That you and I live in the same house.
Huh? That we're siblings?

364
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,938
I'm happy for you.

365
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,442
Clean up your own shit.

366
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,653
Do whatever it takes to fix this,
you moron.

367
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,856
I put in a bit more than
the amount we agreed on.

368
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,651
You didn't have to do that.

369
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,153
I heard he's badly hurt.

370
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,197
You shouldn't feel guilty.

371
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,907
That's what you've paid for.

372
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,867
I don't feel that way at all.

373
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,494
I'm just grateful.

374
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,496
I don't know who that person is,

375
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,498
but please tell them
that I said thank you.

376
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,208
Okay.

377
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,293
I'll make sure I tell them that.

378
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,921
It goes without saying that

379
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,964
this never happened, right?

380
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,552
And there won't be any other reasons
for us to meet in the future.

381
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,686
Thank you.

382
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,604
Thank you so much.

383
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,238
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

384
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,397
Mm, delicious.

385
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,318
It's important for kids to maintain
their stamina during senior year.

386
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,945
Make sure you feed them
high-protein foods.

387
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,739
Of course, that's what I'm doing.

388
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,075
This is Osung's favorite,
and these are Jihyun's favorites.

389
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,411
All rich in protein.

390
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,996
And what about me?

391
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,206
You can go out and eat more protein
on your own.

392
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,463
If you're both able to attend
the highest-ranked college together,

393
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,506
all my wishes will have come true.

394
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,971
Father, I'm sorry but I should head out
as I need to get to school early.

395
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,514
Why don't you just eat a bit more?

396
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,391
Okay, then. Go ahead
and head out if you're busy.

397
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,685
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, take some jerky with you.

398
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,895
Oh, I'm fine.

399
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:48,203
CAR WASH

400
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,042
Have you been waiting for me?

401
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,044
I heard you're here every morning.

402
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,880
You must've been surprised
when you saw Kook Jihyun at my house.

403
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,591
Well, yeah. I guess I was a bit surprised.

404
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,384
As you saw,

405
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,678
Jihyun and I live together
in the same house.

406
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,349
We might be siblings to some,
but not to others.

407
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,187
My father married Kook Jihyun's mom
two years ago.

408
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,605
It's not official yet though.

409
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,398
Oh...

410
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,360
But as you can see,
we don't get along very well.

411
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,446
I really don't like her,

412
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,864
and she doesn't either.

413
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,784
If someone at school

414
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,119
finds out that we're siblings,

415
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,997
I'll be too embarrassed
to attend that school with her.

416
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,749
Don't worry.

417
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,001
I won't tell anybody.

418
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,005
You can trust me.
I'll keep that to myself.

419
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,008
Thank you, Chanmi.

420
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,219
Is there anything I can do for you?

421
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,846
No, there's nothing I want.

422
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,264
I'm on my way to class now.

423
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,474
Just let me know whenever I can help.

424
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,735
Right?

425
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,279
When did you leave practice yesterday?

426
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,781
Was it eight o'clock? I don't remember.

427
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,667
Hey.

428
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,839
This was super helpful.

429
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,674
What?

430
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,175
You even ironed it.

431
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,552
You know I love crisp things.

432
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,554
Thanks again.

433
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,352
Guys, guys. The cops are here, the cops!

434
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,271
That bastard Sa Junggyeong
brought cops with him.

435
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,565
What now?
Are they investigating his case, then?

436
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,983
What? Why are police here?

437
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,277
Why are they going through
all the trouble of catching our hero,

438
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,445
when they should be focusing

439
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,821
on opening up
Sa Junggyeong's rape case again?

440
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,785
Ah, shit.

441
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,581
Ms. Jin, I'll go and check the recordings
from the surveillance cameras nearby.

442
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,292
Check the recordings
from the ones across the street as well.

443
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,420
Roger that. I'll meet with the witnesses
on my way back as well.

444
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,721
Can you tell me
about the circumstances of your assault?

445
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,181
Yes.

446
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,808
-Don't arrest our hero!
-Don't do it!

447
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,435
-Please!
-Just leave!

448
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,021
-Please go!
-Can you just leave?

449
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,648
Get out of here!

450
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,318
Can you just leave?

451
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,322
-Leave!
-Please don't arrest our hero!

452
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,209
It was 9:30 p.m. when Sa Junggyeong's
toes were smashed...

453
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,004
Mr. Sa called 119 at 9:36 p.m.,

454
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:49,759
after getting assaulted
in the photography dark room.

455
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,971
The time on this CCTV recording
is 9:08 p.m.

456
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,472
Have you spoken to the witness
who was in front

457
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,307
of the student center building
where the photography dark room is?

458
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,977
Yes, a male and a female student
who were on a date at the school testified

459
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,520
that they saw a person scaling the wall.

460
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,438
On the other side of this wall
is the alley

461
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,190
where this security camera
recording was taken.

462
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,067
When did they see the person?

463
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,402
It was a little past 9 p.m.

464
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,653
There doesn't seem to be
a significant discrepancy

465
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,779
between the time on the recording.

466
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,159
Don't you think this female
Yongtan High student

467
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,536
stopped after seeing someone?

468
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,289
Oh, I think you're right.

469
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,919
How many girls do you think
ride a scooter at Yongtan High?

470
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,803
-Hey, isn't it amazing?
-What is?

471
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,722
Im Seungwu, why don't you
tell her what you told me.

472
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,974
You know the hero
who crushed Sa Junggyeong?

473
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,811
I was just wondering if it might have been
the same hero who punished Park Wonseok.

474
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,396
Wow, I got goosebumps.

475
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,981
You're right, the police announcement
was not very convincing.

476
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,357
You know, if you want to jump off
from a building,

477
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,734
it would make more sense
to jump from a rooftop.

478
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,277
Why would someone jump off
the window of the science lab?

479
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,031
Right.

480
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,783
That might be possible,
but the hero couldn't have possibly killed

481
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,035
a guy just to punish him.

482
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,454
Hey, maybe the hero
wasn't initially planning to kill him.

483
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,081
Park Wonseok might have fallen
from the science lab on the third floor

484
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,332
while the hero was punishing him.

485
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,417
That's what I'm assuming.

486
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,171
In any case, I think the hero
must have been targeting Park Wonseok.

487
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,007
A lot of people were hurt by Park Wonseok.

488
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,101
Hey, is this all you got?

489
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,478
I told you to stop.

490
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,272
And when I heard
he had killed himself,

491
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,609
I thought it was karmic retribution.

492
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,153
When he killed himself,

493
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,988
I'm sure there were a lot of people
who were secretly happy about it.

494
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,364
He would search for people's weaknesses
and threaten people with them.

495
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,408
That bastard was utter trash.

496
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:42,371
Could it be that my brother
was killed by the same guy?

497
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,718
What are you doing here?

498
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,761
Uh.

499
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,514
I'm just on my way back
to pick up my bike.

500
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,816
-Hello.
-Hey.

501
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,656
Mr. Choi, by any chance,
do you know where Ji Sooheon lives?

502
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,657
Sooheon's home?

503
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,784
Yeah, I need to bring something to him.

504
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,868
So I was just wondering if you know where.

505
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,787
Oh, didn't you know
he lives above the gym?

506
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,874
-I see. Thank you.
-Sure.

Hello. Hello.

519
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,519
I have something I need to ask you.
Could you spare a moment?

520
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,188
Yes, sure.

521
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,574
Here, take this.

522
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,826
Thank you.

523
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,999
Can you confirm
if that's you on the screen?

524
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,627
Yes, that's me.

525
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,505
Do you know when and where this was taken?

526
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,757
The alley next to the school,
two days ago.

527
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,387
Seems like you met a friend there?

528
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,680
Sorry?

529
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,974
You ran into someone you knew.
Isn't that why you stopped your scooter?

530
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,018
Yeah.

531
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,728
Can you tell me who that person was?

532
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,025
It was Ji Sooheon.

533
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,988
Oh... Mr. Ji Sooheon?

534
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,491
Did have an appointment to meet there?

535
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,410
No, I just ran into him.

536
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,912
Were there any other students
or other people there?

537
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,581
No.

538
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,499
It was just Ji Sooheon that was there.

539
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,585
Do you know
why Mr. Ji Sooheon was there alone?

540
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,796
What I want to know is,
did you notice anything strange about him?

541
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,216
Like whether he was carrying
something in particular...

542
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,177
wearing something in particular?

543
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,846
Was he in a hurry, or that sort of thing?

544
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,473
Do you remember anything?

545
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,237
Detective.

546
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,535
Thank you, please come again soon.

547
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,412
Thank you.

548
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,290
Hello, welcome.

549
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,614
Do you know about the assault case

550
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,866
at the photography dark room
in the student center building?

551
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,868
Yes.

552
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,706
According to Ms. Ok Chanmi,
who's in the same class as you,

553
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,043
she ran into you in the alley
on the other side of the wall

554
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,586
of the student center that night.

555
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,963
Is that true?

556
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,094
Did you run into Ms. Ok Chanmi
in the alley that night?

557
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,304
Yes, I ran into her.

558
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,016
Could you describe the situation
when you ran into her?

559
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,435
The situation?

560
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,188
In other words...

561
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,190
How did you end up in the alley?

562
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,693
What were you doing there
and where were you before that?

563
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,987
Where did you
go after parting ways with her?

564
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,031
-That's what we're asking.
-Why should I tell you?

565
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,616
I mean, if you don't want to do it here,
should we do it at the police station?

566
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,785
-What do you think?
-Mr. Ji Sooheon.

567
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,456
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

568
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,586
Can I leave?

569
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,350
That night...

570
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,228
I was on my way to the auto repair shop
to pick up my bike

571
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,230
after jogging on the Unmacheon track.

572
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,150
Well, I'm sure you've already done
your investigation, but...

573
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,610
I practice martial arts.

574
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,438
Hey, Sooheon!

575
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,942
You look tired.
Just call it a day and get some rest.

576
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,152
Okay, see you, sir.

577
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,029
-Don't forget to lock the door.
-Okay.

578
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,060
Even if I get caught...

579
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,608
there wouldn't be anything
I can do about it, would there?

580
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:09,164
CAR WASH

581
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,959
YONGTAN CAR SERVICE

582
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,759
Hey.

583
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,638
By any chance, did you meet
with detectives last night?

584
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,764
By any chance?

585
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,934
You're the one who sent them my way.

586
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,936
You can't just act sneaky and say
"by any chance".

587
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,062
That's why I've been waiting for you

588
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,564
because I didn't want there
to be any misunderstandings.

589
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,566
They asked me who I ran into in the alley

590
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,985
after showing me surveillance footage
of me from that night.

591
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,361
So I just said I ran into you.

592
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,612
I know you're suspicious of me.

593
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,656
You must have told the cops

594
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,701
that I'm the hero
that everyone's talking about.

595
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,245
I didn't tell them that.

596
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,747
Then why did you steal my bloody sneakers

597
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,416
from my room on the rooftop?

598
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,879
You brought them to the police,
didn't you?

599
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,132
Detective.

600
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,100
I don't have anything noteworthy
to tell you.

601
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,822
I apologize.

602
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,449
I misunderstood.

603
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,535
I'm sorry about taking your sneakers, too.

604
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,748
I really don't have anything else
I can say. I'm sorry.

605
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,631
You might not accept my apology,

606
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,468
but I'm still really sorry.

607
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,902
You said you wanted to catch the culprit
behind your twin brother's death?

608
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,154
Wasn't that the reason
why you transferred to this school?

609
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,616
The reason why Park Wonseok died

610
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,035
has nothing to do with what you think
might have happened.

611
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,579
The hero didn't kill him,

612
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,331
so go back to your school
in Busan already.

613
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,835
How do you know that?

614
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,882
Hey! Ji Sooheon!

615
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:28,095
Why are you saying that?
Hey, answer me! What does that mean?

616
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,891
Hey, don't just walk away
when I'm talking to you.

617
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,018
Come on, tell me what you meant by that!

618
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,396
That's enough. Just leave.

619
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,730
What do you mean that's enough?

620
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,316
You think you can say whatever
you want and just go silent?

621
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,901
I said, leave.

622
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,574
Hey, Ji Sooheon, come on!
Hey, explain it to me!

623
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,826
Hey, hey, Ji Sooheon!

624
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,036
You! Didn't you hear?
He said that's enough.

625
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,872
It's none of your business,
so stay out of it.

626
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,084
Hey, Ji Sooheon! Hey, get up.

627
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,503
Didn't I tell you to explain yourself?

628
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,009
What are they doing?

629
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,262
Hey, Ok Chanmi.

630
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,847
Do you really think you can act
however you want

631
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,848
because you know a secret about me?

632
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,476
I'm not interested in your secret.

633
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,646
And I'm not going to spread
any rumors about it.

634
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,149
So you can stop being paranoid about it.

635
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,483
Paranoid?

636
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,694
Hey, Ok Jihyun.

637
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,864
I'm not interested in you,
nor do I want to argue with you.

638
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,949
So please, why don't we just mind
our own businesses?

639
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,993
Do you really think you can transfer here,

640
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:37,080
and go around acting like
a dirty piece of gum under my shoe?

641
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,626
You're the one that needs to be
more careful about not stepping on gum.

642
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,754
You think a piece of gum would just leap
and stick itself onto a shoe?

You work really hard, huh?

645
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,820
Don't look at me like that.

646
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,405
I'm here as a customer, nothing more.

647
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,906
I need to work...

648
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,908
I'm telling the truth.

649
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,493
Don't mind me, you can go on and work.

00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,774
Hey! Honey, over here!

654
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,527
Oh, hey dear.

655
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,280
Mr. Ji, the reason why you fainted is

656
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,407
because you have a tumor in your brain.

657
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,868
And it's a very dangerous one.

658
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,954
Sorry, I'm a little late.

659
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,248
You met with your patient's guardians
on your way back, right?

660
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,751
Exactly, how can I just dismiss
them when they're asking me questions.

661
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,253
Anyways, it's been a while since
we last bowled. Let's go.

662
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,588
-Loser pays for dinner. You in?
-I'm in.

663
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,673
-Welcome.
-Hello.

664
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,758
-Two people?
-Yes.

665
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,676
-What size...
-240 for me,

666
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,678
one in 240 and one in 275.

667
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,096
Okay, got it.

668
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,368
OK CHANMI, COME TO THE AUDITORIUM
AFTER CLASS ENDS. I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET.

669
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,806
One, two, three, four.

670
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,693
Who are you?

671
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,111
You told me to meet you here, so come out.

672
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,352
Ok Chanmi!

673
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,441
DEPOSIT

674
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,322
Yes, hello.

675
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,324
I'm Shin Yukyung's son.

676
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,409
I've just made a deposit
for my mom's medical bills.

677
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,829
Ah, yes, sorry for the delay.

678
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,206
Thank you.

679
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:28,014
It was a concussion. I stitched you up
since you had a little bleeding.

680
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,268
Do you still feel dizzy
or feel like vomiting?

681
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,103
A bit of headache. That's it.

682
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,437
Hmm.

683
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:38,191
We need to see how you progress
for the rest of today, so please rest.

684
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,818
Okay, thank you.

685
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,574
Are you hungry?

686
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,826
What would you like?
I'll go get it for you.

687
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,620
-It's okay. I'm fine.
-No, you aren't.

688
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,414
How could you be fine
when you're lying in a hospital bed

689
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,873
after falling because you were dizzy?

690
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,166
You need to stay nourished.

691
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,794
Seok Jaebum, how can I ever repay you?

692
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,629
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

693
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,173
By the way,
why were you in the auditorium?

694
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,427
You don't know how surprised
I was to see you collapsed.

695
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,761
Oh, man.

696
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,097
I just wanted to find
a quiet place to think.

697
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,392
What about you? Why were you in there?

698
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,270
I was watching
Baseball Club practice outside

699
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,565
on the field when I saw you
heading to the auditorium.

700
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,443
When I realized that you had been in there
for a while,

701
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,777
I just went to check up on you.

702
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,237
You're a lifesaver.

703
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,283
So why don't you eat properly,
so that you don't just fall over again.

704
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,243
Okay.

705
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,001
What's going on?

706
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,544
Look, look over there.

707
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,296
Why is she wearing that?

708
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,890
Am I right?

709
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,362
What's wrong with you all?

710
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,864
What's going on? What are you doing?
You're annoying me.

711
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,282
Oh, you're here.

712
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,579
What's this?

713
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,247
It's all over the school right now.

714
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,371
Ok Chanmi.

715
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,957
Why are you here?
Why aren't you at school?

716
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,000
The doctor said you need another day
of treatment.

717
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,460
Do you really think you'll be okay?

718
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,921
Yeah, I'm fine.
There's no need for me to stay any longer.

719
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,051
Besides, the bill will be expensive.

720
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,220
Who do I talk to about that?

721
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:16,015
Ah, your doctor told me your
hospital bill has been paid off already.

722
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,183
What?

723
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,643
No way.

724
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,229
Oh, that doesn't sound right.
I need to go ask about that.

725
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,565
No, I... I mean...

726
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,152
Uh...

727
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:32,574
Actually, my family owns this hospital.

728
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,369
Huh?

729
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,374
I'll pay you back one day.

730
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,503
I really appreciate it. I'll pay you back.

731
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,094
What? What do you want from me?

732
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,099
Don't you have something to tell us?
About this fake nude photograph?

733
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,602
We've checked everyone's messages.

734
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,104
Seo Dayeon, you're the original source.

735
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,606
God.

736
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,442
Im Seungwu, that damn bastard!
I told him not to share it with anyone!

737
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,487
Did you create it?

738
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,405
Why?

739
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,492
What have I ever done to you!

740
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,287
I didn't make it.

741
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,748
I got this from Ok Chanmi.

742
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,874
What?

743
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,876
-She said Ok Chanmi.
-Ok Chanmi?

744
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,545
I'm really sorry about spreading it.

745
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,215
-But I got this from Ok Chanmi!
-Unlock your phone.

746
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,060
Wow, did Ok Chanmi do this for real?

747
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,645
Did Ok Chanmi really do this?

748
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,522
-Is she out of her mind?
-Wow.

749
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,273
I never knew
she was that kind of a person.

750
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,067
Ok Chanmi would have to
be crazy to do something like this.

751
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,196
-Ok Chanmi's coming!
-Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi. There she is.

752
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,281
Hey, hey, Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi.

753
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,459
Why did you do that?

754
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,255
You crazy little...

755
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,281
What?

756
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,991
Ji... Ji Sooheon?
