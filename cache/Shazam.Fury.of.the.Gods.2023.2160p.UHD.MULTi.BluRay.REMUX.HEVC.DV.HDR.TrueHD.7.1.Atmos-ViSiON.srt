1
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:12,588
The lore tells us of a valiant few

2
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:15,357
who stood above the fray and fog.

3
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,827
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

4
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,261
Which brings us to our current exhibit,

5
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,798
the mythical staff of the gods.

6
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,567
In Homer's tale,

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,803
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

8
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh. Welcome, proud soldiers.

9
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:33,173
What did I say?

10
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:34,541
Museums are fun.

11
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:37,511
Amusement parks for the brains.

12
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:38,613
Whoa!

13
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:40,615
Okay, there's no reason to get pushy.

14
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,951
Everyone will get a chance to see it.

15
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:44,552
Carved from a heartwood

16
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:46,955
not seen in over 2,000 years,

17
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:49,423
the two halves of this ancient replica

18
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:51,660
were recently discovered in, of all places,

19
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:55,362
a waste processing
plant outside of Philadelphia.

20
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,698
So strong, they reportedly broke

21
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,667
three trash compactors.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,902
Okay, um, friends, that's enough.

23
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:03,437
I'm, I'm sort of the star
of the show here...

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,339
Stop!

25
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:06,473
Stop! Sir!

26
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:09,443
Sir!

27
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,781
Hey!

28
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:14,348
Hey, what are you doing?

29
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,695
Unleash the chaos.

30
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,769
Unleash the chaos.

31
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,545
Unleash the chaos.

32
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:39,517
Wait, wait.
Move, move, move!

33
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:43,803
No, no!

34
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,672
Help me!

35
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,393
No!

36
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:12,363
Ladies, please just let me go.

37
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,637
Oh, my God!
Look out!

38
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:04,815
Turns out museums are fun.

39
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,520
Let's have more of it.

40
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,624
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

41
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:16,026
The champions of this realm outnumber us.

42
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,163
Human champions are still humans

43
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:20,998
and we are gods.

44
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:23,934
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

45
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:26,170
To protect the power of the gods,

46
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,006
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

47
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,877
the strongest,
most keenly intelligent champions

48
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,179
this realm has ever witnessed.

49
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,848
I'm an idiot.

50
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:39,917
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

51
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,719
Like, what am I even contributing?

52
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:43,654
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

53
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:44,787
with a lightning bolt on it

54
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,890
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

55
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:50,693
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

56
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:51,995
and Batman is so cool!

57
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,097
And I'm just me.

58
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,665
And I can't say this to anyone else,

59
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:57,076
'cause my family looks to me as a leader,

60
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,002
but I feel like

61
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,136
a fraud.

62
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,638
You understand I'm a...

63
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,007
pediatrician,

64
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,777
right?

65
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,846
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

66
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,648
by another patient, Billy Batson.

67
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:12,949
It doesn't matter.

68
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:14,817
Can you help fix my thoughts so that

69
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:16,786
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

70
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,187
All right, look.

71
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:19,865
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

72
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,824
but it sounds to me like

73
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:24,694
you're experiencing imposter syndrome.

74
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:27,931
And often,
that originates from trauma early in life,

75
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:30,532
so if you don't mind me asking,

76
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,568
how well do you remember your childhood?

77
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:33,970
Like it was today.

78
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,872
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

79
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:38,506
I mean, I never met my dad.

80
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,877
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

81
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,521
I spent a lot of time in the foster system,

82
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:44,613
ran away from 11 homes,

83
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:45,847
got into a lot of fights.

84
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,091
Then I was abducted by a wizard

85
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,717
who gave me superpowers

86
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,261
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

87
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,653
That's not a small amount.

88
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,021
A doctor conjured seven demons

89
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:54,589
and held my whole family hostage,

90
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,967
so we had to rip out one of his eyeballs,

91
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,793
and then everybody got superpowers,

92
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,637
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

93
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,205
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

94
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,199
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

95
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:06,835
Right? Rejected by your parents,

96
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,502
then by the system,

97
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:11,073
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

98
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,808
I never said I was rejected by my city.

99
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,244
"Rejected by city."

100
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:18,213
That's the <i>Tribune.</i>
Nobody reads the <i>Tribune.</i>

101
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,016
-I do.
-Anyway, okay, well, um...

102
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,819
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

103
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:28,289
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

104
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,758
-Hostage situation?
-Yeah.

105
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,102
I suck balls at this.

106
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,705
Why do we always have
to play war games?

107
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,539
Hey, it's practice for our other job.

108
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,309
I'm serious.

109
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,678
Military strategy,
multiple team members,

110
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,546
each with a special skillset

111
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,849
unleashed against an unknown enemy.

112
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,584
I know how it sounds,

113
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:58,228
but the house keeps getting
struck by lightning, Leo.

114
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm telling you.

115
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:01,865
Besides, you're the one
always talking about teamwork.

116
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,291
But we don't need guns!

117
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,160
Darla?

118
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,337
This is it. This is big time.

119
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,997
-We are the guns.
-Darla!

120
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,565
Why were there Skittles in my pockets?

121
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,701
It was supposed to be a surprise.

122
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,202
It was.

123
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,004
Hmm, she's very moody lately.

124
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,005
Why do you think
I put Skittles in her pocket?

125
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,207
-Oh.
-Whoo! <i>Ole.</i>

126
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,642
Is this an army of unicorns

127
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,277
-killing Genghis Khan?
-Yes.

128
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,046
Unicorns aren't real.

129
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,214
It's called speculative history, Eugene.
Look it up.

130
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:29,291
Billy, you can't just leave.

131
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,084
Your guy's gonna die!

132
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,919
Whoo!

133
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,723
-See?
-Yes.

134
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:38,034
I told you you would get into it

135
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,592
if you gave it a chance.

136
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,828
Yeah, I'm really starting to see the appeal.

137
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:45,632
What's going on?

138
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,809
Dude, what are you doing?

139
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,319
<i>Possible 10-99 in progress.</i>

140
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,921
<i>Multiple reports of cracking on roadway.</i>

141
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,847
<i>Fraying suspension cables.</i>

142
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,083
<i>All units to the Ben Franklin Bridge.</i>

143
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,185
Yeah. It's crazy music, Freddy.

144
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,654
It is, isn't it?
Very urgent melody to it.

145
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:08,798
We should see it performed live.

146
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,189
I was thinking the same thing.

147
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:11,699
I feel like we can get tickets
to that concert.

148
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,625
Two. Maybe not six.

149
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,794
All or none. That's the rule.

150
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,664
Yet I'm still gonna walk backwards now.

151
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:21,133
So, now's your last and final chance.

152
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,035
Billy Batson, come with me.

153
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,803
No, no, no!

154
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:27,806
Man, it sure is a beautiful
day in Philadelphia!

155
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,109
Is it though?

156
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,010
-Almost finished.
-Again?

157
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,246
-Okay.
-This better be good.

158
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:39,084
Whoa, whoa!
Where's everyone going?

159
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:40,786
Um...

160
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:41,854
To fight crime?

161
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,991
-Okay.
-Bye, Mom.

162
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:47,392
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, Mom.

163
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,628
-Bye.
-Bye, Rosa.

164
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:53,165
Give it time.

165
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:02,874
You guys ready?

166
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:05,343
Shazam!

167
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:31,269
Oh, my God.

168
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,338
It's gonna break!

169
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,042
Run!

170
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:46,909
No, no, no.

171
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,785
No way, shut up! Did I just save you

172
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,339
while you were listening to this song?

173
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:01,957
No! I got you, I got you.

174
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,240
No need to panic.
Captain Everypower is here.

175
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:19,975
Oh.

176
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,048
I'm just kidding, it's real easy.

177
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,158
Hi!

178
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,429
Oh, my gosh. Kittens!

179
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:45,133
Oh! They're so cute!

180
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:49,304
Did she just leave us?

181
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,907
Okay, let's go.

182
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,552
-Okay.
-No, no, no, I got ya!

183
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:41,355
That's my sidekick.
Captain Everypower Junior.

184
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,190
Hey! Junior?

185
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,559
You're gonna wanna hold on tight.

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,980
Everyone's safe.

187
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,014
Awesome job, Mary.

188
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,384
Circle up, fam!

189
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,693
All right, here's the situation.

190
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:21,327
We have one more job to do

191
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,529
and that's to keep this bridge
from collapsing.

192
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,701
<i>The Ben Franklin
Bridge has collapsed.</i>

193
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,435
<i>Fortunately, there are no casualties.</i>

194
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,203
{\an8}<i>Thanks in part to our local heroes,</i>

195
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,606
{\an8}<i>one with me now.</i>

196
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,273
{\an8}<i>It's great to be here, Nancy.</i>

197
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,443
{\an8}<i>What can I say?
It's all in a day's work.</i>

198
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,187
{\an8}<i>Right. Well, how do you feel
about being dubbed</i>

199
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,280
{\an8}<i>the Philadelphia Fiascoes?</i>

200
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,282
<i>Given that that's not an official title,</i>

201
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,251
<i>we feel nothing about it.
That is not our name.</i>

202
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,729
<i>Right,
but the important thing is...</i>

203
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,655
What is wrong with these people?

204
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,358
Have you ever no...

205
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,427
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

206
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,271
Yeah, you should.
God only knows what they're up to.

207
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,097
Probably drugs, right?
Probably taking selfies

208
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,331
while vaping on TikTok.

209
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,399
Oh.

210
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,104
Is that a kitten?

211
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,473
No.

212
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,669
I'm gonna name you Tawny.

213
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,687
"Destroy bridge"? What?

214
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,522
Not saving is different than breaking.
Am I wrong?

215
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,391
Am I wrong about this?
Also, we saved countless lives.

216
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,327
{\an8}A hundred sixty-two. It's countable.

217
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,329
{\an8}Emotionally countless,

218
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,363
{\an8}Mary.

219
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,032
{\an8}Where's Eugene?

220
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,367
{\an8}Where he always is.

221
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,036
Mapping out the Room of Doors.

222
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,543
Eugene!

223
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:21,144
Hey, buddy! Where you at?

224
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,115
Hey, Eugene.

225
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,454
Hello? We have a meeting, Eugene.

226
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,461
Oh.

227
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,098
You're late.

228
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,033
Do not go in there.

229
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,372
All right, fam-jam, let's jump in.

230
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,110
All right, big day,

231
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,779
big bridge,
kind of a couple blunders, right?

232
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,892
But we're gonna meditate
on those mistakes right now.

233
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:01,450
Mary?

234
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:05,121
Organic chem is my meditation.

235
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:08,457
Said nobody with friends ever, really.

236
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:11,160
In point of fact, I'd have friends

237
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:12,596
if I had gone to college.

238
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,439
In point of fact is exactly
the kind of

239
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:15,703
smart thing that a smart person

240
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,175
who doesn't need to go to college says.

241
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,635
So,

242
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,202
let's go back to the tape.

243
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:21,805
Now, guys, as you can see,

244
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,675
we started off real,
real, real, real strong, right?

245
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,476
Right up top,
all that cohesiveness, energy,

246
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,245
terrific!

247
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:32,415
Oh, sorry, Coach. Gotta fly IRL.

248
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:33,760
No, no, no,
I'm not done with the presentation.

249
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:35,451
I know. And I love these daily recaps.

250
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:37,721
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

251
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:39,832
-It helps keep me loose!
-Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

252
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,366
We'll go have a group hang in the air.
That sounds great.

253
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,893
I gotta test this slime for toxicity

254
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:45,261
'cause I'm starting to... tingle.

255
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:48,263
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game just came on

256
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,299
so I'm gonna go ahead and, uh,
watch baseball.

257
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,435
It's right that I give Tawny back.

258
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:56,748
Oh, come on!
What is happening?

259
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:58,808
What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

260
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,275
If you say you have to work...

261
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,677
I have to work.

262
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,846
Why do you even have a job?

263
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,246
Wonder Woman doesn't have a job!

264
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,682
-Stop.
-No, seriously.

265
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:07,859
Do you think she
wears a ponytail and glasses

266
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:09,484
and, like, nobody recognizes her

267
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,862
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

268
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:13,488
Just stop.
You are holding on too tight.

269
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:16,324
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

270
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,728
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

271
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:20,663
Or me wanting to go to college

272
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:22,297
means I'm abandoning the family.

273
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,733
Oh. Okay, cool,

274
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,701
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

275
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:26,869
Yeah.

276
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,704
Do you really not see yourself?

277
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:37,511
You turn 18 in five months.

278
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:39,781
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

279
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,416
Victor and Rosa are saints,
yes, but you're about to age out

280
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:44,351
of the foster system just like I did.

281
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:46,955
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

282
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:47,988
Do you?

283
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,926
Victor and Rosa can barely pay rent.

284
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,863
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

285
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,931
and soon there will be no checks for you.

286
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:01,703
I don't care if Wonder Woman has a job.

287
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:03,437
I want to contribute.

288
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,339
At some point, Billy, like

289
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,609
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

290
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:09,410
leave home.

291
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,818
Nothing lasts forever.

292
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,762
I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

293
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:35,234
So, clearly, some things do last forever.

294
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,940
Leave me to die.

295
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:16,409
Oh, but we come bearing gifts.

296
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,621
Magic.

297
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:30,522
Impossible.

298
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,725
This realm was sealed off from magic.

299
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,462
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

300
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:40,298
From every god in this realm.

301
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:41,701
From me.

302
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,773
Do you not remember what you took?

303
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,742
What my particular power was?

304
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:52,344
The power of elements.

305
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,882
No. I cast a barrier to prevent your kind

306
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:57,884
from entering the human realm.

307
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,086
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if...

308
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,654
Someone broke this?

309
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:04,824
How did...

310
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:06,592
Where is the Champion?

311
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:09,394
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

312
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:11,697
and yours that will mend it.

313
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:14,866
I told you
I would die before I help you.

314
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:36,387
Now, say the word.

315
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,590
Never. Never!

316
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:40,091
Never say never.

317
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,400
Say the word.

318
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:59,711
<i>Say the word. Say the word.</i>

319
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:02,147
Shazam!

320
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,012
Now we get to have our fun.

321
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:39,482
Fun is for children, dear.
We are at war.

322
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,845
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

323
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:00,913
-I am so sorry!
-I'm so sorry!

324
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:02,471
No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

325
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,582
No, it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

326
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:04,617
-I'm okay, yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

327
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,175
-I'm always okay.
-Good.

328
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:09,679
Uh, actually, do you...
do you know where this is?

329
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:10,856
Miss Saunders!

330
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,149
Yeah, absolutely

331
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:14,827
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

332
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,595
Oh, no, no worries.
If it makes you feel any better

333
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:17,796
it's nothing compared to the amount

334
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,031
that you're blushing right now.

335
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:20,522
Oh, I blush when I'm confident.

336
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:21,958
There she is.

337
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:24,127
-Hey.
-New girl. First period.

338
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,529
-Yeah.
-I'm Brett. This is Burke.

339
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:28,164
Listen, if you need anything at all,

340
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,099
we're your guys. We got it.

341
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,168
Brett and Burke Breyer.

342
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,646
They got it all. I mean, what is it,
narcissistic personality disorder,

343
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,538
chlamydia, they got it.

344
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:37,506
Plenty of it to go around, too.

345
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,176
This is Thundercrack's Make-A-Wish kid.

346
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,111
Fanboy here thinks he's a big boy now.

347
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:43,689
Yeah, he doesn't know where he belongs.

348
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,190
Sure I do. I don't belong in that trash can.

349
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:46,891
'Cause that's...
I'll smell like human garbage,

350
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:48,850
do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!

351
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,120
Down goes Freeman.

352
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,487
Hey, hey! Look!

353
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:57,125
-Now I'm a superhero.
-Nice!

354
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:01,697
What is this thing doing here?

355
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,098
Janitors.

356
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,242
Get up, man. What are you doin'?

357
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:05,767
Come on.

358
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,078
You're gonna want to get this fixed, huh?

359
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:09,071
Yeah, that's probably why you fell.

360
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:10,739
-Yeah.
-Bye, new girl.

361
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:11,907
Jeez, thanks Mr. Geckle.

362
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,608
Don't sweat it. That trash can

363
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,442
was like a second home to me
when I went here.

364
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:19,081
Hey.

365
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,782
You knew those guys were gonna hit you,

366
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,718
but you stepped in anyway.

367
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:24,886
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

368
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,121
The funnier I am,

369
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:28,890
the more I get punched.

370
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,626
Well, it made me laugh.

371
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:33,795
So...

372
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:39,700
Hero.

373
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:46,040
You gonna walk me to class, or what?

374
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:47,317
Why would I... Walk you to class? No.

375
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:49,643
Why would I wanna do that? Yes!

376
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:50,978
Thanks.

377
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:53,280
So, from the top.

378
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:56,650
What is Thundercrack's Make-A-Wish kid?

379
00:24:56,684 --> 00:25:00,721
Yeah. Um, it's real inside baseball,
but basically,

380
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:03,124
a while ago I happened to have some lunch

381
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,126
in the cafeteria with a few superheroes.

382
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,162
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

383
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:09,697
-That was you?
-Yeah.

384
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,332
And they're still dicks to you?

385
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:12,909
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

386
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,269
doesn't really necessarily make you cool.

387
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:16,771
You seem pretty cool to me.

388
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:20,608
Freddy!

389
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:23,978
Is my name.

390
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,814
Sorry, that was weird and loud.
I'm Freddy,

391
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:28,315
he said in a normal voice.

392
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:29,550
I'm Anne.

393
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:32,819
Anne.

394
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,288
-Nice!
-Bullseye.

395
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:37,023
Hey, you gotta fix that crutch, bro!

396
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:40,026
What?

397
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:19,399
Good, little one.
Well done.

398
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:22,334
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

399
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:41,687
Wow. Um...

400
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,423
I'm flattered that you feel this way.

401
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:47,359
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

402
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:49,761
Romantic setting

403
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:52,164
and fancy champagne, big plates, tiny food.

404
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:53,799
I mean, you went all out.

405
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,902
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

406
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,670
I'm just not sure

407
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,682
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

408
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,175
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

409
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:07,813
I promise this is not about
you. Okay? Look...

410
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:09,781
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

411
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:11,283
You and me.

412
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:14,952
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies.

413
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:18,089
She-zam.

414
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:20,391
I guess I'm just afraid that I'm...

415
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:22,860
gonna let 'em all down. You know?

416
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:25,482
That I'm gonna let you down.

417
00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:32,737
You know what? Screw it. Let's try.

418
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,938
Let's try this crazy thing.

419
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:36,174
Maybe we'll, uh...

420
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,411
seal it with a kiss?

421
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:55,493
Billy Batson!

422
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:57,929
You are a fool of a champion.

423
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:00,031
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

424
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,308
What happened to her beautiful face?

425
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:03,067
Also, aren't you, like, dead-ass dead?

426
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,268
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

427
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:07,270
The daughters of Atlas are coming for you.

428
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:08,471
Daughters of Atlas?

429
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:10,073
They're coming to unmake your world

430
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,043
and torture mankind for all eternity

431
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:15,845
-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay, I feel like maybe

432
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:16,956
I should be writing all this down.

433
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,114
-Quiet!
-Okay, okay.

434
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:20,116
You don't know what you've done.

435
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,152
I regret ever choosing you.

436
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,920
Because of you,

437
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,965
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

438
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:27,424
They will be hunting for you now.

439
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,458
Hunting your family.

440
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:33,029
Hmm?

441
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:35,966
Oh, they're coming. Listen to me, Billy.

442
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:38,335
The fate of your world depends on it.

443
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:40,804
One thing you absolutely must not allow

444
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,039
the daughters of Atlas to do is...

445
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:05,094
Hey, Freddy?

446
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:19,808
Nope, over it. Done it.

447
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,077
Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me?

448
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,813
Armored car heist?

449
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,082
I think I got that in the bag.

450
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,853
Shazam!

451
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,359
Whoo!

452
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:42,164
Bon appetit.

453
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,034
Hi.

454
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,569
-Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
-Hi.

455
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:49,103
Um, you wanna show me

456
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:51,005
where you were sitting when it happened?

457
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,576
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

458
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,444
-Yeah. Follow me.
-Okay, yeah.

459
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:58,880
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

460
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,419
So I was sitting, yeah...

461
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:06,988
Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

462
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:08,256
right there.

463
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,466
-Here?
-Right there, yeah.

464
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:13,161
Oh, sorry. Overbearing brother.

465
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:15,229
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

466
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:16,440
Always has to know where I am.

467
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,899
Right.

468
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,209
I feel that, clearly.

469
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,902
Always thinks she knows better, too.

470
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:22,346
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

471
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,238
Exactly.
And it's not that I don't love her.

472
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,441
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone...

473
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:28,343
Constantly breathing down your neck.

474
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,220
-From the moment you wake up!
-'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

475
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:32,581
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

476
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,391
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

477
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,484
No!

478
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,887
Oh! Billy! What...

479
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,289
What a coinkidink! Um...

480
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,291
I was just telling my friend Anne

481
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:47,194
-what a great guy you are.
-We need to talk.

482
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:48,672
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

483
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:50,531
-He's a great talker.
-Freddy.

484
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,966
-I have to talk to him. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

485
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,903
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

486
00:30:56,937 --> 00:30:58,138
The skin peeled off his face.

487
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:00,040
He turned into a literal pile of ash.

488
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:02,175
-Yeah, seems definitive.
-I dunno.

489
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:05,345
Yeah. Except now he's in my dreams

490
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:06,956
and, Freddy,
he's trying to give me a message.

491
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,559
Could be astral
projection powers.

492
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,984
-What's that?
-Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

493
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,629
-from the great beyond?
-That's it, I'm calling

494
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:14,254
an emergency meeting after school.

495
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:16,289
-I want you there.
-Where else am I gonna go?

496
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:17,592
-What?
-Dude.

497
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:22,162
Okay, first of all, I didn't explode it!

498
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:23,640
All right? It was already like that and,
and, and...

499
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:25,208
What is that, the <i>Tribune?</i>
It's fake news!

500
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:26,634
Freddy, we only have one rule.

501
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,135
All or none.

502
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:29,445
And it's a stupid rule, by the way.

503
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,170
I have a girl talking to me, Billy.

504
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:33,038
A girl. For the first time in my life!

505
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,016
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

506
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,576
but I'll never find out

507
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,053
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

508
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:39,412
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

509
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:42,481
Okay. Mmm.

510
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:44,684
By the way, uh, she has a sister.

511
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:46,285
Total control freak.

512
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,687
I think you guys would get along.

513
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:49,589
Think you'd love her, actually.

514
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:50,956
<i>Look, look, look. Fam,</i>

515
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,391
I know it sounds crazy.

516
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:54,160
And, and obviously I don't know

517
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:56,162
exactly what this all means

518
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,697
but, but he was super aggro

519
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:59,742
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

520
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,367
He was yelling about all this

521
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,978
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

522
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:05,504
Do you have to talk so loud?

523
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,506
Yeah, Mary,
'cause this is not that loud.

524
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,342
I think this is a perfectly
acceptable indoor voice volume.

525
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:11,711
What is the deal? Are you okay?

526
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:14,980
-Yeah.
-Why do you have sunglasses on?

527
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:16,694
Did you go to the eye doctor this morning?

528
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,654
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

529
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:23,488
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

530
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:26,525
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

531
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,494
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

532
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,764
You made friends at the eye doctor?

533
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:33,398
No, she...

534
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,033
Yeah, can we get back on track?

535
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,535
Listen, he's yelling at me

536
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,537
and he's saying the daughters of Atlas

537
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:40,505
are coming to hunt us.

538
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,040
So, check out what I found.

539
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:43,552
"The daughters of Atlas are the offspring

540
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:44,777
of the Titan Atlas..."

541
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,411
which is obvious,

542
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:50,583
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

543
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:53,117
Well, good things
can happen at night.

544
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:54,653
And death.

545
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:56,522
Let me see this.

546
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,563
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

547
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:08,333
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

548
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,301
which gave birth to their realm

549
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:11,670
protected by a...

550
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,772
-dragon."
-Hey, now.

551
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,139
And I am suddenly here for this.

552
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:17,609
I know, right?

553
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,118
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

554
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:20,812
-On the other hand, dragon!
-Dragon!

555
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:22,580
Mary. What are we doin'?

556
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,415
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

557
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:28,085
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

558
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:29,687
and, and, and look,

559
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,557
I often think that you think
better than me.

560
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,326
The wizard did not exactly give
me a tutorial here, guys, okay?

561
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,395
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

562
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:40,464
That, that room of doors, or that violin

563
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:43,200
that is, like, constantly burning
which is super weird but also

564
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,645
definitely keeps the lair cozy, right?

565
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:47,705
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

566
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,173
And it's not like I'm not tryin'.

567
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:52,376
But I really, really need your help.

568
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:57,381
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

569
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:04,488
Shut up. That lights up?

570
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:08,559
Shut up.

571
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,426
So, I'm mapping out the entire lair

572
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:45,194
and you withhold this?

573
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:45,862
And you have really
been holding out on us.

574
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:46,896
Jeez Louise, dude.

575
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,434
-Whoa!
-"Whoa" what?

576
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,169
-"Whoa" what?
-Look!

577
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:54,762
Hey, Steve.

578
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,306
What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

579
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,851
Yeah, I thought he looked like a "Steve."

580
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,795
He totally looks like a "Steve."

581
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:06,311
{\an8}"'Crime and Punishment,
report by Pedro Pena?"

582
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:07,215
Yeah.

583
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,585
Pedro.

584
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,555
-Dude, that's cheating.
-I mean, he knows everything.

585
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,156
-Hmm.
-Seriously. Ask him.

586
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,559
You can just ask him stuff?

587
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,169
-Pretty much.
-Slick. Okay, cool.

588
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:20,730
Steve, we're looking for information

589
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:22,765
about the daughters of Atlas.

590
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,800
Can you please help us with that?

591
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,209
-These are book titles.
-Okay.

592
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:35,621
Let's just all pick a book, or something.

593
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:38,179
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

594
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:39,815
Definitely his thing.

595
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:42,518
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

596
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,558
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

597
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:52,894
Don't lie.
This is where you hang out

598
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:55,362
with your superhero friends, isn't it?

599
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:57,642
No, actually, why would they ever have to...
Why would they ever come here?

600
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,400
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

601
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,335
Do you actually know those guys?

602
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,438
Or is this like a "Canadian
girlfriend" situation?

603
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:05,683
Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

604
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,408
aren't really exclusive, as of now.

605
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:11,945
Do you wanna meet one of them?

606
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,682
Meet, like how?

607
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,215
Like, face-to-face, right now.

608
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,619
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

609
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:18,887
And today is your lucky day,

610
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,855
because I'm gonna call the hot one.

611
00:36:21,756 --> 00:36:23,323
Her?

612
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:24,793
-No, the male hot one.
-Him?

613
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,696
What? Him?

614
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:29,607
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

615
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:31,700
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

616
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,568
so... It's no big deal.

617
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,570
Is this a joke, Freddy?

618
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:38,405
'Cause I didn't mean to make
you actually prove it, really.

619
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,577
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

620
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,421
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

621
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:48,549
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

622
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,584
Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

623
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:53,419
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

624
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:54,597
Remember that time I saved your life?

625
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:55,723
No, no, no, the other time.

626
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,323
Yeah.

627
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:59,693
Well, I'm calling in that favor.

628
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,369
You must be Anne.

629
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:13,006
Oh, my God.

630
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:16,043
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

631
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:18,946
I am, actually. Yeah. How are you...

632
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:24,885
You know,
I may be the one with the superpowers,

633
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:26,019
but that kid,

634
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:27,654
he's the real hero.

635
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,757
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

636
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,491
I've never met anyone like him.

637
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:33,793
He's... genuine

638
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:36,596
and warm and funny.

639
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,330
-That's a lot of nice things.
-Yeah.

640
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,567
How did you two meet?

641
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:42,702
Comic Con.

642
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:44,704
-What's Comic Con?
-What?

643
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:45,981
<i>According to this,</i>

644
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:48,440
gods considered humans servants,

645
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:50,375
toys to be played with,

646
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:51,744
children to be punished.

647
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:55,447
Thanks, Steve.

648
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,884
Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

649
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,585
I'm reading about that right now.

650
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,319
So, apparently, all of this

651
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:03,421
revolves around a powerful weapon.

652
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,423
So Atlas, uh, the father

653
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,660
of the daughters of Atlas, obviously, yeah,

654
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:09,562
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

655
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:12,098
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

656
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:15,034
but also to take powers away
from others.

657
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:18,671
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

658
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:22,542
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

659
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:24,042
But when things got bad,

660
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:27,045
a council of human wizards
got together and they

661
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,580
stole the staff from Atlas.

662
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:30,447
And they used that to take
his powers away.

663
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,859
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

664
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:33,460
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

665
00:38:33,484 --> 00:38:35,386
this is the wizard that I know!

666
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:36,555
What do these say?

667
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:43,494
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

668
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:45,072
Strength of Hercules, Stamina of Atlas,

669
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:46,798
{\an8}Power of Zeus, Courage of Achilles,

670
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:47,636
{\an8}Speed of Mercury."

671
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,100
These are the powers they stole.

672
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:51,536
No.

673
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:54,639
Whoa, guys, look!

674
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:56,141
This is what the name means.

675
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:57,752
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

676
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:59,744
which is just a bunch of hot garbage, so.

677
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:01,536
If I may point out one of the powers

678
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,914
{\an8}that may be possibly MIA.

679
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:04,549
{\an8}Boop.

680
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,650
{\an8}I'm sorry,

681
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:07,552
are you very unsubtly implying

682
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:10,121
that I somehow lack the wisdom of

683
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:12,023
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

684
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:14,825
Well, maybe it comes later.

685
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,827
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

686
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:17,895
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

687
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:19,395
This is very, very hurtful.

688
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,574
I just want you all to know that.

689
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:21,966
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

690
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,534
Oh.

691
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,135
What else have we learned, fam?

692
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:29,707
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

693
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,011
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

694
00:39:34,044 --> 00:39:36,113
magical sphere

695
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:38,015
sealing it away forever.

696
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:40,416
Cut off from magic.

697
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,519
Oh, so that's what that was about.

698
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:45,656
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

699
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,927
{\an8}<i>A bizarre and gruesome scene unfolded</i>

700
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,762
{\an8}<i>in Athens, Greece this morning.</i>

701
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:53,840
{\an8}<i>Two women dressed in what
appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

702
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:55,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's the
wizard's staff. How did they get that?

703
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,768
So, all those statues used to be people.

704
00:39:57,801 --> 00:40:01,772
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

705
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:02,907
where Greece is at?

706
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:08,044
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

707
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:09,112
You want it back?

708
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:15,084
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

709
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:17,553
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

710
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:18,721
-You know?
-What?

711
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:20,089
What do you mean, "What?" What?

712
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:21,800
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

713
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:23,927
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

714
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,728
You're welcome, by the way.

715
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,006
And then I had to break
it in half so Sivana didn't do

716
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,065
super bad-guy stuff with it, okay?

717
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:30,733
You broke the staff,

718
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,669
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

719
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:33,903
Which we now know.

720
00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:35,872
We also now know what they look like,

721
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,716
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

722
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,775
-coming a...
-Three.

723
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:39,809
What?

724
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:43,478
{\an8}Atlas had three daughters.

725
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:45,782
Kalypso, Hespera,

726
00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:47,650
Anthea.

727
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:50,086
Anne... thea.

728
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:55,191
You know, I'm not just a superhero.

729
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,627
I'm a super listener.

730
00:40:58,627 --> 00:40:59,928
And...

731
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:01,096
I sense...

732
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:05,033
that you may have feelings for Freddy.

733
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:06,969
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

734
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,604
Don't want him to get hurt.

735
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:12,641
Oh, well, Anne...
I mean, we can't choose

736
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:14,242
the people we fall for.

737
00:41:14,276 --> 00:41:15,944
What?

738
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:17,713
I'm not talking about that.

739
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:20,582
If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.

740
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:22,684
Whoa! Look who you're with.

741
00:41:22,718 --> 00:41:24,219
What could possibly be dangerous?

742
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:25,253
Us.

743
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:29,191
Okay.

744
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:30,926
I see how it is.

745
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,960
Let's dance.

746
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:36,631
Oh, my God.

747
00:41:36,665 --> 00:41:37,666
Freddy?

748
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,201
Ow!

749
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,836
Oh, Freddy, I, I didn't know.

750
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,237
I never meant for you to get hurt.

751
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,172
Oh, I'm not the one who's gonna get hurt.

752
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:46,008
Shazam!

753
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:48,710
Shazam!

754
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,845
Shazam.

755
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,913
-What's going on up here?
-Mis...

756
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:54,715
Freddy, are you all right?

757
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:55,716
Get back inside.
Just get back inside, Mr. Geckle.

758
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,918
I'm okay. Go back inside.

759
00:41:57,952 --> 00:41:59,320
Who are you?
Do you have kids here?

760
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:00,821
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

761
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:03,524
I won't touch him.
You have my word.

762
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,169
Mr. G. Wha...

763
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,642
What did she say?
What are you doing?

764
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,074
What are you doing?

765
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,842
What are you-- no, no, no!

766
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:23,020
Stop, stop, stop!
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no, no!

767
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:26,614
Wait, no, no, no!

768
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,019
I forgot how easily they burst.

769
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:33,187
Why would you do that?

770
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:35,189
Like grapes.

771
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,294
What the... Huh?

772
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:55,708
Now, child, tell us where
to find the others.

773
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,277
No need.

774
00:43:02,715 --> 00:43:04,117
Clip his wings, Anthea.

775
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:33,879
Ow.

776
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:40,719
Wait.

777
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:43,789
There are more.

778
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:52,731
-Perfect. We take them all.
-No.

779
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,233
That's not why we're here.

780
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:56,401
We're here for the seed of life.
Yield, sister.

781
00:43:56,435 --> 00:43:58,270
We stick to the plan we have.

782
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,404
Father would never yield.

783
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:01,073
And Father is dead.

784
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,809
Now, you know your place, sister.

785
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,344
Or I will show it to you.

786
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,815
We do this our way, not theirs.

787
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:19,358
Make one move...

788
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,763
...and I will snap this child's neck.

789
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,760
Oh, Freddy.

790
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,768
Billy, no!

791
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,213
Billy, stay back!

792
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,957
They're using the staff to take our powers.

793
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:53,149
What? What?

794
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:09,865
Sorry!

795
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:13,836
I'm sorry,

796
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,247
I'm sorry, just, just save yourself.

797
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:17,940
No, no, all or none. We stick together.

798
00:46:17,973 --> 00:46:20,876
And that you will
because you cannot leave.

799
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:24,246
Let's see how you like being
sealed off in a dying world.

800
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,982
No!

801
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:28,117
No!

802
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,151
Freddy!

803
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:39,266
<i>From City Line Avenue in the north</i>

804
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:41,297
<i>to the western shore of the
Schuylkill River</i>

805
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,599
<i>to Cobbs Creek.</i>

806
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:44,534
<i>The unidentified barrier appears</i>

807
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,235
<i>to be in the shape of a dome</i>

808
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:49,338
<i>with no one allowed into

809

810
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:58,247
<i>may be the doing, or undoing,
of the Philadelphia Fiascoes.</i>

811
00:47:17,231 --> 00:47:18,534
-Holy sh...
-Shh!

00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:22,170
I'm trying to sleep.

813
00:47:22,203 --> 00:47:24,506
It is the only escape from the
tortures here.

814
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,874
Okay. Bleak.

815
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:30,244
Wait a second.

816
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:32,447
Hagrid beard, Batman voice.

817
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,149
You're the wizard.
You're the wizard! Oh, my...

818
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:36,561
You're back! Billy told me all about you.

819
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,886
Billy? You know Billy Batson?

820
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,364
Billy Batson.
Yeah, he's my best friend.

821
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,323
I'm... I'm Freddy Freeman,
Captain Everypower.

822
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,258
Well, used to be.
It's complicated now.

823
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:45,960
She... It's complicated.

824
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:48,396
That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of Shazam?

825
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:51,465
Yeah, he did. And he said that
you turned into ash, but, but didn't?

826
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:54,935
Once I gave him the power,

827
00:47:54,968 --> 00:47:57,538
I could no longer remain in my realm.

828
00:47:57,572 --> 00:47:59,306
But death would have been a luxury

829
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,308
compared to being trapped in this cell

830
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:03,678
with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

831
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:05,178
Mostly with you.

832
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:06,356
A little more sarcastic than Billy said,

833
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,215
but, hey, all good.

834
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:10,360
-Let's just get out of here.
-"Let's just get out of here."

835
00:48:10,384 --> 00:48:11,586
Yeah, sure.

836
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:13,387
I sound nothing like that, but okay.

837
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,921
Here's what we've got, um...

838
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,290
A cranky wizard with a cynical streak

839
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:20,236
and a precocious young man with an
encyclopedic knowledge regarding magical shit.

840
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,264
There is no way these sisters
are keeping us in here.

841
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:26,133
These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!

842
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:29,269
-What spells do you know?
-Please, stop talking.

843
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:30,437
How about an arcane focus?

844
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,139
I don't even know what that is.

845
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:35,208
Fine, then let's make a potion.

846
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:37,377
Like a potion of, um,
giant strength or diminution.

847
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:39,179
Oh! Gaseous form!

848
00:48:39,212 --> 00:48:41,616
Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

849
00:48:41,649 --> 00:48:45,151
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

850
00:48:46,185 --> 00:48:47,987
We will die here, Freeby.

851
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,956
It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...

852
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,358
The sooner you accept it,

853
00:48:53,259 --> 00:48:54,460
the easier it will be.

854
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:57,163
Is this a tooth?
There's a tooth in here!

855
00:48:57,697 --> 00:48:58,732
Hmm.

856
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:10,309
{\an8}"Power of elements.
Power of chaos.

857
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:12,445
Power of axis."

858
00:49:12,478 --> 00:49:14,113
These are primordial forces.

859
00:49:14,146 --> 00:49:16,048
I don't know how we fight
powers like this.

860
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,983
I tell you how we fight it.

861
00:49:18,017 --> 00:49:19,418
With the wisdom of...

862
00:49:20,286 --> 00:49:22,556
-Solomon.
-Exactly.

863
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,457
We, we set up a meeting.

864
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,026
Yeah, we tell 'em we want to negotiate.

865
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:29,195
Offer up our powers for Freddy.

866
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:31,130
But then we grab one of them

867
00:49:31,163 --> 00:49:32,998
and that's what we really use to trade!

868
00:49:33,032 --> 00:49:34,500
But what if they steal our powers?

869
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:36,669
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

870
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:39,346
You know what I mean? If they
just point that staff at us, we dodge.

871
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,073
Like dodgeball.

872
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:44,275
-Hmm.
-Dude, I suck at dodgeball.

873
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:46,311
Well, maybe Pedro sucks at dodgeball,

874
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:47,680
but not Super Pedro.

875
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:50,081
No, Super Pedro also sucks at dodgeball.

876
00:49:50,114 --> 00:49:53,117
Fine. Listen, all I know is that
there's five of us and three of them.

877
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,420
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

878
00:49:57,823 --> 00:49:59,123
Okay.

879
00:49:59,157 --> 00:50:01,192
So, Steve says that this paper

880
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:03,361
is a stack of magical parchment.

881
00:50:03,394 --> 00:50:05,330
You write a message on the magical paper

882
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:08,333
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

883
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:10,803
and then the paper folds into a...

884
00:50:10,836 --> 00:50:13,371
Oh, my God, yes!

885
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,241
A paper bird.

886
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:17,776
And it flies to the god.

887
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,678
Well, that's kinda cute.

888
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:23,782
Hey, what about demigods?
Uh, you know, like, Wonder Woman?

889
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:26,216
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

890
00:50:28,352 --> 00:50:29,486
Did the pen just shrug?

891
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,590
Hey, Steve, do I just dictate to...

892
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:35,693
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

893
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:37,060
All right.

894
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:40,297
Letter...

895
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,268
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

896
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,803
I was just talking out loud.

897
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:47,797
That's not a part of the letter.
Wad that up, too.

898
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:50,542
Maybe if you try

899
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:52,644
-speaking from the heart.
-Hmm.

900
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,546
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

901
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:57,682
violence is not the answer."

902
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,304
Child,

903
00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:23,372
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

904
00:51:23,406 --> 00:51:24,775
Honesty.

905
00:51:24,808 --> 00:51:28,512
Yeah, wow, very, um, ironic subject choice.

906
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:30,614
The other Champions...

907
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:33,149
are they children like yourself?

908
00:51:33,182 --> 00:51:34,851
What even is a child?

909
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:37,721
I mean, I know I shave, like,
every week-ish.

910
00:51:37,754 --> 00:51:39,488
Yes or no?

911
00:51:39,523 --> 00:51:41,658
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

912
00:51:41,692 --> 00:51:45,328
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

913
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:48,732
-Give us their names.
-The names of the Champions?

914
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:52,903
Um, well, there's Brett Breyer,
and, uh, Burke Breyer.

915
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:54,437
Are you guys taking this stuff in?

916
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,839
Writing this down? No?

917
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:57,239
They drive a Dodge Ram.

918
00:51:57,273 --> 00:51:58,441
He's lying.

919
00:51:58,474 --> 00:52:00,877
That's your superpower, not mine.

920
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,713
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

921
00:52:03,814 --> 00:52:04,915
One of you.

922
00:52:04,948 --> 00:52:06,215
Probably you.

923
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,417
Hold him.

924
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,723
Don't...
What's happening?

925
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,190
What is that? What's she doing?

926
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:16,626
Power of chaos.

927
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:19,160
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

928
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:21,697
Oh.
My mind is already trash,

929
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:24,165
so I'd actually like to see you try.

930
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:26,334
Because nobody has the balls

931
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:28,470
to handle what's inside my brain.

932
00:52:28,504 --> 00:52:30,673
Say their names.

933
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,814
Say their names.

934
00:52:38,848 --> 00:52:41,717
<i>Say their names.
Say their names.</i>

935
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:48,724
Destiny's Child did it better.

936
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,258
He is stronger than he looks.

937
00:52:52,427 --> 00:52:54,295
-Say their names.
-Stop!

938
00:52:56,766 --> 00:52:57,867
Billy...

939
00:53:01,402 --> 00:53:02,837
Billy Bats...

940
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:08,242
Billy B...

941
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:09,678
Stop.

942
00:53:12,446 --> 00:53:13,815
This is from the Champions.

943
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:17,284
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

944
00:53:17,317 --> 00:53:19,688
violence is not the answer.

945
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:23,490
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

946
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:25,292
-We'd like to make a trade.
-What?

947
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:26,761
We'll give up our powers

948
00:53:26,795 --> 00:53:30,230
if you give us Freddy, add 'unharmed.'

949
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:33,300
Otherwise, they're gonna monkey's-paw you.

950
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,669
Smart, Eugene.

951
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:36,971
Steve, add 'unharmed'

952
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,473
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

953
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,309
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

954
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:45,279
Maybe just signed 'The Champions.'

955
00:53:45,312 --> 00:53:46,881
Should we proofread it?

956
00:53:46,915 --> 00:53:49,283
Naw, Steve doesn't make mistakes,

957
00:53:49,316 --> 00:53:50,652
just writes what you say.

958
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,021
Great. I feel good about this. Me, too.

959
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:56,990
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

960
00:53:57,024 --> 00:53:58,424
Do we have red?"

961
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,929
What is this Gatorade?

962
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:06,767
-Is it a weapon?
-Sister.

963
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,770
We need not torture him any longer.
You heard the letter.

964
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:13,406
-Throw them in the pit.
-Wait.

965
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:15,843
They want to make a trade.

966
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:20,047
And we will meet, sister.

967
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,849
But humans are not to be trusted.

968
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:25,586
The pit is just
a bad name for a fun place, right?

969
00:54:26,486 --> 00:54:28,387
Right?

970
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:48,040
Are you hurt?

971
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:50,710
No, just worthless.

972
00:54:50,743 --> 00:54:53,311
-Well, you must get up.
-For what?

973
00:54:53,345 --> 00:54:57,016
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

974
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:59,018
a way for me to pretend I'm not broken.

975
00:54:59,051 --> 00:55:00,853
Oh, feelings.

976
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:18,370
-I see something moving.
-Yeah, I see it, too.

977
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:35,954
Oh, shit.

978
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:38,523
What is that?

979
00:55:38,557 --> 00:55:39,825
Ladon.

980
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:42,060
The guardian of the Garden of Atlas.

981
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:54,539
-Run.
-I can't. I can't!

982
00:56:12,724 --> 00:56:14,759
You're okay! You're okay.

983
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:16,528
I don't feel okay at all.

984
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:18,997
That's the power of the dragon.

985
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,398
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

986
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,702
Ladon's fear paralyzes any mortal,

987
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:25,904
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

988
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:29,640
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

989
00:56:29,673 --> 00:56:31,575
-very rare.
-Anthea!

990
00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:33,611
I must go.

991
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:36,580
The door back to your world
is at the center of the labyrinth.

992
00:56:36,614 --> 00:56:38,448
Right, left, left

993
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:40,918
and then follow the
right-hand wall to the center.

994
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:42,753
-You'll need this.
-How did you find this?

995
00:56:42,786 --> 00:56:44,454
You once protected me from the bullies

996
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:46,557
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

997
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,830
Now I've protected you in mine.

998
00:56:52,897 --> 00:56:55,132
Hero.

999
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:58,468
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

1000
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,004
I was about to rearrange those boys'

1001
00:57:00,037 --> 00:57:01,705
internal organs when you stepped in.

1002
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:04,440
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1003
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:07,177
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1004
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:10,915
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1005
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:15,653
How lovely for both of you.

1006
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,954
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get...

1007
00:57:17,987 --> 00:57:20,790
You should go.
My sisters don't need you anymore.

1008
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:22,424
All they require now is the seed.

1009
00:57:23,226 --> 00:57:25,495
-The seed?
-Yes.

1010
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:27,206
Which remains hidden in a place
unreachable

1011
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,232
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

1012
00:57:29,265 --> 00:57:31,834
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1013
00:57:45,114 --> 00:57:46,983
Hi, God... No?

1014
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:52,188
Yo, Low Voltage.

1015
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:55,925
When you fixing this dome shit, man?

1016
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:57,527
Oh, no, no, no, don't worry, sir.

1017
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,828
I have a plan.

1018
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:00,229
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1019
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:02,031
'Cause look like all you got is a sandwich.

1020
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:03,499
No, these sandwiches?

1021
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:04,643
No, these sandwiches are important.

1022
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:06,035
They're, they're for a meeting.

1023
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:09,504
Yeah, sure, Colonel Cheesesteak.

1024
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:11,006
Colonel?

1025
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,909
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

1026
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,915
Quiet one, she is.

1027
00:58:19,948 --> 00:58:22,617
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1028
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,721
Is that...

1029
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:27,622
Oh, you're totally serious. Okay.

1030
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:29,191
Uh...

1031
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:32,094
Right, so, look,
here's the thing, um, you're upset.

1032
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:33,962
A bunch of wizards
came and stole your powers,

1033
00:58:33,996 --> 00:58:36,264
which totally sucks balls, I totally get it.

1034
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:39,234
But, I kind of feel like you're taking this all,

1035
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:42,270
like, really personally and, like,
I don't even know you, lady, right?

1036
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:44,873
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1037
00:58:44,906 --> 00:58:47,009
and stole all your coin and then fled,

1038
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:49,511
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1039
00:58:50,846 --> 00:58:52,547
And say, in this pursuit the thieves

1040
00:58:52,581 --> 00:58:53,949
dropped the money on the ground

1041
00:58:53,982 --> 00:58:56,618
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1042
00:58:57,753 --> 00:59:00,621
Now, imagine it is not money,

1043
00:59:00,654 --> 00:59:02,857
but the lifeblood of your father.

1044
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,925
The last breath of your mother.

1045
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:07,261
The power of all the gods,

1046
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,698
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1047
00:59:10,731 --> 00:59:13,234
And now this magic courses through you,

1048
00:59:13,267 --> 00:59:15,136
and you have the gall

1049
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:17,772
to believe that you deserve it?

1050
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,176
This is very personal,

1051
00:59:23,377 --> 00:59:24,578
Billy.

1052
00:59:27,281 --> 00:59:29,350
You are very menacing.

1053
00:59:29,383 --> 00:59:31,786
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1054
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:35,356
I see the presence that you
have, and that goes a long way.

1055
00:59:35,389 --> 00:59:39,026
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1056
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,995
There is no compromise.

1057
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:42,997
I knew you were gonna say that.

1058
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,299
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1059
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,968
Give us back Freddy, you take down this

1060
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:51,172
sphere-y dome-y magic bowl thing

1061
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:52,872
and then, you know,

1062
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:54,617
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1063
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:55,842
It's a good offer.

1064
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,010
I'm being serious.

1065
00:59:57,043 --> 00:59:59,746
You play the part of a man,

1066
00:59:59,779 --> 01:00:02,115
but you do not play it well.

1067
01:00:02,148 --> 01:00:04,584
Give us the powers, child.

1068
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:06,953
All of them.

1069
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:08,822
You are no leader, Billy.

1070
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:11,758
You are a lost boy

1071
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:14,994
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1072
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,197
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1073
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,232
'cause I'm not, like, super old like you,

1074
01:00:19,265 --> 01:00:22,669
but I think I have a few
experiences that you don't have.

1075
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,939
'Cause I've seen all of the
<i>Fast and the Furious</i> movies, lady.

1076
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,674
And let me tell you something.

1077
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,777
It's all about family!

1078
01:00:36,116 --> 01:00:38,284
Family!

1079
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:41,654
Guys, that was the signal.
We practiced this, like, 12 times. Thank you.

1080
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:43,723
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?

1081
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:47,893
No, human. You forgot about mine.

1082
01:00:58,303 --> 01:00:59,338
Come on!

1083
01:00:59,371 --> 01:01:00,405
-Let's go.
-Pedro!

1084
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,809
You're wasting my time, boy.

1085
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:18,983
Yeah.

1086
01:02:19,016 --> 01:02:20,218
Whoo!

1087
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:21,986
She sure didn't see that coming

1088
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:25,957
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor.

1089
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,791
Uh, Darla, that was, 'cause...

1090
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:30,227
A euphemism. That was a euphemism.

1091
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,135
No!

1092
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:53,326
We've taken the power from two

1093
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,218
in your family already.

1094
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:57,887
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1095
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,323
So you can keep playing soldier?

1096
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:39,028
My father was Atlas.

1097
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:41,964
Titan god of stamina and strength.

1098
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:47,336
His magic and power
may course through you,

1099
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:50,839
but you will never be a true god.

1100
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:52,875
Oh, yeah?
Did your dad have superspeed?

1101
01:03:57,146 --> 01:03:59,448
Nope!

1102
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:07,856
You okay? That was fun. Let's go.

1103
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,828
Come on. Come on, come on.

1104
01:04:16,397 --> 01:04:18,032
Hurry, everyone!

1105
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:19,067
Let's go, let's go.

1106
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,612
What?

1107
01:04:32,548 --> 01:04:34,082
You thought you were just goin'

1108
01:04:34,115 --> 01:04:35,460
into some regular porta-potty, didn't ya?

1109
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:37,653
Which I can somehow still smell.

1110
01:04:37,686 --> 01:04:39,987
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks around.
It's crazy, right?

1111
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:41,155
-Yeah.
-Like, permeates

1112
01:04:41,189 --> 01:04:42,658
the air. Doesn't matter. Anyway,

1113
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:44,225
welcome to the Rock of Eternity.

1114
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,461
Only Champions

1115
01:04:46,495 --> 01:04:49,030
{\an8}can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1116
01:04:49,063 --> 01:04:51,667
Little thing that
we can do that your sisters can't.

1117
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,335
Guys, that's what I call a total success.

1118
01:04:55,671 --> 01:04:57,673
Okay, maybe, like, a partial total win.

1119
01:04:57,706 --> 01:04:59,608
-Told you I suck at dodgeball.
-Yeah,

1120
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:01,209
you do, yeah, but you know,

1121
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:02,519
look, Pedro, we all have our weak spots.

1122
01:05:02,543 --> 01:05:04,010
You know what I mean?

1123
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:05,580
{\an8}And hers...

1124
01:05:05,613 --> 01:05:07,280
{\an8}lack of strategic thinking.

1125
01:05:07,314 --> 01:05:09,249
Now for the real trade.

1126
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:12,587
Freddy and the staff, for your freedom.

1127
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,163
And get rid of the dome.

1128
01:05:14,187 --> 01:05:15,288
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:17,457
And get rid of the dome.

1130
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:19,159
'Cause the city of brotherly love

1131
01:05:19,192 --> 01:05:20,360
is gettin' a little moist.

1132
01:05:22,697 --> 01:05:24,231
Word choice, man.

1133
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:25,308
{\an8}Yeah, I regretted it as soon as

1134
01:05:25,332 --> 01:05:27,067
{\an8}it was coming out of my mouth.

1135
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,068
{\an8}It's just one of those words...

1136
01:05:28,101 --> 01:05:29,101
I know. I just...

1137
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:36,076
"Dear daughters of Asshat-Las."

1138
01:05:36,109 --> 01:05:37,678
Burn!

1139
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,146
I just came up with that.

1140
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:40,356
Make sure you put a dash in there, though,

1141
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,315
so it's really clear. Okay.

1142
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:44,661
{\an8}Man, it's so good
having Steve cover grammar

1143
01:05:44,685 --> 01:05:47,087
and spelling and stuff, it makes
me sound so much smarter.

1144
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:49,956
So...

1145
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,992
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1146
01:05:52,025 --> 01:05:53,560
How's that feel?

1147
01:05:53,593 --> 01:05:56,462
Also, how are you actually sisters,

1148
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:59,298
because the age difference
is very noticeable,

1149
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,536
and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1150
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:05,070
Even though I don't like you very much,

1151
01:06:05,104 --> 01:06:07,039
I believe everyone deserves human rights,

1152
01:06:07,072 --> 01:06:08,675
but you don't deserve strawberry.

1153
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,611
You only get yellow.

1154
01:06:14,113 --> 01:06:15,114
She's gone!

1155
01:06:16,683 --> 01:06:17,751
Wait, what?

1156
01:06:28,662 --> 01:06:30,530
I thought we brought her in too easily.

1157
01:06:30,564 --> 01:06:32,599
She wanted to get caught.

1158
01:06:32,632 --> 01:06:36,168
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1159
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,646
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1160
01:06:54,285 --> 01:06:57,121
Yep. We are so lost. Thanks, bozo.

1161
01:06:57,155 --> 01:07:00,258
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1162
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,760
I don't know.

1163
01:07:01,794 --> 01:07:04,262
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1164
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:06,297
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1165
01:07:09,768 --> 01:07:11,069
You're the wizard.

1166
01:07:11,102 --> 01:07:13,271
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

1167
01:07:13,304 --> 01:07:16,074
Now let's see if that girlfriend
of yours can be trusted.

1168
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:33,492
Get back, get back. Get back.

1169
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:03,363
Okay, I think the
coast is clear. Let's go home.

1170
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:04,689
One moment.

1171
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:07,224
Did you not see what she was holding?

1172
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:08,826
It was an apple. She wanted a snack.

1173
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,327
What's the big deal?

1174
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,598
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1175
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,465
From the Tree of Life.

1176
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,781
Oh, wait, hold up,
didn't you say that was somewhere safe?

1177
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:22,205
-Billy!
-Billy. Gosh.

1178
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:25,743
Where are you going now?

1179
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:35,652
Nope.

1180
01:08:35,686 --> 01:08:36,687
She's not in there.

1181
01:08:37,754 --> 01:08:39,155
Nope.

1182
01:08:39,188 --> 01:08:40,724
No, no, no. That's a hard pass.

1183
01:08:40,757 --> 01:08:42,759
-That's a hard pass.
-Yo, Billy,

1184
01:08:42,793 --> 01:08:44,393
you don't gotta worry about that one.

1185
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:46,171
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1186
01:08:46,195 --> 01:08:47,764
Like an ancient Greek

1187
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:48,878
-labyrinth?
-Guys...

1188
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:52,268
porta-potty.

1189
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:53,870
Mmm.

1190
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,347
Hespera.

1191
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:12,355
It's over, sisters.

1192
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:14,825
Now we can plant
the seed and restore our realm.

1193
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:19,629
Or we plant it in their realm.

1194
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:23,164
But that would destroy their world.

1195
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,467
Just as they destroyed ours.

1196
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:27,637
You can't be serious.

1197
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,538
-Yes.
-No.

1198
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:31,172
No, that's not what we agreed to.

1199
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:32,775
Anthea, you simpering bore.

1200
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:34,477
She's right, we've spent ages

1201
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,911
waiting for this moment.

1202
01:09:35,945 --> 01:09:37,445
We have the seed.

1203
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,414
We have the staff and its powers.

1204
01:09:39,447 --> 01:09:40,792
We are not squandering it

1205
01:09:40,816 --> 01:09:42,685
for your personal satisfaction.

1206
01:09:42,718 --> 01:09:45,721
No, I should go, not you.

1207
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:47,757
Look, I know what you're thinking.

1208
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,191
The kid with the crutch doesn't
exactly sing "sneak thief."

1209
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:52,537
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy when you walk.

1210
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:53,796
It's pathetic.

1211
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:54,897
See?

1212
01:09:55,965 --> 01:09:57,500
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1213
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:59,635
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1214
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:03,304
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1215
01:10:03,338 --> 01:10:06,676
That's it. You nailed it.

1216
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:08,376
I'll see you on the other side.

1217
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:11,321
Even if we did, the Tree of Life

1218
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:12,914
would not thrive in their soil.

1219
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:16,250
It would despoil,
it would disfigure into something...

1220
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:17,585
Monstrous?

1221
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:19,954
That is what humans are.

1222
01:10:19,988 --> 01:10:22,957
It is only fitting that we bring
our monsters to their world

1223
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,593
and do to them as they did to us.

1224
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:30,832
We agreed to restore balance

1225
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:34,468
and vengeance has great
measure of weight on those scales.

1226
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:37,539
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1227
01:10:37,572 --> 01:10:39,507
-No, not all.
-All.

1228
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:42,944
Sister, I fear your
rage has gotten the better of you.

1229
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:44,344
Why?

1230
01:10:44,378 --> 01:10:46,681
Humans wreak havoc and devastation,

1231
01:10:46,715 --> 01:10:48,850
then pray to the gods to absolve them.

1232
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:51,351
They actually pray for order and peace

1233
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:54,522
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1234
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:56,758
Anthea, I want you to take the apple

1235
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,893
and plant it in our garden.

1236
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:01,772
Of course you turn to her.

1237
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:03,564
Father would be ashamed of both of you.

1238
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:07,300
Where did that even come from?

1239
01:11:08,802 --> 01:11:10,738
-Hi!
-You favor her, Hespera,

1240
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:12,473
and see how she betrays us.

1241
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:17,644
Deliver him to his proper fate, sister.

1242
01:11:17,678 --> 01:11:19,813
-No!
-Kill him!

1243
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:24,985
What is that?

1244
01:11:25,018 --> 01:11:26,887
Great question. No idea.

1245
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:29,623
But made you look.

1246
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:30,824
Billy!

1247
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:34,460
-Oh!
-Oh.

1248
01:11:34,495 --> 01:11:36,295
Your crutch!

1249
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:39,298
Oh! Shazam!

1250
01:11:39,332 --> 01:11:40,333
-Yes!
-No!

1251
01:11:44,403 --> 01:11:46,305
So, we have a lot to talk about.

1252
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:58,618
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1253
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,021
You are not fit to wield it.

1254
01:12:02,054 --> 01:12:03,556
More fit than you.

1255
01:12:03,589 --> 01:12:05,323
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1256
01:12:05,357 --> 01:12:08,661
Our sole purpose is to avenge our father,

1257
01:12:08,694 --> 01:12:10,763
but everyone here has become weak.

1258
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:14,000
Ladon, world-eater,

1259
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:17,503
rise from the pit!

1260
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:27,880
Go, go, go!

1261
01:12:27,914 --> 01:12:29,357
Captain Everypower!
Where's he going?

1262
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:30,650
What the...

1263
01:12:46,131 --> 01:12:47,331
Victor?

1264
01:12:47,966 --> 01:12:49,466
Victor, wake up.

1265
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:52,704
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1266
01:12:52,737 --> 01:12:54,405
Dad. We gotta go!

1267
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:56,541
-We gotta get out of here.
-We have to go right now!

1268
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,777
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1269
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,588
That's not true.
I have no idea what this looks like.

1270
01:13:00,612 --> 01:13:02,379
Just don't freak out.

1271
01:13:07,485 --> 01:13:08,963
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1272
01:13:08,987 --> 01:13:10,722
Rosa, it's Billy, okay? And that's Eugene,

1273
01:13:10,755 --> 01:13:11,990
-and that's Freddy...
-It's me.

1274
01:13:12,023 --> 01:13:13,457
That's Darla and that's Mary, obvi,

1275
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:14,893
and then Pedro, just normal Pedro.

1276
01:13:16,928 --> 01:13:18,072
Guys, this is no time for secrets, okay?

1277
01:13:18,096 --> 01:13:20,498
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1278
01:13:20,532 --> 01:13:22,868
-We're superheroes.
-I'm gay.

1279
01:13:22,901 --> 01:13:23,935
Yeah, we know, bud.

1280
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:26,605
-You knew?
-Yeah.

1281
01:13:27,672 --> 01:13:29,841
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1282
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:31,743
-I'm the wizard.
-Oh, this is the wizard.

1283
01:13:31,776 --> 01:13:33,410
He's a wizard who's called "the wizard."

1284
01:13:33,444 --> 01:13:35,056
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1285
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,123
Put on these clothes.

1286
01:13:36,147 --> 01:13:37,781
This is so weird.

1287
01:13:37,815 --> 01:13:39,016
Yep, yep.

1288
01:13:39,049 --> 01:13:41,752
You guys are the Philly Fiascoes?

1289
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:45,055
Okay. This is in no way an
acknowledgement of that stupid nickname

1290
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:47,133
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1291
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:49,159
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1292
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,695
Dragon?

1293
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:29,975
You okay?

1294
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,000
Okay.

1295
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,903
I know this is a lot to take in,

1296
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:35,905
but I promise to explain it all later.

1297
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:37,740
Explain what?

1298
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,518
That our kids are
superheroes being hunted by Greek gods

1299
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,086
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1300
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,479
-Yeah.
-Wait, you bought the house?

1301
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:44,747
Yeah.

1302
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,056
Run! Go!

1303
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:02,799
Oh, no.

1304
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:06,736
Get down.

1305
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,171
Okay, that's it!

1306
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,109
Again?

1307
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:15,044
Freddy!

1308
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,615
Hey, hey!
This is what you want, right?

1309
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,598
Come on, we're good.

1310
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:38,231
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

1311
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:04,593
Mary!

1312
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,629
No.

1313
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:48,969
Hey. Are you okay?

1314
01:16:49,737 --> 01:16:50,738
You okay?

1315
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:53,140
All right.

1316
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:56,811
Now, where is this dragon?

1317
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:26,206
Fitting place for a garden.

1318
01:19:47,911 --> 01:19:49,312
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1319
01:20:01,925 --> 01:20:03,159
Go! Let's go, let's go!

1320
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:10,800
Oh, God, I'm slipping! Slipping!

1321
01:20:13,036 --> 01:20:14,938
My shoe!

1322
01:20:34,123 --> 01:20:36,158
Holy moly.

1323
01:20:55,978 --> 01:20:58,414
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1324
01:20:58,447 --> 01:21:01,083
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1325
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,921
Your world will not survive this.

1326
01:21:05,954 --> 01:21:07,156
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1327
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:08,223
He's right.

1328
01:21:09,358 --> 01:21:11,026
Anne!

1329
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,496
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-I'm okay, I'm fine.

1330
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:16,332
In the God Realm, this tree...

1331
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:19,602
is a thing of beauty.

1332
01:21:19,636 --> 01:21:21,402
Of peace.

1333
01:21:21,436 --> 01:21:24,005
It was not meant for the soil of this realm

1334
01:21:24,038 --> 01:21:26,174
and it's become monstrous by the
hand that planted it.

1335
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:28,276
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1336
01:21:28,309 --> 01:21:30,411
I must try to sway Hespera.

1337
01:21:30,445 --> 01:21:32,447
Only she can subdue our sister.

1338
01:21:32,481 --> 01:21:34,516
I will give it my all, or die trying.

1339
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,150
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1340
01:21:36,184 --> 01:21:37,595
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1341
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:40,254
My sweet Freddy, I'm ready if need be.

1342
01:21:40,288 --> 01:21:41,956
I've lived a long life.

1343
01:21:41,989 --> 01:21:43,434
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"

1344
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:44,359
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1345
01:21:44,392 --> 01:21:46,394
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1346
01:21:46,427 --> 01:21:47,995
Oh?

1347
01:21:49,397 --> 01:21:50,398
You look great.

1348
01:21:51,065 --> 01:21:52,066
Oh.

1349
01:21:57,305 --> 01:21:59,107
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1350
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,141
Yeah.

1351
01:22:08,116 --> 01:22:10,418
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1352
01:22:10,451 --> 01:22:12,120
We have to figure something out.

1353
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,421
Take my powers back.

1354
01:22:14,454 --> 01:22:15,956
-No, Billy!
-No, no, no.

1355
01:22:15,989 --> 01:22:17,525
Hey, take my powers back.

1356
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,968
You gave 'em to me,
so you can take 'em back, right?

1357
01:22:18,992 --> 01:22:21,161
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1358
01:22:21,194 --> 01:22:22,338
You think I know how to fix this, dude,

1359
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:24,097
but I really don't, okay?

1360
01:22:24,131 --> 01:22:26,400
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1361
01:22:26,433 --> 01:22:28,111
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1362
01:22:28,135 --> 01:22:29,637
which means you know what to do.

1363
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,672
And you were right.

1364
01:22:31,706 --> 01:22:34,074
You picked the wrong champion, man.

1365
01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:35,985
I mean, that's why I always say
"all or none," right?

1366
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:38,145
Because without my family, I'm nothing.

1367
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:43,518
And honestly, I have no idea what I'm doin'.

1368
01:22:43,551 --> 01:22:44,685
No.

1369
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,319
You don't have a shred of wisdom

1370
01:22:46,353 --> 01:22:47,954
in that brain of yours.

1371
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:51,592
But your heart is wise.

1372
01:22:51,626 --> 01:22:55,195
And it knows exactly what must be done.

1373
01:22:55,228 --> 01:22:58,699
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1374
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:02,436
and no one was worthy of what
I once shared

1375
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:05,070
with my brothers and sisters.

1376
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:06,706
But when you shared your powers,

1377
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,576
you did not hesitate.

1378
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,077
For you, everyone can be worthy

1379
01:23:12,111 --> 01:23:13,547
if given a chance.

1380
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:17,082
Now, go fight for your family.

1381
01:23:17,116 --> 01:23:19,285
Go fight for the world.

1382
01:23:19,318 --> 01:23:21,521
I chose right when I chose you.

1383
01:23:25,357 --> 01:23:26,560
Billy?

1384
01:23:26,593 --> 01:23:28,462
Billy, what are we gonna do, man?

1385
01:23:28,495 --> 01:23:31,531
Same thing we always do, Freddy.
Save the God darn world.

1386
01:23:31,565 --> 01:23:33,332
Now, I'm gonna go get that staff

1387
01:23:33,365 --> 01:23:35,201
and I need you to lure these things away

1388
01:23:35,234 --> 01:23:38,037
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1389
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,706
Wait, wait, wait, Billy, Billy.

1390
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:42,107
Can I just see you, before you go?

1391
01:23:42,141 --> 01:23:44,143
Not this version.

1392
01:23:44,176 --> 01:23:46,078
You... You.

1393
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:47,213
My Billy.

1394
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:54,386
Shazam!

1395
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:59,090
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1396
01:24:02,393 --> 01:24:03,394
Hey.

1397
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:12,437
I promise after this

1398
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:14,305
if I don't get eaten by a dragon,

1399
01:24:15,774 --> 01:24:17,576
I'm not gonna force you to keep me.

1400
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:19,812
-Okay?
-What?

1401
01:24:19,845 --> 01:24:21,647
I know I age out soon.

1402
01:24:22,848 --> 01:24:24,583
Billy.

1403
01:24:24,617 --> 01:24:29,153
My wonderful, kind, brave, son.

1404
01:24:29,187 --> 01:24:30,627
You will never age out of your home.

1405
01:24:32,423 --> 01:24:33,526
Never.

1406
01:24:37,863 --> 01:24:40,198
Now, do me a favor

1407
01:24:40,231 --> 01:24:42,568
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1408
01:24:42,601 --> 01:24:45,169
go kick their ass, okay?

1409
01:24:46,404 --> 01:24:47,438
I love you, Mom.

1410
01:24:49,139 --> 01:24:50,140
Me too.

1411
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:54,044
Shazam!

1412
01:24:59,249 --> 01:25:01,586
That's gonna take some getting used to.

1413
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:03,488
Everybody to the battle wagon!

1414
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:04,756
The battle wagon?

1415
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:07,956
Trying to get into the spirit of things.

1416
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,845
Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1417
01:25:27,879 --> 01:25:29,047
I do.

1418
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:31,649
And what I see is just.

1419
01:25:31,683 --> 01:25:33,183
Hespera, look at this tree.

1420
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:35,720
It is blighted. It is unnatural here.

1421
01:25:35,753 --> 01:25:37,655
We made a vow to restore our realm,

1422
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:39,388
not destroy another.

1423
01:25:39,422 --> 01:25:41,300
A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1424
01:25:41,324 --> 01:25:43,560
They did not know their place,

1425
01:25:43,594 --> 01:25:45,227
so I am showing it to them.

1426
01:25:45,261 --> 01:25:48,732
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1427
01:25:48,765 --> 01:25:50,801
No. I'm putting an end to this.

1428
01:25:58,809 --> 01:26:01,143
Hespera.

1429
01:26:06,817 --> 01:26:08,117
No!

1430
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:10,721
Hespera.

1431
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:14,625
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1432
01:26:14,658 --> 01:26:17,126
then perhaps you should be human.

1433
01:27:13,281 --> 01:27:15,584
Help, somebody!

1434
01:27:15,618 --> 01:27:16,886
Somebody help!

1435
01:27:16,919 --> 01:27:18,186
Somebody help!

1436
01:27:30,397 --> 01:27:31,976
Okay, now what?
There are only so many minotaurs

1437
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,233
I can run over with this van.

1438
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:38,740
Hey, Steve.

1439
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:41,910
What are monsters afraid of?

1440
01:27:45,714 --> 01:27:46,881
"The king of beasts."

1441
01:27:46,915 --> 01:27:48,016
Lions?

1442
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:49,349
Unicorns.

1443
01:27:49,383 --> 01:27:51,418
Really? I love unicorns.

1444
01:27:51,452 --> 01:27:53,455
Yet, the unicorn does not love you.

1445
01:27:53,488 --> 01:27:55,490
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

1446
01:27:55,523 --> 01:27:57,424
What?

1447
01:27:59,426 --> 01:28:01,930
-Oh, my--
-Ah!

1448
01:28:01,963 --> 01:28:03,832
I guess maybe it's not so crazy.

1449
01:28:03,865 --> 01:28:06,901
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature of its realm.

1450
01:28:06,935 --> 01:28:08,503
Ruthless and cruel,

1451
01:28:08,536 --> 01:28:09,780
not like the ponies from your storybooks.

1452
01:28:09,804 --> 01:28:11,405
They loathe humanity.

1453
01:28:11,438 --> 01:28:12,907
Is there anything they do like?

1454
01:28:14,475 --> 01:28:16,610
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1455
01:28:16,643 --> 01:28:18,287
Ambrosia. It's like the nectar of the gods.

1456
01:28:18,311 --> 01:28:19,880
It's supposed to be sweet, like honey.

1457
01:28:19,913 --> 01:28:21,314
I have an idea.

1458
01:28:21,347 --> 01:28:22,916
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1459
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:25,686
Guys, get as many
of these people to safety as you can.

1460
01:28:26,452 --> 01:28:27,855
Kids?

1461
01:28:31,558 --> 01:28:33,627
-Let's go.
-Come on, let's go!

1462
01:28:34,561 --> 01:28:35,896
Wizard?

1463
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:36,964
I'm going with them.

1464
01:28:37,831 --> 01:28:38,832
Freddy?

1465
01:28:41,101 --> 01:28:42,301
Anne?

1466
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:44,938
Anne!

1467
01:28:44,972 --> 01:28:45,973
Anne!

1468
01:28:48,876 --> 01:28:51,845
I am not entirely sure how to parent, here.

1469
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:01,522
Hey! Khaleesi!

1470
01:29:14,634 --> 01:29:17,435
Whoo! That was really satisfying.

1471
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:18,471
How was that for you?

1472
01:29:35,755 --> 01:29:37,557
Yeah.

1473
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,725
We love you, Thundercrack.

1474
01:29:39,759 --> 01:29:41,359
You're the best, Captain Marvel.

1475
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:43,996
-Yeah, go, High Voltage!
-Oh, wassup, bro?

1476
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:46,364
It's Maximum Voltage actually,
amongst other names.

1477
01:29:46,398 --> 01:29:48,034
We're still kinda workshopping it, so...

1478
01:29:55,074 --> 01:29:57,475
You thought you were invulnerable.

1479
01:29:57,509 --> 01:29:59,144
But, no.

1480
01:29:59,177 --> 01:30:00,946
Magical fire.

1481
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:02,881
Magic can kill magic.

1482
01:30:02,914 --> 01:30:04,716
Yeah, yeah, yeah, "Magic kills magic."

1483
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:06,383
Way ahead of you, lady.

1484
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:07,461
I'm just trippin'
out because I've never seen

1485
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:08,720
my suit burn like this.

1486
01:30:08,753 --> 01:30:11,156
Also, nobody messes with my town!

1487
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:13,091
Know what I'm saying?

1488
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:15,493
I defeated my traitor sister.

1489
01:30:15,527 --> 01:30:16,661
A god.

1490
01:30:16,695 --> 01:30:18,730
You think I won't destroy you?

1491
01:31:05,876 --> 01:31:07,544
The staff is absorbing it all.

1492
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:09,412
Like a battery.

1493
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:16,820
That's right.

1494
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:19,089
Run!

1495
01:31:19,123 --> 01:31:20,791
This is a terrible idea.

1496
01:31:20,824 --> 01:31:22,993
You don't understand the savagery,
the barbarity.

1497
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:27,531
Oh, no.

1498
01:31:56,693 --> 01:31:58,194
-Hello.
-No.

1499
01:32:01,965 --> 01:32:03,132
It's okay. Come here.

1500
01:32:08,037 --> 01:32:09,138
Darla...

1501
01:32:09,172 --> 01:32:11,641
It's okay. Good girl.

1502
01:32:19,182 --> 01:32:21,551
-Whoa, watch out!
-Whoa!

1503
01:32:21,584 --> 01:32:23,519
Darla!

1504
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:46,742
Taste the rainbow.

1505
01:32:49,044 --> 01:32:50,245
Good, isn't it?

1506
01:32:50,278 --> 01:32:52,547
It's the closest to ambrosia we have.

1507
01:33:17,339 --> 01:33:18,540
Good girl.

1508
01:33:25,312 --> 01:33:26,547
Whoa!

1509
01:33:35,856 --> 01:33:37,191
We're gonna need more Skittles.

1510
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:15,662
Taste the rainbow, motherfu--

1511
01:34:35,748 --> 01:34:37,884
No, no, no.

1512
01:34:37,917 --> 01:34:39,319
Lady, lady, you can't die!

1513
01:34:39,352 --> 01:34:41,387
Come on, Billy, come on!
Powers, powers, powers.

1514
01:34:41,421 --> 01:34:44,858
Medical powers. No.
How-to-fix-dead-people powers.

1515
01:34:52,332 --> 01:34:54,033
Clear?

1516
01:34:54,067 --> 01:34:57,070
Whoa! Come on!
One more time. Clear!

1517
01:34:57,103 --> 01:34:58,671
Stop! Stop!

1518
01:34:58,705 --> 01:35:01,040
Let me go to the Underworld in peace, please.

1519
01:35:01,074 --> 01:35:04,077
Oh, lady, lady, listen to me, okay?

1520
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:05,411
I don't want anyone else to die.

1521
01:35:05,445 --> 01:35:06,888
Not my family, not Anthea, not anyone,

1522
01:35:06,912 --> 01:35:08,313
and we can save them.

1523
01:35:08,347 --> 01:35:09,882
This all came from the tree, right?

1524
01:35:09,915 --> 01:35:11,383
I might know a way to destroy

1525
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,951
the tree and the dragon all in one.

1526
01:35:12,985 --> 01:35:16,321
Ladon's powers are too great, boy.

1527
01:35:16,355 --> 01:35:17,990
Well, not if I can overload the staff

1528
01:35:18,023 --> 01:35:20,292
-with enough lightning.
-A bomb?

1529
01:35:21,727 --> 01:35:22,904
Is that enough to kill the dragon?

1530
01:35:22,928 --> 01:35:23,962
And more.

1531
01:35:25,864 --> 01:35:27,299
You would annihilate

1532
01:35:27,332 --> 01:35:29,401
everything that's inside the dome.

1533
01:35:30,969 --> 01:35:32,905
Well, then I have one more favor to ask.

1534
01:35:35,974 --> 01:35:37,876
Let's go, let's go. Let's go.

1535
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:39,077
There's shelter ahead.

1536
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:41,346
There's shelter ahead. Let's go.

1537
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,382
Walk, don't run.
There's shelter ahead.

1538
01:35:44,249 --> 01:35:45,250
Let's go, let's go.

1539
01:35:46,952 --> 01:35:48,720
Keep going. Keep going!

1540
01:35:48,754 --> 01:35:50,055
Anne!

1541
01:35:50,088 --> 01:35:51,089
Anne!

1542
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:54,126
Anne!

1543
01:36:01,165 --> 01:36:02,400
Go. Run.

1544
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:04,802
Watch that rear.

1545
01:36:17,281 --> 01:36:18,816
Go, go, go!

1546
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:28,359
Back away!

1547
01:36:28,392 --> 01:36:30,861
Run, run, run!

1548
01:36:39,504 --> 01:36:41,038
Anne!

1549
01:36:41,072 --> 01:36:42,173
Ladon,

1550
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,242
kill the traitor.

1551
01:37:17,173 --> 01:37:18,408
Impossible.

1552
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:19,909
Bow him!

1553
01:37:33,923 --> 01:37:36,426
I lost it. Freddy, I can't.

1554
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,261
What is a god without her power?

1555
01:37:38,295 --> 01:37:40,430
The most powerful thing about you

1556
01:37:40,464 --> 01:37:41,864
is you.

1557
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:43,065
You taught me that.

1558
01:37:51,373 --> 01:37:53,175
Kill them!

1559
01:38:10,493 --> 01:38:12,595
Boom!

1560
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:15,164
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

1561
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:19,168
Assuming that you are one.

1562
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:21,003
I mean, you fly, and you breathe fire,

1563
01:38:21,036 --> 01:38:23,172
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1564
01:38:23,205 --> 01:38:25,407
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

1565
01:38:26,676 --> 01:38:27,676
Freddy, Anthea, don't!

1566
01:38:31,213 --> 01:38:33,314
Ah, made you look!

1567
01:38:33,348 --> 01:38:35,049
Oh, lady, that's twice.

1568
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:37,185
And I didn't even need
a flaming violin that time.

1569
01:38:38,554 --> 01:38:40,888
You want the staff? Come get it.

1570
01:39:15,524 --> 01:39:17,325
Now, Hespera.

1571
01:39:19,628 --> 01:39:20,995
Now, Hespera.

1572
01:39:24,197 --> 01:39:25,566
Now. Now.

1573
01:40:26,358 --> 01:40:27,727
No.

1574
01:40:27,761 --> 01:40:29,395
No! No!

1575
01:40:53,419 --> 01:40:54,754
Remove the dome.

1576
01:40:54,788 --> 01:40:56,989
As long as I still breathe,

1577
01:40:57,757 --> 01:41:00,392
the dome still stands.

1578
01:41:00,426 --> 01:41:04,263
Till I see you on the other side, sister.

1579
01:41:47,806 --> 01:41:49,441
Billy!

1580
01:41:49,475 --> 01:41:51,242
-Get out of there.
-I can't.

1581
01:41:51,276 --> 01:41:52,377
Billy.

1582
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:54,078
I have to do this.

1583
01:41:56,281 --> 01:41:57,559
Billy, what are you doing?

1584
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:58,826
You're not supposed to be in there.

1585
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:02,252
Yeah, I am.

1586
01:42:02,286 --> 01:42:04,197
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1587
01:42:04,221 --> 01:42:05,823
that I didn't deserve my powers,

1588
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:08,898
but there's something that I can do.

1589
01:42:09,426 --> 01:42:10,427
No.

1590
01:42:11,428 --> 01:42:13,130
I can save all of you.

1591
01:42:13,163 --> 01:42:14,599
But it's all or none!

1592
01:42:14,632 --> 01:42:16,467
Yeah.

1593
01:42:16,501 --> 01:42:18,741
All of my family gets to live
and none of them gets hurt.

1594
01:42:21,405 --> 01:42:24,207
Freddy, I've never had a family.
You know that.

1595
01:42:24,241 --> 01:42:26,243
Everybody I've ever cared about,
they all left me.

1596
01:42:26,276 --> 01:42:28,145
My mom, my dad, everyone.

1597
01:42:29,379 --> 01:42:31,248
So when I found you guys,
I had to hang on

1598
01:42:31,281 --> 01:42:32,459
and I've been hanging on too tight.

1599
01:42:32,483 --> 01:42:33,818
No.

1600
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:35,451
I should have let you do your own thing.

1601
01:42:37,287 --> 01:42:39,289
Now it's time for you to fly.

1602
01:42:39,323 --> 01:42:40,324
What about you?

1603
01:42:45,362 --> 01:42:47,197
I'm Captain Everypower Junior.

1604
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,867
Don't you forget it.

1605
01:43:43,653 --> 01:43:45,454
We end this now.

1606
01:43:45,488 --> 01:43:47,790
Yeah. We do.

1607
01:43:58,768 --> 01:44:00,368
Come on, Billy.

1608
01:44:28,396 --> 01:44:29,665
He's got this. We got this.

1609
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:31,634
He's got this. He's got this.

1610
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:32,735
Billy.

1611
01:44:37,038 --> 01:44:38,405
Fly.

1612
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:52,754
Billy.

1613
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,489
Come on, baby. Come on, let's go!

1614
01:45:01,763 --> 01:45:03,598
No!

1615
01:45:46,607 --> 01:45:47,608
Whoa!

1616
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:51,545
Ah.

1617
01:46:54,406 --> 01:46:56,876
Shazam!

1618
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:14,626
Billy.

1619
01:47:15,927 --> 01:47:18,029
A true god,

1620
01:47:18,063 --> 01:47:20,098
after all.

1621
01:48:12,483 --> 01:48:13,651
He did it.

1622
01:48:21,492 --> 01:48:22,493
We must go.

1623
01:48:29,867 --> 01:48:30,868
Billy?

1624
01:48:31,535 --> 01:48:32,536
Billy?

1625
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:34,872
Billy!

1626
01:48:36,774 --> 01:48:37,808
Billy!

1627
01:48:39,176 --> 01:48:41,779
Billy. Where are you?

1628
01:48:41,812 --> 01:48:42,880
Billy!

1629
01:48:44,848 --> 01:48:45,849
Billy?

1630
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:51,921
Billy! Billy.

1631
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:55,725
Billy!

1632
01:48:55,758 --> 01:48:56,759
Billy!

1633
01:48:57,794 --> 01:48:58,995
Billy!

1634
01:48:59,028 --> 01:49:00,463
Dude, wake up. You did it.

1635
01:49:03,066 --> 01:49:04,901
Okay. You're supposed to wake up.

1636
01:49:04,934 --> 01:49:05,978
It's the part where you wake up

1637
01:49:06,002 --> 01:49:07,804
and open your eyes and laugh

1638
01:49:07,837 --> 01:49:10,940
and you're supposed to say
you got me, 'cause you got me.

1639
01:49:12,241 --> 01:49:13,843
Dude. Joke's over, man.

1640
01:49:14,644 --> 01:49:15,712
Billy!

1641
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,983
Billy. Billy, come on.

1642
01:49:22,585 --> 01:49:23,853
Freddy.

1643
01:49:27,023 --> 01:49:28,491
What did you do?

1644
01:49:30,727 --> 01:49:31,828
Wake up, Billy.

1645
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:33,663
-Billy?
-He's over here!

1646
01:49:36,733 --> 01:49:37,734
Billy.

1647
01:49:39,168 --> 01:49:41,504
You asshole!

1648
01:49:42,838 --> 01:49:45,007
We're a team! We're a team!

1649
01:49:46,141 --> 01:49:47,142
Oh, Billy.

1650
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:49,945
Billy.

1651
01:49:49,978 --> 01:49:52,114
Oh, my baby. No.

1652
01:49:56,785 --> 01:49:58,253
He was a hero.

1653
01:49:59,955 --> 01:50:02,324
He was a hero and a god.

1654
01:50:02,357 --> 01:50:04,659
And he should be laid to rest like one.

1655
01:50:09,031 --> 01:50:10,298
Hey, pal.

1656
01:51:18,666 --> 01:51:20,234
Will this land ever come back?

1657
01:51:21,302 --> 01:51:24,071
The staff is drained of magic.

1658
01:51:24,105 --> 01:51:27,006
Only the spark
of a god can restore its power

1659
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:29,642
and there are no gods left.

1660
01:51:31,077 --> 01:51:32,345
There is one.

1661
01:51:51,064 --> 01:51:52,065
What?

1662
01:52:29,134 --> 01:52:30,436
Whoa.

1663
01:52:49,755 --> 01:52:50,789
Whoa.

1664
01:53:19,817 --> 01:53:20,818
It's a zombie!

1665
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:24,121
Guys!

1666
01:53:25,022 --> 01:53:26,324
What the hell?

1667
01:53:26,357 --> 01:53:28,292
You buried me?

1668
01:53:28,326 --> 01:53:30,861
In what, like, two minutes?

1669
01:53:30,895 --> 01:53:31,929
Oh, Billy!

1670
01:53:33,498 --> 01:53:34,832
Hey.

1671
01:53:34,865 --> 01:53:37,101
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

1672
01:53:40,037 --> 01:53:41,506
Hi. Hey.

1673
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:44,408
Oh, my God. Hi.

1674
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:46,177
Why didn't anybody tell...

1675
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:48,145
Hi. Sorry, sorry, I didn't, uh...

1676
01:53:48,179 --> 01:53:51,182
I didn't see you there, I was, um, I was...

1677
01:53:51,215 --> 01:53:52,316
I was dead at the time.

1678
01:53:53,351 --> 01:53:54,453
So, you, uh...

1679
01:53:55,419 --> 01:53:56,887
you got my bird letter?

1680
01:53:58,089 --> 01:53:59,357
Oh, I, uh...

1681
01:54:01,124 --> 01:54:02,392
I think you've got something...

1682
01:54:04,194 --> 01:54:05,429
On my...

1683
01:54:05,463 --> 01:54:07,030
Where... Oh.

1684
01:54:07,598 --> 01:54:08,832
What?

1685
01:54:09,533 --> 01:54:10,568
That's a spider.

1686
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:12,235
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

1687
01:54:12,269 --> 01:54:14,838
Also,
that's really embarrassing.

1688
01:54:14,871 --> 01:54:16,072
Yes, it is.

1689
01:54:16,106 --> 01:54:18,442
But it was an amazing thing you did.

1690
01:54:18,476 --> 01:54:20,410
The sacrifice you made.

1691
01:54:20,444 --> 01:54:23,413
You brought this world back to life.

1692
01:54:23,447 --> 01:54:25,583
Maybe this time, gods and humans

1693
01:54:25,616 --> 01:54:27,350
can learn to live in peace.

1694
01:54:27,384 --> 01:54:28,385
Yeah.

1695
01:54:29,919 --> 01:54:31,855
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

1696
01:54:34,124 --> 01:54:35,459
Be well, Billy Batson.

1697
01:54:37,894 --> 01:54:40,464
Hey, you know,
just because your father's power

1698
01:54:40,498 --> 01:54:42,132
is surging through me,

1699
01:54:42,165 --> 01:54:44,267
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

1700
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:45,902
and I'm gonna be 18

1701
01:54:45,935 --> 01:54:47,547
in, like, five months, so...

1702
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:49,973
Stick to saving the world, kid.

1703
01:54:50,006 --> 01:54:51,975
Yeah, you know, like, that's...
Okay, cool.

1704
01:54:52,008 --> 01:54:53,476
See ya.

1705
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:55,311
What's with our boys and older women?

1706
01:54:58,213 --> 01:55:00,049
Hey.

1707
01:55:00,082 --> 01:55:01,484
Who wants their powers back?

1708
01:55:03,453 --> 01:55:05,455
We can do that, right?

1709
01:55:05,488 --> 01:55:06,556
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, good.

1710
01:55:06,589 --> 01:55:07,956
Good, good, good.

1711
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:09,592
I'd like our house back.

1712
01:55:09,626 --> 01:55:10,959
Can we do that?

1713
01:55:12,928 --> 01:55:14,597
-Dinner!
-Coming.

1714
01:55:14,631 --> 01:55:16,999
Aw. Thank you for
respecting the cross-stitch.

1715
01:55:21,504 --> 01:55:23,072
Anthea.

1716
01:55:23,105 --> 01:55:24,316
Have you decided what you're gonna do

1717
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:27,076
about that god realm of yours?

1718
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:29,646
Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

1719
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:31,648
Spend some time
with the common folk.

1720
01:55:31,681 --> 01:55:33,315
Learn some about your world,

1721
01:55:33,349 --> 01:55:35,951
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

1722
01:55:35,984 --> 01:55:37,520
Number one sign of wisdom:

1723
01:55:37,554 --> 01:55:39,421
Admitting there's always more to learn.

1724
01:55:39,456 --> 01:55:40,889
I'm coming around to it.

1725
01:55:42,692 --> 01:55:44,025
I got it.

1726
01:55:48,329 --> 01:55:49,330
Whoa.

1727
01:55:50,164 --> 01:55:51,433
Uh, guys?

1728
01:55:52,233 --> 01:55:53,267
Guys!

1729
01:56:00,609 --> 01:56:01,876
It's the wizard.

1730
01:56:03,479 --> 01:56:05,413
-Oh, my God!
-No way!

1731
01:56:05,447 --> 01:56:07,181
-Yes.
-Look at this guy!

1732
01:56:07,215 --> 01:56:08,517
Look at him, he's so handsome.

1733
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:10,051
You pimpin' now, what is this?

1734
01:56:10,084 --> 01:56:11,629
-You look amazing.
-You look great!

1735
01:56:11,653 --> 01:56:13,955
Well, I was in the neighborhood

1736
01:56:13,988 --> 01:56:15,491
and, um, I just wanted to express

1737
01:56:15,524 --> 01:56:18,025
my gratitude before I go.

1738
01:56:18,059 --> 01:56:22,263
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

1739
01:56:22,296 --> 01:56:23,898
Not everything.

1740
01:56:26,968 --> 01:56:28,504
You were just in the neighborhood?

1741
01:56:28,537 --> 01:56:31,038
Okay, I came for the staff.

1742
01:56:31,072 --> 01:56:33,074
Perhaps I will hold onto it for now.

1743
01:56:33,107 --> 01:56:37,043
I also wanted
to see your faces one last time

1744
01:56:37,077 --> 01:56:38,679
before I turn into a pile of ash.

1745
01:56:38,713 --> 01:56:40,313
-Wait, what?
-No!

1746
01:56:40,347 --> 01:56:42,382
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

1747
01:56:42,416 --> 01:56:44,284
And besides...

1748
01:56:44,317 --> 01:56:47,120
...I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

1749
01:56:47,154 --> 01:56:49,122
It's time to see your world.

1750
01:56:49,156 --> 01:56:50,658
It's been an honor,

1751
01:56:50,691 --> 01:56:53,393
a privilege, watching you all soar.

1752
01:56:53,428 --> 01:56:54,705
You know, you're not such a bad wizard.

1753
01:56:54,729 --> 01:56:56,263
Thank you, Jeff.

1754
01:56:56,296 --> 01:56:58,131
It never ends.

1755
01:56:59,467 --> 01:57:00,468
Also,

1756
01:57:02,035 --> 01:57:03,471
what's my superhero name?

1757
01:57:06,106 --> 01:57:08,375
Your name is...

1758
01:57:09,409 --> 01:57:11,311
Shazam.

1759
01:57:11,344 --> 01:57:12,379
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1760
01:57:16,183 --> 01:57:18,418
I still think we can beat it.

1761
01:59:57,675 --> 01:59:59,343
My feet hurt. How much further?

1762
01:59:59,376 --> 02:00:00,578
About ten seconds less

1763
02:00:00,612 --> 02:00:02,244
than the last time you asked me.

1764
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:03,718
I'm sorry, I just feel like we could

1765
02:00:03,747 --> 02:00:05,181
have parked a little bit closer.

1766
02:00:05,214 --> 02:00:06,358
He doesn't know we're coming,

1767
02:00:06,382 --> 02:00:07,751
and I didn't want to spook him.

1768
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:10,252
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

1769
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:11,622
All right, let's go.

1770
02:00:11,655 --> 02:00:13,690
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

1771
02:00:13,724 --> 02:00:15,902
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

1772
02:00:15,926 --> 02:00:17,527
we never actually met him

1773
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:19,896
because you wore shitty walking shoes.

1774
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:21,832
Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

1775
02:00:21,865 --> 02:00:23,800
and they're not shitty, they're new.

1776
02:00:23,834 --> 02:00:26,803
-I just haven't had a chance to break them in yet.
-Shut up.

1777
02:00:26,837 --> 02:00:29,873
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

1778
02:00:29,906 --> 02:00:31,675
but a little immature.

1779
02:00:31,708 --> 02:00:32,843
Oh, great.

1780
02:00:33,744 --> 02:00:36,379
{\an8}Whoo!

1781
02:00:45,321 --> 02:00:46,790
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

1782
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,592
I mean, no.

1783
02:00:48,625 --> 02:00:50,326
I've never heard that name in my life.

1784
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:51,671
I don't know who you're talking about.

1785
02:00:51,695 --> 02:00:53,328
But I'd like to meet that person

1786
02:00:53,361 --> 02:00:55,196
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

1787
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:57,900
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

1788
02:00:57,933 --> 02:00:59,535
but, like, in a dangerous way.

1789
02:00:59,568 --> 02:01:01,470
What the hell are you talking about?

1790
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:03,606
Relax. We know who you are.

1791
02:01:03,639 --> 02:01:05,775
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

1792
02:01:06,809 --> 02:01:07,843
Who are you guys?

1793
02:01:07,877 --> 02:01:09,344
Don't worry about that either.

1794
02:01:09,377 --> 02:01:11,212
Look, we've seen what you can do.

1795
02:01:11,246 --> 02:01:12,782
And we're here to make you an offer.

1796
02:01:12,815 --> 02:01:13,883
How would you like to join

1797
02:01:13,916 --> 02:01:15,250
-the Justice...
-Yes!

1798
02:01:15,283 --> 02:01:16,652
A thousand times yes!

1799
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:18,587
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

1800
02:01:18,621 --> 02:01:20,589
Well, I mean, not this exactly.

1801
02:01:20,623 --> 02:01:21,667
Like, normally, it's Wonder Woman

1802
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:22,858
in the dream, but...

1803
02:01:22,892 --> 02:01:24,460
-Ew.
-Huh?

1804
02:01:24,493 --> 02:01:26,629
Well, that was easy.

1805
02:01:26,662 --> 02:01:28,296
Welcome to the Justice Society.

1806
02:01:28,329 --> 02:01:30,331
Yeah! Aweso-- Wait, what?

1807
02:01:30,365 --> 02:01:31,600
The Justice Society?

1808
02:01:31,634 --> 02:01:32,944
Is that different than the Justice League?

1809
02:01:32,968 --> 02:01:34,704
Yes. The Justice Society

1810
02:01:34,737 --> 02:01:36,271
is different than the Justice League

1811
02:01:36,304 --> 02:01:37,940
because of how words work.

1812
02:01:37,973 --> 02:01:39,909
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

1813
02:01:39,942 --> 02:01:42,343
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

1814
02:01:42,377 --> 02:01:44,345
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

1815
02:01:44,379 --> 02:01:46,280
He's joking, right?

1816
02:01:46,313 --> 02:01:49,551
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

1817
02:01:49,584 --> 02:01:51,586
I'm gonna wait here, 'cause of the shoes.

1818
02:01:51,619 --> 02:01:53,621
Can you drive by and get me?

1819
02:01:53,655 --> 02:01:56,024
Hey,
just a little constructive criticism.

1820
02:01:56,057 --> 02:01:57,497
It's pretty confusing that there are

1821
02:01:57,525 --> 02:01:59,527
two separate groups of superheroes

1822
02:01:59,561 --> 02:02:00,962
that are totally unaffiliated,

1823
02:02:00,995 --> 02:02:03,031
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

1824
02:02:03,064 --> 02:02:05,341
Like, have you guys ever thought
about doing a rebranding of sorts?

1825
02:02:05,365 --> 02:02:08,036
'Cause just a quick search on Thesaurus.com,

1826
02:02:08,069 --> 02:02:09,938
you got so many options, man.

1827
02:02:09,971 --> 02:02:13,007
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

1828
02:02:13,041 --> 02:02:14,809
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

1829
02:02:14,843 --> 02:02:16,376
These are, like, legal terms.

1830
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:19,514
"The Avenger Society."

1831
02:02:20,949 --> 02:02:22,517
I like that, for some reason.

1832
02:08:58,004 --> 02:09:02,041
Well, well, Doctor.
We meet again.

1833
02:09:02,075 --> 02:09:03,943
Where in the hell have you been?

1834
02:09:03,977 --> 02:09:07,013
To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

1835
02:09:07,046 --> 02:09:09,315
one must have patience.

1836
02:09:09,349 --> 02:09:10,917
What are you talking about?

1837
02:09:12,486 --> 02:09:14,387
It's been two goddamn years!

1838
02:09:14,421 --> 02:09:19,359
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

1839
02:09:19,392 --> 02:09:20,894
A meaningless measure.

1840
02:09:20,927 --> 02:09:23,430
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

1841
02:09:23,464 --> 02:09:26,866
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

1842
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,867
waiting for a worm to enact some, what,

1843
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:31,303
vague plan I've been
told absolutely nothing about?

1844
02:09:31,336 --> 02:09:34,072
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

1845
02:09:34,106 --> 02:09:36,942
I do not have legs, I do not have wings,

1846
02:09:36,975 --> 02:09:40,312
I just slither around endlessly.

1847
02:09:40,345 --> 02:09:42,915
But not for long.

1848
02:09:45,784 --> 02:09:47,319
Tell me everything.

1849
02:09:48,954 --> 02:09:51,023
Just one more thing I need to do.

1850
02:09:51,056 --> 02:09:53,058
What? No!

1851
02:09:54,494 --> 02:09:55,494
Oh, goddamn it!

1852
02:10:10,352 --> 02:10:12,353
English
