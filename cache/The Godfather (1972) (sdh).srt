2

America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,559
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:06,355
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,897
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,573
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,241
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,989
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,579
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:31,172
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,422
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,547
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:46,597
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,025
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,568
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,195
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,249
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,828
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,634
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,301

Sorry.

22
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:38,490
I went to the police,
like a good American.

23
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,200
These two boys were brought to trial.

24
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,029
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

25
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,285
but suspended the sentence.

26
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,463
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

27
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,002
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

28
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,680
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

29
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:09,521

we must go to Don Corleone."

you invited me for a cup of coffee.

Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

39
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,626
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

40
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,426
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

41
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,798
BONASERA: I didn't want to
get into trouble.

42
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,763
I understand.

43
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,980
You found Paradise in America.

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,945
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

45
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,694
You didn't need a friend like me.

46
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,953
But now you come to me and say,

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,577
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

48
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,249
But you don't ask with respect.

49
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,999
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

50
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:10,805
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

51
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,352
BONASERA: I ask you for justice.

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,396
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

53
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,776
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

54
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,280
How much shall I pay you?

55

56
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,004
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

57
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,844
If you'd come in friendship,

58
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,224
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

59
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,610
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

60
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,278
And then they would fear you.

62
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,455

Good.

Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

65
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,934
But until that day

Please, Michael. Tell me.

183
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:37,336
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

184
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,335
with a big bandleader.

185
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,715
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

186
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,430
Johnny is my father's godson.

187
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,684
My father went to see this bandleader.

188
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,684
He offered him $10,000
to let Johnny go,

189
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,562
but the bandleader said no.

190
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:04,026
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

191
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,072
Within an hour,

192
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:13,751
he signed a release
for a certified check of $1,000.

193
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,715
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

194
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:26,173
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

195
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:31,553
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

TOM: Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

295
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:29,195
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

296
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,162
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

297

This favor I can't give him.

298
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,247
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

299
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:45,295
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

300
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,253
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

301
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,223
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

302
00:30:55,228 --> 00:31:00,143
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

303
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:05,444
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

304
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:10,362
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

305
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,194
Let me be even more frank.

306
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:18,249
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

307
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,961
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

308
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:27,258
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

309
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:33,598
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

310
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,265

Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

He's supposed to be very good

<i>He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.</i>

329

<i>In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

will, maybe the five families.</i>

- 30%.

349
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,288
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

350

And then it would go up.

And I'll give you my reason.

It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

365

They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

366
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:32,577
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

614

If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

615
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,611
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

616
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,734
I'll be out in a minute.

617
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,377
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

I'm with you now.

I'm with you.

Get rid of these. Come here.

Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

were locked up!

- You little punk!

Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

- He's a war hero. He's never been...
I said take him in!

634
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,608
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

Stand him up straight.

- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

651
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:25,980
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,608
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

No more! Not this time, <i>Consigliere.</i>

No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

This is business, not personal!

- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

to patch things up. Just help me win.

I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

664
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,409
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

665
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,497
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

666
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:28,296
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

669
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,847
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

Take this into consideration.

We can't wait. We can't wait.

01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:06,706
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

674
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:10,459
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

675
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,672
- Mike is right.
- SONNY: Let me ask you something.

676
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:19,472
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

677
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,525
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

678
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:32,947
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

679
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,943
Let's set the meeting.

680
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:42,749
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

681
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:48,334
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

682
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:52,084
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

683
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,847
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

684
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,301
So I can't have a weapon on me.

685
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,768
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

686
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,940
then I'll kill them both.

Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

689
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,427
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

690
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:42,927
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

691
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,138
You're taking this very personal.

692
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:49,770
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

693
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,319
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

694
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:59,493
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

695
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:04,372
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

696
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:09,286
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

697
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,754
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

698
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,924
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

701
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,398
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

702
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,916
Is the trigger too tight?

703
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,375
My ears!

704
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:58,051
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

705
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,096
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

706
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:08,220
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

707
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,932
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

708
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:16,312
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

709
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,280
so walk out fast, but don't run.

710

Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

711
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:26,405
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

712
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:32,828
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,

713
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,959
and we'll catch the hell.

- Pretty goddamn bad.

All the other families will probably
line up against us.

- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

731

The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

732

He could blast whoever is in the car.

Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

738

A police captain is on call 24 hours

- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

742

We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

743
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:32,636
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

744
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:36,594
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

745
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:42,105
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

746
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:46,480
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

747

Miami somebody very good
to plant that gun.

I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

749

- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

Yeah, a million times.

753
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:21,265
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

At least a year.

I don't know.

1075
02:07:16,129 --> 02:07:19,497
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

1076
02:07:22,677 --> 02:07:26,011
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

1077
02:07:28,516 --> 02:07:32,054
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

1078
02:07:32,145 --> 02:07:36,139
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

1079
02:07:37,483 --> 02:07:41,021
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1080
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:46,653
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

1081
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:50,861
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

1082
02:07:50,955 --> 02:07:54,994
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1083
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:57,951
He refused to share them.

1084
02:07:58,045 --> 02:08:02,004
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1085
02:08:02,133 --> 02:08:04,295
All of you know me.

1086
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:10,472
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And Why?

1087
02:08:12,059 --> 02:08:18,101
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1088
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:22,276
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1089
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:28,357
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

1090
02:08:28,492 --> 02:08:33,077
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1091
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:37,499
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1092
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:42,705
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1093
02:08:42,798 --> 02:08:45,130
Times have changed.

1094
02:08:45,218 --> 02:08:49,928
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1095
02:08:50,014 --> 02:08:52,847
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1096
02:08:52,975 --> 02:08:58,220
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1097
02:08:58,356 --> 02:09:03,066
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1098
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:07,646
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1099
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,240
After all, we're not communists.

1100
02:09:13,371 --> 02:09:16,580
I also don't believe in drugs.

1101
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:21,251
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1102
02:09:21,587 --> 02:09:24,750
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

1103
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:28,253
"If you put up
3-4,000 dollar investment,

1104
02:09:28,386 --> 02:09:30,969
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1105
02:09:32,223 --> 02:09:38,219
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1106
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:43,099
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1107
02:09:43,192 --> 02:09:45,183
That's an <i>infàmia.</i>

1108
02:09:46,362 --> 02:09:50,230
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1109
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:53,575
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1110
02:10:00,334 --> 02:10:03,827
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1111
02:10:05,339 --> 02:10:11,881
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1112
02:10:12,388 --> 02:10:17,053
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1113
02:10:17,143 --> 02:10:21,307
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1114
02:10:21,439 --> 02:10:25,103
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1115
02:10:25,192 --> 02:10:28,605
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

1116
02:10:28,696 --> 02:10:31,233
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1117
02:10:31,324 --> 02:10:36,535
BARZINI: We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1118
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:39,495
You talk about vengeance.

1119
02:10:39,623 --> 02:10:42,911
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1120
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:45,411
Or my boy to me?

1121
02:10:45,504 --> 02:10:48,246
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1122
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,422
But I have selfish reasons.

1123
02:10:55,723 --> 02:10:59,216
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1124
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:03,728
because of this Sollozzo business.

1125
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:09,021
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1126
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,982
Cleared of all these false charges.

1127
02:11:13,282 --> 02:11:16,525
But I'm a superstitious man.

1128
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:21,951
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

1129
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:26,959
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1130
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:29,876
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1131
02:11:31,217 --> 02:11:34,710
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1132
02:11:36,263 --> 02:11:38,675
And that I do not forgive.

1133
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:43,517
But, that aside,

1134
02:11:46,607 --> 02:11:49,099
let me say that I swear

1135
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:53,691
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1136
02:11:53,864 --> 02:11:58,279
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1137
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:29,272
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1138
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:31,474
Mention it. Don't insist.

1139
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:38,357
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1140
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:41,867
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1141
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:46,118
He could never have outfought Santino.

1142
02:12:48,335 --> 02:12:54,081
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1143
02:13:09,398 --> 02:13:11,514
Come on, Nancy.

1144
02:13:12,776 --> 02:13:15,518
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1145
02:13:16,697 --> 02:13:18,529
Okay, all right.

1146
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:33,578
How long have you been back?

1147
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,377
I've been back a year.

1148
02:13:37,635 --> 02:13:39,797
Longer than that, I think.

1149
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:44,805
It's good to see you, Kay.

1150
02:13:55,819 --> 02:13:58,481
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1151
02:14:00,866 --> 02:14:03,858
He's been sick. Very sick.

1152
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:07,490
But you're not like him.

1153
02:14:07,623 --> 02:14:11,366
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1154
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:17,414
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1155
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:21,168
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1156
02:14:22,388 --> 02:14:24,675
Like a senator or president.

1157
02:14:24,807 --> 02:14:27,390
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1158
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:30,218
They don't have men killed.

1159
02:14:33,482 --> 02:14:35,473
Who's being naive, Kay?

1160
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:40,899
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1161
02:14:42,616 --> 02:14:46,826
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1162
02:14:48,622 --> 02:14:52,581
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1163
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:57,249
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1164
02:14:58,424 --> 02:15:03,464
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1165
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:06,922
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1166
02:15:07,057 --> 02:15:10,846
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1167
02:15:12,438 --> 02:15:15,226
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1168
02:15:16,859 --> 02:15:20,727
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1169
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:26,866
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1170
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:31,620
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1171
02:15:33,334 --> 02:15:35,951
That we have children. Our children.

1172
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:39,545
Kay, I need you.

1173
02:15:41,508 --> 02:15:43,249
And I love you.

1174
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:09,155
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1175
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:12,779
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- MICHAEL: Be patient.

1176
02:16:12,915 --> 02:16:16,078
TESSIO: I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1177
02:16:16,168 --> 02:16:19,331
MICHAEL: Be patient.
CARLO: We must protect ourselves.

1178
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:22,755
- Let me recruit some new men.
- MICHAEL: No.

1179
02:16:22,883 --> 02:16:26,717
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.

1180
02:16:28,305 --> 02:16:30,546
CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...

1181
02:16:30,683 --> 02:16:34,517
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1182
02:16:34,645 --> 02:16:38,684
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1183
02:16:39,692 --> 02:16:42,559
Michael is now head of the family.

1184
02:16:42,695 --> 02:16:46,734
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1185
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:49,357
After we make the move to Nevada

1186
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:53,703
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1187
02:16:53,789 --> 02:16:58,204
- TESSIO: How long will that be?
- Six months.

1188
02:16:58,335 --> 02:17:01,418
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1189
02:17:01,505 --> 02:17:04,543
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1190
02:17:04,633 --> 02:17:10,219
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1191
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:13,214
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1192
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:16,217
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1193
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:19,729
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1194
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:29,781
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1195
02:17:29,908 --> 02:17:32,240
That's all I can tell you now.

1196
02:17:33,036 --> 02:17:35,573
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1197
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:39,119
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1198
02:17:39,209 --> 02:17:43,954
Tom Hagen is no longer <i>consigliere.</i>
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1199
02:17:44,047 --> 02:17:46,630
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1200
02:17:46,759 --> 02:17:51,469
If I ever need help, who's a better
<i>consigliere</i> than my father? That's it.

1201
02:18:11,533 --> 02:18:15,322
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1202
02:18:15,412 --> 02:18:18,245
Mike... Why am I out?

1203
02:18:19,625 --> 02:18:22,583
You're not a wartime <i>consigliere,</i> Tom.

1204
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:27,000
Things may get rough with the move.

1205
02:18:27,132 --> 02:18:28,463
Tom.

1206
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:38,641
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad <i>consigliere.</i>

1207
02:18:38,769 --> 02:18:42,933
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1208
02:18:44,483 --> 02:18:47,771
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1209
02:18:48,695 --> 02:18:53,690
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1210
02:18:54,785 --> 02:18:57,823
Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1211
02:19:07,798 --> 02:19:09,414
(DOOR CLOSING)

1212
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:51,294
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1213
02:19:51,425 --> 02:19:55,840
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1214
02:19:55,929 --> 02:20:00,093
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1215
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:02,637
Let me open the door, all right?

1216
02:20:03,896 --> 02:20:06,638
(PLAYING
<i>FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW)</i>

1217
02:20:08,859 --> 02:20:14,150
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1218
02:20:14,281 --> 02:20:16,739
JOHNNY: Your brother Freddy.
FREDO: Girls?

1219
02:20:20,704 --> 02:20:23,742
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1220
02:20:25,083 --> 02:20:28,701
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1221
02:20:29,963 --> 02:20:33,456
- That's for you to find out.
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1222

- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1223
02:20:39,806 --> 02:20:42,389
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1224

Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

Hey, come on! Scram!

1227

Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1228
02:21:02,871 --> 02:21:04,236
Sorry.

What happened to Moe Greene?

1232
02:21:18,762 --> 02:21:23,222
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1233
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:25,216
Well, give him a call.

- Nice to see you, Mike.

JOHNNY: Thanks.

Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1237
02:21:35,988 --> 02:21:37,979
Well, I owe it all to him.

1238
02:21:39,199 --> 02:21:40,860
He knows how grateful you are.

1239
02:21:40,951 --> 02:21:44,160
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1240
02:21:44,246 --> 02:21:46,157
Mike, what can I do?

1241
02:21:47,374 --> 02:21:49,911
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1242
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:52,876
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1243
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:58,917
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1244
02:21:59,011 --> 02:22:01,719
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1245
02:22:01,805 --> 02:22:04,797
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1246
02:22:04,933 --> 02:22:07,800
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

See, Johnny...

1248
02:22:11,565 --> 02:22:15,684
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1249
02:22:15,819 --> 02:22:19,608
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1250
02:22:22,492 --> 02:22:27,032
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1251
02:22:28,373 --> 02:22:30,489
We're counting on you.

1252
02:22:32,502 --> 02:22:36,086
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1256
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,686
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1257
02:22:51,813 --> 02:22:55,272
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1258
02:22:57,861 --> 02:23:00,728
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1259
02:23:02,491 --> 02:23:04,277
Buy me out?

1260
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:06,867
The casino, the hotel.

1261
02:23:06,995 --> 02:23:09,862
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1262
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:15,493
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1263
02:23:15,629 --> 02:23:18,872
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1264
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:23,092
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1265

You Guineas make me laugh.

1266

I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1267
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:39,767
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1268
02:23:39,903 --> 02:23:44,943
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1269
02:23:45,075 --> 02:23:47,988
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1270
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:50,452
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1271

The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1273
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:03,921
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1274
02:24:04,052 --> 02:24:07,670
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1275
02:24:07,764 --> 02:24:12,554
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1276
02:24:12,686 --> 02:24:16,930
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1277
02:24:17,023 --> 02:24:21,733
I have a business to run.
We got to kick asses sometimes.

1278
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:25,688
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1279
02:24:25,782 --> 02:24:28,570
You straightened my brother out?

1280
02:24:28,702 --> 02:24:32,991
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1281

- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.
