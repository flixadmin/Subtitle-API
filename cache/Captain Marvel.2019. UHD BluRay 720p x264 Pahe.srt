
1
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:35,462

2
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,755
Do you know
what time it is?

3
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,479
Can't sleep.

4
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,748
There are tabs
for that.

5
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,552
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

6
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,620
Dreams again?

7
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:29,493
Wanna fight?

8
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,262
I slipped.

9
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:35,197
Right, you slipped

10
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,199
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

11
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,099
I was already slipping

12
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,367
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

13
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:40,970
The two events
were not related.

14
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:42,539
Tell me about this dream.

15
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,578
- Anything new?
- No.

16
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,548
You have to let go
of the past.

17
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,816
I don't remember my past.

18
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:56,485
It's causing you doubt,

19
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,288
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

20
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:07,498
Control it.

21
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,366
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

22
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:12,834
with the
Supreme Intelligence.

23
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,706
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

24
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,010
Humor is a distraction.

25
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:25,213
And anger?

26
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:26,650
Anger only serves
the enemy.

27
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,494
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

28
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,530
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

29
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,864
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

30
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,699
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

31
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:47,469
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

32
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,739
in its true form.

33
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,840
You know that.

34
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:54,576
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

35
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:58,112
So it's sacred.
It's personal.

36
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,248
No Kree divulges it, ever.

37
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,251
Who do you see?

38
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:03,418
- Your brother?
- No.

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,686
- Father?
- No.

40
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,855
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

41
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:08,258
It's me you see,
isn't it?

42
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,259
I see
what you're trying to do.

43
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,727
- Is it working?
- Yes.

44
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,596
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

45
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:17,198
What is the point
of giving me these...

46
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,900
if you don't want me
to use them?

47
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,769
I want you to use them.

48
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,671
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

49
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:24,639
of showing you
how to use them.

50
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,507
I know how.

51
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:26,808
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

52
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,212
knock me down without them.

53
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:31,615
Control your impulses.

54
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:35,750
Stop using this,
start using this.

55
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:39,756
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

56
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:22,131
Vers.

57
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,899
Intelligence.

58
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,969
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

59
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,638
I am.

60
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,241
You struggle
with your emotions...

61
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:35,612
with your past,
which fuels them.

62
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:40,548
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

63
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,752
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

64
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:46,821
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

65
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,825
then take over our planets.

66
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,527
Horrors that you remember...

67
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,165
and so much that you do not.

68
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:02,570
It's all blank.
My life.

69
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,272
You're supposed
to take the form

70
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:05,940
of who I most admire...

71
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:10,578
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

72
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,647
Perhaps this is a mercy

73
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,583
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

74
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:19,487
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must...

75
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,990
put your people's needs
before your own.

76
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,526
We've given you
a great gift.

77
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:26,963
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

78
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:29,798
I want to serve.

79
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,866
Then master yourself.

80
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:34,538
What was given
can be taken away.

81
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:40,008
I won't let you down.

82
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,245
We'll know soon enough.

83
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,314
You have a mission.

84
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:47,984
Serve well, and with honor.

85
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,605
This can't be good.

86
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:12,640
Must be another
Skrull attack.

87
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:13,977
Whatever it is, it's big.

88
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,511
Has a Skrull
ever simmed you?

89
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:17,679
Once.

90
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,048
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

91
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,450
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy...

92
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,686
and the face staring back
was my own.

93
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:25,887
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

94
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,522
then it would be
less disturbing.

95
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:29,624
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

96
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:30,859
You never laugh.

97
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:33,928
I laugh on the inside.

98
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,330
I'm not doing that now.

99
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:36,498
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

100
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,699
you're quite handsome.

101
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,900
Well, thank you.

102
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,503
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

103
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:42,539
All right.

104
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:46,407
Prepare for...

105
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,344
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

106
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,614
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

107
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,582
This time, Torfa.

108
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:55,683
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

109
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,989
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

110
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,557
The Skrull general, Talos,

111
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,425
has sent kill units
to find him.

112
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:05,994
Should they reach him
before we do...

113
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:07,395
the intelligence
he's acquired

114
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,965
over three years
is as good as theirs.

115
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,900
The Accusers will bomb

116
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:14,002
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

117
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:17,472
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

118
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:20,608
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

119
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,877
The Torfan populace.

120
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,379
We are not to interfere
with them,

121
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,380
nor them with us.

122
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:28,917
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

123
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,919
Proceed with caution.

124
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,089
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

125
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:36,558
This is
a dangerous mission.

126
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,494
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

127
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:40,962
if that is our fate today.

128
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:42,096
For the good of all Kree.

129
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:43,393
For the good
of all Kree!

130
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:56,037
Vers,
track Soh-Larr's beacon.

131
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,742
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

132
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,127
Locals on the periphery.

133
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,529
Maybe a dozen.

134
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:22,965
Minn-Erva?

135
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,003
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

136
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:29,003
Repeat.

137
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,119
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

138
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:47,722
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

139
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:48,957
Only one way in,
only one way out.

140
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,692
We can get past the locals.

141
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:53,295
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

142
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:54,696
You don't have to go
with me. I'll go alone.

143
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:55,699
No, you won't.

144
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,837
Right. We keep a close radius.

145
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,874
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

146
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,110
Come on.

147
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,922
Att-Lass, you getting this?

148
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:22,226
Copy. I see them.

149
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,603
Get back!

150
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,172
Commander?

151
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:45,780
Get back! Back!

152
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:48,551
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

153
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,786
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

154
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,590
Does anybody copy?

155
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:58,962
I don't wanna hurt you.

156
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:02,799
Keep back!

157
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,204
Stay back!

158
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:13,975
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

159
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,678
They're just starving.

160
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:42,870
HGX-78.

161
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:45,675
TRT79-VVX6.

162
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,080
Get back.

163
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,323
Skrulls!

164
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,207
Vers!

165
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,409
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

166
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,279
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

167
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:42,299
Incoming!

168
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,304
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

169
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,640
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

170
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:53,242
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

171
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:54,476
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

172
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:57,011
How did you know the code?

173
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,250
How about
I tell you my secret...

174
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:03,287
when you've told me yours?

175
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:08,325
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

176
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:22,970
<i>Where are we?</i>

177
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,308
<i>Stand by.</i>

178
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,311
Where's your head at?

179
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,845
In the clouds.
Where's yours?

180
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,347
On my shoulders.

181
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,183
About to show these boys
how we do it.

182
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:35,750
You ready?

183
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:36,817
Higher, further,
faster, baby.

184
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:37,820
That's right.

185
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:49,132
<i>This can't be right.</i>

186
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,000
<i>Go back even further.</i>

187
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,075
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

188
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:15,224
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

189
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:16,359
What the hell
are you thinking?

190
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,392
You don't belong out here!

191
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,093
<i>I think
we went back too far.</i>

192
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,495
You let him drive.

193
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:21,998
<i>Let me try something.</i>

194
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,800
Give up already!

195
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,304
You don't belong out here!

196
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:32,039
You're not strong enough.

197
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,310
You'll kill yourself.

198
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,948
They'll never let you fly.

199
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,352
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

200
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:45,587
You're a decent pilot.

201
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:46,622
But you're too emotional.

202
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:49,890
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

203
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:00,402
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

204
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:03,505
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

205
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:04,473
And so,

206
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:07,108
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

207
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,444
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

208
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,080
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

209
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:15,350
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

210
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:16,585
<i>Charming memory.</i>

211
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:17,918
<i>Hang on.</i>

212
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,223
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

213
00:16:23,993 --> 00:16:25,460
Goose likes you.

214
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,094
She doesn't typically
take to people.

215
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:28,497
Early start to your morning.

216
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:29,930
Uh, late night, actually.

217
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,999
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

218
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:32,933
Sound familiar?

219
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:34,538
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

220
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,639
Wonderful view, isn't it?

221
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,874
I prefer the view
from up there.

222
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,176
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

223
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:43,312
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

224
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,014
<i>Stand by.</i>

225
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,051
Sound familiar?

226
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,422
Wonderful view, isn't it?

227
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:55,457
I prefer the view
from up there.

228
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,891
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

229
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:57,992
<i>What's that
on her shirt?</i>

230
00:16:57,994 --> 00:16:59,196
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>

231
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,499
Wonderful view, isn't it?

232
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,436
I prefer the view
from up there.

233
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:10,037
<i>- Focus.</i>
- Excuse me?

234
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,906
<i>Look down.</i>

235
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,941
<i>Focus.</i>

236
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:16,611
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

237
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:17,579
Do you hear that, too?

238
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,216
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>

239
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,883
<i>Got it.</i>

240
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:25,289
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

241
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,228
<i>Interesting.</i>

242
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:35,330
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>

243
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:38,135
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

244
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,703
That's no MiG, Lawson.

245
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:44,339
<i>This is it.
Now let me see where you're headed.</i>

246
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,510
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

247
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,579
<i>Focus.</i>

248
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,214
<i>Open, please.</i>

249
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,582
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

250
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,649
<i>You're almost there.</i>

251
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,520
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

252
00:17:58,255 --> 00:17:59,456
<i>Focus!</i>

253
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:02,959
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

254
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,029
This doesn't make any sense.

255
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,250
Do we have any information
we can act on?

256
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:31,051
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

257
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,187
We're on our way.

258
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:35,055
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

259
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:38,228
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

260
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:40,930
And everything we're after.

261
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:49,506
Oh!

262
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:51,773
That did something.

263
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,210
Try that again.

264
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:05,722
Not yet!

265
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,466
What did you do to me?

266
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,434
Now we're just after
a little information.

267
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:21,136
What did you put in my head?

268
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,039
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

269
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,141
But those aren't my memories.

270
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:28,677
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

271
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,179
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

272
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,381
They really did
a number on you.

273
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:34,549
Enough of your mind games.

274
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,451
What do you want?

275
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,722
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

276
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:42,491
and her light-speed engine.

277
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:44,359
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

278
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:47,997
Really? Then why is she
in your head?

279
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:20,094
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

280
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,097
how these things come off,
would ya?

281
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:22,731
No?

282
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,133
Fine.

283
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:47,824
Hmm.

284
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:56,793
Hey.

285
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,467
<i>You do
know why they call it a...</i>

286
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:23,718
You leaving so soon?

287
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,255
We're just getting to know
each other.

288
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:51,641
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

289
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,513
Hello? Do you copy?

290
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,942
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.

291
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:29,279
Is this C-53?

292
00:24:31,748 --> 00:24:34,516
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

293
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:36,785
Yeah. I understand you.

294
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:37,852
Oh, good.

295
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,890
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

296
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,561
Sort of. Uh,
the movie theater has its own guy.

297
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:47,831
Where can I find
communications equipment?

298
00:24:54,938 --> 00:24:56,039
Thank you.

299
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,074
Track the pod.
Find the girl.

300
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:34,711
She knows more
than she knows.

301
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,048
Hey.

302
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,750
This one's taken.

303
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:53,027
Come on.

304
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,196
<i>Vers?</i>

305
00:25:54,198 --> 00:25:55,465
Vers?

306
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:58,133
Verify. CTC-39.

307
00:25:58,135 --> 00:25:59,601
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

308
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:00,770
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

309
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:03,504
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

310
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:05,473
Skrull ambush.

311
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,075
I thought we'd lost you.

312
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:08,210
Did you find Soh-Larr?

313
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,711
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

314
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:11,779
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

315
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:14,015
That's impossible.

316
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:16,017
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

317
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:17,585
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

318
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:18,686
The machine that they used...

319
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:21,089
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

320
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:22,224
Vers, where are you?

321
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:24,626
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

322
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:27,028
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

323
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,630
<i>Who?</i>

324
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:31,866
She's who I see.

325
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,570
<i>She's what?</i>

326
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:35,572
<i>Vers?</i>

327
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,641
Vers, what?

328
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,242
She's a scientist.

329
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:42,477
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

330
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,078
I have to get to her
before they do...

331
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,780
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

332
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:47,584
No. You've been
caught once already.

333
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:50,952
How far is C-53?

334
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:53,655
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

335
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:55,790
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

336
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,859
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

337
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:59,827
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

338
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:00,929
<i>We're sorry.</i>

339
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,096
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

340
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:02,597
<i>is required for the number
you have dialed.</i>

341
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,801
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?

342
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:07,336
Vers?

343
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,836
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>

344
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:10,939
Vers?

345
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:13,775
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

346
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:15,779
She's stronger
than you think.

347
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:18,615
Ever been to C-53?

348
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,217
Once.

349
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:23,185
It's a real shithole.

350
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,633
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

351
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:45,142
Did you call this in?

352
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:00,890
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

353
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:05,860
Excuse me, miss.

354
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:08,297
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

355
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:11,766
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

356
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:14,271
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

357
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:17,172
Oh.

358
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:19,841
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

359
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:23,178
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

360
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,682
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

361
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,684
Could I see
some identification, please?

362
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:31,186
Vers. Kree Starforce.

363
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:32,287
We don't carry
our identification

364
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,355
on little cards.

365
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:34,557
Vers?

366
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:37,060
Starforce?

367
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,028
How long you plan
to be in town?

368
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,196
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

369
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:42,663
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

370
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,235
that are infiltrating
your planet.

371
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,603
Skrulls?

372
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:48,170
Shapeshifters?

373
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:51,242
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

374
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,909
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

375
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,812
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

376
00:28:57,814 --> 00:29:03,185
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

377
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:05,154
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

378
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:07,222
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

379
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:10,325
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

380
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:12,595
You're under arrest.

381
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:21,638
Rook!

382
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,740
Rook, let's roll!

383
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:34,749
Did you see her weapon?

384
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:35,850
I did not.

385
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:46,896
Watch it!

386
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:21,931
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

387
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:45,788
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

388
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,929
"Trust me, true believer."

389
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:40,043
Get off!

390
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,434
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

391
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:42,439
Let's greet them
at the station.

392
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,085
<i>Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.</i>

393
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,122
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

394
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:02,990
And, uh,
where'd everybody go?

395
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,994
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>

396
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:34,549
We need an ambulance!

397
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,016
Someone call 911!

398
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:37,552
Hey! You all right?

399
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:39,554
Oh, my gosh!
Is everyone okay?

400
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:40,522
Anyone else see that?

401
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:44,259
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

402
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,443
Nice scuba suit.

403
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,550
Lighten up, honey, huh?

404
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:43,420
Got a smile for me?

405
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:48,958
Freak.

406
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:12,112
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

407
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:14,483
Whatever he runs on,

408
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:16,050
it's not
on the periodic table.

409
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,522
You're saying
he's not from around here?

410
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:20,591
Hey, how's your eye?

411
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:24,091
Well, I'd say fine...

412
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:26,396
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

413
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:34,236
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

414
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:36,271
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

415
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:39,174
And the woman said
that there were more?

416
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:41,243
The word she used
was "infiltration."

417
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,410
You believe her?

418
00:36:42,412 --> 00:36:44,713
Not till I saw this.

419
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:47,782
What's your plan?

420
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:49,751
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

421
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,153
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

422
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:54,088
that fits her description.

423
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,825
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

424
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:59,261
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

425
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:00,264
Good.

426
00:37:01,532 --> 00:37:04,100
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

427
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,335
Not even our own men.

428
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:08,539
Yes, sir.

429
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:26,187
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

430
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:29,693
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

431
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,133
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

432
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:41,805
I will finish
what we started.

433
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,482
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

434
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,253
No one in or out.

435
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:33,188
Boom!

436
00:38:58,382 --> 00:38:59,814
What can I get ya?

437
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:01,385
Where was
this photograph taken?

438
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:03,551
An airport.

439
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:04,886
Where's Pegasus?

440
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,955
That's classified.

441
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:10,327
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

442
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:14,629
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

443
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:16,464
Grunge is a good look
for you.

444
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,999
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

445
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,701
It was cool, you know?

446
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:22,671
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

447
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:26,708
Got to watch
an alien autopsy.

448
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,443
Typical nine-to-five.

449
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:29,377
So you saw one?

450
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:32,349
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

451
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:35,550
but I can't unsee that.

452
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:38,253
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

453
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,622
You think I'm one of
those green things.

454
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:41,990
Can't be too careful.

455
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:46,961
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

456
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:48,496
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

457
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:50,598
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

458
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,534
No. The DNA would match.

459
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:53,735
Want my AOL password?

460
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:55,770
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

461
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,774
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

462
00:39:58,942 --> 00:40:00,875
You wanna get personal.

463
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:02,777
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

464
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:04,412
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

465
00:40:04,414 --> 00:40:05,880
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

466
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,382
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

467
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:08,450
Do I pass?

468
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:09,851
Not yet. First job?

469
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,720
Soldier. Straight out of
high school.

470
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:12,987
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

471
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:14,355
- Then?
- Spy.

472
00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:15,490
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

473
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:16,725
We were everywhere.

474
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:19,594
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

475
00:40:19,596 --> 00:40:21,329
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

476
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:22,497
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

477
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:23,598
for the past six years...

478
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,699
trying to figure out
where our

479
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:25,767
future enemies
are coming from.

480
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:26,968
Never occurred to me

481
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,504
they would be coming
from above.

482
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:30,839
Name a detail so bizarre

483
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,275
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

484
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:38,348
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

485
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,783
You didn't need that,
did you?

486
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:43,520
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

487
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,854
Okay. Your turn.

488
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:47,591
Prove you're not a Skrull.

489
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,767
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

490
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:00,068
you're not a Skrull?

491
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,471
That's a photon blast.

492
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:02,904
And?

493
00:41:02,906 --> 00:41:03,907
A Skrull can't do that.

494
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,374
So, a full bird colonel

495
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,642
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

496
00:41:07,644 --> 00:41:10,013
must have pretty high
security clearance.

497
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:11,715
Where's Pegasus?

498
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:20,455
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

499
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:22,390
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

500
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:26,561
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

501
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:29,097
Heroes.
Noble warrior heroes.

502
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:32,769
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

503
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:35,937
They believe
that she developed

504
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:37,939
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

505
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:39,576
Light-speed engine?

506
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:41,976
Gotta admit, that's not

507
00:41:41,978 --> 00:41:43,545
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

508
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:45,147
Well, it's still early.

509
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:47,415
And you,
what do you want?

510
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,717
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

511
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,720
And?

512
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:58,426
Look, war is
a universal language.

513
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:01,129
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

514
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:03,533
You got a personal stake
in this.

515
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:15,443
<i>This is government property.</i>

516
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,445
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

517
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:20,615
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

518
00:42:20,617 --> 00:42:22,752
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

519
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:25,687
<i>One moment.</i>

520
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:29,824
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

521
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:31,559
Everybody calls me Fury.

522
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:35,597
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

523
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,065
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

524
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,800
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

525
00:42:38,802 --> 00:42:39,968
What about your kids?

526
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,903
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

527
00:42:41,905 --> 00:42:43,138
<i>You are cleared
for access.</i>

528
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,141
Thank you.

529
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:15,970
Oh, hold up.

530
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,708
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

531
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,711
Put that on.

532
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,180
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

533
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:27,982
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

534
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:29,717
help with the covert part
of your job?

535
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,922
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

536
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,124
Lose the flannel.

537
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:47,236
How can I help you?

538
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:49,439
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

539
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,875
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

540
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:56,079
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

541
00:43:57,714 --> 00:43:59,115
Do you know her?

542
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:04,754
Follow me.

543
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:06,456
Hmm.

544
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:12,462
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

545
00:44:13,264 --> 00:44:14,464
No.

546
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:17,934
Well, this ain't it.

547
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:26,574
Is that a communicator?

548
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:29,944
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

549
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:31,146
Who are you paging?

550
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:34,884
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

551
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,722
After you.

552
00:45:14,724 --> 00:45:16,358
Impressive.

553
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,129
Oh, you should see what I
can do with a paperclip.

554
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,108
Hey, there. How are you?

555
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:36,978
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

556
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,614
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

557
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:41,849
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

558
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:42,984
What's your name?

559
00:45:42,986 --> 00:45:45,887
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

560
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:46,890
Fury?

561
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:48,159
Hmm?

562
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:51,728
I'll be back.

563
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:57,266
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

564
00:45:57,268 --> 00:45:58,835
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

565
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:05,640
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

566
00:46:05,642 --> 00:46:06,774
When all you had to do was...

567
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:08,179
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

568
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,331
Huh. Lawson.

569
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:40,677
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

570
00:46:41,945 --> 00:46:44,112
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

571
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:48,618
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

572
00:46:51,087 --> 00:46:52,223
Kree glyphs?

573
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:53,857
Hmm?

574
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,826
Lawson is not cuckoo.

575
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:00,928
She's Kree.

576
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,432
Well, she's dead.

577
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:05,099
What?

578
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,901
She crashed
the Asis aircraft

579
00:47:06,903 --> 00:47:08,970
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

580
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:11,072
Took a pilot down
with her.

581
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:13,342
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

582
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:16,380
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

583
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:20,817
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

584
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:25,855
When did this crash happen?

585
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,726
Six years ago. 1989.

586
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,060
Who was the pilot?

587
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:36,331
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

588
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,801
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

589
00:47:40,803 --> 00:47:42,839
Last person
to see them alive.

590
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:49,246
You okay?

591
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,216
Mm-hmm.

592
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:55,118
Back in a minute.

593
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:27,416
This isn't about
fighting wars.

594
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:29,018
It's about ending them.

595
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:36,824
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

596
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:39,894
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

597
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:42,531
<i>Do you know anything
about this?</i>

598
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,266
I just discovered
a mission report

599
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:46,100
sent from C-53.

600
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:47,202
There's only so much

601
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:49,906
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

602
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,912
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

603
00:48:57,914 --> 00:49:01,516
She was working
on a unique energy core.

604
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:03,017
Experimenting with tech

605
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:05,888
that apparently could
help us win the war.

606
00:49:12,563 --> 00:49:14,028
She still here?

607
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:16,531
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

608
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,567
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,537
I want to
question her alone.

610
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:24,508
Excellent work, Nicholas.

611
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:30,279
Does it say anything
about me?

612
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:32,147
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

613
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:33,080
<i>Why would it?</i>

614
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:36,518
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

615
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,222
<i>On C-53?</i>

616
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,123
Mar-Vell is who I see

617
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,558
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

618
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,028
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

619
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,364
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

620
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:51,333
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.

621
00:49:51,335 --> 00:49:53,268
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

622
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,604
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

623
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:59,075
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

624
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:02,344
She's on sublevel six.

625
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:03,978
I'll get off on five...

626
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,149
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

627
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:10,285
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

628
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:13,257
Right. Like we did
in Havana.

629
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,200
<i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i>

630
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:27,569
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>

631
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:30,138
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

632
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,841
Together.

633
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:35,546
Okay.

634
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:54,897
Vers!

635
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,867
Vers!

636
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:16,385
Fury's colluding
with the target.

637
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:17,719
Then why would he call us in?

638
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:19,287
All I know is
we take him in, too.

639
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:20,422
Dead or alive.

640
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:21,723
Dead or alive?

641
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,775
Go. Go, go!

642
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:52,456
Was it something I said?

643
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:11,508
Mmm-mmm.

644
00:52:31,195 --> 00:52:35,597
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

645
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,603
but they do
kinda complete the look.

646
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:41,538
Don't you think?

647
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:00,322
You called them in?

648
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:01,658
My bad.

649
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:17,839
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

650
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:19,576
They're not down here.

651
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,145
Let's try up there.

652
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:32,687
- What?
- Your communicator.

653
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:34,756
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

654
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:07,255
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

655
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:08,390
Uh, we'll see.

656
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:09,793
That's a yes or no question.

657
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,831
Yes.

658
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:20,102
That's what I'm talking about!

659
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,565
We got a stowaway.

660
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:53,737
Hang on, Goose.

661
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:00,109
Goose.

662
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,281
No, Goose.

663
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:09,250
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

664
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:10,919
Yes, that's right.

665
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:13,288
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

666
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,589
You the good kitty,
that's right.

667
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:15,726
See anyone you know?

668
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,260
Funny story.

669
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:22,799
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

670
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:24,899
That was six years ago.

671
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:27,302
So, you think
you're the pilot

672
00:55:27,304 --> 00:55:28,637
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

673
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,972
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

674
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:32,307
could probably tell us.

675
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:33,908
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,611
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

677
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,282
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

678
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:42,751
That agent...

679
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:44,819
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

680
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:46,888
Coulson. The new guy.

681
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,490
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

682
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,227
Yeah, well, give him time.

683
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:53,895
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

684
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:56,331
Went with his gut
against orders.

685
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,766
That's a really
hard thing to do.

686
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:59,801
But it's what
keeps us human.

687
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:02,437
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

688
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:03,571
Oh, I can see that about you.

689
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:08,877
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

690
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:10,311
I'm guessing that's not

691
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:11,946
standard
Kree operating procedure.

692
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:14,315
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

693
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:23,591
Ronan.

694
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:25,627
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

695
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:27,028
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>

696
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,430
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

697
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:29,898
It was a trap

698
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,734
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

699
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:33,868
<i>Give us their location.</i>

700
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,737
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>

701
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:38,673
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

702
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:40,875
No, we'll handle this.

703
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:42,977
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

704
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:45,313
<i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i>

705
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:46,381
<i>Where are they?</i>

706
00:56:46,383 --> 00:56:47,951
- They are...
- Lost.

707
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:51,753
They are lost for now.

708
00:56:51,755 --> 00:56:53,488
But we will find them.

709
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,860
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

710
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:03,500
Maintain the course
for C-53.

711
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:24,888
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

712
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:28,590
Auntie Carol?

713
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:30,527
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

714
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,429
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

715
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:36,500
But we knew they were lying.

716
00:57:38,602 --> 00:57:40,704
I'm not really
who you think I am.

717
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,980
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

718
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:55,116
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

719
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,818
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

720
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,553
There is no such thing.

721
00:57:58,555 --> 00:57:59,921
'Cause if there were,

722
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:02,624
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

723
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:03,693
You don't believe me?

724
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:13,434
No way!

725
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:15,503
That's so cool!

726
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:16,938
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

727
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,373
with those hands.

728
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:19,474
Like what? Show us.

729
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:20,777
Maybe later.

730
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,511
I kept all your stuff.

731
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:25,647
I'll go get it.

732
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:27,317
You want to give her
a hand with that?

733
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:28,618
Hmm?

734
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:45,569
You don't remember anything?

735
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:50,373
I see flashes.

736
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:52,809
Little moments.

737
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,412
But I can't tell
what's real.

738
00:58:57,647 --> 00:59:01,516
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

739
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:03,753
maybe it'll all
make sense.

740
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:10,159
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

741
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:12,594
Your usual move.

742
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,530
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

743
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:18,066
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

744
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,768
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

745
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,070
at doing something
that mattered.

746
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:24,973
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

747
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:25,907
and I wasn't about to argue,

748
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:28,009
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

749
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:30,445
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

750
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:32,013
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

751
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:33,114
Since it violates
the predetermined

752
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:34,216
rules of engagement.

753
00:59:34,218 --> 00:59:35,683
I definitely
don't remember those.

754
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:37,485
Hmm. Of course you don't.

755
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:47,695
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

756
00:59:47,697 --> 00:59:51,699
She said
she had lives to save.

757
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,101
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

758
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,236
but you said that...

759
00:59:54,238 --> 00:59:58,039
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

760
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:02,911
Yeah. Yep.
Big hero moment.

761
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:06,848
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

762
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,652
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

763
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:15,192
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

764
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:18,726
I know this must be
hard for you.

765
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:20,664
Oh, what?
This part right here?

766
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:23,800
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

767
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:31,039
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

768
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,573
in a mission so secret

769
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:34,644
they act like it never
even happened.

770
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:40,182
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

771
01:00:40,184 --> 01:00:42,085
too damn stubborn to die.

772
01:00:43,553 --> 01:00:46,288
And now you come up in here
after six years...

773
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,523
with your supercharged
fire hands...

774
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:50,625
and you expect me
to call you...

775
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:52,163
I don't even know what.
Vers?

776
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:55,932
Is that really
who you are now?

777
01:00:58,235 --> 01:00:59,970
I don't know.

778
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,676
Come look!

779
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:14,816
This is me and you
on Halloween.

780
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:18,187
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

781
01:01:18,189 --> 01:01:19,921
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

782
01:01:19,923 --> 01:01:21,889
You didn't get along
with your parents...

783
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:23,658
so Mom said
we became your real family.

784
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,227
This is us on Christmas.

785
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:26,362
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

786
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:28,297
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

787
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:29,630
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

788
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:30,698
And this is right after
you graduated.

789
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,933
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

790
01:01:31,935 --> 01:01:34,169
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

791
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:35,570
And this is you with Mom

792
01:01:35,572 --> 01:01:36,838
right after a good day
of training.

793
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,140
These were
your three favorite guys.

794
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:41,876
Oh, wait. I forgot.

795
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:43,578
Your jacket.

796
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,912
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

797
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:46,616
after I spilled
ketchup on it.

798
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:02,132
That was all
that survived the crash.

799
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:05,101
Or so we thought.

800
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:11,739
Don't answer that.

801
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:13,375
It's just my neighbor.

802
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:15,111
They can change into anyone.

803
01:02:20,384 --> 01:02:21,883
Hi there.

804
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:22,886
What do you want?

805
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,054
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

806
01:02:26,056 --> 01:02:27,722
This is my friend, Carol.

807
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:29,025
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

808
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:32,394
Yowzers.

809
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:35,630
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

810
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:38,333
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

811
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,667
and I was just wondering...

812
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:40,835
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

813
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:42,036
to get a closer look-see?

814
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:44,373
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

815
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:47,677
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

816
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:49,010
Mmm.

817
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:50,645
You're really working
overtime

818
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:54,015
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

819
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:56,818
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

820
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,420
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

821
01:02:58,422 --> 01:03:00,324
- Uh...
- Okay.

822
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:06,661
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

823
01:03:06,663 --> 01:03:07,895
You never know
when you're gonna need

824
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:09,599
to borrow some sugar.

825
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:14,436
Now, hang on a second.

826
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:18,140
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

827
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:21,111
making a mess
of your friend's house...

828
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:23,312
It's a lovely home, miss.

829
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:24,614
Oh, my God!

830
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:26,981
What the hell?

831
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:31,855
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

832
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:35,022
Just don't kill me.

833
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:36,991
That would really complicate
the situation.

834
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:39,794
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

835
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:41,163
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

836
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:42,930
I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

837
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:46,701
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

838
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:47,969
Without deception.

839
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:49,173
And who is that out there?

840
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:52,707
Okay, that's a fair point...

841
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:54,309
but I'm sure
that you understand

842
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:56,744
I had to take
some precautions.

843
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:59,947
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

844
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:01,115
with your hands bound.

845
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:02,351
I just wanna talk.

846
01:04:02,353 --> 01:04:03,418
Last time we talked,

847
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,852
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

848
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:07,356
That was before I knew
who you were.

849
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,660
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

850
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:13,928
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

851
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,964
of your voice
from a plane crash

852
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:18,433
six years ago...

853
01:04:18,435 --> 01:04:23,238
on a device I believe
you call a "black box."

854
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,973
They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.

855
01:04:25,975 --> 01:04:27,176
How'd you get it?

856
01:04:27,178 --> 01:04:28,343
She don't understand.

857
01:04:28,345 --> 01:04:29,877
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

858
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,313
that kind of allows me

859
01:04:31,315 --> 01:04:33,482
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

860
01:04:33,484 --> 01:04:34,849
Call me
"young lady" again...

861
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,151
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

862
01:04:36,153 --> 01:04:37,687
it's not supposed to be.

863
01:04:39,756 --> 01:04:42,025
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

864
01:04:42,493 --> 01:04:43,559
Your ass.

865
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:46,461
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

866
01:04:46,463 --> 01:04:48,430
But, look,
I just need your help

867
01:04:48,432 --> 01:04:49,931
decoding some coordinates.

868
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:51,933
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

869
01:04:51,935 --> 01:04:55,071
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

870
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,009
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

871
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:01,776
Deal.

872
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:04,912
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

873
01:05:04,914 --> 01:05:06,248
How'd that get in here?

874
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,351
Hmm?

875
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:09,951
The cat?

876
01:05:09,953 --> 01:05:11,453
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

877
01:05:11,455 --> 01:05:12,755
That's not a cat.

878
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,957
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

879
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:17,461
Mom?

880
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:26,201
Monica.

881
01:05:26,203 --> 01:05:27,837
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

882
01:05:55,499 --> 01:05:57,165
What's happening?

883
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:58,469
It's loading.

884
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:04,005
<i>Punch in the coordinates</i>

885
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:08,443
<i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

886
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:10,545
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

887
01:06:10,547 --> 01:06:12,180
<i>My laboratory.</i>

888
01:06:12,182 --> 01:06:14,483
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

889
01:06:14,485 --> 01:06:15,517
<i>Oh, no.</i>

890
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,985
<i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>

891
01:06:17,987 --> 01:06:19,454
<i>It's not showing up
on my radar.</i>

892
01:06:19,456 --> 01:06:21,356
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

893
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:23,891
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

894
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:25,960
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

895
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:26,963
Yes, ma'am.

896
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,304
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

897
01:06:35,306 --> 01:06:36,906
I never should have
brought you along.

898
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:43,079
Here come some G's.

899
01:07:02,533 --> 01:07:04,301
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

900
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,046
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

901
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:22,085
Stay with me, Lawson!

902
01:07:40,304 --> 01:07:41,703
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

903
01:07:41,705 --> 01:07:44,373
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

904
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:46,141
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

905
01:07:46,143 --> 01:07:48,278
Yeah! I copy.

906
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,081
Doc?

907
01:07:53,082 --> 01:07:54,451
Your blood.

908
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:57,185
It's blue.

909
01:07:57,187 --> 01:08:00,324
Yeah, but, uh,
how's my hair?

910
01:08:01,692 --> 01:08:04,194
Help me out, will ya?

911
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:10,399
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

912
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:11,999
Lawson?

913
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:14,503
You remember what I said about
our work here?

914
01:08:14,505 --> 01:08:15,606
What it's for?

915
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,140
To end wars?

916
01:08:18,142 --> 01:08:21,645
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

917
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:24,381
Damn it!

918
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:27,416
My name is not Lawson.

919
01:08:27,418 --> 01:08:30,519
My real name is Mar-Vell,

920
01:08:30,521 --> 01:08:33,455
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

921
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:37,024
I would say
that you're delusional...

922
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:38,560
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

923
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:41,061
and your blood is blue.

924
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:45,065
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

925
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,001
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

926
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:48,303
any more regrets.

927
01:08:48,305 --> 01:08:51,038
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

928
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,641
You gotta save 'em without me.

929
01:08:52,643 --> 01:08:53,642
Save who? How?

930
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:57,044
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

931
01:08:57,046 --> 01:08:58,282
What are you doing?

932
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:20,304
We have no interest
in hurting you.

933
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:21,870
No?

934
01:09:21,872 --> 01:09:24,741
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

935
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:27,744
The energy core.

936
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:30,145
Where is it?

937
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:32,581
Pararescue's on the way.

938
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:34,749
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

939
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:37,586
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

940
01:09:37,588 --> 01:09:38,622
No, wait!

941
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:46,463
You mean that energy core?

942
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,202
No!

943
01:10:35,712 --> 01:10:39,347
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

944
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:40,350
Hold your fire.

945
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,394
There's nothing left.

946
01:10:52,396 --> 01:10:54,130
The core has been destroyed.

947
01:11:03,607 --> 01:11:05,609
She absorbed its power.

948
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:09,646
She's coming with us.

949
01:11:30,534 --> 01:11:31,835
He lied to me.

950
01:11:34,538 --> 01:11:36,638
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

951
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,374
Now, you understand.

952
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:41,910
What?
What do I understand now?

953
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:43,945
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

954
01:11:43,947 --> 01:11:45,248
He killed her...

955
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:47,849
'cause she found out
that she was

956
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:51,286
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

957
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:52,787
No.

958
01:11:52,789 --> 01:11:55,223
Your people are terrorists.

959
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:56,758
They kill innocents.

960
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,693
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

961
01:11:58,695 --> 01:12:02,397
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

962
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,468
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

963
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:09,571
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

964
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,706
and they destroyed
our planet.

965
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:15,443
And the handful of us
that are left

966
01:12:15,445 --> 01:12:17,612
will be slaughtered next...

967
01:12:17,614 --> 01:12:21,618
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

968
01:12:22,853 --> 01:12:24,452
The core that she found

969
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:26,221
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

970
01:12:26,223 --> 01:12:27,989
capable of carrying us
to safety.

971
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:32,162
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

972
01:12:33,563 --> 01:12:35,897
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

973
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:37,432
wasn't to fight wars...

974
01:12:37,434 --> 01:12:38,933
but to end them.

975
01:12:38,935 --> 01:12:44,574
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

976
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:46,741
Well, I already destroyed it.

977
01:12:46,743 --> 01:12:48,510
No, you destroyed
the engine.

978
01:12:48,512 --> 01:12:51,646
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

979
01:12:51,648 --> 01:12:56,017
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

980
01:12:56,019 --> 01:12:57,654
we can find it.

981
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:01,191
You'll use it
to destroy us.

982
01:13:03,427 --> 01:13:06,396
We just want a home.

983
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,904
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

984
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:17,906
Can't you see it now?

985
01:13:17,908 --> 01:13:19,409
You're not one of them.

986
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:23,847
You don't know me.

987
01:13:25,348 --> 01:13:27,718
You have no idea
who I am.

988
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,222
I don't even know
who I am!

989
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:35,692
You are Carol Danvers.

990
01:13:36,893 --> 01:13:39,060
You are the woman
on that black box

991
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:41,698
risking her life
to do the right thing.

992
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:45,467
My best friend...

993
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:48,470
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

994
01:13:48,472 --> 01:13:50,538
when no one else did.

995
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:55,744
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

996
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:59,080
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

997
01:13:59,082 --> 01:14:02,352
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

998
01:14:02,953 --> 01:14:04,488
You hear me?

999
01:14:05,822 --> 01:14:07,657
Do you hear me?

1000
01:14:14,865 --> 01:14:16,867
Come here. Come here, girl.

1001
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:18,935
I got you.

1002
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:26,541
<i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1003
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:28,777
but you were our only lead.

1004
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:31,045
We discovered
that your energy signature

1005
01:14:31,047 --> 01:14:33,850
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1006
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:36,586
Now we know why.

1007
01:14:38,455 --> 01:14:42,425
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1008
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:45,360
I just need your help

1009
01:14:45,362 --> 01:14:49,564
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1010
01:14:49,566 --> 01:14:52,734
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1011
01:14:52,736 --> 01:14:54,803
For orbital position
and velocity.

1012
01:14:54,805 --> 01:14:56,638
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1013
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,972
'cause it's not on Earth.

1014
01:14:57,974 --> 01:14:58,907
That was the location

1015
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:00,508
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1016
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,876
If we track its course,

1017
01:15:01,878 --> 01:15:04,445
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1018
01:15:04,447 --> 01:15:06,016
It's just basic physics.

1019
01:15:08,585 --> 01:15:09,386
In orbit?

1020
01:15:11,521 --> 01:15:13,121
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1021
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:16,057
I mean, you're
my science guy, right?

1022
01:15:16,059 --> 01:15:18,793
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1023
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:21,629
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1024
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:23,498
Mmm. We're going
to space?

1025
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,566
In what?

1026
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:26,467
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1027
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:28,703
I can handle
the modifications.

1028
01:15:28,705 --> 01:15:30,440
Mmm. Your science guy.

1029
01:15:37,181 --> 01:15:38,815
Well, I could use
a copilot.

1030
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,750
No. No, I can't.

1031
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:44,786
I can't leave Monica.

1032
01:15:44,788 --> 01:15:48,089
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1033
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:50,458
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1034
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,527
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1035
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:53,563
and you used to do that.

1036
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,166
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1037
01:15:57,168 --> 01:15:58,833
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1038
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:00,668
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1039
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:01,769
with
a technologically-superior

1040
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:02,772
foreign enemy.

1041
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:04,772
Correct?

1042
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:05,840
That's what I'm saying.

1043
01:16:05,842 --> 01:16:07,108
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1044
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,509
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1045
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:09,744
in the history
of missions...

1046
01:16:09,746 --> 01:16:11,613
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1047
01:16:11,615 --> 01:16:12,816
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?

1048
01:16:13,617 --> 01:16:14,716
What?

1049
01:16:14,718 --> 01:16:15,917
I just think
you should consider...

1050
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:19,156
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1051
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,230
What's going on around here?

1052
01:16:28,232 --> 01:16:29,497
I know, I know.

1053
01:16:29,499 --> 01:16:30,901
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1054
01:16:35,906 --> 01:16:38,240
Your mom's lucky.

1055
01:16:38,242 --> 01:16:39,741
When they were
handing out kids,

1056
01:16:39,743 --> 01:16:41,943
they gave her
the toughest one.

1057
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:42,946
Lieutenant Trouble.

1058
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,582
You remembered.

1059
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,418
Is that mine?

1060
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:51,253
No, no.

1061
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:54,122
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1062
01:16:54,124 --> 01:16:56,824
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1063
01:16:56,826 --> 01:16:59,694
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1064
01:16:59,696 --> 01:17:02,764
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1065
01:17:02,766 --> 01:17:04,634
with any sense of style...

1066
01:17:05,869 --> 01:17:06,937
Hmm?

1067
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:10,073
Whoa.

1068
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:13,877
No.

1069
01:17:16,147 --> 01:17:17,148
Uh-uh.

1070
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:20,249
Definitely not.

1071
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,655
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1072
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:37,867
Hmm.

1073
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,837
How do I look?

1074
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:45,709
Fresh.

1075
01:18:05,628 --> 01:18:07,695
What took you so long?

1076
01:18:07,697 --> 01:18:10,665
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

1077
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:13,101
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1078
01:18:13,103 --> 01:18:14,871
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1079
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:18,240
Okay, then let's do this.

1080
01:18:18,242 --> 01:18:21,709
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1081
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:24,612
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1082
01:18:24,614 --> 01:18:25,782
But you would never
tell me who.

1083
01:18:27,218 --> 01:18:30,618
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1084
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,154
The transfusion.

1085
01:18:32,156 --> 01:18:34,356
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1086
01:18:34,358 --> 01:18:35,558
Whose blood?

1087
01:18:38,162 --> 01:18:39,196
Hmm.

1088
01:18:46,669 --> 01:18:50,707
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1089
01:18:55,246 --> 01:18:56,844
What have you done with her?

1090
01:18:56,846 --> 01:18:58,815
You're too late.

1091
01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:16,333
She knows?

1092
01:19:31,081 --> 01:19:34,649
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1093
01:19:34,651 --> 01:19:35,783
Come at once.

1094
01:19:35,785 --> 01:19:38,019
<i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>

1095
01:19:38,021 --> 01:19:41,055
<i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>

1096
01:19:42,992 --> 01:19:44,861
Passing 500 and climbing.

1097
01:19:48,031 --> 01:19:51,300
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1098
01:19:51,302 --> 01:19:54,769
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1099
01:19:54,771 --> 01:19:57,672
And as long as he continues
to freak you out...

1100
01:19:57,674 --> 01:19:58,940
like that...

1101
01:19:58,942 --> 01:20:01,343
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1102
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:04,346
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1103
01:20:04,348 --> 01:20:06,148
Can I ask you something?

1104
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,350
Do you just turn into
anything you want?

1105
01:20:08,352 --> 01:20:10,219
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1106
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:11,853
Can you all do it?

1107
01:20:11,855 --> 01:20:13,788
Physiologically? Yeah.

1108
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:16,057
But, uh, it takes practice...

1109
01:20:16,059 --> 01:20:19,994
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1110
01:20:19,996 --> 01:20:22,697
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1111
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:24,233
What about a filing cabinet?

1112
01:20:24,235 --> 01:20:27,302
Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet?

1113
01:20:27,304 --> 01:20:28,703
A Venus flytrap?

1114
01:20:28,705 --> 01:20:29,770
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1115
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:31,005
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1116
01:20:31,007 --> 01:20:32,807
Switching engines

1117
01:20:32,809 --> 01:20:35,044
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1118
01:20:44,188 --> 01:20:45,119
Hey.

1119
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:47,989
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1120
01:20:47,991 --> 01:20:48,992
Pretty much.

1121
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,794
Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1122
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:26,430
Where is it?

1123
01:21:30,033 --> 01:21:32,967
It's here.
It's gotta be here.

1124
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:38,175
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1125
01:21:43,813 --> 01:21:45,880
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

1126
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:50,579
Is that it? The core?

1127
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:53,016
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1128
01:22:59,122 --> 01:23:00,190
Whoa.

1129
01:23:01,858 --> 01:23:04,027
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1130
01:23:17,974 --> 01:23:19,073
We're not alone.

1131
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:43,400
Talos!

1132
01:23:53,344 --> 01:23:56,246
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1133
01:24:18,702 --> 01:24:20,069
It's okay.

1134
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,675
We didn't know what to do.

1135
01:24:26,677 --> 01:24:30,245
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1136
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:32,012
or the Kree would find us.

1137
01:24:32,014 --> 01:24:34,117
You did the right thing.

1138
01:24:43,594 --> 01:24:45,427
It's okay, it's okay.

1139
01:24:45,429 --> 01:24:47,498
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1140
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:51,466
I am not gonna hurt you.

1141
01:24:51,468 --> 01:24:53,370
She led me to you.

1142
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:55,572
I'm so sorry.

1143
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:58,673
I didn't know.

1144
01:24:58,675 --> 01:24:59,909
Carol.

1145
01:25:00,577 --> 01:25:03,412
This is war.

1146
01:25:03,414 --> 01:25:06,916
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1147
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:09,684
But we're here now.

1148
01:25:09,686 --> 01:25:12,922
You found my family.

1149
01:25:15,759 --> 01:25:17,726
This is just the beginning.

1150
01:25:17,728 --> 01:25:20,631
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1151
01:25:21,732 --> 01:25:24,501
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1152
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:44,619
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1153
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:46,621
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1154
01:25:49,259 --> 01:25:51,560
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1155
01:25:51,562 --> 01:25:52,663
Uh-uh.

1156
01:26:04,741 --> 01:26:07,041
What did you do
to your uniform?

1157
01:26:07,043 --> 01:26:09,177
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1158
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:11,045
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

1159
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:12,514
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1160
01:26:12,516 --> 01:26:15,082
Let 'em go.
You can have me.

1161
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:16,618
And the core?

1162
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,220
You lied to me.

1163
01:26:18,222 --> 01:26:22,224
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1164
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:28,530
What's given
can be taken away.

1165
01:26:42,346 --> 01:26:43,445
Back here! Move, move!

1166
01:26:43,447 --> 01:26:46,015
Get over here. Get down!

1167
01:26:46,517 --> 01:26:49,186
Let's go! Go, move!

1168
01:27:28,525 --> 01:27:30,258
There she is.

1169
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:33,697
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1170
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:36,464
This jacket.

1171
01:27:36,466 --> 01:27:38,468
It's killer,
by the way.

1172
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,469
Oh.

1173
01:27:41,471 --> 01:27:43,705
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1174
01:27:43,707 --> 01:27:45,540
Let me out.

1175
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:47,475
No can do.

1176
01:27:47,477 --> 01:27:51,379
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1177
01:27:51,381 --> 01:27:53,315
With what exactly?

1178
01:27:53,317 --> 01:27:54,716
Your power comes from us.

1179
01:27:54,718 --> 01:27:56,651
You didn't give me
these powers.

1180
01:27:56,653 --> 01:27:57,819
The blast did.

1181
01:27:57,821 --> 01:27:59,287
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1182
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:00,390
to control them
on your own.

1183
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:13,501
<i>Species: Flerken.</i>

1184
01:28:13,503 --> 01:28:15,503
<i>Threat: high.</i>

1185
01:28:20,444 --> 01:28:22,346
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1186
01:28:25,882 --> 01:28:27,582
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1187
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:29,786
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1188
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:32,487
That thing's
clearly busted.

1189
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:34,591
Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>

1190
01:28:35,425 --> 01:28:37,394
Eject the others into space.

1191
01:28:40,297 --> 01:28:42,332
You did good, Ace.

1192
01:28:43,834 --> 01:28:44,966
Thanks to you...

1193
01:28:44,968 --> 01:28:47,202
those insidious shapeshifters

1194
01:28:47,204 --> 01:28:48,770
will threaten
our borders no more.

1195
01:28:48,772 --> 01:28:51,306
I used to believe
your lies...

1196
01:28:51,308 --> 01:28:53,942
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1197
01:28:53,944 --> 01:28:55,644
You're talking
about destroying them

1198
01:28:55,646 --> 01:28:57,479
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1199
01:28:57,481 --> 01:28:58,680
And neither will I.

1200
01:28:58,682 --> 01:29:01,983
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1201
01:29:01,985 --> 01:29:03,652
You stole me.

1202
01:29:03,654 --> 01:29:06,488
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1203
01:29:14,498 --> 01:29:16,400
It's cute how hard you try.

1204
01:29:18,502 --> 01:29:20,237
But remember...

1205
01:29:21,505 --> 01:29:22,804
without us...

1206
01:29:22,806 --> 01:29:23,874
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1207
01:29:25,642 --> 01:29:26,941
<i>Stay down!</i>

1208
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:28,610
...you're weak.

1209
01:29:28,612 --> 01:29:30,545
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1210
01:29:30,547 --> 01:29:31,946
You're flawed.

1211
01:29:31,948 --> 01:29:33,316
<i>Are you trying
to kill yourself?</i>

1212
01:29:34,284 --> 01:29:35,350
Helpless.

1213
01:29:35,352 --> 01:29:36,418
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

1214
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,820
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1215
01:29:38,822 --> 01:29:40,522
We saved you.

1216
01:29:40,524 --> 01:29:41,990
<i>- Control it.
- I told you,</i>

1217
01:29:41,992 --> 01:29:43,058
<i>- Carol.
- They'll never</i>

1218
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,325
<i>- let you fly.
- This ain't</i>

1219
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:45,393
<i>- a game for little girls.
- You kiss like a horse.</i>

1220
01:29:45,395 --> 01:29:46,563
<i>You won't last
a week, Danvers.</i>

1221
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:52,703
Without us,
you're only human.

1222
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:55,472
You're right.

1223
01:29:56,673 --> 01:29:58,775
I'm only human.

1224
01:30:32,743 --> 01:30:36,344
On Hala,
you were reborn...

1225
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:37,647
Vers.

1226
01:30:42,652 --> 01:30:45,589
My name is Carol.

1227
01:31:00,403 --> 01:31:01,872
She's trying to break out.

1228
01:31:46,116 --> 01:31:49,586
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1229
01:31:50,554 --> 01:31:52,086
But what happens when...

1230
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:57,360
I'm finally set free?

1231
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:40,535
You know you're glowing,
right?

1232
01:32:40,537 --> 01:32:41,538
I'll explain it later.

1233
01:32:44,107 --> 01:32:45,573
Take the Tesseract.

1234
01:32:45,575 --> 01:32:46,808
Leave the lunchbox.

1235
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:48,543
- Me?
- Yes.

1236
01:32:48,545 --> 01:32:49,944
I'm not touching that thing.

1237
01:32:49,946 --> 01:32:51,014
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1238
01:32:56,887 --> 01:32:58,054
Whoa!

1239
01:33:04,761 --> 01:33:07,495
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1240
01:33:07,497 --> 01:33:10,165
Take the Flerken with you.

1241
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,935
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1242
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:15,739
I'm picking you up now.

1243
01:33:18,842 --> 01:33:21,444
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1244
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:27,617
Oh, hey, guys.

1245
01:33:31,521 --> 01:33:33,056
Arm wrestle
for the Tesseract?

1246
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,826
I used to find you amusing.

1247
01:33:38,828 --> 01:33:39,829
Let's put an end to this.

1248
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:16,167
Okay.

1249
01:34:16,733 --> 01:34:17,966
Good kitty.

1250
01:35:04,315 --> 01:35:06,116
You knew all along.

1251
01:35:07,218 --> 01:35:08,649
Is that why
we never hung out?

1252
01:35:08,651 --> 01:35:09,753
No, I just never
liked you.

1253
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:17,961
Incoming!

1254
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:27,570
Hey, in a hurry?

1255
01:35:29,773 --> 01:35:31,773
Don't make me do this.

1256
01:35:31,775 --> 01:35:32,776
Okay.

1257
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:49,659
Come on, do your thing!

1258
01:35:50,827 --> 01:35:51,895
Come on!

1259
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,763
Come on!

1260
01:35:58,802 --> 01:36:00,169
Damn it, Goose.

1261
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,272
Pick a side.

1262
01:36:05,642 --> 01:36:07,675
Take them
to the hangar, too.

1263
01:36:07,677 --> 01:36:09,378
We'll blast them all
into space.

1264
01:36:11,382 --> 01:36:12,582
Play it cool.

1265
01:36:13,983 --> 01:36:15,252
Just like Havana.

1266
01:36:17,087 --> 01:36:19,321
Do you have the thing?

1267
01:36:19,323 --> 01:36:20,957
Flerken kitty ate it.

1268
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:35,903
Come on, move!

1269
01:36:35,905 --> 01:36:37,040
Move!

1270
01:36:37,707 --> 01:36:38,942
Follow my lead.

1271
01:36:42,946 --> 01:36:43,947
Cover her eyes.

1272
01:36:52,356 --> 01:36:54,122
Onto the ship!

1273
01:36:54,124 --> 01:36:55,892
Let's go! Let's go!

1274
01:37:18,781 --> 01:37:21,082
Nice diversion.

1275
01:37:21,084 --> 01:37:22,886
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1276
01:38:19,909 --> 01:38:22,109
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1277
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:23,180
On it.

1278
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:29,018
You all right, friend?

1279
01:38:30,086 --> 01:38:32,021
Never better.

1280
01:38:36,859 --> 01:38:38,495
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1281
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:20,129
Yes! Boom!

1282
01:40:36,146 --> 01:40:37,314
Whoo!

1283
01:40:40,584 --> 01:40:42,051
What the hell was that?

1284
01:41:05,376 --> 01:41:07,478
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1285
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:01,363
That's impossible.

1286
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:03,732
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1287
01:42:03,734 --> 01:42:06,437
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1288
01:42:08,004 --> 01:42:10,407
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1289
01:42:14,778 --> 01:42:16,112
Take her down.

1290
01:42:36,065 --> 01:42:37,099
Whoo!

1291
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:28,519
Return to the jump point.

1292
01:43:29,553 --> 01:43:31,655
We'll be back
for the weapon.

1293
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:34,458
The core?

1294
01:43:36,326 --> 01:43:37,561
The woman.

1295
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:27,244
I'm so proud of you.

1296
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:30,612
You've come a long way

1297
01:44:30,614 --> 01:44:33,214
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1298
01:44:33,216 --> 01:44:35,383
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1299
01:44:35,385 --> 01:44:37,686
long enough to take me on?

1300
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:40,424
Or will they get the
better of you as always?

1301
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,725
I always told you...

1302
01:44:43,727 --> 01:44:45,226
you'll be ready

1303
01:44:45,228 --> 01:44:47,629
the day you can knock
me down as yourself.

1304
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:49,331
This is that moment.

1305
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:51,866
This is that moment, Vers!

1306
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:53,268
Turn off the light show...

1307
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:56,540
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1308
01:45:11,955 --> 01:45:14,157
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1309
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,207
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1310
01:45:32,209 --> 01:45:33,842
I can't go back empty-handed.

1311
01:45:33,844 --> 01:45:35,777
You won't be empty-handed.

1312
01:45:35,779 --> 01:45:38,346
I'm sending you
with a message.

1313
01:45:38,348 --> 01:45:41,616
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1314
01:45:41,618 --> 01:45:44,421
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1315
01:45:46,323 --> 01:45:47,624
You can't do this.

1316
01:46:06,543 --> 01:46:10,278
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1317
01:46:11,214 --> 01:46:12,714
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1318
01:46:12,716 --> 01:46:13,848
Ow!

1319
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:15,383
Mother Flerken!

1320
01:46:15,385 --> 01:46:16,818
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1321
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,455
It's just a scratch.

1322
01:46:18,755 --> 01:46:20,190
No.

1323
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,564
I can't believe

1324
01:46:29,566 --> 01:46:30,965
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1325
01:46:30,967 --> 01:46:32,600
and I missed it.

1326
01:46:32,602 --> 01:46:34,402
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1327
01:46:34,404 --> 01:46:36,571
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1328
01:46:36,573 --> 01:46:38,707
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1329
01:46:38,709 --> 01:46:40,608
I'll consider it...

1330
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:43,745
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1331
01:46:43,747 --> 01:46:44,946
How's your eye?

1332
01:46:44,948 --> 01:46:47,382
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1333
01:46:47,384 --> 01:46:48,683
Just so I'm clear...

1334
01:46:48,685 --> 01:46:50,318
you were Soh-Larr...

1335
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,754
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1336
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:55,356
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1337
01:46:55,358 --> 01:46:58,359
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1338
01:46:58,361 --> 01:46:59,694
It is a little like stealing.

1339
01:46:59,696 --> 01:47:01,429
Whose side are you on here?

1340
01:47:01,431 --> 01:47:02,931
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1341
01:47:02,933 --> 01:47:06,301
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1342
01:47:06,303 --> 01:47:07,902
I could go back
to being your boss.

1343
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,003
Uh, please don't.

1344
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:12,040
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1345
01:47:12,042 --> 01:47:14,676
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1346
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,711
Don't ever change
your eyes.

1347
01:47:16,713 --> 01:47:18,346
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1348
01:47:18,348 --> 01:47:20,014
I was trying
not to panic...

1349
01:47:20,016 --> 01:47:21,585
I'll help you find a home.

1350
01:47:22,652 --> 01:47:23,754
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1351
01:47:25,822 --> 01:47:28,323
They can stay here
with us.

1352
01:47:28,325 --> 01:47:29,891
Can't they, Mom?

1353
01:47:29,893 --> 01:47:32,527
They won't
be safe here, baby.

1354
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:34,095
Auntie Carol's right.

1355
01:47:34,097 --> 01:47:35,298
They need their own home.

1356
01:47:36,466 --> 01:47:38,666
I'll be back
before you know it.

1357
01:47:38,668 --> 01:47:42,036
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1358
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:45,006
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1359
01:47:45,008 --> 01:47:46,574
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1360
01:47:46,576 --> 01:47:48,378
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1361
01:47:57,988 --> 01:48:00,524
Keep the Tesseract
on Earth.

1362
01:48:01,091 --> 01:48:02,423
Hidden.

1363
01:48:02,425 --> 01:48:04,461
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1364
01:48:04,995 --> 01:48:06,394
Mar-Vell.

1365
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:07,762
That's what I said.

1366
01:48:07,764 --> 01:48:10,365
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1367
01:48:10,367 --> 01:48:11,766
Mar-Vell.

1368
01:48:11,768 --> 01:48:12,901
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1369
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:14,337
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1370
01:48:28,084 --> 01:48:29,050
Not ringing any bells?

1371
01:48:29,052 --> 01:48:31,087
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1372
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:48,670
I upgraded it.

1373
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:51,041
Range should be a couple
galaxies, at least.

1374
01:48:53,743 --> 01:48:56,044
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1375
01:48:56,046 --> 01:48:59,683
For emergencies only, okay?

1376
01:49:04,188 --> 01:49:07,055
Well...

1377
01:49:07,057 --> 01:49:09,591
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1378
01:49:09,593 --> 01:49:11,628
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1379
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,665
Oh!

1380
01:49:28,445 --> 01:49:30,480
We got
the ketchup stain off.

1381
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:37,654
Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1382
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:40,824
Hmm.

1383
01:49:46,897 --> 01:49:49,631
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1384
01:50:03,113 --> 01:50:04,447
Go on.

1385
01:51:11,315 --> 01:51:14,117
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1386
01:51:19,055 --> 01:51:20,224
So, is it true?

1387
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:22,824
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1388
01:51:22,826 --> 01:51:26,094
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1389
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:30,031
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1390
01:51:30,033 --> 01:51:31,101
Understood.

1391
01:51:32,736 --> 01:51:33,701
I'm sorry to report

1392
01:51:33,703 --> 01:51:34,936
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1393
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:37,172
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1394
01:51:38,808 --> 01:51:40,708
I'll let you know
when it does.

1395
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:42,012
Then what?

1396
01:51:42,645 --> 01:51:43,945
Sir?

1397
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:44,912
We have no idea

1398
01:51:44,914 --> 01:51:48,283
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1399
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:50,352
And our one-woman
security force

1400
01:51:50,354 --> 01:51:51,886
had a prior commitment...

1401
01:51:51,888 --> 01:51:53,690
on the other side
of the universe.

1402
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,595
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1403
01:52:00,197 --> 01:52:02,063
We need to find more.

1404
01:52:02,065 --> 01:52:03,198
More weapons?

1405
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,099
More heroes.

1406
01:52:05,101 --> 01:52:06,801
You think you can find
others like her?

1407
01:52:06,803 --> 01:52:09,806
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1408
01:52:10,874 --> 01:52:12,108
Get some rest, sir.

1409
01:52:13,177 --> 01:52:15,045
You got
a big decision to make.

1410
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:15,925
This is a nightmare.

1411
01:55:17,494 --> 01:55:19,862
I've had better nightmares.

1412
01:55:21,998 --> 01:55:23,032
Hey.

1413
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,235
So, that thing just stopped

1414
01:55:26,237 --> 01:55:28,004
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1415
01:55:29,939 --> 01:55:32,507
What do we got?

1416
01:55:32,509 --> 01:55:35,109
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

1417
01:55:35,111 --> 01:55:36,211
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1418
01:55:36,213 --> 01:55:37,346
We did.

1419
01:55:37,348 --> 01:55:41,149
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1420
01:55:41,151 --> 01:55:43,084
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1421
01:55:43,086 --> 01:55:44,553
We don't even know
what this is.

1422
01:55:44,555 --> 01:55:47,289
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

1423
01:55:47,291 --> 01:55:50,024
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1424
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:52,429
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1425
01:55:55,366 --> 01:55:56,899
Where's Fury?

1426
02:03:31,084 --> 02:03:36,084
