2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,881
It was good...

3
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,773
that you called us.

4
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,965
I don't know what happened.

5
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:38,414
We were at the bar...

6
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:44,885
drinking, having fun...

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,530
I don't even know how I got here.

8
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:54,771
Come on, she's been under too long.

9
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:59,049
You're the only one who can help me.

10
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:06,107
Come on, come on...

11
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:11,631
- Tell me what I need to know.
- They'll kill me.

12
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:17,401
You asked for my help.

13
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,678
Come on.

14
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,608
The contact in Minsk...

15
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:29,680
Give us the name.

16
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:35,564
Dimitri... Miediev.

17
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:53,908
- What now?
- Now we drink.

18
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:56,075
To friends.

19
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,467
Get rid of that scum.

20
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,525
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

21
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,194
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

22
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:10,450
- Care to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?
- No, I prefer the theatre.

23
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:14,262
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

24
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,424
Perhaps you'd choose one for me.

25
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:24,347
Thank you.

26
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:52,702
Good morning, Mr Phelps.
This is Alexander Golitsyn, -

27
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:57,832
- an attaché at our embassy
in Prague. He is also a traitor.

28
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:01,378
He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list-

29
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,882
- of all our deep cover agents
in Eastern Europe.

30
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:09,553
For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.

31
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:13,141
The portion Golitsyn has
contains code names.

32
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:18,665
It is useless without its mate, which
matches the codes with true names.

33
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:24,296
It is this half Golitsyn plans to steal
at an embassy reception tomorrow.

34
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:30,701
Your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to obtain proof of the theft.

35
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:35,539
Shadow Golitsyn to his buyer
and apprehend them both.

36
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:39,628
I've dispatched a team
selected from your group.

37
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:44,883
Sarah Davies is undercover now. Jack
Harmon can hack into their system.

38
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:50,097
Hannah Williams will do surveillance.
Your wife, Claire, will cover transport.

39
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:54,352
And Ethan Hunt
will be your point man, as usual.

40
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:58,898
He is now in Kiev and
will rendezvous with you in Prague.

41
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:03,611
Should any member of your IM force
be caught or killed, -

42
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:07,825
- the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.

43
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:13,349
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.

44
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,606
A very straightforward objective.

45
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,319
We photograph Golitsyn stealing the
NOC list, follow him to his buyer, -

46
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:47,659
- apprehend both of them.
Now, here's the plot. Ethan...

47
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:53,123
You go into the embassy in character,
during a party. Hide in plain sight.

48
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:56,668
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

49
00:06:56,692 --> 00:07:02,175
Sarah, you're there as the embassy's
Washington visitors' liaison.

50
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,303
You and Ethan will run the game.

51
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:10,827
- I haven't a thing to wear.
- Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

52
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:18,127
Mark Golitsyn and hand him off
to Hannah. Hannah, you stay on him.

53
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,492
Jack, fingerprint security is accessed
through the elevator shaft here.

54
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:31,016
- So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.
- Open, close, get out.

55
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:35,585
Claire, you're in the vehicle.

56
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:41,109
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior. You two stay on him.

57
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:45,554
If I call "abort",
everybody walk away immediately.

58
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:49,809
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m.

59
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,396
Any questions?

60
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,920
Can we get a cappuccino machine?
I don't know what you call this.

61
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:03,699
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

62
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:08,162
Is it possible that it's worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev?

63
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:13,686
- Hey, take it easy on my wife's coffee.
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.

64
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:19,216
- Off on a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

65
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,219
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

66
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:27,224
- Punishing! 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

67
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:30,228
He's getting soft in his old age.

68
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:34,732
Okay, listen. If that list
gets out into the open, -

69
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:39,904
- the names of our agents will be
up for grabs to the highest bidders.

70
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:45,428
Terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords.
Everyone who wants to get rid of us.

71
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:52,171
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

72
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:59,176
I'll run the whole show from here.
Let's punch out the details.

73
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,700
There's a camera built into the bridge.
It transmits what you see back here.

74
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,250
Can you hear me?
No, you need an earpiece.

75
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:21,991
You have lovely eyes...
Can you hear me now?

76
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:27,372
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

77
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:32,896
- You should check out these streets.
- What do you think I've been doing?

78
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:38,259
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

79
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:43,640
- Isn't he chairing a hearing?
- Not this week.

80
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:49,164
This week he's fly-fishing in County
Kildare with one of our Irish guides.

81
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:54,816
And he won't be back anytime soon.

82
00:09:57,595 --> 00:10:02,160
Senator, it sounds as if
you want to lead the kind of charge -

83
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:07,684
- that Sen. Church led in the 70's, and
destroy the US's intelligence capability.

84
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:14,798
I want to know who they are and how
they're spending the tax payers money.

85
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:19,266
This is still a democracy.

86
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:25,161
Stick of gum, right?
No. Red light, green light.

87
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,691
You have a lock you can't pick,
you mash them together...

88
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:36,215
Hasta lasagne, don't get any on ya'.
You'll have about five seconds.

89
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:41,509
Just don't chew it.

90
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:22,851
Ethan, Jack's inside.
Let's go.

91
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,062
How do you do, Senator?
How was the opera?

92
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:38,275
- It was boring.
- Let me see if I can steer you through.

93
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:55,323
- Windows open by 2300.
- Mr Brandi, the mayor, and Mrs Brandi.

94
00:11:55,347 --> 00:12:00,496
Senator,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

95
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,020
- Of course. How are you, Ms Norman?
- He's in pocket, on the stairway.

96
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:13,275
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

97
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:17,315
Hannah.

98
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:23,074
Pull the shade.

99
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:36,064
Sarah, mark the package
and go to two.

100
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:44,102
Your advance team said you'd like
a tour of the facility. This way.

101
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:58,933
Oh, great.

102
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:04,457
Which leads to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area here.

103
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:33,604
Governor's in position now.

104
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:46,544
- Can I help you?
- As you can see, there's surveillance.

105
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,615
I'm sorry,
I know it's in here somewhere.

106
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,868
Sergeant, why are you not in uniform?

107
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:59,585
We've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes, sir.

108
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:04,337
Be right back.

109
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:09,861
- Do you have a Jack on your staff?
- I believe we did.

110
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:17,078
An unreliable fellow, as I recall.
Constantly late and behind in his work.

111
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:25,294
We were forced to tie him to a horse
and drag him around my barn.

112
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:28,959
I'm working on it.

113
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:47,146
Sorry.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

114
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:02,096
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

115
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,404
Higher.

116
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,860
He's heading to the Denied Area.

117
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:46,887
Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

118
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:58,684
Jack...

119
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:02,965
Jack, we're in position here.

120
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:06,078
I didn't touch it.

121
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:12,701
- What about my coat? I'll freeze.
- Jack, open the doors.

122
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:24,196
He's in the box, Ethan.

123
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,178
- We'll take his exit. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

124
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:33,366
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

125
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:18,463
- He's got it.
- All right.

126
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:23,301
- I saved your ass again, Jack.
- Such a nice ass.

127
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:28,283
- And a lonely ass.
- Transport in five minutes.

128
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:17,544
Jack, we're in position. Open the doors
and let the package roll.

129
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,821
Stairway, you're wrapped.
Go to transport.

130
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:35,682
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

131
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:45,574
I don't have control, Jack.
Cut the power.

132
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:52,297
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

133
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,860
Jack...

134
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:10,080
Jack...
Jack?

135
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,880
- Jack, do you copy?
- Man down, Ethan.

136
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,214
Man down.

137
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:42,148
Ethan, stay where you are.
I'm coming to you.

138
00:19:55,948 --> 00:20:00,391
The package is out in the open.

139
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:07,425
- Jim, he's in the open.
- En route.

140
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:30,006
Jim, he's in the open.

141
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,681
Jim, the package is in the open.

142
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:41,598
I've got a shadow.
I can't lose him. Abort!

143
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:45,901
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

144
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:52,526
- I can't do that.
- We're being ambushed. Abort!

145
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,050
- Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.
- No, dammit, I said abort!

146
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:12,298
- Eye on the package. Jim, I'm coming.
- Jim gave an abort.

147
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:17,822
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me? Now go!

148
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,218
- Where are you?
- 200 yards from the bridge.

149
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:57,054
They're covering the frequency.

150
00:21:57,078 --> 00:22:01,873
Cut all radio communication.

151
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,800
Ethan...

152
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:05,021
Sarah, abort.
Repeat: Abort!

153
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:10,543
Abort! Do you read me?

154
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:17,227
Sarah...

155
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:52,916
Oh my God!

156
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,131
- Satcom 7.
- Central Europe, unsecured.

157
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:49,423
- Designator?
- Bravo, echo, one, one.

158
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:56,121
- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.

159
00:25:56,711 --> 00:26:00,899
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

160
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:05,613
- Who's dead?
- My team. My team is dead!

161
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:11,137
Golitsyn's gone. They knew
we were coming. The disk is gone.

162
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:17,543
- Are you intact?
- The list is in the open!

163
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:23,048
Let's just bring you in safely,
then we'll worry about that.

164
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:28,430
- Were you followed?
- I don't think so.

165
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,808
Don't think. Be sure.
Are you clean?

166
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:34,102
Yes.

167
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:39,065
Location Green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.

168
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:42,811
- You're in Prague?
- One hour.

169
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:43,028
I... I can't tell you how sorry I am.

170
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:48,683
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you.

171
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:54,207
- Personally as well as professionally.
- Yeah...

172
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:02,656
Here's a passport and visa. Usual drill.

173
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,951
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada -

174
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:11,034
- and throw the Prague police a bone,
toss them a few suspects.

175
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:20,235
- You follow me?
- Yeah, I follow you.

176
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:27,117
- We've lost enough agents for tonight.
- You mean, I have.

177
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:34,667
- You're bent on blaming yourself.
- Who else is left?

178
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:41,059
Yeah, I see your point.

179
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:49,421
- Why was there another team?
- What?

180
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,794
The IMF agents at the embassy.

181
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:59,367
I don't quite follow you.

182
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:03,179
Then follow me around the room.

183
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:08,703
The drunk Russians on
the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.

184
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:14,585
The couple waltzing around me,
the waiter standing behind Hannah.

185
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,657
Bow tie at 12 o'clock.
The other IMF team.

186
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:24,344
You're worried about me. Why?

187
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:30,542
For two years
we've been spotting a blowback -

188
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:34,296
- in IMF operations.
We have a penetration.

189
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,635
We've decoded an Internet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

190
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,097
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

191
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:48,621
Max has a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

192
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,380
This time he got on the inside,
in a position to buy our NOC list.

193
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:03,053
An operation he called "Job 3-14". He
thought Golitsyn was doing it tonight.

194
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:11,712
- The list he stole was a decoy.
- That's correct.

195
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:17,236
The actual list is secure at Langley.
Golitsyn was one of ours.

196
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,410
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

197
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:34,517
- The whole operation was a mole hunt.
- Yeah.

198
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:40,058
The mole's deep inside.

199
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:45,289
And like you said...

200
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:48,667
you survived.

201
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:53,237
I want to show you something.

202
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:59,846
Since your father's death, your
family's farm has been in receivership.

203
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,018
Suddenly, they have 120 grand
in the bank.

204
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:08,022
The illness was supposed to have
wiped out that account.

205
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:13,546
Dying slowly in America can be
a very expensive proposition.

206
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:21,137
So why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

207
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:29,879
- I can understand you're very upset.
- You've never seen me very upset.

208
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,549
Enough is enough.

209
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:37,387
You've bribed and killed,
using loyalties on the inside.

210
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:42,911
You want to shake hands with the
devil? Fine, but you'll do it in hell.

211
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:46,949
Money, money...
Where's the damn money?

212
00:34:12,536 --> 00:34:18,036
We've decoded an Internet message
from a Czech we know as "Max".

213
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,418
He got in a position to buy our NOC
list. An operation he called "Job 3-14".

214
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:25,675
Job 3:14...

215
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:44,337
"asleep and at rest with kings
and counsellors of the earth..."

216
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:49,728
You son of a bitch.

217
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:30,892
Ethan...

218
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:36,416
What are you doing?
I needed you.

219
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:39,986
On the bridge.

220
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,188
But you weren't there.

221
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:03,051
- Don't move.
- Ethan...

222
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:08,575
It's okay. Just calm down.
It's Claire.

223
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:14,088
- You were in the car.
- No, I wasn't.

224
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:20,755
- I heard on the radio...
- I saw you, you were in the car.

225
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:26,285
No, I got out of the car. I ran to
the bridge. He said someone was...

226
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:30,999
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.
There was nobody there.

227
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:36,523
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead! They're all dead!

228
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:49,625
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead...

229
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:55,615
Take off your coat.

230
00:39:08,437 --> 00:39:13,127
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

231
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:18,651
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you? Did they send you?

232
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:23,931
No one sent me.

233
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:29,455
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock if we abort.

234
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:34,692
0400. Four a.m. Four o'clock.
It's four o'clock.

235
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:39,614
If we abort... four a.m.

236
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:02,505
I've been disavowed.

237
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:12,000
They actually think
I killed Jim and everyone else.

238
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:20,617
Somehow, $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

239
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:26,141
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole,
employed by an arms dealer, Max, -

240
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:31,896
- for the last two years,
to get him our NOC list.

241
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:38,052
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

242
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:42,557
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

243
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:47,437
Whoever the mole is,
he goes by the name of Job.

244
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:52,901
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list, he'll find me.

245
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:58,157
I'm going to go in and tell Kittridge
you have nothing to do with this.

246
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:03,681
Claire, if you're not dead,
he'll assume you're with me.

247
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:23,184
The message is for Job.

248
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:27,547
That's right.
And I'm going to answer it.

249
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:55,862
Excuse me,
could I trouble you for a match?

250
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:15,418
Remove your hat, please.

251
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:20,370
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

252
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:24,366
The price of admission.

253
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:38,533
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

254
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:44,581
- Then why the hell am I here?
- So he can hear what you have to say.

255
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:49,485
I don't communicate well
through a shroud.

256
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:55,009
If Max doesn't like what you say,
you'll be wearing it indefinitely.

257
00:42:56,976 --> 00:43:01,418
I'm willing to take the chance.

258
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:07,615
Very well.

259
00:43:10,115 --> 00:43:14,762
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

260
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:18,861
I need $150,000.

261
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:22,488
Really?

262
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:30,088
And you thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

263
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:35,077
Why not? You gave Job 125.

264
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,810
The penny drops. You are not Job.

265
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:48,173
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

266
00:43:48,197 --> 00:43:53,697
Its tone was aggressive but playful.
Job is not playful.

267
00:43:55,872 --> 00:44:01,372
- So you are something of a paradox.
- Well, that depends.

268
00:44:01,545 --> 00:44:06,398
- On what?
- Whether you like a paradox.

269
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:12,843
- I want $150,000 today.
- That's quite out of the question.

270
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:19,206
The disk Job sold you is worthless.

271
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,453
It's bait. Part of an internal mole hunt.

272
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:31,929
And how might you know that?

273
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:36,058
Are you another company man?

274
00:44:36,082 --> 00:44:40,422
Like Job?

275
00:44:41,505 --> 00:44:45,568
We're asking about you.

276
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:51,092
I'm NOC. Was...
Now disavowed.

277
00:44:51,474 --> 00:44:56,497
- Why, may I ask?
- That's what I want to ask Job.

278
00:44:56,521 --> 00:45:01,961
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

279
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:06,007
You could arrange an introduction.

280
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:10,720
- Why should I?
- I can deliver the actual NOC list.

281
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:16,244
Your list is worthless, and it's probably
equipped with a homing device.

282
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:26,422
Boot it up. In 10 minutes you'll have the
CIA hopping around you like rabbits.

283
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:36,642
It's easy to say it's worthless if I can't
look at it to see if it's worthless.

284
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:42,981
- Not a tenable position, sir.
- Okay, use it.

285
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:48,695
But I'd suggest you pack first.

286
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:08,157
- 26-27. So far, so good.
- Not so good for you, my friend.

287
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:13,036
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

288
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:48,218
- 32 and 33.
- Doesn't mean it's a signal.

289
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,029
44 and 45.

290
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:51,310
The man's gone black, Barnes.
He's under until he decides to surface.

291
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:56,834
- We can cut off his transportation.
- What can we do, Barnes?

292
00:47:57,966 --> 00:48:02,280
Put a guy at the airport?
How many identities does Hunt have?

293
00:48:02,304 --> 00:48:06,618
How many times
has he slipped past customs?

294
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:11,665
These guys are trained to be ghosts.
We taught them!

295
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:15,252
What do you suggest?

296
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:19,089
Let's make him come to us.

297
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:24,613
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

298
00:48:30,918 --> 00:48:36,347
Günther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

299
00:48:36,424 --> 00:48:41,924
- Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
- Thanks, Max.

300
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:46,410
Or is it Maxine?

301
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:51,760
I don't have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity is in my profession.

302
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:56,158
It's like a warm blanket.

303
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:03,989
My deal with Job was subject to
a successful boot scan. The deal's off.

304
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,395
- What was your deal with Job?
- Six million dollars.

305
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:15,526
I'll give you the same, for the
complete list, not just Eastern Europe.

306
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,697
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

307
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:25,221
10 million, in negotiable US Treasury
certificates, coupons attached.

308
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,125
And one more thing...

309
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:35,649
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

310
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:56,879
- Max made a deal with you?
- I deliver the list, Max delivers Job.

311
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:05,078
We've 75 rounds for the Beretta,
but only 20 for the Sig-Sauer.

312
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:09,208
One pair of Visco glasses.

313
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:12,850
Plenty of passports...

314
00:50:15,697 --> 00:50:21,197
Well, you said it yourself.
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

315
00:50:23,873 --> 00:50:27,811
- Are you sure?
- Jim was my husband.

316
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:32,733
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

317
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:38,257
- We need help. They'll have to be local.
- What kind of help?

318
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:17,907
Simple game. Four players.

319
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:22,537
Exfil opens the pocket,
cyber ops lifts the wallet.

320
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:27,084
- Bank?
- IMF mainframe.

321
00:51:27,108 --> 00:51:32,608
- Where exactly is it?
- In Langley.

322
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:38,471
In Langley?
The one in Virginia?

323
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,809
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

324
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:47,172
- Is he serious?
- Always.

325
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,695
Why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

326
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,158
I can fly a helicopter into the vault.

327
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:01,287
It would be easier
than breaking into the CIA.

328
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:06,811
- What kind of information is it?
- Profitable.

329
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:11,851
Payment on delivery.

330
00:52:12,073 --> 00:52:17,396
I don't know.
I just don't know.

331
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:22,352
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

332
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:27,065
What did they used to call you?
The Net Ranger?

333
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:30,193
The only man to hack NATO Ghostcom.

334
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:35,717
There was never any evidence
that I had anything to do with that...

335
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:40,253
with that exceptional piece of work.

336
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:48,606
You don't know what you're missing.
This is the Mt Everest of hacks.

337
00:52:48,821 --> 00:52:54,321
You're kidding yourselves. Even with
top of the line crypto, Stu 3's...

338
00:52:55,661 --> 00:53:00,977
- Krieger can get it. Right?
- It may take a little time.

339
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:04,897
That's not what Claire says about you.

340
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:09,235
Thinking Machine laptops.

341
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:14,759
The 686 prototypes,
with the artificial intelligence RISC chip.

342
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:17,911
24 hours.

343
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:22,582
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

344
00:53:22,606 --> 00:53:28,106
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

345
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:34,595
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

346
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:40,119
No modem access to a mainframe.
It's in what we call a "stand-alone".

347
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:46,502
Which means I'd have to be
physically at the terminal.

348
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:50,780
Relax, it's much worse than you think.

349
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:53,783
It's in a black vault lock-down.

350
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:59,307
The only person allowed in the room
has to pass through security checks.

351
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:05,981
The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.

352
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:12,303
This only gets him into the outer room.

353
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:16,975
Next he has to pass a retinal scan.

354
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,500
And the intrusion countermeasures are
deactivated by an electronic key card.

355
00:54:24,507 --> 00:54:28,236
Which we won't have.

356
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,760
Inside the black vault, three systems
operate whenever the technician is out.

357
00:54:35,644 --> 00:54:41,144
The first is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.

358
00:54:41,942 --> 00:54:45,422
The second system detects
any increase in temperature.

359
00:54:45,446 --> 00:54:50,946
The body heat of an intruder will trigger
it if the temperature rises one degree.

360
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:01,314
That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning duct, -

361
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:04,985
- 30 feet above the floor.

362
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:08,626
That vent is guarded by a laser net.

363
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:16,080
The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.

364
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:20,626
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.

365
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:26,150
If any one of these systems is set off,
it will activate an automatic lock-down.

366
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:32,407
Believe me when I tell you,
all three systems are state of the art.

367
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:41,475
And you really think we can do this?

368
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:44,577
We're going to do it.

369
00:56:17,796 --> 00:56:20,733
Alarms in sectors 3, 7 and 12.

370
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:26,257
- What sector's the air conditioning?
- 21. But there's no alarm in 21.

371
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:37,769
No one goes into any sector where the
alarm hasn't gone off, and it hasn't...

372
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,238
- It's gone off. Let's go.
- Let's move.

373
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,175
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

374
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:06,711
21's through here.

375
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:16,251
- He's recruiting. For what purpose?
- Survival.

376
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:21,424
Too short-sighted. This guy initiates.
The question is, what does he want?

377
00:57:21,448 --> 00:57:26,429
Where does he need to get it?
Barnes, what the hell is that noise?

378
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:31,953
- Fire alarm, Gene.
- Do we have to evacuate?

379
00:58:19,802 --> 00:58:23,317
Hey, where's the other guy?

380
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:30,047
- Zero body count.
- We'll see.

381
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:06,901
Hi, there.

382
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:09,752
One, two, three.

383
01:01:09,776 --> 01:01:13,339
Toast, toast.

384
01:01:13,363 --> 01:01:18,863
- Check.
- Good. Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

385
01:01:19,037 --> 01:01:24,537
Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?

386
01:01:30,256 --> 01:01:35,756
- Damn.
- Krieger, from now on, total silence.

387
01:02:52,178 --> 01:02:55,532
He's rolling to you.

388
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:02,501
- He's at the voiceprint corridor.
- William Donloe.

389
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:20,215
Outer room.

390
01:03:23,253 --> 01:03:27,180
He's coming in the vault.

391
01:03:30,428 --> 01:03:33,575
Come on, move.

392
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,518
He's in the bathroom.

393
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:22,464
A-W-9 -

394
01:06:22,488 --> 01:06:25,533
- 6-B-6.

395
01:06:43,885 --> 01:06:45,989
Holy mother of God.

396
01:06:46,013 --> 01:06:48,646
A NOC list.

397
01:09:45,122 --> 01:09:49,256
He's at the vault.

398
01:10:00,222 --> 01:10:02,383
Four yellows.

399
01:10:04,977 --> 01:10:08,698
One red.

400
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:20,642
Get moving.

401
01:10:23,122 --> 01:10:25,901
Toast.

402
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:28,823
Oh, my God.

403
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:49,515
- It's for you.
- Kittridge.

404
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:16,053
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops.

405
01:12:16,077 --> 01:12:19,765
- It never happened.
- What about him?

406
01:12:19,789 --> 01:12:25,216
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

407
01:13:04,378 --> 01:13:09,878
Are you contacting your buyer?
Ethan?

408
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,227
Ethan?

409
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:31,432
Oh, excuse me. "Mr Hunt".

410
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:43,646
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

411
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:48,778
My contact is extremely shy.

412
01:13:48,802 --> 01:13:53,115
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders.

413
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:56,660
- Not while I'm holding this.
- Krieger...

414
01:13:56,684 --> 01:13:59,317
Shut up.

415
01:14:03,275 --> 01:14:06,963
- You mean this?
- That's not the list.

416
01:14:06,987 --> 01:14:11,327
You've never seen this trick?

417
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:21,311
Where did it go?

418
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:26,527
It's gone.

419
01:14:26,551 --> 01:14:30,993
- What?
- You... no?

420
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:40,235
But not too far.

421
01:14:42,568 --> 01:14:45,547
I know what you're thinking.

422
01:14:45,571 --> 01:14:51,071
"In the computer room, I was up here
and he was down there."

423
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:57,954
"He was carrying two disks."

424
01:15:00,003 --> 01:15:05,269
- It's hard to keep track of these things.
- Where is it?

425
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:24,088
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

426
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:29,612
Try any sleight of hand with my money
and I'll cut your throat.

427
01:15:54,853 --> 01:15:59,418
- On a cushy recruiting assignment?
- Did they put you at the Plaza?

428
01:15:59,442 --> 01:16:03,987
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

429
01:16:04,072 --> 01:16:07,689
I'm so sorry.

430
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:16,376
Krieger was my call.

431
01:16:20,297 --> 01:16:25,196
I'm sorry, Ethan.

432
01:16:27,139 --> 01:16:31,077
We did what we had to do.

433
01:16:31,101 --> 01:16:35,646
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

434
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:16,959
Krieger did have the NOC list?

435
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:29,700
Hold on to it. If you knew what you were
getting into, you wouldn't have done it.

436
01:17:36,254 --> 01:17:40,109
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

437
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:45,633
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on the
train. Don't let it get out in the open.

438
01:17:53,147 --> 01:17:58,647
- What is the range of this thing?
- It's hard to tell. I'll have to be close.

439
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:08,640
The unlikely setting, a farm in the
heartland of America, Wisconsin.

440
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:13,354
Here, Federal agents found the brains
behind an international drug ring:

441
01:18:13,378 --> 01:18:18,734
Margaret Ethan Hunt and her
brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.

442
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:24,258
They were arrested this morning
in a major sting operation -

443
01:18:24,348 --> 01:18:29,848
- designed to expose the
illegal manufacture of the drug "khat".

444
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:33,459
- What we have here is a case...
- Kittridge.

445
01:19:04,016 --> 01:19:06,578
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

446
01:19:06,602 --> 01:19:10,123
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

447
01:19:10,147 --> 01:19:13,376
Been watching a little TV?

448
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:18,716
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

449
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:21,469
- He's in England.
- Get MI-5.

450
01:19:21,493 --> 01:19:26,265
My first order of business
after you come in -

451
01:19:26,289 --> 01:19:31,789
- is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped.

452
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:35,650
If you come in now, -

453
01:19:35,674 --> 01:19:40,781
- we can play down
the charges against you, as well.

454
01:19:40,805 --> 01:19:45,661
- Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
- Certainly, Ethan.

455
01:19:45,685 --> 01:19:48,164
If you're dealing with someone -

456
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:51,501
- who's crushed, stabbed, -

457
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:54,463
- shot and detonated -

458
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:59,051
- five members of his own IMF team, -

459
01:19:59,075 --> 01:20:04,556
- how devastated will you make him
by arresting Ma and Uncle Donald?

460
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:10,080
I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?

461
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:15,527
Lost him.
We needed three more seconds.

462
01:20:15,551 --> 01:20:20,303
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

463
01:20:31,901 --> 01:20:36,860
You're a hard man to catch up with.

464
01:20:42,746 --> 01:20:46,936
The next day I dragged myself
back to the safe house.

465
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,441
- I checked our aliases.
- And you picked us up in the States.

466
01:20:51,465 --> 01:20:54,986
But you'd gone,
and I could check just so many places.

467
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:59,699
Some European countries
don't computerise customs records.

468
01:20:59,723 --> 01:21:03,328
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

469
01:21:03,352 --> 01:21:08,852
- You know I like Liverpool St. Rentals.
- I showed them to you.

470
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,754
I remember.

471
01:21:12,778 --> 01:21:18,278
A doctor's got to look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

472
01:21:18,952 --> 01:21:24,452
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well. Sit down.

473
01:21:27,921 --> 01:21:32,985
Ethan... I saw who shot me.

474
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:36,030
I saw the mole.

475
01:21:36,054 --> 01:21:39,868
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge...

476
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:43,246
Kittridge, Ethan!

477
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:53,066
Kittridge is the mole.
My God. Of course, you're right.

478
01:21:58,537 --> 01:22:03,392
He was at the embassy that night.

479
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:08,786
First he took out Jack, at the elevator.

480
01:22:15,638 --> 01:22:20,126
He shot you on the bridge.

481
01:23:02,647 --> 01:23:08,147
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

482
01:23:24,755 --> 01:23:29,653
How did he do Hannah?

483
01:23:51,742 --> 01:23:56,331
No, he could've done Hannah himself.

484
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:27,499
Why, Jim?
Why?

485
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:35,074
When you think about it,
it was inevitable. No more Cold War.

486
01:24:35,122 --> 01:24:40,622
No more secrets to keep
from everyone but yourself.

487
01:24:41,503 --> 01:24:47,003
Then suddenly the President is running
the country without your permission.

488
01:24:48,052 --> 01:24:53,552
The son of a bitch, how dare he?
And you realise it's over.

489
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:59,850
You're obsolete hardware, with
a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

490
01:25:02,151 --> 01:25:07,651
Kittridge. We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch, big time.

491
01:25:12,245 --> 01:25:16,976
We won't have to.
He'll come after us.

492
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,315
- What's going to make him do that?
- What he didn't get in Prague.

493
01:25:22,339 --> 01:25:25,944
The NOC list.

494
01:25:25,968 --> 01:25:29,198
Jesus, Ethan.

495
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:33,501
Good for you.

496
01:25:33,643 --> 01:25:39,143
- We meet tomorrow, the TGV to Paris.
- Tight security. No guns. Real plus.

497
01:25:41,026 --> 01:25:46,090
I deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max delivers Job to me.

498
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:51,614
Claire and Luther will be on the train.
Krieger will have a helicopter in Paris.

499
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,395
Jim?

500
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:09,747
I was in a cafe, waiting for you...

501
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,036
and there she was.

502
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:18,560
Standing in the rain, alive and beautiful,
thinking I'm dead and gone.

503
01:26:22,737 --> 01:26:28,237
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going.

504
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:36,353
She can't know about me. No one can.
Not till this is over.

505
01:26:36,377 --> 01:26:41,877
- You're probably right.
- There's too much at stake.

506
01:26:42,342 --> 01:26:47,842
Once we leave the safe house,
you get in there and crash.

507
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:52,889
- I'll call from Paris.
- You got it.

508
01:27:14,919 --> 01:27:18,684
What happened?

509
01:27:20,257 --> 01:27:25,274
I sent the message to Max.

510
01:27:26,556 --> 01:27:31,205
We're on for tomorrow.

511
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:39,150
Okay.

512
01:27:47,788 --> 01:27:50,979
Come here.

513
01:28:31,084 --> 01:28:34,856
- What's this?
- Incoming for you.

514
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,632
X-ray's clean. Non-explosive.

515
01:28:49,103 --> 01:28:53,075
Gene.

516
01:28:55,527 --> 01:29:01,027
How long to the London terminus?
We've got 10 minutes. Move!

517
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:42,729
- Give me Max.
- It's him.

518
01:29:45,664 --> 01:29:50,813
- This was not what we discussed.
- My apologies. It couldn't be helped.

519
01:29:50,837 --> 01:29:54,970
You'll find the disk under your seat.

520
01:30:29,253 --> 01:30:34,753
Dear boy, I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

521
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:41,635
- Not if you tell me where the money is.
- The mere chance is worth 10 million.

522
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:47,350
Baggage car, rack 3,
silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

523
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:53,481
- What about Job?
- I wouldn't worry, he'll find you.

524
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:14,861
- What's the matter?
- It's not transmitting.

525
01:31:14,885 --> 01:31:20,385
We've got to get this through
before we hit the tunnel.

526
01:31:31,946 --> 01:31:37,052
- What's the problem?
- "Connection denied."

527
01:31:37,076 --> 01:31:41,723
- Did you check the batteries?
- I always check the batteries.

528
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:45,778
Run it through from the top.

529
01:31:47,379 --> 01:31:50,983
We don't know what Max looks like.

530
01:31:51,007 --> 01:31:56,507
If he's got that list, he'll want
to check it. That means laptops.

531
01:32:08,109 --> 01:32:11,626
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

532
01:32:17,619 --> 01:32:23,119
- Is everything all right?
- It's working.

533
01:32:34,262 --> 01:32:36,938
He's in the baggage car.

534
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:43,225
- Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.
- I'll meet you in the baggage car.

535
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:03,741
Barnes.

536
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:45,398
Ethan's right behind me.
Listen, Jim...

537
01:33:45,422 --> 01:33:48,879
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

538
01:33:52,179 --> 01:33:55,490
Kittridge is here.

539
01:33:57,686 --> 01:34:02,701
We take the money,
Ethan takes the blame.

540
01:34:04,192 --> 01:34:08,532
No one else has seen you alive.

541
01:34:08,906 --> 01:34:12,362
No one will believe him.

542
01:34:38,938 --> 01:34:44,438
Of course, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

543
01:34:46,863 --> 01:34:52,363
- Ethan.
- Yes, Ethan Hunt. You remember him.

544
01:34:55,664 --> 01:35:00,687
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

545
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:05,401
When he knew is a good question.
Mind telling me, Ethan?

546
01:35:05,425 --> 01:35:09,500
Before or after I showed up in London?

547
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:15,430
Before London. After you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

548
01:35:16,062 --> 01:35:19,988
They stamped it, didn't they?
Damned Gideons.

549
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:24,713
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why?

550
01:35:24,737 --> 01:35:29,844
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

551
01:35:29,868 --> 01:35:34,474
You've asked the question...
and you are the answer.

552
01:35:34,498 --> 01:35:39,729
- I knew about Jim.
- But he didn't know about you.

553
01:35:39,753 --> 01:35:45,236
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

554
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:49,702
But I was confident,
having tasted the goods.

555
01:35:51,015 --> 01:35:56,341
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

556
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:02,963
- Let's just get the money and get out.
- Yes, let's get the money.

557
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:07,885
Ethan, the money.

558
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:12,997
Give her the money.

559
01:36:13,623 --> 01:36:17,963
You've earned it.

560
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,865
- All 10 million.
- Claire was wrong about one thing.

561
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:31,609
Oh, what's that?

562
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:53,893
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

563
01:36:53,917 --> 01:36:58,669
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

564
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:04,752
- You son of a bitch.
- It's over, Jim.

565
01:37:09,934 --> 01:37:14,422
- Don't. Don't, Jim.
- "Don't, Jim"?

566
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:34,648
No, he's in the tunnel.
He'll crash into us! Accelerate!

567
01:42:37,703 --> 01:42:42,353
Red light... green light.

568
01:43:34,223 --> 01:43:39,121
I think this is what you're looking for.

569
01:43:43,023 --> 01:43:45,502
Hello, Max.

570
01:43:45,526 --> 01:43:51,026
My lawyers will have a field day with it.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

571
01:43:51,366 --> 01:43:56,529
Maybe we'll just leave the courts
out of this one.

572
01:43:57,414 --> 01:44:02,340
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

573
01:44:02,364 --> 01:44:07,365
In a freak accident, a helicopter
lost altitude, veered into a tunnel, -

574
01:44:07,389 --> 01:44:11,488
- and collided with a high-speed train.

575
01:44:11,512 --> 01:44:17,012
The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt...

576
01:44:19,771 --> 01:44:24,085
- You call your folks? How do they feel?
- About what?

577
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:29,609
The Justice Department apology,
VIP treatment, the whole nine yards.

578
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:36,200
My mom didn't know how the DEA
mistook them for drug smugglers.

579
01:44:41,003 --> 01:44:45,489
- Cheers.
- To you, Luther.

580
01:44:45,513 --> 01:44:51,013
- And being off the disavowed list.
- Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

581
01:44:52,306 --> 01:44:55,550
Why don't you come back with me?

582
01:44:56,728 --> 01:45:01,523
I just don't know why
I'd be doing it.

583
01:45:03,109 --> 01:45:08,609
I've got to catch my flight...
How does it feel to be a solid citizen?

584
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:16,160
Man, I don't know.
I'm going to miss being disreputable.

585
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:22,791
If it makes you feel any better,
I'll always think of you that way.

586
01:45:33,309 --> 01:45:36,084
Excuse me, Mr Hunt.

587
01:45:36,729 --> 01:45:39,353
Would you like to watch a movie?

588
01:45:40,063 --> 01:45:44,024
No, thank you.

589
01:45:44,048 --> 01:45:47,836
Would you consider the cinema
of the Caribbean?

590
01:45:49,361 --> 01:45:51,448
Aruba, perhaps?

591
01:49:52,455 --> 01:49:57,278
