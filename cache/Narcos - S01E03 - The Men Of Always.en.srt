1
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:07,385
I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

2
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,513
Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

3
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,557
Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,724
'Course not.

5
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:17,728
Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,522
- "Encounters"?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,815
I'm married.

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,235
Right.

9
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,655
Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife

10
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:29,240
are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

11
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:30,824
No, no, Carrillo's solid.

12
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,701
Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

13
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,204
Did you drop your wallet?

14
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:36,372
Passport.

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,416
How important is this cat to you?

16
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,000
Excuse me?

17
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:41,794
You gave someone your passport?

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,006
We were trying to get Puff
through Immigration.

19
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,383
"Puff"?

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,176
I didn't name it, dude.

21
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,012
Traffickers pay people
at the airports for intel.

22
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,224
A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

23
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:57,851
Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

24
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,688
You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

25
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,855
Fucking price on my head?

26
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,360
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

27
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,238
but you're safe... because of Kiki.

28
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,450
The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

29
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:17,955
was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

30
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,333
Kiki was captured and tortured.

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,419
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,

32
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:26,005
used an electric drill on his head
until he died.

33
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,049
What the fuck were they thinking?

34
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:33,471
They could kill an American
government agent and get away with it?

35
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:37,308
Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

36
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,687
They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world

37
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:44,649
got the message
that the DEA is off-limits.

38
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:47,234
Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

39
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,569
He died to save us all.

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:51,864
Do not tell Connie that story.

41
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,240
I won't.

42
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,743
- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?

43
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,871
This cat is DEA.

44
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,081
Mark my words, it will get justice.

45

00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:20,847
Uh-huh.

47
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,362
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

48
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,991
A drug dealer running
for president. It was crazy, right?

49
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,202
Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

50
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,581
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

51
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,750
He was a fucking winner.

52
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,502
The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.

53
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,672
The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.

54
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:23,010
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

55
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,179
and all he had to do was to get to them.

56
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,559
And in order to do that,

57
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:34,605
he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

58
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,656
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,

59
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,450
a party who claimed
to represent the people.

60
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,219
And just like that...
an honest man blinked.

61
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,471
You're not going back to that comuna!

62
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:57,099
What, you want me to stay
in this apartment for the next two years?

63
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,268
Oh, my God, you do.

64
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:02,146
Honey, your cat was killed
as a warning to me.

65
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,355
Our cat.

66
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,606
OK, our cat.

67
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:09,361
What if you went back to Miami just for
a little while until things quiet down?

68
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:13,281
- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
- You're that good, huh?

69
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,952
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.

70
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,663
- You prepared to do that?
- I'm not giving in on this one!

71
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,842
OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.

72
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,220
I already stick out like a sore thumb.

73
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,555
The bodyguards
are only gonna draw more attention.

74
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,265
Just humor me.

75
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:41,351
I can't do my job
if I'm worried about your safety.

76
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,270
Mm...

77
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,652
Hey, mind parking
down the street a little?

78
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,279
I'll scream if I need you.

79
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,998
- Buenos días, Father.
- Connie.

80
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,624
What, are you surprised to see me?

81
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,335
We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

82
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,962
Well, this one will keep coming.

83
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,595
Surprised to see Elisa,
a communist M-19 guerrilla,

84
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,222
working in the comuna?

85
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:22,059
That's because you don't know
the liberation church in Colombia.

86
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:25,104
And the priest... innocent, right?

87
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:28,023
Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.

88
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,836
- What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

89
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:03,475
No hablo español.
I don't know what you're saying.

90
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,829
- What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

91
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,247
Tell me about it.

92
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,270
- Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

93
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,148
Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,

94
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:54,776
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

95
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,742
Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

96
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,413
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?

97
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,625
According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario "Poison"

98
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,170
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

99
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,838
For what purpose,
we don't know.

100
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,799
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy,

101
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,385
we're sending the wrong message.

102
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,845
Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.

103
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,097
No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.

104
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,808
The narcos have informants
in their department.

105
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,562
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

106
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,397
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

107
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,690
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

108
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,526
but you know where we are.

109
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,361
With enough money,
you can get anything done.

110
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:31,535
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

111
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,036
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

112
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,456
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.

113
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,126
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

114
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,088
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

115
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,714
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

116
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,050
You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to--

117
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,594
Poison's killed three of my men already.

118
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,678
If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

119
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:52,931
Then you guys gotta go.

120
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,305
OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

121
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,390
OK!

122
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,232
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

123
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,653
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

124
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,321
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

125
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,824
Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

126
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,743
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

127
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,882
To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

128
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,261
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

129
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,680
a former congressman from Antioquia.

130
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,312
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

131
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,657
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

132
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:10,261
Shh.

133
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,888
Shh.

134
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:11,400
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

135
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,153
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

136
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,949
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

137
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:21,493
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"The Men of Always."

138
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,999
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

139
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:31,420
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

140
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,425
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

141
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:37,927
Pablo! Pablo!

142
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,264
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

143
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,559
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

144
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,105
so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.

145
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:53,818
With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into Nazilandia,

146
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,404
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

147
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:03,369
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

148
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,497
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

149
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,624
his front man,
once the election was over.

150
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,640
As for us, we were kind of divided.

151
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,726
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

152
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,729
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

153
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:32,690
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

154
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,483
No one will go on record.

155
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,111
I got a better idea.

156
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,697
We let him win.

157
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,949
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,

158
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,660
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

159
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,664
But first, we had to get proof

160
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,250
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

161
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,502
So we went to Suárez,

162
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,921
and gave him a lot of money.

163
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:01,427
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,

164
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,181
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

165
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:13,480
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

166
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,039
Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

167
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,417
who reported the arrest...

168
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,169
...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

169
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:38,381
and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

170
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,801
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

171
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,221
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

172
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:47,681
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

173
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,893
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.

174
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,937
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

175
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,481
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.

176
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,026
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

177
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:02,029
Finally, it dawned on us.

178
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:05,574
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,

179
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:10,121
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

180
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,504
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

181
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,718
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

182
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,638
And what am I doing here?

183
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,599
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

184
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,685
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

185
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,604
Your party took money from Escobar.

186
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,440
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

187
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,816
Everyone took money.

188
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:43,237
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

189
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:46,198
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

190
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:52,079
Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

191
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,540
The New Liberal party had the candidate

192
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,543
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

193
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,753
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

194
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,713
Ladies and gentlemen,

195
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,447
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

196
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:12,451
in a poor city, in a poor country,

197
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,828
and by the time you were 28 years old,

198
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,956
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

199
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,711
What do you do?

200
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:26,006
You make your dreams come true.

201
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,974
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

202
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,065
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

203
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,653
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

204
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,869
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

205
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,999
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

206
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,880
where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

207
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,678
But even magical realism has its limits.

208
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,676
And when you get too close to the sun...

209
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:54,803
your dreams may melt away.

210
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,340
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

211
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,718
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

212
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,659
But Lara wouldn't back down.

213
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:48,245
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

214
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,248
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

215
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,668
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

216
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,503
were owned by drug traffickers.

217
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:02,008
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

218
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,595
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

219
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:09,850
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

220
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,231
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

221
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,066
of elephants and camels from Africa.

222
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,696
And with the action of one brave man,

223
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,824
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

224
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:45,677
Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

225
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,805
with his stand against the narcos.

226
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,348
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

227
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:55,186
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

228
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,566
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

229
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,195
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

230
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,074
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

231
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,078
You feel responsible, is that it?

232
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,040
Somewhat, yes, sir.

233
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:20,253
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

234
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,382
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

235
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,677
for American policy objectives?

236
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,473
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

237
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:33,224
you... did nothing.

238
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:37,604
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

239
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,607
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

240
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:56,707
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

241
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,960
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

242
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:01,378
And what is that?

243
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:05,799
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

244
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,929
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

245
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,350
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

246
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,728
Just wear the vest.

247
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,531
He didn't wear it.

248
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,327
Wouldn't have made a difference.

249
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:25,249
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

250
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,920
It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

251
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:36,676
- As for Suárez...
- Hey.

252
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,179
...he made so much money
playing both sides,

253
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:44,601
he decided to lift our spirits by giving
the DEA a token of his appreciation.
