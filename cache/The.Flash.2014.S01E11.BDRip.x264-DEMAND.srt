1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,609
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,765
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,726
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,488
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,202
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,129
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,170
You opened your lab
after Nora Allen's murder.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,561
What were you doing in Central City
before that?

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,849
And here I thought we were just two guys
having a friendly drink.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,204
- What?
- I just noticed you don't smile too much.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,404
The explosion that put you in a coma
also killed my fiancé.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,847
Ronnie!

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,049
- He was a hero.
- I didn't want him to be a hero.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,641
I wanted him to be my husband.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,802
Don't look for me again.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,006
Everyone has a hero.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,208
Someone they look up to or admire.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,408
Someone they just wish they could be.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,609
It's easy to believe in heroes.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,451
What's hard is when our heroes
stop believing in us.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,524
Oh, Barry, there's an intersection
coming up. Hurry.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,290
This should slow them down.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,766
Guys, which way?

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,168
- Left. Right.
- Right. Left.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,091
You both hear you're telling me
two different things, right?

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,284
Barry, listen up. Listen carefully.
Here's what you're going to do.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,331
Now, Queen is trying to make it to
the bridge, but I have a shortcut.

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,370
And left. Left. Right.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,568
- I see her.
- Make her go west before Fremont.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,529
- Okay, how?
- I recommend a detour.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,927
The King is headed for the interstate.

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,562
What entrance?

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,886
Attaboy.

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,731
Check...

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,881
Got the keys!

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,644
...mate.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,961
- Give me some. Ha, ha.
- Yo.

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,920
- Efficiently done, Mr. Allen.
- We need a picture.

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,964
I'm pretty sure rule number one
of having a secret identity...

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,004
...is not taking pictures
in your super suit without a mask on.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,207
Oh, come on. Please?

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,601
This is just for us. Just
to document all this.

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,082
Who knows? Maybe people in the future
will wanna know how all this happened.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,086
All right, if you want the future to have
the whole story, we all need to be in it.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,608
- Let me put on some makeup.
- The future does not care about your makeup.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,330
Mm-mm.

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,005
Okay.

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,400
Big smiles.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,490
Three, two, one.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,846
Ha.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,207
- Does that count as a selfie?
- Absolutely.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,128
Sick. Damn, I look good.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,402
Thanks for talking me through things
out there.

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,644
My pleasure. Well done.

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,683
It was bit of a rush. Feeling like a...

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,569
- A hero.
- Yep.

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,369
You're pretty good at it.

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,361
- Hey.
- Hey.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,283
You do realize the whole point of moving
out is not being at home anymore, right?

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,487
Ha-ha-ha.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,682
I forgot a few things.

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,241
So how is it living back in the house?

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,482
- Hey, Bar.
- Yo.

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,005
Babe.

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,970
Spaghetti a la me.
You sure you don't wanna stay for dinner?

69
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,011
Thanks, but Eddie is painting all day,
and I swore that I would help.

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,482
Although I'm really just gonna do that thing
where I get paint on my hair and nose.

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,248
Ha, ha. Oh, hey, someone from Central City
Picture News called you the other day.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,085
- I left the number on the fridge.
- Why didn't you tell me?

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,321
Chill. I just did.

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,844
Hey, I heard that some members of
the Royal Flush Gang are headed to prison.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,651
- Aah!
- Is that a good scream or bad scream?

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,485
Good. So good.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,924
I just got offered a job as a reporter
at Central City Picture News.

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,048
- Awesome.
- The editor's a fan of my blog.

79
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,044
- That is amazing.
- Oh, my God.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,006
Oh, God.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,445
Harrison Wells.

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,041
Hello?

83
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,766
We both know what you did.

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,242
It's time to pay the piper.

85
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,130
Come in.

86
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,008
Look, Joe. I apologize for all of this.

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,845
It really feels like a case of so much
for so little.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,923
The police should not have been called.

89
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,811
I got a prank call before
all this happened.

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,850
This feels like more than just a prank,
doctor.

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,682
Well, there are those who feel
I did not suffer enough...

92
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,526
...for the particle-accelerator explosion
last year, and some of them act on it.

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,841
Dr. Wells. Dr. Wells, are you okay?

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,525
Dr. Snow, I'm fine.

95
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,286
A little chilly. Otherwise, I'm fine.
Hello, Cisco.

96
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,490
Make yourselves at home as best you can.
I'm gonna make a hotel reservation.

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,369
- This place is so sick.
- Yeah.

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,249
Hey, what took you guys so long?

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,006
- We got lost.
- We've never been here before.

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,002
- Really, never?
- He tends to keep his private life private.

101
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,447
A precipice in front and wolves behind.

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,166
In other words, you're between a rock
and a hard place.

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,560
Check.

104
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,090
The king is dead.

105
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,765
Checkmate.

106
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,249
Dr. Wells?

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,647
There he is.

108
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,570
Hartley, allow me to introduce you
to Cisco Ramon.

109
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,487
Mr. Ramon here is one of the finest
mechanical engineers I have ever seen.

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,967
Wow, I can't believe Harrison
Wells said that about me.

111
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,726
He should prove to be an invaluable member
of your team, trust me.

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,245
You I trust.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,166
I don't foresee myself trusting someone
who showed up to his first day of work...

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,164
...in a billion-dollar research facility
wearing a T-shirt...

115
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,530
...that says "Keep calm
and Han shot first."

116
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,767
Huh. Would you give us a minute, Cisco?

117
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,084
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,287
I realize you don't have to explain
your hiring decisions to me...

119
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,240
...but maybe for the sake of a fun
exercise, we could pretend you did.

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,721
I have a good feeling about him.

121
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,604
Just as I did about you.

122
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,082
Oh.

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,480
Hartley.

124
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,763
You're still my guy.

125
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,686
Nothing and no one
is ever gonna change that.

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,886
I canvassed the street.

127
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,088
No other reports of vandalism.

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,641
No strange cars.

129
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,804
Get this, Wells says he's right there
when it happened.

130
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,527
All that glass shattering down around him.

131
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,048
- He can't walk.
- And he didn't have a scratch on him.

132
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,688
There's no point of impact.

133
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,241
No rock or bat...

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,727
...or any solid object went through
these windows.

135
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,929
It's as if they just shattered themselves.

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,443
This wasn't some teenage prank?

137
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,369
No, it wasn't.

138
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,491
But you don't want our help.

139
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,051
Why?

140
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,321
Because I already know who did this.

141
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,244
Hartley Rathaway.

142
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,329
Who is Hartley Rathaway?

143
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,085
Hartley Rathaway is the prodigal son.

144
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,641
And he has returned.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,966
Rathaway possesses one of the finest
scientific minds I've ever encountered.

146
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,045
Any ties to Rathaway Industries?

147
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,851
His grandfather founded it,
his father expanded it.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,968
Hartley was set to inherit the throne.

149
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,361
- What happened?
- He came out to his parents.

150
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,760
Old money, old values.

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,244
They were estranged when we met
but brilliant.

152
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,402
I couldn't have built the accelerator
without him.

153
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,801
You guys have never even mentioned
his name.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,641
That's because Hartley
had a challenging personality.

155
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,486
What she means is he was mostly a jerk.

156
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,246
But every once in a while...

157
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,731
...he could be a dick.

158
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,171
Let's just say that Hartley, like many
outliers, had trouble relating to his peers.

159
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,245
- Yes, but he was always your favorite.
- The chosen one.

160
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,684
He referred to himself like that.

161
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,043
So if you two were so close,
why would he target you?

162
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,411
Hartley left S.T.A.R. Labs about a year ago
after we had...

163
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,721
...a disagreement.

164
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,481
About what?

165
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,407
Look, don't worry. We'll stop him.

166
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,403
I won't let him hurt you, any of you.

167
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,126
Let's get back to my lab.

168
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,130
I could have gone my whole life
without seeing that jerk again.

169
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,443
- Yo, this place is so dope.
- What a coincidence.

170
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,446
We were thinking of making
"Yo, this place is so dope" our new slogan.

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,410
If you're so convinced
Dr. Wells made a mistake hiring me...

172
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,449
...why don't you try proving it to him?

173
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,163
Magnetic flux is measured by what?

174
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,209
Hall-effect pickup.

175
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,567
The dual of a parallel RC circuit?

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,202
Series RL circuit. I can go all day, pal.

177
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,610
Hartley, it looks like you have met
your match.

178
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,890
- I am Dr. Caitlin Snow. It's nice to meet you.
- Cisco Ramon. Nice to meet you.

179
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,044
And just ignore Hartley. We all do.

180
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,010
Tell your boyfriend I need the specs
on the synchrotron by end of day.

181
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,960
Actually, it is the end of Ronnie's day.
We are leaving early.

182
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,011
My boyfriend is taking me out of town
for our one-year anniversary.

183
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,209
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Thanks. I'll see you guys on Monday.

184
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,606
See you.

185
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,765
She seems nice.

186
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,407
You don't.

187
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,005
I give you a week.

188
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,850
Max.

189
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,608
Hi. I'm Iris West.

190
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,087
- It's my first day.
- I can see that.

191
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,004
Really, does it show?

192
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,162
The fact I've never seen you before shows.

193
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,769
Mr. Bridge, nice of you to make
an appearance at a staff meeting.

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,002
I do love a good shmear.

195
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,607
- Everyone, welcome Iris West, our new cub.
- Hi.

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,728
Anyone wanna volunteer
to be her mama bear?

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,844
- Mason, you pick a bad day to show up.
- I don't nanny.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,561
I lost the ability to make a
joke back in '05. Today you do.

199
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,964
Deadlines. All new stories are due
on my desk at the end of the day.

200
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,049
Oh, actually, I had an idea for a piece.

201
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,364
There's this program in Keystone that helps
battered women get back on their feet.

202
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,205
Ah. That sounds really great, West.

203
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,840
Actually, any thoughts on a piece
about the Flash?

204
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,771
Something you haven't written about yet?
Something new?

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,885
Um...

206
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,646
No, not currently.

207
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,563
All right. Sally forth,
everyone, sally forth.

208
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,567
Everything has a natural frequency.
Since sound is expressed as a vibration...

209
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,725
...if the pitch of the sound matches the natural
vibration frequency of an object, then...

210
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,450
So you're saying that can happen
to anything, not just glass?

211
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,046
Oh, yeah.
I think that's absolutely what happened...

212
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,250
...to the window at Wells' house.
He's using some kind of sonic technology.

213
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,684
I'm getting this feeling that Wells
is hiding something.

214
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,161
About what's going on
with this Rathaway character.

215
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,651
Don't touch that.

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,925
I mean, it sounds like this Hartley guy was
a pill before he went all super villain.

217
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,162
So I get why he never mentioned him.

218
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,364
Like he never mentions his girlfriend
that got killed.

219
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,726
No.

220
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,723
How do you know about her?

221
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,769
He's taken up a big part of our lives.

222
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,445
I wanted to know more about him.

223
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,604
Well, if you wanna know more about him,
you could just ask me.

224
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,768
Sounds like you don't know him
as well as you think.

225
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,607
Joe, multiple 911 calls.

226
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,484
Rathaway Industries is under attack.

227
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,971
Sector cars are en route.

228
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,290
- Hey.
- Barry, it's Caitlin.

229
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,046
I think I know why you're calling.

230
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,203
Get down, on the ground.

231
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,924
It's over, Rathaway.

232
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,048
You know my name.

233
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,531
I know some names too.

234
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,885
Caitlin Snow.

235
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,644
Cisco Ramon.

236
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,649
Harrison Wells.

237
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,963
I can hear their radio waves emanating
from your suit.

238
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,243
About 1900 megahertz.
Is that them on the other end listening?

239
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,482
Are they gonna hear you die?

240
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,250
No. They're gonna hear you
get your ass kicked.

241
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,771
Okay.

242
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,320
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says.

243
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,290
Smart enough to have figured out
who Wells really is.

244
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,364
You see, I know his secret.

245
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,885
Being scooped up by a guy clad in head-to-toe
leather is a longtime fantasy of mine.

246
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,929
So thanks.

247
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,246
Well, well, the gang's all here.

248
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,647
You've lasted a lot longer
than I'd have thought, Cisco.

249
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,882
And you didn't last 10 seconds
against the Flash.

250
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,249
- I was thinking of calling myself Pied Piper.
- Hey.

251
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,483
I assign the nicknames around here.

252
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,085
Although that one's not bad.

253
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,723
Caitlin, never did get that wedding invite.

254
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,446
- Shut the hell up.
- Stay in front of me.

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,211
Scanner's detecting foreign metallic
objects in your ears. Take them out.

256
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,284
I can't. I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

257
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,087
My hearing was severely damaged. Without
these, I'm in pain you can't imagine.

258
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,530
We all lost something that night.

259
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,011
Heh. Very clever, repurposing the
antiproton cavities into confinement cells.

260
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,885
- Wells' idea, I'm sure.
- It was mine, actually.

261
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,126
Hartley, don't make this more difficult
than it has to be.

262
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,130
Enough, Hartley.

263
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,564
Give us a minute.

264
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,210
- See you soon, Cisco.
- Doubt it.

265
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,687
God, I wish I had taken a language
in school.

266
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,684
How did you know
we were working with the Flash?

267
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,604
I wrote a hexagonal algorithm...

268
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,401
...tracking all of his sightings,
extrapolating a theoretical exit trajectory.

269
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,964
In other words...

270
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,045
...every time he ran from the scene of the
crime, he ran in this general direction.

271
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,043
You are brilliant.

272
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,721
And any anguish you have been through...

273
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,406
...because of me was never my intent.

274
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,680
Not bad.

275
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,844
As far as heartfelt apologies go.

276
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,365
Except that wasn't for my benefit.

277
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,281
That was for you, Flash.

278
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,922
It feels good to have the great
Harrison Wells behind you, doesn't it?

279
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,610
But one day...

280
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,286
...this man will turn on you...

281
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,403
...in a flash.

282
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,244
And even you won't see it coming.

283
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,483
My only hope is that he leaves you
in better shape than he left me.

284
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,444
If you're lucky, you'll only be dead.

285
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,411
Because every day,
I have to live with the agonizing...

286
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,171
...piercing screaming in my ears.

287
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,566
Heh. I almost forgot. I told your pet I
know your deep, dark secret, Harrison.

288
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,925
Have fun letting him in on that one.

289
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,201
I assume you were all listening.

290
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,407
Hartley was telling the truth.

291
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,766
I have not been honest with you.

292
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,200
With any of you.

293
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,402
The accelerator.

294
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,250
Hartley warned me that there was indeed a
chance that the accelerator could explode.

295
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,810
His data did not show
100 percent certainty.

296
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,406
Just that there was a risk
but it was a real risk...

297
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,767
...and yet I made the decision...

298
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,690
...that the reward...

299
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,966
...that...

300
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,370
...everything we could learn...

301
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,650
...that everything we could achieve,
that all of that...

302
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,651
...simply outweighed that risk.

303
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,285
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,047
The next time you choose to put our lives
and the lives of the people that we love...

305
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,361
...at risk...

306
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,483
...we'll expect a heads-up.

307
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,207
After the explosion,
when everyone else left you...

308
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
...Caitlin and Cisco stood by you.

309
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,011
You owe them more than an apology.

310
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,331
They might seem to get more than that
with Hartley so intent...

311
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,164
...on sending me to the next world.

312
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,731
What...?

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,606
That wouldn't make it right with them.

314
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,004
You broke their trust, our trust.

315
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,404
Oh. Hi, chief. Is that
what people call you?

316
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,641
Uh, no. Not really.

317
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,725
Listen, eyewitnesses say that the Flash
thwarted an attack downtown today.

318
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,002
- Look into it.
- Uh, yeah, sure.

319
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,207
Great.

320
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,204
Mason, you're looking rumpled today.
Mm-hm.

321
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,888
So, what are we working on?

322
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,567
I am following up on a lead
on corruption at the DWP.

323
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,409
You, I think you just got your assignment
from Larkin, didn't you?

324
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,846
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

325
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,284
I know that Larkin hired me because he thinks
that I have some sort of in with the Flash.

326
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,125
- But I am serious about being a journalist.
- Why?

327
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,050
Because you write a blog?

328
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,690
My mother writes a blog.

329
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,207
I may not have a lot of experience,
but I do have...

330
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,407
Spunk.

331
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,210
Grit.

332
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,164
Gumption.

333
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,562
What is this, a chick-lit novel?

334
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,168
No, no, no. I am having the worst day ever.

335
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,369
We both can't be having
the worst day ever, okay?

336
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,251
I was really looking forward
to getting some complaining in.

337
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,204
Well, fire away.

338
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,404
Okay, well, turns out
that the real reason they hired me...

339
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,605
...is because they think I have some sort
of connection to the Flash, which I don't.

340
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,565
Not anymore.

341
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,328
And I've been teamed up with Mason Bridge,
who is a legend, who I admired...

342
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,971
...before he told me I was a worthless,
talentless millennial.

343
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,122
Well, the people we admire
aren't always who we'd like them to be.

344
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,047
Well said.

345
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,723
So I'm screwed.

346
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,489
No. Look.

347
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,601
If this Mason guy doesn't see
what a talented journalist you are...

348
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,728
...then he's probably a lousy writer.

349
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,487
He won the Pulitzer. Twice.

350
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,404
I think.

351
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,490
Oh. Good for him.

352
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,406
Thanks, Barry.

353
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,770
Having someone believe
in me, it's a small...

354
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,691
...really, really big thing.

355
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,729
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

356
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,845
Where's Dr. Wells?

357
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,570
I'm not sure.

358
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,290
Barry was right.

359
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,084
Hartley was using sonic resonance.

360
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,562
The intensity regulator's measuring
decibels. But you know what's weird?

361
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,529
He had it set to the lowest setting.

362
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,087
What do you mean?

363
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,002
Well, he could've completely destroyed his
father's building if he wanted to in one blast.

364
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,043
So why not just do it and leave?

365
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,044
I mean, why stick around
and run the risk of getting caught?

366
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,883
Unless he wanted to be caught.

367
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,360
Dr. Wells, there's been a pipeline breach.

368
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,645
Hartley.

369
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,565
Stay here.

370
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,720
Not now.

371
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,651
Cisco, can you hear me?

372
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,523
- Hey, what's up?
- Hartley escaped. He's loose in the facility.

373
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,565
Okay.

374
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,967
Okay, your turn.
Why are you having the worst day?

375
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,486
Tell me, Harrison.

376
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,445
Am I still your guy?

377
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480
He)', are you okay?

378
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,723
Yeah. Cisco and Dr. Wells.

379
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,044
He's gone.

380
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,485
H9)'-

381
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,449
Welcome back, Mr. Ramon.

382
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,247
Oh.

383
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,603
Oh, man.

384
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,562
- Caitlin.
- Hey, she's fine.

385
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,207
You need to rest. You have a concussion.

386
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,885
You're lucky.

387
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,520
Please tell me you got him.

388
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,601
I guess the attack on his family's company
was a fake-out so we'd catch him.

389
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,762
Give him direct access to S.T.A.R. Labs.

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,400
- But why?
- Should've know he was up to something.

391
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,841
- This is my fault.
- Hey, man, this is on me too.

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,891
I shouldn't have left before...
This is no one's fault but mine.

393
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,566
I earned the blame.
I'm not interested in sharing it.

394
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,088
Hartley doesn't think
I've paid for my crimes.

395
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,251
He's right. He won't stop until I do.

396
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,481
Where are you going?

397
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,161
To earn back your trust.

398
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,081
Hmm. Now, what were you doing
in my accelerator?

399
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,087
I thought it was our accelerator.

400
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,285
Because it will be our fault if we turn this
thing on and blow a hole in Central City.

401
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,289
You are wagering the lives of everyone
in this building. Everyone in this city.

402
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,764
If you don't have the courage to admit
you could be wrong, I will do it for you.

403
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,608
Hartley Rathaway.

404
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,285
Your position at S.T.A.R.
Labs is terminated.

405
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,249
If you think you can shut me up...

406
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,164
Oh, I know I can, Hartley.

407
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,166
Because if you breathe one word of any kind
of unsubstantiated accusation...

408
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,167
...I'll make sure the only job you get in
physics is teaching it to high school juniors.

409
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,285
What is going on here?

410
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,048
Press conference.

411
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,683
Thank you for coming on short notice.

412
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,366
And for those of you
that read the 10-volume report...

413
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,491
...issued by the Norris Commission,
well, I commend you on your tenacity.

414
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,329
You already know, then, the circumstances
that led to the explosion...

415
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,642
...of the S.T.A.R. Labs
particle accelerator.

416
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,926
Or rather, you think you do.

417
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,005
Now, the commission's finding
was that the catastrophe...

418
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,322
...was caused by a chain of events...

419
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,445
...that nobody could have predicted,
including myself.

420
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,970
The truth is, I was warned there was a
chance the particle accelerator might fail.

421
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,485
I was warned by a former colleague.
A friend.

422
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,646
I chose to ignore the warning,
and in so doing...

423
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,928
...I let down all of you.

424
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,845
As a new friend pointed out...

425
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,166
...I failed this city.

426
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,161
I failed this city,
and I failed those who trusted me the most.

427
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,164
But coming forward today...

428
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,843
...it's my hope I'm taking the first step
toward regaining that trust.

429
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,690
And your trust as well.

430
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,969
- Are there any questions?
- Mr. Wells...

431
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,602
Do you have any intention
of rebuilding the particle accelerator?

432
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,843
Ms. West.

433
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,883
Do you have a question for me?

434
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,165
I don't believe you answered my colleague's
question, Dr. Wells, so I'll ask it again.

435
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,848
Do you have any intention of rebuilding the
particle accelerator, either now or in the future?

436
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,326
Of course not.

437
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,603
Thank you for your answer, doctor.

438
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,762
- It's my pleasure.
- Dr. Wells. Dr. Wells.

439
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,331
No further questions.

440
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,811
Hey.

441
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,846
What was that?

442
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,250
Gumption.

443
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,651
- Hartley made contact yet?
- What makes you so sure he will?

444
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,770
Because he's Hartley,
and he'll wanna have the last word.

445
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,285
Cisco, you should be resting.

446
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,684
The answer to why Hartley fooled us into
catching him is in here, and I'm gonna find it.

447
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,009
You have nothing to prove.

448
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,286
Not true.

449
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,849
Do you know why I hired you, Cisco?

450
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,204
You said you saw something in me. I know.

451
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,886
What I saw was humanity.

452
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,245
You and Hartley, Cisco, you're both
brilliant. You both have mental...

453
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,486
...sparks, but his brilliance subtracted
from the experience of working here...

454
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,326
...whereas your brilliance, your heart...

455
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,811
...your warmth, your
humor, it just adds to it.

456
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,287
There's no chosen one, Cisco.

457
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,850
There's no second or third favorite.
Never was.

458
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,606
It's just us.

459
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,010
What's that?

460
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,041
Nice gambit, Harrison, but this isn't over.

461
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,841
Hartley, what do you want? What do you
want? I already gave my mea culpa today.

462
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,843
The city already hated you.

463
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,210
You don't think I noticed that press
conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?

464
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,649
No, no, no, I've played with you too many
times to let you get away with that.

465
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,691
This is between you, me and the Flash.

466
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,804
You don't wanna play for those
kind of stakes with me, Hartley.

467
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,042
Actually, I really do.

468
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,440
What do you say?

469
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,045
One last game of chess?

470
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,410
You and I both know that the winner of the game
is the one who makes the next to last mistake...

471
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,045
...and you have a move in mind.

472
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,363
You're right, and I'm already at the board.

473
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,848
So why don't you move
your precious scarlet knight...

474
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,409
...while I take out a few pawns?

475
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,242
- All right. All right, Cisco, where do I go?
- I can't trace his signal.

476
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,368
He could be sending messages
from anywhere.

477
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,522
Cisco, scan for seismic activity.

478
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,530
If Hartley's using sonic blasts,
the vibrations could cause tremors.

479
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,050
Look, over here.
Quake activity but no fault line.

480
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,487
I think he's on Cleveland Dam.

481
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,291
Barry. Don't underestimate him.
He's brilliant.

482
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,043
Well, good thing I'll have you in here.

483
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,645
Rook to Knight 4.

484
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,929
You need to disarm
Harfley immediately. Do you hear me?

485
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,650
He is a master of distraction.

486
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,802
He is a master of hiding his true endgame.

487
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,645
Aha.

488
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,248
- Uh-oh.
- "Aha" what?

489
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,404
I figured out what Hartley stole,
why he let himself get caught.

490
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,849
- Which brings us to the "uh-oh."
- He has all the data on Barry's molecular scans.

491
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,084
- Why would he want that?
- He can get Barry's frequency.

492
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,131
Barry, you need to get out of there.
Get out immediately.

493
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,331
It's over!

494
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,403
You lose.

495
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,686
Amazing.

496
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,049
He replaced me with you, a total moron.

497
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,887
I got you with the same trick twice.

498
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,971
I got the idea
watching you and Harrison chit-chat.

499
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,211
To use your suit's own
speakers to kill you.

500
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,845
That feeling?

501
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,367
That's your organs shearing apart.

502
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,444
And you activated the frequency
when you disarmed me.

503
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,484
In chess, we call that a discovered attack.

504
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,927
You don't see it until it's too late.

505
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,208
Right, Harrison?

506
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,770
Barry's vitals are bottoming out.
We need to do something.

507
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,206
What are you doing?

508
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,609
Barry's on the travel road of the dam
at rush hour surrounded by cars.

509
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,002
Those cars are gonna have satellite radio.

510
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,000
Satellite sends a signal,
song comes out the speaker...

511
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,606
I know how satellite radio works.
How does that help?

512
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,161
I'll have a satellite send something
other than a song.

513
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,410
Hartley is about to hear something
he was not expecting.

514
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,770
A sound wave that'll meet the frequency of
and destroy his weapons.

515
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,650
You don't seem so special anymore.

516
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,691
Given how easy it was to bring you down,
I wonder if Harrison will even miss you.

517
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,450
No, no, no.

518
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,130
Checkmate.

519
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,001
Barry, can you hear me?

520
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,605
Sort of.

521
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,362
- Okay.
- How do you feel?

522
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,320
Fine. There is a little ringing in my ears.
But other than that, I'm good, so...

523
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,721
You're speaking very loudly.

524
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,043
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It'll pass.

525
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,766
Nice moves.

526
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,247
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

527
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,563
I think I'm gonna take my doctor's advice
and go lie down.

528
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,445
- What a great idea.
- Heh.

529
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,610
Man, I feel like I'm hungover times 10.

530
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,842
Not surprised.

531
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,402
It's difficult for me...

532
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,650
...to admit when I'm wrong.

533
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,929
Certainly in front of an entire city,
but also...

534
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,842
Also to my closest friends.

535
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,644
So I hope one day...

536
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,164
...to restore your trust and faith in me.

537
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,602
That day was today.

538
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,725
Yeah.

539
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,724
Not every hero wears a mask.

540
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,805
Some heroes save the day
in the simplest of ways...

541
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,644
...by just being there for us.

542
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,131
Or letting us know we 're believed in.

543
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,041
If I'm any sort of hero today,
it's not because of my speed.

544
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,086
It's because I learned how
from the people in my life.

545
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,606
All of them.

546
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,483
H9)'-

547
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,407
Man, that press conference today
was something else.

548
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,562
Dr. Wells. Took a lot of guts to do that.

549
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,960
I have to give him that.

550
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,726
He has his moments.

551
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,721
What's up?

552
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,405
- Must have been hard for you.
- What, to be this handsome?

553
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,967
Raising me.

554
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,282
Oh. No.

555
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,649
Well, a kid who loved math and chemistry.

556
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,441
Whose idea of a fun afternoon
was doing experiments in the garage.

557
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,204
- Ha, ha.
- It couldn't have been easy.

558
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,690
Soon as I started AP classes, you had
no clue how to help me with my homework.

559
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,405
- No.
- You must have always felt...

560
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,600
...like you were competing
with Richard Dawkins and Neil Tyson...

561
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,923
...and Henry Allen too.

562
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,685
But look, none of them,
no one, could ever replace you.

563
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,249
Not even Wells.

564
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,562
- Aw.
- Ha, ha.

565
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,966
- All right, I'll see you at home.
- All right.

566
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,527
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, Barry.

567
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,811
Hey. What did you find out?

568
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,764
I searched Wells' entire
house like you said.

569
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,007
There was nothing.

570
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,171
Are you sure you wanna do this,
investigate Wells?

571
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,521
Hundred percent.

572
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,284
Your evil hearing aids
won't help you escape this time.

573
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,244
So I'd get comfy.

574
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,162
You must be enjoying this, Cisco.

575
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,446
I am.

576
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,810
If that scares you, I can't imagine how you're
gonna feel when you let me out of here.

577
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,404
Hmm. Maybe I'm going deaf, because I could've
sworn you just said I'm gonna let you out.

578
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,769
And very soon too.

579
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,288
Why would I ever do that?

580
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,603
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is.

581
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,129
I know what really happened to him
that night.

582
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,001
And I know how to save him.

583
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,848
Warning. Tachyon output
has passed acceptable tolerance range.

584
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,446
Continued exposure is not recommended.

585
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,807
Increase to maximum, Gideon.

586
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,531
Increasing to maximum, doctor.

587
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,002
Speed force absorption at 35 percent
and rising.

588
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,889
I'm not stabilizing.

589
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,328
I can't hang on to my speed.
It comes and goes and I cannot control it.

590
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,122
Gideon, for how much longer
is the tachyonic device viable?

591
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,007
Calculations inconclusive.

592
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,403
- I'm sorry, doctor.
- Well, that's okay, Gideon.

593
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,003
This is only meant to be a temporary fix.

594
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,004
The real endgame is almost here.
