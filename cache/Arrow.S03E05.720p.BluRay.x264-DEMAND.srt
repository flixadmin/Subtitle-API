1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,521
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,682
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,047
...I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,850
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,287
Now others have joined my crusade.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,568
To them, lam Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,724
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else...

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,123
...I am something else.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,611
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,967
A lot of good people,
they lose someone.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,963
They come in here to work off that rage.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,964
Roy, are you okay?
You look a little tired.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,884
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,761
If I had accepted my life,
I would be a cocktail waitress in Vegas...

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,526
...and I never would have believed
some crazy guy in a hood...

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,451
...when he told me
I could be more than just some IT girl.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,931
- You're not moving very quickly this morning.
- I just didn't sleep much last night.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,365
You're not boxing, Laurel.
You're not even fighting.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,761
You're just lashing out. Come on.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,005
Impressive.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,811
How do normal people spend their morning?

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,005
Eight, nine...

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,525
Foun

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,763
Come on, ladies, you're almost there...
And 10.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
- Five. Ungh.
- Good. Very good.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,205
Yes!

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,601
Hold your core strong, push that back in...

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,971
Mrs. Fernandes...

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,160
...I already told you I
haven't seen your cat.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,924
I haven't seen him either.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,206
Or is the cat a girl?

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,523
Was I being misogynistjust now?
Or is it misogynistic? I never know.

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,121
Ray, what are you...?

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,805
Nice place. Lots of space.

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,201
So, what's the one thing
Queen Consolidated has...

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,806
...that we don't use
to its maximum potential?

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,681
- A doorbell?
- Have you heard of cogeneration?

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,726
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,167
- Cogeneration is a...
- The repurposing...

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,721
...of waste heat given off
by electricity production.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,089
A principle of thermodynamic efficiency,
which occurred to me...

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,040
...could be applied to a building
which generates over 240,000 watts...

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,601
...like Queen Consolidated.
Mmhm.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,084
I, uh, did some preliminary calculations
on the drive over.

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,889
You wanna sell QC's excess energy
back to the city?

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,611
If by sell, you mean
give away for free, yes.

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,411
Energy is something
that should be given freely to the masses.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,765
Uh, you still haven't found Mrs.
Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,889
- Oh, my beautiful girl!
- Very friendly with your neighbors, I see.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,530
- Mom...
- Mom?

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,251
- ...what are you doing here?
- Honey, I came to see you.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,961
For a visit. Look. Didn't you get my text?

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,011
Mom, to send a text, you actually have
to press "send" on the text.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,925
Oh, okay. Not a big deal.
I'll do it right now.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,087
- Are you adopted?
- Oh.

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,005
I'm so sorry. I didn't know you
had somebody staying over.

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,006
Oh, no, he's not staying over.
He's not... Like, we're not...

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,527
- This is my boss.
- Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Smoak.

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,490
- Hi. You can call me Donna.
- Mom.

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,530
- I'm Ray.
- Oh, my God. Palmer?

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,604
- You're that watch guy.
- We like to call them smart wearables.

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,969
I bought one of your watches! Look!

63
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,164
Felicity here thinks I don't pay attention
to all of her techie things.

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,249
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS. I'm actually
wearing a prototype for the new 6.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,244
- It basically replaces your computer.
- Very fancy.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
- You know what? It's yours.
- Oh, no. Seriously?

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,163
I'll let you two catch up.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,641
Let me know what you think
about those numbers...

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,610
- ...and, Donna, hope to see you again.
- Wouldn't count on it.

70
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,240
She'll probably be really busy,
planning my funeral...

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,410
...after I die of embarrassment.

72
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,211
You are standing in an open field
west of a white house...

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,682
...with a boarded front door.

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,921
What are you doing?

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,646
I just finished coding
a Linux emulator for Zork.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,647
Hmm. "it is pitch black.

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,483
You are likely to be eaten...

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,325
...by a grue."
I guess you'll have to protect me.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,964
Why can't you just quietly have sex under
a comforter like most college students?

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,011
You found an exploitable node?

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,130
Now I just need your super computer virus
to crack the firewall.

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,001
I really wish you wouldn't call my X-axis
bionumeric algorithm a super virus.

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,722
Spoofing the IF', switching to MD6, and...

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,209
Somebody take a screenshot.

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,603
We have to post this to Hackerforum
to brag that we actually got in.

86
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,560
- Hold on.
- Thirty seconds until the firewall goes back up.

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,726
Cooper, what are you doing?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,730
The world would be a much better place
without student loans.

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,242
You can't wipe out all the loans.
They're gonna track us down.

90
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,243
- Ten seconds.
- Cooper!

91
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,802
I'm not going to jail for you, Cooper.
And you shouldn't either.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,406
- Coop!
- I almost had it.

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,886
What were you thinking?

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
Ever heard of hacktivism?

95
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,522
Instead of posting to web forums,
we could be doing some real good.

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,682
And going to prison in the process.

97
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,050
It's all about what you wanna be
when you grow up, babe. A hacker or a hero?

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,050
Hello?

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,844
Speedy?

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,966
Just signed the lease. What do you think?

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,842
Thea, you're signing a lease on a spot
that you can't possibly afford.

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,203
- I can, actually.
- With whose money?

103
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,806
Malcolm Merlyn's. His estate, I mean.

104
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,248
When I left Starling City,
I mentioned something to Ned Foster...

105
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,169
...about Malcolm being my father...

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,166
...and there was a lot of legal stuff
I didn't understand...

107
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,967
- He left you money?
- The entire world thinks he's dead, so...

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,805
...yes, legally, his estate goes
to his last living heir.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,251
And, ahem, last week when you told me that you
had investors for the club, that was a lie?

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,688
I was afraid you wouldn't react well
to the idea of me taking his money.

111
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,481
It's blood money, Thea. You don't know
what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of.

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,722
I know what his money is capable of.

113
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,766
Renting me this really sweet loft.

114
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,604
Listen to me. He's alive.

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,929
And if you take his money,
he has a hold on you.

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,242
I think you're being a little melodramatic.

117
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,526
I'm his daughter, okay?
He's not going to put me in danger.

118
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,129
He's responsible for the death of 503
innocent people, including your brother.

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,244
That is a card that you do not get to play.

120
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,209
You are my brother...

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,127
...but that does not mean you have the right
to tell me what I can do with my life.

122
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,044
I am my own person.

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,807
Movers are coming tomorrow,
so you can stop by with popcorn...

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,570
...or not stop by at all.

125
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,323
Oh, please.

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,324
Good. So...?

127
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,367
What is going on?

128
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,045
Ollie?

129
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,971
Are you okay?

130
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,088
We are Brother Eye.

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,607
Judgment has been rendered
against this city.

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,762
A sentence carried out.

133
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,122
An earthquake. A siege.

134
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,044
This is what comes next.

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,407
A new life you will live on your knees.

136
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,884
And it will take nothing more
than the push of a button.

137
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,646
We are in control now.

138
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,041
And this is all just the beginning.

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
Let there be light.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,010
Ooh. A nightclub. Heh.

141
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,561
You know,
I'm really not dressed for a nightclub.

142
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,926
- Really?
- You think?

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,363
My friend owns the place. He just needs
a little help turning the power back on.

144
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,567
Oh.

145
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,444
Why don't you...

146
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,762
...come, come, stay put?

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,922
- Stay here?
- Right here.

148
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,844
Okay. You gonna go?
Mm-hm.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,923
Hey, any luck tracking this...?

150
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,845
Hello.

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,966
Hi. Uh...

152
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,043
- Please tell me this is your friend.
- No.

153
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,001
- Mom, this is Oliver...
- Queen.

154
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,926
- Very nice to meet you.
- Yes, it's so nice to meet you too.

155
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,686
How many billionaires do you know?

156
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,450
Diggle, uh, meet Felicity's morn.

157
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,684
- Mom? John Diggle. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

158
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,168
Aw. Hello. Who is this little nugget?

159
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,890
This is my daughter, Sara.

160
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,125
- Mom? Mom? Mom!
- Oh. Aw. What?

161
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,966
- We have to go downstairs.
- I didn't mean to stop you.

162
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,327
I'm so sorry. Little baby moment. So sorry.

163
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,683
- It's great to meet you, finally.
- Nice to meet you. Yes. Definitely.

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,410
Why is Sara here?

165
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,211
Lyla's on assignment,
and the nanny called in sick.

166
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,846
But we can't bring her down there.

167
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,251
- Why not, Oliver? Who's she gonna tell?
- Well, she...

168
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,481
- I'm not comfortable with her down there.
- God help me.

169
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,880
My mother loves babies.

170
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,921
- Really?
- Whoever this Brother Eye group is...

171
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,880
...got access to the city's protective
network and uploaded a system-wide virus.

172
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,121
Any way to trace it?

173
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,442
No, it deleted itself
as soon as it completed its task.

174
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,929
- He said the power outage was the beginning.
- Let's find them before there's a next time.

175
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,611
- Hey, Laurel, are you all right?
- I'm fine. I was close.

176
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,367
But why did I get the alert?
Why didn't they call the district attorney?

177
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,127
He's visiting his niece in Coast City.
You are the acting district attorney.

178
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,203
Congratulations.

179
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,849
Hello, detective. Captain.

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,042
- You're on this Brother Eye thing?
- We are.

181
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,567
Good. No one here knows computers
better than you.

182
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,802
I gotta go. For the last time,
I am not interested in buying a fake ID.

183
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,531
I am hanging up now. Bye.

184
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,443
My mom says hi.

185
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,650
- You still angry at me?
- I was into the account network.

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,531
I had 3000 debts wiped
by the time you pulled the plug.

187
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,446
Think of how many accounts you could go
to prison for if I hadn't stopped you.

188
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,725
Relax. The DNS wasn't configured.
They can't backtrace me.

189
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,406
They can. The subroot was configured.

190
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,891
By accessing the accounts...

191
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,209
...you set off a packets feedback
that anyone could trace back to you.

192
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,201
You are gorgeous
when you're being a chicken.

193
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,005
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
- Cooper Seldon...
- FBI, don't move!

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,687
- ...you're under arrest.
- What? No! Let go of me!

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,687
No, no, no!

197
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,162
You're under arrest for violation
of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 10-30.

198
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,681
- Don't! It's not his!
- You have a right to remain silent.

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,366
Let go of him! Let him go!

200
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,290
We said this was just the beginning.

201
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,205
Electricity is not the only power
in this city.

202
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,931
Consider money, for example.

203
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,521
The banks are next to go dark.

204
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,444
Your beloved dollars wiped away...

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,366
...as your accounts will finally
all be equal at zero.

206
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,045
- Felicity.
- I'm working on it.

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,841
I set up some trace IP packets.
As soon as he opened the channel...

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,367
...I scooped up the crumbs.
Crumbs we can follow?

209
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,965
I hope so.

210
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,528
- Where's Captain Lance?
- Coordinating squad car patrols for Dispatch.

211
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,729
- Why, what's wrong?
- There's a situation at Starling National.

212
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,405
Send in an ESU squad.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,004
- Sorry, but you don't have the power to...
- I'm acting district attorney.

214
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,524
The city charter gives me operational authority
in times of crisis, which this clearly is.

215
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,844
And I'm not letting anyone get hurt.
Send in an ESU now.

216
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,091
- What's going on?
- S.C.P.D. dispatched a riot squad.

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,368
That's like fighting a fire with gasoline.

218
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,851
Suit up.

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,924
This group has been ordered to disperse.

220
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,243
Go back inside! Get back behind the line!

221
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,762
Oliver, the riot is getting
out of control. You need to hurry up.

222
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,720
You are trespassing!
Please disperse immediately.

223
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,410
We will use force!

224
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,124
Get away from the bank!

225
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,449
Tear gas is dispersing them,
but we can't calm the entire city.

226
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,281
The trace led me to the virus they're
using. It is a mile past complex.

227
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,164
I'm combing through now.

228
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,251
- No, no, no.
- What's wrong?

229
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,601
The virus, I can't stop it.

230
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,683
- How do you know?
- Because it's mine.

231
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,481
I wrote it five years ago.

232
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,041
Okay, before you say anything,
just know that...

233
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,488
...I never imagined the virus being used
for something like this.

234
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,723
I mean, sure, I could have imagined it.
I have a very vivid imagination.

235
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,326
Like Cronuts, I had a vision of them...
Hey.

236
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,689
Relax.

237
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,490
Take a deep breath.

238
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,683
Good. Now start at the beginning.

239
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,571
I was in this,
I guess you could call it a group...

240
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,281
...in college. We were hacktivists.

241
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,681
For lack of a better word.

242
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,605
Civil disobedience via the World Wide Web.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,323
I created this...

244
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,361
...this...

245
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,007
...super virus.

246
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,522
It could give us root access
to any infected server.

247
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,682
We could expose government fraud...

248
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,367
...and start virtual sit-ins
and digitally deface criminals.

249
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,041
I guess you could say it was
my first attempt at being a hero.

250
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,361
Felicity...

251
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,042
...why didn't you tell
me about any of this?

252
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,121
Do we even know a fraction of what happened
to you the five years you were away?

253
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,249
- Who else had access to the program?
- Myron Forest.

254
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,962
He was my... I had a boyfriend in college,
and Myron was his roommate.

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,049
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?

256
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,688
What about the boyfriend?

257
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,081
Oh, he couldn't have done this. He's...

258
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,369
...not in the picture,
but Myron always had somewhat of an edge.

259
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,564
Can you give me an address?

260
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,890
Sure.

261
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,449
There's one small problem.

262
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,201
Not small necessarily, but short.
Just take the alleyway entrance.

263
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,131
Are you okay?

264
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,123
I've been better.

265
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,490
I talked it over with Myron, and I'm going
to tell them I wrote the super virus.

266
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,485
You can't do that.

267
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,802
- I can't let you rot in prison, Coop.
- You can't tell them you wrote that virus.

268
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,769
Because I already told them I did.

269
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,961
- Cooper...
- I always said I'd protect you from the grues.

270
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,010
- This isn't...
- It's better this way.

271
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,725
I wiped out those loans. There's no reason
both of us should be in prison.

272
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,525
I love you.

273
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,966
I love you too.

274
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,641
Hey. Got a minute?

275
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,004
Congratulations, you called in a riot
squad, you nearly started one...

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,322
...and you did it behind my back.

277
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,161
You were busy, and the situation
at Starling National was escalating.

278
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,166
You escalated it, Laurel! Please tell
me you can at least see that now.

279
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,691
Okay.

280
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,203
- I'm sorry.
- Laurel, baby...

281
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,080
...what's gotten into you? You're
angry, you're distant, you're reckless.

282
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,368
Tell me you're not boozing again.

283
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,201
- No.
- Then what the hell's going on?

284
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,600
Because this isn't you.

285
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,889
Look, I haven't said anything.
I was hoping you would say something...

286
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,886
...because you are in 1O different kinds
of pain and you won't talk about it.

287
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,404
I can't talk about it with you.

288
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,568
Okay, listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.

289
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,210
But talk about it with somebody.

290
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,802
Because secrets hurt, baby,
sometimes more than the truth.

291
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,242
Backup generator keeps that locked.

292
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,721
Or so they told me.

293
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,049
I could never get that stupid door to open.

294
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,241
Contractor says the entire sublevel's
flooded, though. A water-main break.

295
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,565
What are you doing here, Ollie?

296
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,207
A super hacker's trying to take over
the city and I'm worried about you.

297
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,041
- I still get to be worried, right?
- Yes.

298
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,250
And if you really have to,
you can even be judgmental.

299
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,090
Occasionally.

300
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,242
But someone told me recently
that family is pretty precious.

301
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,041
And love, in spite of everything,
is what makes it precious.

302
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,965
Right now the Queen family
is just you and me.

303
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,888
So let it just be you and me.

304
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,844
And don't take Merlyn's money.

305
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,607
I'm trying to meet you halfway here, Ollie.
The other half is up to you.

306
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,165
Myron Forest...

307
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,005
...you have failed this city.

308
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,161
He has to retract all the infected packets
from subsystem mainframes.

309
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,529
Tell me how to shut down the virus.
Do it now.

310
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,563
You think I'm behind the cyber attacks?

311
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,604
- Sounds like a Brother Eye to me.
- I swear to God, I'm not.

312
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,081
I head up the IT department
of an accounting firm.

313
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,526
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.

314
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,002
I'm one of the sheep lunatics
like these guys hate. Why would I do this?

315
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,162
His fingerprints are all over this code.

316
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,408
It's an X-axis bionumeric algorithm.

317
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,848
The code's an X-axis bionumeric algorithm
that you've used before!

318
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,250
In college.

319
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,288
My roommate, his girlfriend. Yeah.

320
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,411
We developed it, we called it a super virus,
but that doesn't mean I'm the Eye guy.

321
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,564
- Have you tried Felicity Smoak?
- She's innocent.

322
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,643
Then it's gotta be someone else.

323
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,122
After we graduated, I might have showed
the code off to a few people.

324
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,011
- Who were they?
- I don't remember. It was five years ago.

325
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,210
I didn't think it was a big deal.
We were just kids playing with matches.

326
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,569
I'm running out of expletives.

327
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,882
Track down whoever
Myron shared your code with.

328
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,929
I hacked all of his e-mails and texts...

329
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,560
...from five years ago,
and all I got was depressed.

330
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,929
- Okay, what about your ex?
- I already told you, he didn't do it.

331
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,287
Why? Because he's your ex-boyfriend?

332
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,000
Because“.

333
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,606
...my senior year of college,
Cooper and I did a stupid thing.

334
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,286
He got arrested and he went to prison.

335
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,091
So he went to prison. Maybe he got out.

336
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,607
He didn't.

337
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,411
- How do you know?
- Because he's dead.

338
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,242
He hung himself before sentencing.

339
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,370
Felicity...

340
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,924
I just really need to be alone right now.

341
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,364
Oh. I'm glad you're here.

342
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,205
I launched my plan to rebrand Starling
into Star City.

343
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,330
Didn't count on cyber terrorism.

344
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Uh, I'm looking for a partner
with whom to drown my sorrows...

345
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,967
...and you definitely look like someone
who could use a drink.

346
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,565
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,640
My mother...
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

348
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,804
You Okay?

349
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,446
You're an inventor.

350
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,603
Did you ever create anything
that you didn't think was important...

351
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,171
...turns out...

352
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,804
...it's very important?

353
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,646
Of course.

354
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,642
Those turned out to be the best inventions.

355
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,211
Not always.

356
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,124
You wanna talk about it?

357
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,611
Of course I'd find you here.

358
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,970
- Could you just wait one second?
- Wait?

359
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,165
I've already waited two hours for you
at your apartment...

360
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,164
...and before that,
it was two hours in that club.

361
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,611
Is there any way
that you could be anywhere else but here?

362
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,003
Thanks, Mom.

363
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,683
That wasn't the least bit mortifying.

364
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,525
Only half as bad as Parents' Weekend
freshman year.

365
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,364
Well, I'm sorry.

366
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,447
I'm sorry I've been reduced
to stalking my own daughter.

367
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,083
Because you can't seem to comprehend
that I can't make the whole world stop...

368
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,289
...because you decided to show up
on my doorstep.

369
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,283
I have responsibilities.

370
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,046
Yes, I know, Felicity, you have work.

371
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,965
- You have work, work, work...
- No, no, you don't understand.

372
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,044
It is so much more than work.

373
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,602
All you care about is my love life
or how much cleavage I don't show.

374
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,730
- That is not true.
- That is completely true!

375
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,804
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.
I'm sorry I have an actual job.

376
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,726
I'm sorry that I don't dress like a porn
star, which is a compliment to you.

377
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,771
I am so sorry
that I am such a disappointment to you!

378
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,961
I'm not as smart as you, Felicity,
or your father.

379
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,770
I know that.

380
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,489
When you were only 6 years old,
I could barely keep up with you two.

381
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,244
And...

382
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,927
...maybe I wasn't always the mother
you wanted, but I was always there.

383
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,971
I stayed, and I tried. He...

384
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,846
He left me.

385
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,447
He left us.

386
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,442
But when I look at you...

387
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,409
...all I see is what he gave you.
There's nothing of me...

388
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,925
...in you.

389
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,402
You know, it's so funny, I was...

390
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,606
I was always so afraid that one day
you were gonna leave me too. Heh.

391
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,841
And now I finally realize...

392
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,130
...you already did.

393
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,721
There are people on the other end
of this thing, right? People we can hit?

394
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,484
We need Felicity.

395
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,846
I'm here.

396
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,768
My super virus has
3407 traceable access nodes.

397
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,764
Hopefully, I didn't put a firewall
on every one, though.

398
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,161
Of course I did,
because I'm smarter than that.

399
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,767
Seriously, if I had two less IQ points,
we never would have gotten in this mess.

400
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,282
- Are you all right? Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

401
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,804
Probably back at my place...

402
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,770
...wishing she had a different daughter.
It's a long story.

403
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,366
- Go see her. Take an hour.
- The city is under attack.

404
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,006
You're our best chance of stopping it,
but not like this.

405
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,845
- Your head's not in the game.
- I will get it together.

406
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,721
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour. Go talk to your mom.

407
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,007
I do not have anything to say to her.

408
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,961
You know, earlier today, Thea told me
that she literally has to put up with me...

409
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,049
...because family is precious.

410
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,403
And that it's love, in
spite of everything...

411
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,210
...that makes it precious.

412
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,040
Go.

413
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,369
- Where's Sara?
- The nanny came to pick her up.

414
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,369
Said he was from a company called
A.R.G.U.S. I don't know. Never heard of it.

415
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,369
I think that's the point.

416
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,731
Well, I'm glad you're still here.

417
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,210
You are a terrible liar, Felicity.

418
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,522
Might be the only thing we have in common.

419
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
I have blond hair.

420
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,724
You dye it.

421
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,484
You're right.

422
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,564
We're different, and it's always
gonna be that way, and it's not easy...

423
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,926
No, you know what?

424
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,243
It's totally my fault
forjust showing up here uninvited.

425
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,609
Seriously, I think I just got so excited
about this free flight.

426
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,240
What?

427
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,040
My plane ticket. I got an e-mail that said
I'd won some contest...

428
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,443
...free first-class round trip to Starling.

429
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,443
E-mail?

430
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,482
Mom. Morn...

431
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,051
...someone wanted you to be here.

432
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,569
- No!
- Mom!

433
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,167
MQfn!

434
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,122
- Baby!
- Mom!

435
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,884
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

436
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,121
Oh, thank God.

437
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,724
Where are we? Oh, honey.

438
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,362
Felicity Smoak.
Just the woman I wanted to see.

439
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,006
What the hell do you want from me?
Who are you?

440
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,764
You really don't know?

441
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,086
I thought you never forget your first love.

442
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,170
You died.

443
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,807
They told me...
That I committed suicide, right?

444
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,844
The NSA needed a hacker
with game for cyber espionage...

445
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,163
...and I needed to not be in prison
for the rest of my life.

446
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,731
Because of what the NSA wanted me doing,
it was advantageous for me to be dead.

447
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,689
When I found out you died...

448
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,922
...I was devastated.

449
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,086
I loved you.

450
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,290
I loved you too.

451
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,962
After I finished my time with the NSA,
I was gonna find you.

452
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,320
To let you in on this.

453
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,326
And then I discovered
you'd become this corporate lapdog.

454
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,484
It broke my heart. You changed.

455
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,122
If you thought I was capable of doing this,
you never really knew me at all.

456
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,365
When you wrote this virus, Felicity,
you knew exactly what it was capable of.

457
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,285
All I'm doing is unleashing
the true potential of what you made.

458
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,523
Why?! This isn't who you are.

459
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,287
Five years with the NSA,
you learn a lot about how the world works.

460
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,011
How it can't be saved or salvaged.

461
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,969
How it's every man for himself.

462
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,611
You also learn that when a city bank
goes under, say, financial cyber attack...

463
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,650
...the mayor will reach out
to the Treasury Department...

464
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,167
...and request an influx of fresh cash.

465
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,489
Cash, which is transported
by armored trucks...

466
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,484
...navigating according
to a closed-end GPS system...

467
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,881
...which directs them to City Deposit.

468
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,369
If the drivers deviate from the route,
the trucks are shut down.

469
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,087
But you are going to hack into the system
and direct the cash to come here.

470
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,846
- It was about money, and I'm the sellout?
- No.

471
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,927
No, babe.
You're the one who's gonna help me.

472
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,129
See, breaking into the treasury's
asymmetric encryption...

473
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,169
...is beyond even my capabilities.

474
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,288
I'm going to politely decline.

475
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,766
- Don't!
- That's why I flew some motivation into town.

476
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,929
She's been MIA for over an hour.

477
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,368
You did tell her to go home.
I had an A.R.G.U.S. agent pick up Sara.

478
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,887
- I could have them go back, check things out.
- Yeah.

479
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,524
Felicity's never more than five feet
from her phone.

480
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,364
Agh. Something's wrong.

481
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,961
Ow!

482
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,643
That terminal's configured to only connect
with the treasury's IP.

483
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,361
I mention this so you don't try to do
anything stupid like alert the police.

484
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,726
I'm so sorry.

485
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,884
Mom, right now's
not really the best time, okay?

486
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,930
But it might be the last time, hon,
and I want you to know...

487
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,561
...that all I've ever wanted...

488
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,565
...is for you to be happy.

489
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,565
What say we hit pause
on the Dr. Phil episode?

490
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,927
It's done. It's done.

491
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,804
- That quick?
- There's a reason you wanted me, right?

492
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,122
They'll be at your front
door in five minutes.

493
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,170
Guards will be armed.

494
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,164
- Let's go. Move out.
- I'll take the front.

495
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,445
Stay put, okay?

496
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,002
Just because we used to screw
doesn't mean I won't use this gun.

497
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,080
What's that?

498
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,563
Huh? Oh. Uh...

499
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,451
It's the watch.
It's the watch Mr. Palmer gave me.

500
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,683
It chimes on the hour and, I guess,
when we're about to be killed.

501
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,281
We're not gonna be killed.
We're going to get out of here.

502
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,808
- It basically replaces your computer.
- I don't know what that means.

503
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,007
It means it has Wi-Fi.

504
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,404
Really?

505
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,524
Okay.

506
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,524
When they're in range, you know what to do.

507
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,971
I did what you wanted.
You don't have to kill us.

508
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,090
Really?

509
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,844
Who would've thought
that I'd become the grue?

510
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,764
Hey! Hey.

511
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,891
You wanna wave that gun at me, fine,
but don't you dare threaten my daughter.

512
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,008
Here I thought you were all nails and hair.

513
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,606
Try single mom
who's worked 60-hour weeks for tips...

514
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,081
...in order to raise that genius child
you see right there.

515
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,806
I mean, I don't understand all this
cyber-whatever, but I know without that gun...

516
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,770
...you wouldn't last 10 seconds
against my girl.

517
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,207
Too bad she doesn't have 1O seconds.

518
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,691
I disagree.

519
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,645
Put the gun down.

520
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,850
You were always good, Felicity.

521
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,286
So good.

522
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,568
But so am I.

523
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,923
Motion-sensored.
They can hit most any target.

524
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,004
Come on.

525
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,651
Something's wrong.

526
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,643
All right, boys, light them up!

527
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,125
Clear.

528
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,169
This is all your fault.

529
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,041
No.

530
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,885
Mom, are you okay? Are you...?

531
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,400
On, baby.

532
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,287
Before, you were right
to keep pressing on Cooper.

533
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,488
Turns out he's not as dead as I thought.

534
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,404
I've had some experience with that.

535
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,129
And you learn not to judge.

536
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,566
Yes.

537
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,762
Are you okay?

538
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,285
I guess so.

539
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,761
Old lovers have a way
of opening old wounds.

540
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,245
Lovers.

541
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,602
Sounds creepy no matter how you say it.

542
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,770
Felicity...

543
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,244
...I want you to know that whatever experiences
you had to go through, I'm glad that you did.

544
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,687
They shaped the person you are today.

545
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,446
And you know how I feel about her.

546
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,600
I should head out.

547
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,605
You were right.

548
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,281
We have to love our families.

549
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,920
No matter what.

550
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,969
Felicity.

551
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,970
You here?

552
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,170
What happened to you?

553
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,526
This is me now.

554
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
You were right.

555
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,204
Something is going on with me.

556
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,690
And my father, he noticed it as well.

557
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,411
He told me I should open up to someone.

558
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,841
My sister, she...

559
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,525
She died.

560
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,484
Well, she...

561
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,005
She was murdered.

562
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,051
- Did they ever catch the...?
- No. No one knows she's gone except for me.

563
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,369
And I can't tell anyone. So yes.

564
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,842
- Yes, I am angry.
- I'm gonna help you with that.

565
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,361
See, before, you were swinging
at your sister's killer.

566
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,363
That's a target you're never gonna hit.

567
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,410
Don't train for that, all right?
Train for yourself.

568
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,609
See, now I know how to teach you.

569
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,883
So, what's it gonna be?

570
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,051
Red or black?

571
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,611
Black.

572
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,683
Definitely black.

573
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,485
Maybe I'm lost

574
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,005
It was popcorn, right?

575
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,564
You said you were meeting me halfway.
This is me doing my part.

576
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,761
Maybe I'm lost

577
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,200
Wow.

578
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,646
I missed you, Speedy.

579
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,008
Let's not miss each other anymore.

580
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,244
It was so much easier to be in each other's
lives when we were underneath the same roof.

581
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,086
So why don't you move in with me?

582
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,084
I mean, clearly, I have enough space.

583
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,727
And l...

584
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,451
I swear,
once the club starts making a profit...

585
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,763
...I will donate all of Malcolm's money...

586
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,608
...to a earthquake-relief charity thing.

587
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,611
I can live with that.

588
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,488
You got a TV in here?

589
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,248
Well, I'm officially off.

590
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,806
My flight doesn't leave till tonight, but
I figured you'd be working, so we can...

591
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,010
We can just say goodbye now.

592
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,644
You were right.

593
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,563
- About what?
- I haven't always been appreciative of you.

594
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,683
You were always there for me
every day and night.

595
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,650
So if I haven't said thank you enough...

596
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,006
...thank you.

597
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,005
But you were wrong too...

598
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,966
Mm-hm.

599
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,363
...when you said all you saw
in me was Dad...

600
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,000
...and there was nothing of you in me.

601
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,131
I can't really explain it, but over the
past two years, I have been through a lot.

602
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,080
And I have learned
that I am a lot tougher than I thought.

603
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,011
That"

604
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,204
...I get from you.

605
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,486
Don't cry.

606
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,849
I took another look at those
cogeneration numbers. You wanna...?

607
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,721
Oh.

608
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,530
- Hi again.
- Hi.

609
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,722
How's that new smart wearable
working out?

610
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,291
Oh. It's, um...

611
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,886
- it's a real lifesaver. Heh-heh.
- Yeah.

612
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,246
Mm-hm.

613
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,403
Ray, I can't come in to work today.

614
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,561
I am...

615
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,051
...calling in sick.

616
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,246
- "Feel better."
- Heh. Thank you.

617
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,690
See you later.

618
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,242
Yeah, you need to do something
about that one.
