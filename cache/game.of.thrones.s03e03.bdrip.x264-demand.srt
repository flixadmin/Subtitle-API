1
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,024
If I may, nephew,

2
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,686
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

3
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,923
at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...

4
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,397
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

5
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,129
And don't call him
"nephew." He is your king.

6
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,636
Robb knows I meant him no...

7
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,264
You're lucky I'm not your king.

8
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,867
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory ﬂag.

9
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,641
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

10
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,580
back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

11
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,949
I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war

12
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,681
if he's the only one winning any battles.

13
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,053
No, there's glory enough to go around.

14
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,954
It's not about glory.

15
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,456
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

16
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,791
I seized an opportunity.

17
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,227
What value was the mill?

18
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,056
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

19
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,568
Is he there now?

20
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,072
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

21
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,337
I wanted to draw the
Mountain into the west,

22
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,436
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

23
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,743
I wanted him to chase us,

24
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,082
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

25
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,246
without a strategic thought in his head.

26
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,348
I could have that head on a spike by now.

27
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,261
Instead, I have a mill.

28
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,331
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

29
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,872
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

30
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,374
Martyn is 15, I believe.

31
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,213
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

32
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,818
Have I sued for peace?

33
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,285
No.

34
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,848
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

35
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,791
brother's great-grandsons?

36
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,999
No.

37
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,967
How many men did you lose?

38
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,166
208. But for every man we
lost, the Lannisters...

39
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,040
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

40
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,341
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,408
I didn't know.

42
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
You would have.

43
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:20,022
Right here today
at this gathering, if you had been patient.

44
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,186
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

45
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,662
You know who isn't?

46
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,197
Tywin Lannister.

47
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,445
Intimate. Lovely table.

48
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,344
Better chairs than
the old Small Council chamber.

49
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,215
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

50
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,380
What news of Jaime?

51
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,797
20,000 unwashed Northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.

52
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,025
You control more spies and informants

53
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,227
than the rest of the world combined.

54
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,296
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

55
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,705
We are trying, my lord.

56
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,173
Try harder.

57
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,375
What do we have, then?

58
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,507
Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun

59
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,349
for the funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

60
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,382
In Stark's absence,
Rouse Bolton holds Harrenhal,

61
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,928
which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

62
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,019
in practice, not in name.

63
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,188
Let him have it.

64
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:18,999
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

65
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,538
The Lord of Harrenhal will make

66
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,105
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

67
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,267
For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

68
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,805
Lady Arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.

69
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:32,840
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

70
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,443
A successful courtship would make

71
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,078
Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

72
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,954
Titles do seem to breed titles.

73
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,924
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

74
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,926
and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

75
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,089
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt

76
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,895
to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.

77
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,937
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

78
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,236
but Lord Baelish's
absence would present certain problems.

79
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,709
The royal wedding may end up being

80
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,278
the most expensive event in living memory.

81
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,247
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

82
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:09,082
Not a good time
to leave the crown's finances unattended.

83
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,213
Fully agreed.

84
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,417
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

85
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,483
- Master of Coin?

86
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,154
It would appear to best suits your talents.

87
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,959
I'm quite good at spending money,

88
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,897
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

89
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,899
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

90
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,462
I have no doubt
you will prove equal to this challenge.

91
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,336
Hear, hear.

92
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,475
He lifted her high in the air

93
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,773
He sniffed and roared and smelled her there

94
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,008
She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair

95
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,584
But he licked the honey from her hair

96
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,652
From there to here, from here to there

97
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,848
All black and brown and covered with hair

98
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,016
He smelled that girl on the summer air

99
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,617
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

100
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:56,158
I hope you're pleased. If I were
armed, they'd never have taken us.

101
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,258
You were armed
when we were taken.

102
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
I was in chains, if you recall.

103
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,105
Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.

104
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,373
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

105
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,174
"what a brilliant swordsman."

106
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,175
You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.

107
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,947
I've been sitting in a muddy pen,

108
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,680
wrapped in chains, for the past year.

109
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,688
I'm a woman. I was beating you.

110
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,020
You were not beating me.

111
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,288
Maybe you were as good as people said...

112
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,296
Once.

113
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,458
Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.

114
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,699
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

115
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,676
None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.

116
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,212
- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?

117
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,648
They'll knock your teeth out.

118
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,149
You think I care?

119
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,552
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

120
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,226
If you fight them,
they will kill you' Do you understand?

121
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,889
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

122
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,399
Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?

123
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,524
What does it matter?

124
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,592
Close your eyes.

125
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,262
Pretend they're Renly.

126
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,536
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

127
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,905
You'd let them do what they wanted?

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,245
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the Gods.

129
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,016
If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.

130
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,425
Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has
to keep the arrows out of my heart.

131
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,427
Why are you helping him?

132
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,589
He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?

133
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,257
You're not our prisoner.

134
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,460
What am I?

135
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,592
Our guest.

136
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,637
No one's put any chains on you.

137
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,206
So I can walk away, then?

138
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,072
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

139
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,407
You're lucky we found you.

140
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,745
You think
you're good with that bow, you little twat?

141
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,287
Better than anyone you've met.

142
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,623
A cowards weapon.
I like to fight up close,

143
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,126
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

144
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,754
Why? So you can kiss him?

145
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,662
You remember the last time you were here?

146
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,296
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

147
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,838
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

148
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,100
and I'd rather not see you no more.

149
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,648
Watch your head.

150
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,079
Off we go.

151
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,446
Walk up!

152
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,485
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

153
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,923
I'm staying.

154
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,492
You're what?

155
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,100
I baked brown bread for the innkeep,
she said she never had better.

156
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,136
Told Thoros she's keeping me as
payment for all his free meals.

157
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,700
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood
wants. My brother ain't no king.

158
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,472
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

159
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,808
Winterfell.

160
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,176
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

161
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,550
Well, I made you something.

162
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,150
What is it?

163
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,554
It's a wolf.

164
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,961
Yes, it is.

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,805
That's the tail?

166
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,238
Yeah.

167
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,639
Well, be safe.

168
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,307
Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.

169
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,010
You don't burn your fingers.

170
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,492
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

171
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,499
Good-bye, Arry.

172
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,780
Up you go, little lady.

173
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,021
Hey, Hot Pie.

174
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,689
It's really good.

175
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,694
A person could almost be forgiven
for forgetting we're at war.

176
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:34,635
It often comforts me
to think that even in war's darkest days,

177
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:40,082
in most places in
the world absolutely nothing is happening.

178
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,120
I've missed you, Uncle.

179
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,954
Father missed you, too,
from the day you left.

180
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,255
Maybe he never said it in so many words...

181
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,921
Maybe?

182
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,295
Your father was a stubborn old ox.

183
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,734
I was surprised when he died. Didn't
think death had the patience.

184
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,407
I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.

185
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,079
Did you make peace in the end?

186
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:17,417
After 30 years of fighting, I don't
think he remembered what started it.

187
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,118
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

188
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,651
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

189
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,331
I told him people
had been calling me Blackfish for so long,

190
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,596
they don't remember my real name.

191
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,606
Every time he would leave for the
capital or fight in a campaign,

192
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,838
I'd see him off.

193
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,008
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

194
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,823
"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."

195
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:59,053
And I would sit at this window every day
when the sun came up, waiting.

196
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,966
I wonder,

197
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,699
how many times did Bran or Rickon

198
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,034
stare across the moors of Winterfell,

199
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,473
waiting for me to return?

200
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,809
I will never see them again.

201
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,146
You mustn't think it.

202
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,351
We don't know the truth.
They could be in hiding.

203
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,858
Robb believes they're alive.

204
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,888
And he must go on believing.

205
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,899
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

206
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,766
And you must remain strong for him.

207
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,717
You're Robb Stark's wife.

208
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,014
Hold still.

209
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,553
Is it true what they say about him?

210
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,025
I don't know. What do they say about him?

211
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,358
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

212
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,090
True.

213
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,428
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

214
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,366
True.

215
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,298
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

216
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,933
Martyn Lannister.

217
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,214
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.

218
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,283
Unless it's a full moon.

219
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,219
It's not a full moon tonight, is it?

220
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,226
See? Nothing to fear.

221
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,744
Always the artists.

222
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,598
It's only horses.

223
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,031
No men.

224
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,796
You said there was dead crows.

225
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,139
There was.

226
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,007
How many men were here?

227
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,173
About 300.

228
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,615
And you know what those men are now?

229
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,683
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

230
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,661
Do you think anyone got away?

231
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,530
It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against Mormont.

232
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:54,162
But dead or alive,
he took a big gamble coming north.

233
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,206
And he lost.

234
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,707
His best fighting men are dead.

235
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,870
And whether
he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

236
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,878
or a blue-eyed corpse,

237
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,643
he's a long way from home.

238
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,519
Tormund. Climb the Wall.

239
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,723
Take Orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.

240
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,819
He knows Castle
Black's defenses better than any of us.

241
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,594
And if he's useful,
good. If not, throw him off the Wall.

242
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,431
See if crows can fly.

243
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,870
We're finally going to war, old friend?

244
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,900
Hide near Castle Black. When I give
the signal, hit them in the night.

245
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,414
They've got a big old wall to hide
behind, but it only guards one side.

246
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,282
We'll meet again.

247
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,751
- Aye. If you do your job.
- Ah.

248
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,914
How will we see your signal?

249
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,753
Send your eagle
above the Wall every night.

250
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,454
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

251
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,723
the North has ever seen.

252
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,384
Ghost?

253
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,568
What have we here? Frozen crows?

254
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,578
We've come a long way.

255
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,348
Smaller flock
than you went north with.

256
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,577
We can talk inside.

257
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,622
Oh, can we?

258
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,602
They need some water.
Tether it, and I'll be inside.

259
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,355
Keep your eyes where they belong.

260
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,865
They're not for you.

261
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,527
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

262
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,799
Aye, pig's got value to me.

263
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,639
You should all
be kissing my feet for letting you in.

264
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,980
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

265
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,346
You are a godly man?

266
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,852
I am. I got no fear of what's out there.

267
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,048
When the white cold comes,

268
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,990
your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.

269
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,224
The only ones left
will be those who are right with the Gods.

270
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,923
The real Gods.

271
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,205
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag

272
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,707
or she can bite down on my fist.

273
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,513
Women.

274
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,545
That sow right
there gave birth to a litter of eight.

275
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,689
Barely a grunt.

276
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,091
And she's almost as fat as this one here.

277
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,594
Now why don't you dine on him?

278
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,359
Carve off what you need as you go.

279
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,459
Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

280
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:07,452
Here we are.
Sharpen these for me, would ya?

281
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,946
I see the head. Push. That's it.

282
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,243
You're nearly there.

283
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,655
One more push should do it.

284
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,926
What is it? What is it?

285
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,966
Keep quiet.

286
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,900
If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.

287
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,900
I can ride.

288
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,232
You're sure?

289
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:19,583
Ride east. Follow the rising sun.
Your sisters waiting for you.

290
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,215
I'll make you
a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.

291
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,521
We're not in the Iron Islands.

292
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,788
Go.

293
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,089
Come on.

294
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,564
Come on. Come on, Come on. Come on.

295
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,434
Come on back.

296
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,370
You refuse to
tell me where you're going?

297
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,539
I don't know yet.
The fires will show me.

298
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,877
How long will you be gone?

299
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,292
I don't know.

300
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,444
You're abandoning me.

301
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,146
I will never abandon you.

302
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,152
You are the Son of Fire.

303
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,488
I am sworn to serve you.

304
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,822
Then serve me.

305
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,897
When I return, you will understand.

306
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,561
My enemies think they've destroyed me.

307
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:11,405
They're laughing at me,
the way Renly laughed at me.

308
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,270
I want Joffrey dead. I
want Robb Stark dead.

309
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,942
Make me another son.

310
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,613
I cannot.

311
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,917
Why?

312
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,983
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

313
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,756
I'm not easily killed. Men
have tried for years.

314
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,933
I want you.

315
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,483
Your fires burn low, my king.

316
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,382
There is another way. A better way.

317
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,120
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

318
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,823
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

319
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,365
You are.

320
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,627
There are others
with your blood in their veins.

321
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,534
You will sit on the Iron Throne,

322
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,903
but first there must be sacrifices.

323
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,705
The Lord of Light demands it.

324
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,682
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

325
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,249
To whom?

326
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,884
To any slave who contemplates doing

327
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,555
whatever these slaves did.

328
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,929
Give me your water.

329
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,765
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

330
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,675
Here' drink.

331
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,713
Leave this place, Your Grace.

332
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,342
Leave tonight, I beg you.

333
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,011
And what is she to do for soldiers?

334
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,250
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

335
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,849
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

336
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,757
If you want to sit on the throne

337
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,591
your ancestors built, you must win it.

338
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,030
That means blood on
your hands before the thing is done.

339
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,036
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

340
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,640
How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

341
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,802
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

342
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,379
where innocents didn't
die by the thousands?

343
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,051
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, Khaleesi.

344
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,284
You know what I saw? Butchery.

345
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,758
Babies, children, old men.

346
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,159
More women raped than you can count.

347
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,825
There's a beast in every man, and it
stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

348
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,893
But the Unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.

349
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,964
They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

350
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:02,603
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

351
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,306
You disagree, Ser Barristan?

352
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,316
When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,

353
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,909
men died for him
because they believed in him,

354
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,420
because they loved him,

355
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,013
not because they'd been
bought at an auction.

356
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,594
I fought beside the last
dragon on that day.

357
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,329
I bled beside him.

358
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,028
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

359
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,865
and Rhaegar died.

360
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,536
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

361
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,203
I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

362
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,312
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.

363
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,392
All?
Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?

364
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,659
They did not. I want to buy them all.

365
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,836
She wants to buy them all.

366
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,336
She can't afford them.

367
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,339
The slut thinks she can flash her tits,

368
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,244
and make us give her whatever she wants.

369
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,881
There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?

370
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:22,049
Yes. 8,000.
And the ones still in training as well.

371
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,653
If they fail on the battlefield,

372
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,397
they will shame Astapor.

373
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,001
Master Greizhen says
they cannot sell half-trained boys.

374
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,199
If they fail on the battlefield,

375
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,502
they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

376
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,566
I will have them all or take none.

377
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,426
Many will fall in battle.
I'll need the boys

378
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,175
to pick up the swords they drop.

379
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,610
The slut cannot pay for all of this.

380
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:53,018
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.

381
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:56,091
Her ship will buy her
100 Unsullied, no more,

382
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,252
Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.

383
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,455
And this because I like
the curve of her ass.

384
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,788
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

385
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,893
What is left will buy her 10.

386
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,801
The gold
you have left is worth 10.

387
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,430
I will give her 20
if it stops her ignorant whimpering.

388
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,600
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.

389
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,771
Her Dothraki smell of shit,

390
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,278
The Dothraki you have with you...

391
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,949
but may be useful as pig feed.

392
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,648
The Dothraki you have
are not worth what they cost to feed...

393
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,578
I will give her 3 for those.

394
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:27,715
...but Master
Kraznys will give you

395
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,059
three Unsullied for all of them.

396
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,051
So, ask this beggar queen,

397
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,561
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay...

398
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,154
how will she pay
for the remaining 7,877?

399
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:39,099
...for
the remaining 7,877 Unsullied?

400
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,576
I have dragons. I'll give you one.

401
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:54,140
You will win the throne with
dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

402
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,810
Khaleesi, please.

403
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,624
Three dragons.

404
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,926
- One.
- Two.

405
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,193
One.

406
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,003
They want the biggest one.

407
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,445
Done.

408
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,948
I'll take you as well, now.

409
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,389
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.

410
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,960
A token of a bargain well struck.

411
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,465
She asks that you give me
to her, as a present.

412
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,789
She asks that you do this now.

413
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,968
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more

414
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,303
Than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that.

415
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,473
You're both here to advise me.

416
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,413
I value your advice, but if you ever

417
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,415
question me in front of strangers again,

418
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,076
you'll be advising someone else.

419
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,219
Is that understood?

420
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,720
Do you have a name?

421
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,386
This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.

422
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,487
Do you have a family? A mother and a father

423
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,656
you'd return to if you had the choice?

424
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,067
No, Your Grace. No family living.

425
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,163
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

426
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,766
Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.

427
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,244
Many of those on the Walk of
Punishment were taken there for less.

428
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,941
I offered water to
a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.

429
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,212
Do you know
what he said to me? "Let me die."

430
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,948
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

431
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,385
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me

432
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,755
about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

433
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,423
All questions have been taken from them.
They obey, that is all.

434
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,195
Once they are yours, they are yours.

435
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,362
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

436
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,896
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

437
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,274
You may go hungry. You may fall sick.

438
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,069
You may be killed.

439
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,910
Valar Morghulis.

440
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,418
Yes, all men must die.

441
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,580
But we are not men.

442
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:26,067
A surprising place
to keep the royal ledgers.

443
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,070
I'm surprised you're surprised.

444
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,340
This is the safest place in the city.

445
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,141
Not for bastards.

446
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,646
That's all of them, my lord.

447
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,512
Thank you, my dear. Pod.

448
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,850
Pod. Take them outside.

449
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,114
I'll be there in a moment.

450
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,449
Yes, my lord.

451
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,600
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

452
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,334
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

453
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,375
You should have him knighted.

454
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,673
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

455
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,606
If only.

456
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,982
I owe you a significant debt.

457
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,386
Our redheaded friend.

458
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,185
You secured her release
when the Queen detained her.

459
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,055
Oh, that.

460
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,221
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

461
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,127
Apparently, Her Grace believed

462
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,192
that you two had
some sort of special relationship.

463
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,170
We don't. I did fuck her once.

464
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,298
- I know.
- But we don't.

465
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,865
I know.

466
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,568
How's! the Queen get that idea?

467
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,408
Why don't you ask her?

468
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,912
Any advice for me on my new position?

469
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,921
Keep a low profile.

470
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,049
If I had a gold dragon

471
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,390
for every time I heard that joke,
I'd be richer than you are.

472
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,327
Well, you are richer than I am.

473
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,388
Good point.

474
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,560
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.

475
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,231
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

476
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:15,073
Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.

477
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:20,775
I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

478
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,750
Come on, I'm here later. Come on.

479
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,850
Tonight, then.

480
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,763
Looks like dull reading.

481
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,095
You think all
reading is dull reading.

482
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,965
It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.

483
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,562
The secret history
of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.

484
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,370
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

485
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,035
to hide what he's really up to.

486
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
Unless he made it all up, yes.

487
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,271
Podrick, do keep up.

488
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,404
Yes, my lord.

489
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,608
Pod rick.

490
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:54,775
Yes, my lord?

491
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,116
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

492
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,780
I finally found
a suitable reward for the services

493
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,088
you've provided over and
above what might be considered reasonable.

494
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:09,394
Tell me, Pod,
have you ever been with a woman?

495
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,558
No, my lord.

496
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,657
Wonderful.

497
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,305
Genna specializes in first-timers.

498
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,966
She's not bad with second-timers, either.

499
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,839
Uh, my lord...

500
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,504
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

501
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,981
through my
would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

502
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,584
Now, as it happens,

503
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,079
Marei

504
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,251
is quite the spear-handler herself.

505
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,489
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

506
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,792
as the battle raged all around me.

507
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,766
He's handsome.

508
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,302
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

509
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:55,876
Kayla is famous
from hereto Volantis in certain circles.

510
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:02,646
One of four women in the world who can
perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

511
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,711
My lord, I don't even...

512
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,316
She's here to thank you for
being a thoroughly respectful fellow,

513
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,055
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

514
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,300
Be back in time for my supper.

515
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,400
Pace yourself, lad.

516
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,136
For years
I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.

517
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,516
Whenever the crown needs
money, he rubs his hands together

518
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,142
and, poof, mountains of gold.

519
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,517
Let me guess. He's not a magician.

520
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,714
No.

521
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,323
He's stealing it?

522
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,858
Worse, he's borrowing it.

523
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,588
What's wrong with that?

524
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,098
We can't afford to pay it back'
that's what's wrong with it.

525
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,430
The crown owes millions to my father.

526
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,004
Seeing as it's
his grandson's ass on the throne,

527
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,040
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

528
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,269
Forgive a debt, my father?

529
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,902
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive,

530
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,674
I've never borrowed money.

531
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,182
- I'm not clear on the rules.
- Well...

532
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,623
The basic principle is, I lend you money,

533
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:22,027
and after an agreed upon period of
time, you return it with interest.

534
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,391
What if I don't?

535
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,462
Well, you have to.

536
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,029
But what if I don't?

537
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,429
This is why I don't lend you money.

538
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,608
Anyway, it's not my
father I'm worried about.

539
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,734
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

540
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,710
We owe them tens of millions.

541
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,805
If we fail to repay these loans,

542
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,974
the bank will fund our enemies.

543
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,212
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

544
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,923
Ah, the return of the conquering hero.

545
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,324
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

546
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,952
The lad's practically skipping.

547
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,555
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.

548
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,123
Or should I say my money's worth?

549
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:04,904
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
This is more than I give you in a year.

550
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,273
He's a squire. You don't pay him.

551
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,403
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

552
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,078
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

553
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,777
Maybe they're trying to curry some
favor with the new Master of Coin.

554
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,821
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

555
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,853
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

556
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,687
What did you tell them?

557
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,317
I didn't tell them anything.

558
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,827
What did you do to them?

559
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,430
Lots of things.

560
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,329
And they seemed to like these things?

561
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,957
Yes, my lord.

562
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,004
Of course they did.
They're paid to seem to like it.

563
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,471
Only they weren't paid.

564
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,304
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

565
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,038
they gave him the time for free?

566
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,407
Is that what you're telling us?

567
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,178
Sit down, Podrick.

568
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,955
We're going to need details.

569
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,523
Copious details.

570
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,736
Come on! Come on!

571
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:50,574
Come on! Come on.

572
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,331
You know how we deal with runaways?

573
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,109
Take off his pants.

574
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,171
No! No! No, no, no!

575
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,341
I'm gonna fuck you into the din.

576
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:38,284
No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!

577
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,720
No, please! No! No!

578
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,583
You little bastard.

579
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,431
Come, my lord.

580
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,440
You're a long way from home,
and winter is coming.

581
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:02,565
I'll take the big bitch first.

582
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:06,097
When she's good
and wet, you lot can finish her off.

583
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,700
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.

584
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,076
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me

585
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,546
to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.

586
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,777
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.

587
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,286
Orders were to take the Kingslayer
alive. Nobody said shit about you.

588
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,259
You're only making it worse.

589
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:35,127
Take her over there,
where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.

590
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,173
Come on!

591
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,976
You know who she is, don't you?

592
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,925
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.

593
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,259
Never been with a woman that big.

594
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,095
She's Brienne of Tarth.

595
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,298
Her father is
Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?

596
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,169
I'm gonna cut your throat!

597
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:15,335
They call it
the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?

598
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:19,874
Every sapphire in Westerns
was mined on Tarth.

599
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,516
Sapphires are gemstones.

600
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,143
The blue ones.

601
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,812
I know what they are.

602
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,549
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight

603
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,218
in sapphires if she's returned to him.

604
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:39,363
But only if she's alive,
her honor unbesmirched.

605
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,880
Bring her back here.

606
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,539
Yes, my lord.

607
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,672
Get up.

608
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:55,875
Come on.

609
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,476
Come on, on your feet.

610
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,981
Unbesmirched.

611
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,721
Not defiled.

612
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,490
Fancy word for a fancy man.

613
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,223
I hated to read as a child,

614
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:15,031
but my father forced me
to study every morning

615
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,663
before I could practice
with sword or horse.

616
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,772
Two hours every day
holed up in the maester's chambers.

617
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:25,006
I learned a lot of fancy words.

618
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,242
I bet you did.

619
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:40,222
Your father, he'd pay your
weight in gold to get you back?

620
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,933
You'll be a rich man till
the end of your days.

621
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:49,027
And your sons will be rich men,
and their sons after them.

622
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,437
Lands, titles...

623
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,702
You'll have them all.

624
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,438
The North can't win this war.

625
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,641
You're a smart man. You understand that.

626
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,876
We have the numbers. We have the gold.

627
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,977
Aye, you have both.

628
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,720
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause is admirable.

629
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:16,498
Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.

630
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:18,890
Hard to argue with that.

631
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,240
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

632
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,642
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree?

633
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,976
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

634
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,277
but if I could sleep lying down,

635
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,647
my back would thank you for it.

636
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,423
I'm not as young and
resilient as I was once.

637
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,426
None of us are.

638
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,853
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

639
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,296
Come on, men.

640
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,170
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

641
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,210
I'm famished, actually.

642
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,212
I think we've got a spare
partridge on the fire.

643
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,976
Well, I do like partridge.

644
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:17,390
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

645
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,491
Will this work as a table, my lord?

646
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,329
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...

647
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,636
On the stump.

648
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,973
You think you're the smartest man there is.

649
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:46,086
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

650
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,314
My father...

651
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:48,548
And if you get in any trouble,

652
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,718
all you've got to do is say "my father"

653
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,659
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

654
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:57,727
Don't.

655
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,163
Have you got something to say?

656
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:06,498
Careful. You don't want
to say the wrong thing.

657
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:15,074
You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

658
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,086
Never forget that.

659
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,682
Here, this should help you remember.
