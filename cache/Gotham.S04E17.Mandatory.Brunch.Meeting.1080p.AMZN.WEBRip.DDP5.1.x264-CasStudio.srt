167
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

168
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,180
- (elevator bell dings)
- (people shouting)

169
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,020
- (gunshots)
- (screaming)

170
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,620
Jimbo! Ol' buddy, ol' pal.

171
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,340
It's great to see you.

172
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,790
Drop the gun.

173
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,060
- Oh, you are such a stick in the mud.
- Give it up, clown boy.

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,370
Hey.

175
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,430
Knock, knock.

176
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,380
You're supposed to say "Who's there?"

177
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,530
- BULLOCK: Thank you, Frances.
- GORDON: Yeah. All right.

178
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,230
Hey, Jim. Same story all around.

179
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,040
No one knows Xander;
no one even met him.

180
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,850
Apparently, he had a proxy

181
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,120
who handled his, uh,
dealings with the company.

182
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,860
Hayes was the only one
who knew their identity,

183
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,440
but, uh, obviously, he's not talking.

184
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,490
So we have to figure out
another way to find Xander.

185
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,450
I'm ahead of you. We looked into it.

186
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,020
No driver's license,

187
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,990
no known addresses... guy's a ghost.

188
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,560
Everything that's happened
in the last 24 hours...

189
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
the breakout, Tetch...

190
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,130
it's all been about
Jerome finding this guy.

191
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,520
I don't think it has anything to
do with him being an engineer.

192
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,070
- This seems personal.
- Makes sense.

193
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,790
I mean, Jerome went to his uncle
to look for him.

194
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,470
Yeah. So how are they connected?

195
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,210
What's up?

196
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,480
Is that Wayne Plaza?

197
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,710
GORDON: Take a look at
the initials of the engineer.

198
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,520
- X.W. Xander Wilde.
- Uh-huh.

199
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,650
Looks like we're gonna have
to go talk to the kid.

200
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,660
He's gonna be thrilled to see you.

201
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,590
(siren wailing in distance)

202
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,660
(indistinct chatter)

203
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,210
What time is it?

204
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,250
CROWD: Riddle time!

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,910
What time is it?!

206
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,420
CROWD: Riddle time! (cheering)

207
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,630
NYGMA: That's right!
It's riddle time at...

208
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,890
NYGMA/CROWD: The Riddle Factory!

209
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,960
(cheering)

210
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,870
Our first contestant is...

211
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,910
Lars,

212
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,240
(with German accent):
from the now defunct biker gang,

213
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,250
The Street Demonz.

214
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,450
It's been a rough go
of it lately, huh, Lars?

215
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,320
I've fallen on hard times.

216
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,490
But I'm damn happy to
be here with you, Riddler.

217
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,910
That's the Narrows spirit I love.

218
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,260
Now, you know the rules.

219
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,410
I ask a riddle.

220
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,770
You answer correctly, you ask me one.

221
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,430
You win them both,

222
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,730
and you're walking out of
here with cold hard cash.

223
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,240
(crowd cheers)

224
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
Lila.

225
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,840
Prepare the timer.

226
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,020
I am heavy forward,

227
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,860
but backward, I am not.

228
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
What am I?

229
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
LARS: Okay. I'm heavy forward.

230
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,340
Back-Backward, I'm not. Um...

231
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,380
- (sighs)
- MAN: You got this, Lars.

232
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

233
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,960
Wait a minute. No, no. I know this.

234
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,740
It's, uh...

235
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,950
No, no. I know this.

236
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,050
- WOMAN: Come on, Lars.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

237
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Um...

238
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,740
It's the hourglass.

239
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,330
(scattered laughter)

240
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,600
(buzzer sounds)

241
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,230
(crowd groans)

242
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,910
The answer is ton. T-O-N.

243
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,480
Backwards, I am "not."

244
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,050
Sorry, Lars.

245
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,320
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

246
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,220
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

247
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,090
You hear 'em, Lars.

248
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,590
It's time to spin...

249
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,760
ALL: The Wheel of Misfortune.

250
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,600
ALL: Spin the wheel!

251
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,200
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

252
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,410
- Lila, please.
- (chanting continues)

253
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,510
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

254
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,740
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

255
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,950
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

256
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,450
(bell ringing)

257
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,950
(crowd cheering)

258
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,890
My personal favorite.

259
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,990
Rabid Sack of Rats!

260
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,260
(cheering)

261
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,090
- (laughing)
- (rats squeaking)

262
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,960
THOMPKINS: All right,
that's enough! Enough!

263
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,510
NYGMA: Doc Thompkins.

264
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,460
What brings Your Majesty down
to our rabble?

265
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,240
How you doing, Ed?

266
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,600
Haven't seen you
since we put Oswald on ice.

267
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,090
Well, I'm doing far better
than Sofia Falcone,

268
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,800
from what I understand.

269
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,780
Whatever the hell this is, it's over.

270
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,370
I don't think so. Ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,160
our queen has just informed me
she wants to shut us down.

272
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,220
How do you feel about that?

273
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,010
(crowd booing and shouting)

274
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,410
You hear that?

275
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,980
That's the sound of democracy.

276
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,230
The people have spoken.

277
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,090
And my name is the Riddler.

278
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,960
Okay.

279
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,340
You want to be entertained?

280
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,670
Hold this, will you?

281
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,910
- Then I'll beat him.
- MAN: Oh!

282
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,580
You can't be serious.

283
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,550
You realize what happens

284
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,520
- when you lose?
- I know.

285
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,390
I spin the wheel.

286
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,420
But if I win, you shut this place down.

287
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,290
(crowd shouting)

288
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,630
ALL (chanting):
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc...

289
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,330
(man booing)

290
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,030
We have our next contestant!

291
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,270
(cheering)

292
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,860
JEROME: Got any ice cream in there?

293
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,100
I've always had a soft
spot for Chunky Monkey.

294
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,600
I was wondering when you would come.

295
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,900
Me? That's very flattering.

296
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,740
So tell me, Little Miss Proxy,

297
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
where is he?

298
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,130
I'll never tell you.

299
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,080
Hmm. I don't know.

300
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,740
See...

301
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,590
I can be very persuasive.

302
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,260
See that?

303
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,330
JEROME: Yeah.
I was wondering about that.

304
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,790
You got, like, a big dog or something?

305
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,440
No. That's how
I'm going to transport you.

306
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,900
Hmm?

307
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,840
(phone beeps)

308
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,850
I've got him.

309
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,280
(horn blows)

310
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,700
(glass clinking)

311
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,360
Butch?

312
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,110
I had heard you were different.

313
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
But I will be honest.

314
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,870
I like it.

315
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,720
What do you want?

316
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,840
I assume you've heard
about the Arkham breakout.

317
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,960
Well,

318
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,680
I just came from brunch
with Jerome Valeska,

319
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,290
and let's just say
that he has plans for Gotham.

320
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,190
What kind of plans?

321
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,470
That part wasn't entirely clear.

322
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,460
They seem to involve a great
deal of paint. (laughs)

323
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,970
No matter.

324
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
I have seen his kind come and go.

325
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,540
Jerome Valeska will flame out.

326
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,870
And in the rubble,

327
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,380
I will reclaim the underworld.

328
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,500
I could use a good man
like you by my side.

329
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,660
(chuckles)

330
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,100
You must be all out of allies
to come looking for me.

331
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,240
Don't be modest.

332
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,200
With your brute strength and my
brains, we will be unstoppable.

333
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,660
I did that job. I'm my own man now.

334
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,200
(laughs)

335
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,830
Really?

336
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,860
Because from where I am, you
look like a man who has nothing.

337
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,010
You'd be wise
to watch what you say to me.

338
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,280
- I'm not the same man you remember.
- And neither am I.

339
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,650
Look at the two of us.

340
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,360
We used to run this town together.

341
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,170
We were friends.

342
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,620
Look, you want your old
life back. So do I.

343
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,990
- We are the same.
- Wrong!

344
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,990
- (groaning)
- You can have your old life back.

345
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,890
I can't. Look at me.

346
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,990
Tabitha will never love me again.

347
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,990
Slaughter Swamp turned
me into a monster!

348
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,730
Now get out of here.

349
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,770
If I ever see you again,

350
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,940
I'll pop your head off like a flower.

351
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,870
(coughs)

352
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,910
(birds chirping)

353
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,280
Let me get this straight.

354
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,010
You tell us to stay out
of your investigation,

355
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,580
and now you want our help?

356
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
- Subtle.
- We have reason to believe

357
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,520
your father met with Xander Wilde.

358
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
Well, if he did, he certainly
would have made a note of it.

359
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,790
What was the name of the building again?

360
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,840
Wayne Plaza.

361
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,290
He was a meticulous notetaker, Thomas.

362
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,590
He organized everything by project.

363
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,600
Let's see. Wayne Gardens.

364
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,430
Wayne Hospital.

365
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,100
Aha. Here we go.

366
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,000
Wayne Plaza.

367
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,460
Right.

368
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,210
Oh, you're bang
on the money there, Captain.

369
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,510
Xander Wilde. Says he went to
meet him to finalize the plans.

370
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,550
No address, just the name of
the street... Annesley Drive.

371
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,450
That's out past Buxton
by the old rock quarry.

372
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,490
This man must have been
very important if my father

373
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
went out of his way to meet him alone.

374
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm starting to think he
isn't just some recluse

375
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,400
hiding from the world.

376
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,230
He's hiding from Jerome.

377
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,920
(laughing)

378
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,690
How interesting.

379
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,560
(grunting)

380
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,770
(grunts)

381
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,160
Oh.

382
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,910
- Oh, you are incorrigible.
- (camera whirring)

383
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,250
And then again,

384
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,780
you always were.

385
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,550
(laughs)

386
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,580
Oh, wait. Or was that me?

387
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,120
Sometimes I get so confused,

388
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,960
I... I can't remember.

389
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,430
(laughing)

390
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,290
(sighs)

391
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,790
<i>You didn't have
to run away like that, you see.</i>

392
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,540
<i>I would never hurt you... Xander.</i>

393
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,330
<i>I love you.</i>

394
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,410
(laughing)

395
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,980
(cackling continues)

396
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,330
<i>Can't wait to see ya!</i>

397
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,860
<i>Did you think about me?</i>

398
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,620
<i>I know that you did.</i>

399
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,190
<i>Oh, I'm gonna squeeze you until you pop!</i>

400
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,840
BULLOCK: Where the hell's the house?

401
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,820
(buzzer sounds)

402
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,190
James Gordon,

403
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,600
<i>here to see Xander Wilde.</i>

404
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,330
(lock clicks)

405
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,620
So this whole joint's underground?

406
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,820
Mr. Wilde values his privacy.

407
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,520
How long has he lived here?

408
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,960
He finished construction six years ago.

409
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,090
(camera whirring)

410
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,500
- Ecco. 496.
- FEMALE VOICE: <i>Welcome, Ms. Ecco.</i>

411
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,170
He'll see you now.

412
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,660
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Wilde.

413
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,950
I expected you might come, Captain.

414
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,050
BULLOCK: My God.

415
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,920
There's two of them.

416
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,770
May I put my hands down now, gentlemen?

417
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,160
Please?

418
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,100
Apologies, Mr. Wilde.
You took us by surprise.

419
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,460
That's understandable.

420
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,670
You can call me Jeremiah.

421
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,050
That's the name my mother gave me.

422
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,420
You solved her murder, Captain Gordon.

423
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,730
I owe you a debt of gratitude for that

424
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,500
and for putting Jerome
in Arkham, where he belongs.

425
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,450
He never mentioned you before.

426
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,590
No, I suppose he wouldn't have.

427
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,970
From the letters my mother sent me,

428
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,180
he never spoke of me after I left.

429
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,380
Left where?

430
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,570
The circus.

431
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,020
They hid me away to protect me from him.

432
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,250
See, we were always different,
Jerome and I.

433
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,350
From an early age,
I showed a proficiency

434
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,380
for maths and design,

435
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,930
and Jerome, mainly
the mutilation of alley cats.

436
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,060
On my tenth birthday, he held
a cake knife to my throat.

437
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,360
A few weeks later,
he lit my bed on fire.

438
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,670
It was like living in a nightmare.

439
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,800
My mother knew eventually
one day he would succeed,

440
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,670
so one night, my uncle came
to my room while Jerome slept,

441
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,180
and told me that he was taking me away.

442
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,310
I had no idea where,

443
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,980
but I kissed my mother good-bye,

444
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,450
told her I loved her,

445
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,120
and I never saw her again.

446
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,580
He took you to St. Ignatius.

447
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,880
Got a new name, a new life.

448
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,630
And I was finally able
to live without fear.

449
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,630
But in my heart,

450
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,240
I knew one day Jerome would come for me.

451
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,070
Well, that day is today, pops.

452
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,970
We have reason to believe
Jerome knows where you are.

453
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,630
We need to move you to a safe location

454
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,250
- until we can apprehend him.
- That won't be necessary, gentlemen.

455
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,850
I've spent the bulk of my life
preparing for this eventuality.

456
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
I am safest here in my home.

457
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,750
Not anymore.

458
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,020
Jerome knows the name of your proxy.

459
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,420
He got it from your boss
just before he executed him.

460
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,860
I heard about Jerome
visiting Allen Hayes.

461
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,990
It's tragic.

462
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,000
But the proxy's name
I gave to Allen was a fake.

463
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,760
You're lying.

464
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,280
I beg your pardon?

465
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,510
Yeah, there's something
about this guy that's fishy.

466
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,890
The security cameras outside.

467
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,220
They were turned on.

468
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,290
So why are the monitors in here off?

469
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,710
I don't see why
that's any of your concern.

470
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,670
Now, if you excuse me,
I'm a very busy man.

471
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,210
- Yeah. I'm sure that you are.
- Please don't touch that.

472
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,030
That's very sensitive equipment.

473
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,270
(Jerome grunting)

474
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,220
BULLOCK: Oh, yeah.

475
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,050
I'd say that's pretty damn sensitive.

476
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,890
Ladies and gentlemen,

477
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,500
a gauntlet has been laid
at the Riddler's feet.

478
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,990
Our leader, Doc Thompkins...

479
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,720
she thinks that she knows
what's good for you.

480
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,060
She thinks stapling a live barracuda

481
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,770
to someone's face isn't
damn good entertainment.

482
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,740
(crowd booing)

483
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,810
- Just get on with the show, Ed.
- Okay.

484
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,940
Enough! What time is it?

485
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,310
CROWD: Riddle time!

486
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,670
- What time is it?
- Riddle time!

487
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,350
- Lila.
- (crowd cheering)

488
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,450
Prepare the timer.

489
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,610
WOMAN: Let's go, Lee!

490
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,990
I can be broken...

491
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,130
without being held.

492
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,130
Given and then taken away.

493
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,670
Some people use me to deceive,

494
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,600
but when delivered,
I am the greatest gift of all.

495
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,950
What am I?

496
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,760
You stumped?

497
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,540
Of course I am.

498
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,140
You're the Riddler.

499
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,640
So you give up?

500
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,470
- No.
- MAN: Come on, Lee!

501
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,040
You're gonna give me the answer.

502
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,910
(laughs)

503
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,650
Really? How's that?

504
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,790
Because deep down, you want to.

505
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,290
Oh, so that's your plan?

506
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,800
To appeal to the inner Ed?

507
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,990
Well, you played the wrong hand, Doc.

508
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,560
Ed is gone,

509
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,860
and I will not be manipulated by you

510
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,170
the way that dope was.

511
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,370
I didn't manipulate him.

512
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,200
- I helped him.
- No.

513
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,100
No, you lied to him.

514
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,540
You promised to fix him,

515
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,640
and that pathetic dust mite
believed you,

516
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,050
causing me to be locked
inside of his feeble mind.

517
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,680
Okay, you have ten seconds left

518
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,050
to find your answer.

519
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,890
So prepare to lose.

520
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,250
But I know the answer now.

521
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,920
(chuckles)

522
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,590
You just gave it to me.

523
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,760
What are you talking about?

524
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,570
You're right. I told Ed
I would fix him, and I didn't.

525
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,570
I broke my promise.

526
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,600
And that, Riddler...

527
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,270
...is the answer.

528
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,640
A promise.

529
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,710
(crowd murmurs)

530
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,220
(crowd cheering)

531
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,060
Well played.

532
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,730
We're only halfway through.

533
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,700
And I assure you, you will not stump me.

534
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,140
<i>Boo. (laughs)</i>

535
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,150
You need to take us to your brother.

536
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,770
I can't do that.

537
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,210
What if he's nuttier than the other one?

538
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,690
I'm nothing like Jerome.

539
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,860
You want me to put you
in a cell next to his?

540
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,260
Because that is where this is heading.

541
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,880
And then what, Captain Gordon?

542
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,260
You couldn't hold him.

543
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,500
Arkham couldn't. I can.

544
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,930
And I will make sure
Jerome never escapes again.

545
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,340
No, no, no. Jerome comes with us.

546
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,380
And if you want to make
this easier on yourself,

547
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,490
I suggest you stay
the hell out of the way.

548
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,810
BULLOCK: Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

549
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,280
The loonies are outside.

550
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,180
No. No.

551
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,380
No, no, no, no.

552
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,990
- How'd they find me?
- GORDON: They must have followed Jerome.

553
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,860
We need to move, now.

554
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,890
(alarm buzzing)

555
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,860
This is not good.

556
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,260
Is there another way out of here?

557
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,260
Yes, but I'm not leaving Ecco.

558
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,330
The loonies will use her against us.

559
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,900
She's devoted her life to me.

560
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,540
We get you out first,
then we can come back for her.

561
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,070
- Deal?
- (alarm continues buzzing)

562
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,910
As a child, I was
obsessed with labyrinths,

563
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,640
so I designed my house like one.

564
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,270
You mean this place is a maze?

565
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,170
Easy enough to get in; I'm the
only one who knows the way out.

566
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,780
Stay close to me.

567
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,500
The maze is built on a hundred acres.

568
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,360
There are 73 dead ends.

569
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,310
I once invited the top
maze designers in the country

570
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,220
to try to solve it... one did.

571
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,450
It took him three days.

572
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,850
GORDON: And how much further?

573
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,150
Not far. We just passed
the final switchback point.

574
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
If I knew this thing was 100 acres,

575
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,970
I would have stopped and got
a sandwich before we came.

576
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,540
Ecco.

577
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,880
Oh, thank God you're okay.

578
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,880
Hey, hey, hey, she's hypnotized.

579
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,190
(all grunting)

580
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,670
Ecco, it's me.

581
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,170
It's me. Ow!

582
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,540
Gordon! Help!

583
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,240
Gordon!

584
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,410
She's a pistol.

585
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,710
Come on.

586
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,080
Ecco, please. Where are you taking me?

587
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,300
- I'm taking you to Jerome.
- No.

588
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,850
He'll do horrible things to me.

589
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,810
Ecco...

590
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,310
- Stop!
- (gun cocks)

591
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,840
Ow.

592
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,240
Let him go.

593
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,710
(gasps)

594
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,950
(gun drops)

595
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,370
Thanks. He went that way.

596
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,780
All right.

597
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,450
GORDON: Jeremiah.

598
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,350
Let's try this way.

599
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,290
(sighs)

600
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,230
JEROME: Hello, brother.

601
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,800
(gasps)

602
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,630
(gasps)

603
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,100
So, how ya been?

604
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,740
Oh, you look great! (laughing)

605
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,780
To think I used to be
the handsome one, right?

606
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,240
How'd you find your way
through the maze?

607
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,010
Oh, bro,

608
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,480
we might not look the same anymore,

609
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,460
but we still think the same.

610
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,920
Plus, you used to draw
those stupid things

611
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,320
all the time as a kid.

612
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,560
I paid attention.

613
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,260
Hey, uh, hat-head. Take Crane.

614
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,150
Find Jimbo and his bearded sidekick.

615
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,320
Kill them.

616
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,920
(chuckling)

617
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,720
I've been waiting for this
moment for 15 years.

618
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,920
Ever since you ran away
in the middle of the night,

619
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,460
like a coward.

620
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,130
- You're insane.
- Yeah.

621
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,310
And I tried telling Mom,

622
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,660
but she didn't want to listen to me.

623
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,399
You blame me for everything
that's gone wrong in your life.

624
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,440
But the truth is, Jerome,

625
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,310
is you were born bad.

626
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,360
Born bad, huh?

627
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,580
So that's why you made her think
that I tried to kill you.

628
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,320
- Right?
- Yeah, we both...

629
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,370
What was it again? What was it?

630
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,020
I put a blade to your throat.

631
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,370
No, no, no, no, no. I tried to...

632
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,760
- light you on fire.
- We both know you wanted to!

633
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,310
Yeah, that was a funny story, wasn't it?

634
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,780
Okay.

635
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,080
Maybe it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

636
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,580
but I didn't have a choice,
and I was right.

637
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,690
Hmm?

638
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,140
You killed our mother.

639
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,600
She did deserve it though.

640
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,100
(chuckles)

641
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,270
After that whore hid you away,

642
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,670
she gave up on me.

643
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,550
Poisoned by your stories.

644
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,250
You turned everyone
I ever loved against me.

645
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,140
My own flesh and blood!

646
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,780
Yeah, I guess it's like what they say.

647
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,950
We all could go insane
with just one bad day.

648
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,790
I guess with you,
it's more like one bad spray.

649
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,020
You'll see. (cackles)

650
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,160
Listen to what I have to say!

651
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,800
Oh, hell no! You are
not hypnotizing me again!

652
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,500
(shouting)

653
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,170
That's one way to do it.

654
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,210
Must go, must go, must go, must go!

655
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,680
(chuckles, exclaims)

656
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,850
What are you gonna do to me, Jerome?

657
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,020
Come on. I'm gonna kill you.

658
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,050
Of course.

659
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,380
But, first,

660
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,820
I'm gonna drive you mad.

661
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,430
But don't worry, you won't be alone.

662
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,530
All of Gotham will be joining you, too.

663
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,510
Must go! Must go! They're
after me and the Scarecrow.

664
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,070
These guys just don't give up, huh?

665
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,230
(Bullock yelling)

666
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,260
(gasps)

667
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,660
Get any closer and I splatter him.
I splatter bro-ski.

668
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,820
- (chuckling)
- GORDON: No, you won't.

669
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,010
If you wanted him dead, you
would have killed him already.

670
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,810
(chuckles) He's right.

671
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,950
- I'll see you soon. Mwah!
- (gasps)

672
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,050
(Jerome laughing)

673
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,100
(insects chirping)

674
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,230
Okay, Doc.

675
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,440
You've had enough time
to think of a riddle.

676
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,840
I hope you've come up with a good one.

677
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,740
I have.

678
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,410
Then ask away.

679
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,520
What three words are said too much...

680
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,680
meant by few, but wanted by all?

681
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,300
That's your riddle?

682
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,480
You're kidding. Right?

683
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,200
What's the answer?

684
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,090
Easy. "I love..." (clears throat)

685
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,720
The answer is, "I love..."

686
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,250
I love what, Ed?

687
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,470
- That's not my name.
- Then what's the answer?

688
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,790
You tricked me.

689
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,200
You're trying to awaken
a love that isn't there.

690
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,000
If it isn't there, then say the words.

691
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,370
WOMAN: Say it.

692
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,200
(crowd murmuring)

693
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,200
I won't say it.

694
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,980
(crowd booing)

695
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,810
- MAN: Come on.
- MAN 2: Say it.

696
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,780
MAN 3: Say it.

697
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,520
Time's up.

698
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,320
(crowd cheering)

699
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,400
ALL (chanting):
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc...

700
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,170
(chanting continues)

701
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
(siren wailing in distance)

702
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,100
Thank you.

703
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,760
What did I say?!

704
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,720
(Oswald choking)

705
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,470
I can help you get Tabitha back.

706
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,200
I know how to reverse your condition.

707
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,270
(gasps)

708
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,600
- Talk.
- This barrel

709
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,170
is from Slaughter Swamp.

710
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,210
It turned you into what you are.

711
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,340
Talk.

712
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,610
Professor Hugo Strange

713
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,780
is the one man who can cure you.

714
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,050
Join me, and we will find him.

715
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,250
(gasping, coughing)

716
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,790
I thought I was gonna
be stuck like this forever.

717
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,960
You don't have to be, friend.

718
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,210
Okay,

719
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,450
I'll join you.

720
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,980
But you better deliver.

721
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,580
I'm not your friend.

722
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,290
I can live with those terms.

723
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,720
Why did you open
your club in the Narrows?

724
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,230
You could have set up shop
anywhere in Gotham.

725
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,560
You wanted my attention.

726
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,330
I came back here
because the people love me.

727
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,600
People didn't come here
because they love you, Ed.

728
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,960
They came for the money.

729
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
But I can give them what they want.

730
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,230
I just need your help.

731
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,740
Why would I help you?

732
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,640
(chuckles)

733
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,010
Because I know what you really want.

734
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,580
You love me.

735
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,320
You've loved me all along.

736
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,590
You're wrong.

737
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,920
That was Ed.

738
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,760
Okay.

739
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,650
So do it.

740
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,300
Kill me.

741
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
(gasps)

742
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,510
What's your record for how many banks

743
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,850
you've robbed in one day?

744
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,250
Three. Why?

745
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,850
I think you can do better.

746
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,290
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

747
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,620
I know.

748

- It's okay.

753
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:45,080
This is Jeremiah Valeska,
Jerome's twin brother.

754

We need to put him into

Hell of a day.

What are you thinking?

760
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,000
Jerome told his brother
his plan was to turn Gotham mad.

761
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,930
How the hell is he
gonna do that, Harvey?

762

I don't know.

00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,470
I thought it already was.

Ugh. Little large

771
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,270
for a test subject, don't you think?

772

He is not your test subject.

This is Grundy.

774

He will make a welcome
addition to the team.

I like him.

He's scary. Good thinking, Mr. Oswald.
