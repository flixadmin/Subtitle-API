1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,286
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,794
What's going on?
At the spot from yesterday…

5
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,379
KANGHEE JUNCTION

6
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,630
What we saw just now…

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,050
I don't understand.

8
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,597
For goodness' sake.

9
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,069
007 TOWING

10
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,696
You can just go.
We'll call our insurance agency.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,240
It's dangerous,
so I'll move your car to a safe area.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,617
- So--
- Sure.

13
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,746
MIN SOHEE
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE

14
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,372
What? Are they cops?

15
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,083
Gosh, I got unlucky.

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,086
- For goodness' sake.
- We can't tow a police car.

17
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,462
You can get going now.

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
Let's go.

19
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,386
Is this the insurance company?

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,347
There has been an accident.

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,682
Yes, at Kanghee Junction.

22
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,853
Yes. That's right.

23
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,834
CRASH

24
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,711
- <i>What is that?</i>
- What is that?

25
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,547
I can't sleep
after watching stuff like this.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,631
EPISODE THREE

27
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,135
What's more ridiculous is that it's where
a drunk driver crashed his car yesterday.

28
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,346
He also said he saw a ghost in white.

29
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,933
- Exactly.
- The wheel turned on its own.

30
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,434
Maybe it really is a ghost.

31
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,853
And you call yourself a detective?

32
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,563
- Watch it again.
- Darn it!

33
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,607
- See if it's a ghost.
- Come on. Cut it out!

34
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,864
In two months, there have been
four reports to the police.

35
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,700
Including the reports
to insurance companies, 13 in total.

36
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,285
Among them, two resulted in death.

37
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,121
The number of accidents
began increasing last November.

38
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,832
Accidents keep occurring at the same spot.

39
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,876
We'll need to look into the cause

40
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,836
in order to prevent further accidents.

41
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,549
Okay. Let's meet up with the victims
and secure the dashcam videos.

42
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,010
- Yes, sir.
- And question people in the area

43
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,137
and see if anyone else has seen a ghost.

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,264
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,600
What is it? You have something to say?

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,268
No. You said everything.

47
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,353
Let's move.

48
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,899
But we aren't in
the Marine Corps.

49
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,358
How can we catch a ghost?

50
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,321
It seems like
an accident occurs every week.

51
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,658
And the darn tow trucks
are so loud and noisy.

52
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,660
I can't sleep at night.

53
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,122
The accidents were so frequent

54
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,333
- that I wrote them down. Take a look.
- Okay.

55
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,793
- For goodness' sake.
- Here.

56
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,003
- Come.
- Okay.

57
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,882
The realtor right over there
has lived here all his life.

58
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:41,721
According to him,
this place used to be a cemetery.

59
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,806
When the apartment was being built…

60
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,977
…no one claimed the unidentified graves.

61
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,813
So they just bulldozed everything
and built an apartment.

62
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,276
That was when it started.
Unable to leave, ghosts haunt this place.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,613
They continue to harass people.

64
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,989
My gosh. No way.

65
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,034
You never know.

66
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,663
Why else would accidents keep occurring
at the exact same place?

67
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,998
It's like something
out of the twilight zone.

68
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,377
Have you heard of someone

69
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,046
who walks around
in white mourning clothes?

70
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,172
White mourning clothes?

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,716
I don't know.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,804
There are several shaman houses
down the mountain.

73
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,599
Why? Is someone walking around in them?

74
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,356
Is this what you saw that day?

75
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,692
Yes, it is.

76
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,445
I told you I saw a ghost that day.
You didn't believe me!

77
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,324
It was hard to believe a drunk driver
who couldn't even stand straight.

78
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536
Do you have a dashcam?

79
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,750
So what is this thing that got filmed?

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,085
We're investigating.

81
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:59,340
Did you turn the wheel
because you were startled?

82
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,425
No.

83
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,722
The car spun on its own.

84
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,891
I'm serious.

85
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,581
It's a place with many problems.

86
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,791
You're right.

87
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
Yes?

88
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,345
Where?

89
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,304
WISH FULFILLMENT

90
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,319
She isn't a shaman.

91
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,741
- Then who would wear such clothes--
- Are you asking me?

92
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,162
I apologize.

93
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,624
Shall I look into it?

94
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,089
- Play the video again.
- Sure.

95
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,006
I don't see the soul.

96
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,386
My grandpa says that it's a ghost.

97
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,018
Excuse me.

98
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,022
You shouldn't do that
when the spirit is speaking.

99
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,191
It brings bad energy.

100
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,737
I'll wait outside.

101
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,907
Wait for me.

102
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,829
Dark clouds loom over that man.

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,585
- What do you mean by dark clouds?
- Be careful.

104
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,753
If you stay by his side,
you'll get struck by lightning.

105
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,091
She said lightning.

106
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,469
Shouldn't you get a talisman?

107
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,595
Don't be absurd.

108
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,227
How much is a talisman? I'm just curious.

109
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,691
Hey. Did you meet the drunk driver?

110
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,944
Yes. We showed him the footage
and he confirmed that was what he saw.

111
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,363
He claimed that the car shook on its own.

112
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,865
It's exactly what Donggi said.

113
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,288
We should check
the condition of the road more thoroughly.

114
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,083
They made the road narrower
when the apartment was built,

115
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,877
making the turning angle quite sharp.

116
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,756
- Let's request KoROAD to do a checkup.
- Okay.

117
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,510
And this is
from the drunk driver's dashcam.

118
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,307
For goodness' sake.

119
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,776
Aren't you going to watch it?

120
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,445
I'm good.

121
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,538
<i>What's happening?</i>

122
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,208
It's the ghost we saw.

123
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,417
It's the person

124
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,713
- we saw.
- The shaman said that it was a ghost.

125
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,840
No way. A ghost won't get caught
on camera.

126
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,344
I'm glad you brought it up.
Then who is this woman in white?

127
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,139
We visited all the shamans
in the neighborhood. She isn't a shaman.

128
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,143
We checked with the funeral houses too,
but they don't use white mourning clothes.

129
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,770
It really doesn't make any sense.

130
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,189
Lieutenant,

131
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,150
do you also want to claim
that it's a ghost?

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,157
I'm not claiming anything.
I simply think that it's very mysterious.

133
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,620
I don't care if it's a ghost or not.
Let's figure out the cause.

134
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,666
If someone caused these accidents
on purpose, it's a serious crime.

135
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,419
Two innocent people have died already.

136
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,438
ROAD ANALYSIS RESULTS

137
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,149
Why didn't you join him?

138
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,650
Didn't you hear the shaman?

139
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,153
I'll get struck by lightning
if I stay by his side.

140
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,923
Get rid of the chief's parking area?

141
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,386
Who proposed it?

142
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,099
It'll be discussed next week
at the Civil Servants' Union meeting.

143
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,435
Cha Yeonho proposed it.

144
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,983
He is too much.

145
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,568
What a total moron.

146
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,158
Let's get rid of it.

147
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,952
The National Police Agency wants
to eradicate

148
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,663
the hierarchical parking lot culture.

149
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,041
If the matter comes to you
after the Civil Servants' Union meeting,

150
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,211
it'll look like you were pushed
into getting rid of it.

151
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,504
So…

152
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,633
- …you want me to beat them to it?
- What matters is how it looks.

153
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,136
While that's true-- Geez.

154
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,806
What will I do every morning
without my parking spot?

155
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,392
- It'll be inconvenient.
- Look at the bigger picture.

156
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,144
You can't stay
at Namgang Police Station forever.

157
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,400
Get going.

158
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,535
Gosh, this punk is fearless.

159
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,539
For goodness' sake.

160
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,665
IF YOU SET OUT TO DIE,
YOU'LL LIVE

161
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,749
IF YOU SET OUT TO LIVE,
YOU'LL DIE

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,920
If you look at the horizontal alignment,
the curvature is 2.12.

164
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,090
The small radius of curvature
increases the risk of accidents.

165
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,302
The longitudinal slope is less than 2%,
so there isn't much gradient.

166
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,055
But the problem is the superelevation.

167
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,766
As you can see, it's 0.08 to 1.12%.

168
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,853
There isn't much longitudinal slope
or superelevation.

169
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,939
That's what caused the accidents.

170
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,359
I didn't understand a thing.

171
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,613
Uh, so simply put,

172
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,866
the road is very flat.

173
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,955
Why did you make it so complicated?

174
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:32,418
Since the road is too level,
water can't get out.

175
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,713
If water can't get out,
it results in reduced friction.

176
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,923
It'll be slippery when it rains.

177
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,092
The wheels will move on their own.

178
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,720
So, that's what happened with the cars.

179
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,431
Hold on. You have the photo, right?

180
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,558
- The one of the marked calendar.
- Yes.

181
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,976
Hold on.

182
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,519
A calendar?

183
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,523
Yes. We questioned people nearby
and met a fruit vendor near the junction

184
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,817
who had marked the dates of the accidents.

185
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,282
All right. Look here.

186
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,493
Most of the accidents occurred
on rainy days.

187
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,455
Some of them occurred on sunny days.

188
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,540
I said "most."

189
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,167
So the cause of the accidents

190
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,629
wasn't a ghost,
but a structural problem of the road.

191
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:21,091
But isn't the accident rate
exceptionally high at Kanghee Junction?

192
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,303
It almost makes me wonder
why no one looked into it.

193
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,223
They probably blamed it on the ghost.

194
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,517
That's what the culprit used.

195
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,686
Someone used the rumor of the ghost
to cause the accidents?

196
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,772
Yes.

197
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,735
Let's wrap it up for today
and resume the investigation tomorrow.

198
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,978
No! My goodness!

200
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,104
Gosh.

201
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,442
You startled me.

202
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,570
Why would you
shine the light on your face?

203
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:26,282
Oh. I thought you'd be scared
if you didn't recognize me.

204
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,909
You startled me.

205
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,249
What were you doing there?
Waiting for the ghost?

206
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,586
Yes. No matter what it is,
it may be the cause of the accidents.

207
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,421
So we need to figure out what it is.

208
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,508
I see. I felt uncomfortable too.

209
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,637
Did you find anything?

210
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,639
The trees around the junction.

211
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,144
Only the trees around Kanghee Junction
were withering with yellow leaves.

212
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,982
Other sections were fine,
but just the area of the accidents.

213
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,151
Why-- Why was that?

214
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,904
Were they damaged
by blight and harmful insects?

215
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,655
Who knows?

216
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,574
Perhaps a ghost did it.

217
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,369
Come on! You said
there were no ghosts!

218
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,957
Gosh.

219
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,834
What? A bicycle?

220
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,961
Did you ride your bicycle in the rain?

221
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,297
Yes.

222
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,511
Your car is very classic.

223
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:34,224
Well, yes. It's quite old.

224
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,728
I feel the most comfortable in this car.

225
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,357
Perhaps it's because it was
the first taxi my father drove.

226
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,573
By the way, are you doing okay
after the conflict with the chief?

227
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,659
I'm doing okay.

228
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,166
Are you really going to talk to him
about the parking spot?

229
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,799
You're probably unaware of this yet,

230
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:11,220
but our team doesn't have
the greatest relationship with Chief.

231
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,013
The chief's son--

232
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,391
I already submitted it
to the Civil Servants' Union.

233
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,983
I see. Gosh.

234
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,196
My goodness. It's pouring outside.

235
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,074
It's the perfect weather
to walk around in white.

236
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,752
You should go home now. It's getting late.

237
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,671
What time is it?

238
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,551
All right.

239
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,970
I guess the ghost won't come today.

240
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,515
What? That's…

241
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,205
Darn it.

242
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,419
Stop right there!

243
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,151
- I'll go this way.
- Hold on.

244
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,235
That way.

245
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,658
It was this house.

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,247
This is…

247
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,381
- Over there.
- Okay.

248
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,267
Take that path. I'll take this one.

249
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,852
But…

250
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,011
Lieutenant.

251
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,056
Lieutenant, are you there?

252
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,873
Scoot over a bit.

253
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,755
What is going on?

254
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,759
For goodness' sake.
What's your problem?

255
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,611
Let's go.

256
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,126
Lieutenant.

257
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,544
Over there.

258
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,089
NAMGANG NURSING HOME

259
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,678
Mourning clothes?

260
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,933
Yes. I was wondering if anyone here
walked around in mourning clothes.

261
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,352
Why do you ask?

262
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,561
Is there?

263
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,360
There was an old lady named Kang Okgeum.

264
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,529
She believed her husband
who passed away would come for her,

265
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,865
so she'd always wear mourning clothes
and sneak out.

266
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,826
She even got into an accident once.

267
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,954
I see. An old lady.

268
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,749
She snuck out today too. You should check.

269
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,586
That's impossible.

270
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,088
That old lady

271
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,632
passed away last year.

272
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,115
What's this?

273
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,494
It's a report of the first accident
involving a ghost at Kanghee Junction.

274
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,290
The person who was mistaken
as a ghost by the driver was…

275
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,541
Kang Okgeum.

276
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,713
The first accident
was caused by a person, not a ghost.

277
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,174
Hold on. But she passed away last year.

278
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,176
Then the subsequent accidents…

279
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,888
They were probably caused by someone
who wanted to look like a ghost.

280
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,853
And this is information on the driver
from the first accident.

281
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,188
What? He looks familiar.

282
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,109
007 TOWING

283
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,112
It's dangerous,
so I'll move your car to a safe area.

284
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,448
He's the tow vehicle driver.

285
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,200
So the victim of a car accident

286
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,995
is running a towing service
in the same neighborhood

287
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,831
and the same accidents keep occurring.

288
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,876
Isn't it strange?

289
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,630
Something definitely doesn't seem right.

290
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,218
One towing service
practically monopolizes

291
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,095
the accidents that occur in the area.

292
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,680
It's 007 Towing.

293
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,809
The CEO, Choi Bumgu,
seems to be related to the ghost fiasco.

294
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,812
He does gain profits from the accidents.
What's your basis?

295
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,148
The driver who mistook
Kang Okgeum for a ghost

296
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,108
and caused the first accident
was Choi Bumgu.

297
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,111
You think he designed the accidents
based on his experience?

298
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,238
I have no evidence. Just a hunch.

299
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,199
He used to work on his own.

300
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,284
Last October, right after the accident,

301
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,244
he changed the business name
to 007 Towing.

302
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,539
What? The number of accidents there
went up starting last November.

303
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,125
I studied Choi Bumgu's insurance records.

304
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,296
This April, he hit a tow truck driver
from a rival business with his car.

305
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,340
It was processed as a minor car accident,

306
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,510
but there's a high chance
of it being intentional.

307
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,053
To take over the area,

308
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:12,516
he assaulted the tow truck drivers
and even the insurance agents.

309
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,892
But here's the problem.

310
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,685
No one pressed charges.

311
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,522
- Why not?
- I guess they feared retaliation.

312
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,440
People are scarier than ghosts.

313
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,859
The scale is too big
to be about the tow service.

314
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,862
Meet the victims
of the previous accidents.

315
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,948
Let's figure out what happened first.

316
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,032
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,410
All right.

318
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,338
Have you eaten?

319
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,340
I told you not to swear at me.

320
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,800
I asked you if you've eaten.

321
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,677
STOCK HOLDINGS

322
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,763
Hey, you should eat Mapo tofu.

323
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,391
- Why?
- You went to the police station recently.

324
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,352
So you want me to eat tofu.

325
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,020
You aren't a gangster, okay?

326
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,023
Stop beating people up.
Make them do the dirty work.

327
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,900
I take after my father.

328
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,736
There's a fire inside of me.

329
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,823
- Then drink cold water to put it out.
- Okay.

330
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,991
STOCK LOSS -17,779,880 WON

331
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,162
Anyway, why is there
so little work these days?

332
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,331
Mr. Shin, don't you work these days?

333
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,460
Give me some time.
I'm trying to read the room.

334
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,212
Please make more effort, okay?

335
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,798
I want to feed my boys some meat.

336
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,677
I don't know about you,
but things are quite tiring for us.

337
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,683
If we're a little bit harsh,
we get complaints.

338
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,143
Recently, the insurance company--

339
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,228
Damn it.

340
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,481
I told you to wait.

341
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,567
We're eating.

342
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,907
It isn't just you.

343
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,202
- Look at us. Everyone has it hard.
- Seunghak.

344
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,957
Things are really tough for me too.
I need to recruit actors and pay them.

345
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,250
Seriously.

346
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,671
Here. Let's hang in a bit longer, okay?

347
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,550
Aren't we fellow countrymen?

348
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,512
We should persevere together,
don't you think?

349
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,433
All right. Cheers.

350
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,352
Cheers.

351
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,978
What's going on?

352
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,356
What? What's going on?

353
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,317
Are they tearing down
the chief's parking spot?

354
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,610
- Hey.
- Hello.

355
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,282
Are you guys going someplace nice
without me?

356
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,951
I'm glad you're here.

357
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,161
Chief, why is your parking spot…

358
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,414
Oh, after my incident with Inspector Cha--

359
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:46,836
After the accident with Cha Yeonho,
I was lost in thought.

360
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,131
It occurred to me
that this was all hierarchical.

361
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,301
I was uncertain
about having a tent set up here.

362
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,597
I thought we didn't have
enough accessible parking space.

363
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,351
Once we get rid of this, we'll have enough
accessible parking space.

364
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,562
Chief Gu, you're amazing.

365
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,773
The police reform
doesn't have to be grand.

366
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,857
That's right.

367
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,443
We should begin
by making changes around us.

368
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,405
You had planned it all along, right?

369
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,117
What's important is taking action.

370
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,536
- Setting an example.
- That's right.

371
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,789
Cha Yeonho. Don't you agree?

372
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,209
- Yes, sir.
- What a load of crap.

373
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,879
In the evening,
I'll visit the headquarters.

374
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,219
I see. You must see him at home every day.

375
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,887
Maybe not. Do you live alone?

376
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,016
Yes, I live alone.

377
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,559
My goodness.

378
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,478
It's cool to see
a young man live independently already.

379
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,939
How amazing.
I know it's hard to live alone.

380
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:53,069
I've lived in a boardinghouse so I know.
You're so cool. Indeed.

381
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,197
There should be more young men like him.

382
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,534
We should strive to have such a mind-set.
It's very nice.

383
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,910
Please go ahead.

384
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,457
- Hey, what could it be?
- What?

385
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,170
Chief Gu has been sucking up to Cha Yeonho
since the last team dinner.

386
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,215
And it's strange that he suddenly got rid
of his private parking space.

387
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,759
It was Cha Yeonho's idea.

388
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,511
Didn't you hear him talk
about going to the headquarters?

389
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,596
What about it?

390
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,890
How frustrating. Hey.

391
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:26,728
Why did he tell Cha Yeonho
about his visit to the headquarters?

392
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,812
It's strange.

393
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,858
Perhaps Inspector Cha knows someone
in the headquarters.

394
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,070
His last name is Cha.

395
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,906
- Maybe it's Commissioner Cha Gyumin.
- Seriously?

396
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,077
Hey. How do you know all that?

397
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,622
Well, I heard it through the grapevine.

398
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,874
You didn't know that? You should.

399
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,542
- Really?
- My goodness.

400
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:55,131
GUIDELINES TO ENHANCE EQUALITY
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE

401
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,472
His rank isn't high enough
to join a meeting like this.

402
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,142
Why does he keep showing up?
You have to be a superintendent at least.

403
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,853
- Don't mind him.
- That's right.

404
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,274
Commissioner Cha.

405
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,943
My goodness, Chief Gu.

406
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,196
Thank you for making the time to attend.

407
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,866
Well, it's a system
the police must implement.

408
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,785
Moreover, I wanted to participate

409
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,996
in the project you were leading, sir.

410
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,166
We'll have a trial operation for a while.

411
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,544
Operate it well
at Namgang Police Station too.

412
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,963
- Yes, of course. Loyalty.
- Good.

413
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,967
Commissioner Cha, you know…

414
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,430
- I'm a bit disappointed in you.
- Why?

415
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,600
If you were going to send
your son to Namgang Police Station,

416
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,563
you could've given me a heads up.

417
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,939
My son?

418
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,484
We know already.

419
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,696
We know that your son is…
…at Namgang Police Station.

420
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,365
My son is?

421
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,076
Yes. Inspector Cha Yeonho.

422
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,036
He's in the TCI team.

423
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,748
- Hey.
- Traffic Crime Investigation…

424
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,874
Come here.

425
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,297
This is Chief Gu Kyungmo
of Namgang Police Station.

426
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,258
He recently graduated
in police administration

427
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,968
and joined the Foreign Affairs Bureau.

428
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,012
He's Cha Hyeonho, my son.

429
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,140
I see. He's your son.

430
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,349
- Yes.
- Your son…

431
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,479
It's nice to meet you. I'm Cha Hyeonho.

432
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,481
Your son is quite tall.

433
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:38,109
Gosh, his skin is perfect.

434
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,027
CHA HYEONHO

435
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,696
Oh, it's Cha Hyeonho.

436
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,324
Is it Hyeonho, not Yeonho?

437
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,202
Do you use the Chinese character
for "Pot handle" for "Hyeon"?

438
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,788
I was planning
to introduce him to everyone.

439
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,373
This is great.
Let's say hello to everyone. Come.

440
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,833
This is my son.

441
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,338
What's this?

442
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,424
His name is Cha Hyeonho, not Yeonho.
For goodness' sake.

443
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,842
I can't believe you!

444
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,679
How did this happen?

445
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,519
Cha Yeonho. Cha Hyeonho. Cha--

446
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,314
This isn't a matter of spelling.
One syllable is completely different.

447
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:20,610
It isn't an alternate spelling
of a name with the same pronunciation.

448
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,403
How could you make such a mistake?

449
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,447
Seriously. My goodness.

450
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,658
I was too careless, Kyungmo.

451
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:31,496
I should've checked more thoroughly.
For goodness' sake.

452
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,039
"Kyungmo"?

453
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,417
"Kyungmo"? Hey, Jaedeok.

454
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,127
Superintendent Go.

455
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,173
I bet you didn't study this carelessly
when you prepared for the bar exam.

456
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,133
You must've studied thoroughly.

457
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,052
How could you fail to fact-check?

458
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,804
I have no excuse, Chief.

459
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,557
Of course, you don't.
You'd be less than human if you do.

460
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,601
How will I park my car every morning?

461
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,814
I totally wasted my energy.

462
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,450
Goodness, it's been a while.
I didn't expect to see you here.

463
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,496
I heard about your transfer to HQ.

464
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,166
How's work? What was the name of the team?

465
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,127
TCI, Traffic Crime Investigation Team.

466
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,962
That's right.

467
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,257
There are many traffic-related problems
and accidents these days.

468
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,844
Let's grab a drink sometime.

469
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,430
We worked together in Daejeon, after all.

470
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,849
- I don't know why we were so distant.
- Right.

471
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,227
- When you have time, drop by my office.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,772
I need to see the commissioner now.
All right. Take care.

473
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,203
I know why you're here.

474
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,456
Don't even get me started.

475
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,792
When I think about it,
I wake up in the middle of the night.

476
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,545
Did the towing service overcharge you?

477
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,297
That's not the problem.

478
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,259
They said they'd let me rent a car
for free while mine got repaired.

479
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,678
It sounded like a good deal,
so I accepted.

480
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,312
- Hello.
- It has been a while.

481
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,397
Come here for a second.

482
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,066
Look at this.

483
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,776
- What?
- Here.

484
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,195
If you have eyes, take a look.

485
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,364
I didn't do it.

486
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,616
- It was already…
- That's nonsense.

487
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,242
- It was already here, my foot.
- You…

488
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,704
<i>They claimed that I damaged the car
and made me pay a hefty repair cost.</i>

489
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,421
I had to pay for the repair fees
of the rented car and my car.

490
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,173
It drove me up the wall.

491
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,259
I think the auto shop is in on the scam.

492
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,887
The insurance company was shocked
to see the repair costs.

493
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,100
- Please come to the station and…
- No.

494
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,102
I struggled for months because of it.

495
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,688
They came to my house and made a scene.

496
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,939
Geez, forget it.

497
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,566
I'll just think that I donated
three million won.

498
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,653
Please put those jerks behind bars.

499
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,405
Goodbye then.

500
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,160
You need to press charges
for us to do that.

501
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,707
Lee Seunghak, age 53.
He's the owner of New Vision Auto Shop.

502
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,585
<i>All the cars that are towed
by 007 Towing are sent here.</i>

503
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,254
Gosh, Mr. Lee.

504
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,756
007 TOWING TOW TRUCK DRIVER
CHOI BUMGU

505
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,426
It's good to see you. Have you eaten?

506
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,011
NEW VISION AUTO SHOP OWNER
LEE SEUNGHAK

507
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,304
<i>There's a business that provides services.</i>

508
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,098
<i>It's Mammoth Car Rental.</i>

509
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,182
MAMMOTH CAR RENTAL OWNER
SHIN JUNGGEUN

510
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,476
<i>The owner is Shin Junggeun. Age, 45.</i>

511
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,396
<i>He's had nine convictions
for violence, fraud, extortion, etc.</i>

512
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,397
Have you eaten?

513
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,276
<i>He opened a car rental agency last August
and began to take over the area.</i>

514
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,487
<i>The office of 007 Towing
is under Shin Junggeun's name too.</i>

515
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,114
- Work hard.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,908
He's the one who operates 007 Towing
from behind.

517
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,704
Look at his face.
He must be the leader of the cartel.

518
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,832
The towing fee and repair costs
of both cars.

519
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,834
So many are living off of this ghost.

520
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:08,796
The amount of money victims paid ranged
from two to ten million won.

521
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,049
They're such thugs.

522
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,801
But we can't get a warrant
unless a victim presses charges.

523
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,138
We'll need a warrant to go over records
and confiscate their ledgers.

524
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,267
The problem is that no one
wants to press charges.

525
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,061
How will we investigate this case?

526
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,148
What if we become the victims?

527
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,454
How do you guys always eat
jjajangmyeon and pizza?

528
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,747
Eat some other food too.

529
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,208
Why do you always come when we're eating?

530
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,668
Go ahead and eat. We'll wait.

531
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,212
Don't be absurd. We're busy.

532
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,881
We can't eat when the police
are in front of us.

533
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,716
Well? What is it this time?

534
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,053
I'm not here as a police officer today.
I'm here as a customer.

535
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,765
My goodness.

536
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,602
These cars are excellent
in terms of cost-effectiveness.

537
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,272
Since you saved my life,
I'll give you a special deal.

538
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,025
That's right. You survived
thanks to Inspector Cha.

539
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,362
I consider this my second life
and I'm living diligently.

540
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:19,242
Then think of this as returning the favor
and give us the cheapest car here.

541
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,993
Those are about to be scrapped.

542
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,122
- Sounds perfect. Where is it?
- All right.

543
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,040
Let's go.

544
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,596
What are you doing?

545
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,394
Will you really be okay?

546
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,691
Because of the road,
you might get into a big accident.

547
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,442
That's why I must do it.

548
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:57,155
Plus, they'll look down
on a female driver.

549
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,658
Choi Bumgu has already seen your face.

550
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,245
Right. What do we do?

551
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,123
I'm sorry.

552
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,835
- You punk, drive properly!
- I'm sorry.

553
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,757
TRAFFIC CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM

554
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,219
- Does this car even go?
- Yes. I drove it here.

555
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,263
- You didn't buy it, did you?
- I did.

556
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,808
Otherwise, people will complain later.

557
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,811
What a waste of money.
Who pays for such a car?

558
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,897
We just need to set the date now.

559
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,568
It needs to rain for us to hunt the ghost,
but it hasn't rained in a week.

560
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,824
- Come here.
- Okay.

561
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,412
What are you doing?

562
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,707
If you desperately wish for something,
it'll come true.

563
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,292
- Pray desperately.
<i>- Namo Amitabha</i>.

564
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,293
Hallelujah.

565
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,420
Let's think of another way.

566
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,634
Do you remember the drunk driving accident
at Kanghee Junction?

567
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,012
Only that road was wet.

568
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,892
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>

569
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,269
It didn't rain that day.

570
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,940
Among the days the accidents occurred,
how many days were clear?

571
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,151
Oh, I'll send you the dates I checked.

572
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,615
I sent it.

573
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,575
SERGEANT WOO DONGGI

574
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,835
I'll be back.

575
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,212
Where are you going?

576
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,924
I'll tell you when I get back.

577
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,177
All right.

578
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,266
My goodness.

579
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,935
That man never talks first.

580
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,728
He's more comfortable being alone.

581
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,401
NAMGANG DISTRICT OFFICE

582
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,656
- Here you go.
- Okay.

583
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,493
Why did you want to see
the schedule for a sprinkler truck?

584
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,081
Would it be possible to meet someone
who worked on this day?

585
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,583
Kanghee Junction? I go there too.

586
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,544
Why do you want to know?

587
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,006
When you were there,
did you notice anything strange?

588
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,049
I'm not sure.

589
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,011
It can be anything.

590
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,934
Well, I don't know if it's strange or not.

591
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,602
But something did stick out.

592
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,288
Watch.

593
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,210
Do you see this truck?

594
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,506
It's always parked there
just before I reach Kanghee Junction.

595
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,218
The license plate number tells me
that it's a rented vehicle.

596
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,511
A rented vehicle?

597
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,097
Yes. It's rare to rent a truck.

598
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,357
What?

599
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,692
My goodness.

600
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,371
<i>If you desperately wish</i>
<i>for something, it'll come true.</i>

601
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,332
Why is it raining all of a sudden?
Did you bring an umbrella?

602
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,251
No. I didn't expect it to rain.

603
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,880
Then why are you smiling?
You'll get soaked.

604
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,803
I know, right?

605
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,808
SANDBOX

606
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,394
What do I do?

607
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,146
Drive off.

608
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,939
We got here first, so drive off.

609
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,691
Hey, drive off.

610
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,361
My goodness!

611
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,696
Are you okay?

612
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,658
Mister, have you seen a ghost?

613
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
I guess you dozed off.

614
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,413
I didn't. I'm certain it was right there.

615
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,373
You really haven't seen it?

616
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,793
You must be in shock.
Stay there. I'll move the car.

617
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,754
I told you to drive off! Darn it.

618
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,176
Get out of the way.

619
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,195
Allow me to take a nice photo.

620
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,160
It won't be easy to repair the car.

621
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,705
Because it's very old,

622
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,749
it'll be difficult to find the parts.

623
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,792
It'll be hard, right?

624
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,795
Don't worry. We'll repair everything.

625
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,257
- I'm just going to have it scrapped.
- Okay.

626
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,428
- Pardon?
- I'll have it scrapped.

627
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,473
Please hold on.

628
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,566
For goodness' sake.

629
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,820
Why did you accept the car
without checking?

630
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,823
This has never happened before.

631
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,451
We already paid 007 Towing their fee.

632
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,079
Hey, we're in the negative now.

633
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,455
What should we do?

634
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,707
Must you ask? Geez.

635
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,627
It looks like a regular auto shop.

636
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,630
You startled me.

637
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,299
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

638
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,718
I heard that you wanted your car scrapped.

639
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,054
Yes.

640
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,767
These days, you have to wait a year
to get a new car.

641
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,894
Why don't you have it repaired?

642
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,689
We'll cut the repair cost in half.

643
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,944
No. I'm too scared to ride that car now.

644
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,405
Scared? Why?

645
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,616
I know that it may sound strange,

646
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,703
but I see a ghost
whenever I drive that car.

647
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,999
I see it sometimes too.

648
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,418
There's one here.
I see one over there sometimes.

649
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,671
It isn't like that. I'm talking about
the Kanghee Junction Ghost.

650
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,383
It isn't a ghost.

651
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,343
Ghosts don't exist.

652
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,345
What is it then?

653
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,057
I don't know.

654
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,436
Whatever. Anyway,
I'll have the car scrapped.

655
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,104
Please find me a car rental agency.

656
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,772
A car rental agency?

657
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:34,278
Yes. I care a lot about comfort.
Would it be okay if I pick the car myself?

658
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,071
Sure.

659
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,199
I'll show you there. Please follow me.

660
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,659
Okay.

661
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,459
MAMMOTH CAR RENTAL

662
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,344
How many times did I tell you?
Do you still not trust me?

663
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,349
For goodness' sake.

664
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,477
Give us the rental fee.

665
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,606
What did you say just now?

666
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,110
We won't make any money
since she wants the car scrapped.

667
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,113
She'll pay for the car rental,
so give us the fee.

668
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,614
We need to make a living too.

669
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,827
That's just absurd.

670
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,870
Darn it.

671
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,416
Why would we pay you
when we're renting out our car?

672
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,583
Don't you understand?

673
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,211
Seunghak.

674
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,590
Some days are good,
while other days are bad.

675
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,263
You should go home now.
I'll treat you to a tasty meal later.

676
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:26,765
I'll get going.

677
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:30,811
Damn it.

678
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,981
Does that jerk take me for a beggar?

679
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,108
Damn it.

680
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,208
Calcium chloride.

681
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,669
Why is it here?

682
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,551
Who are you? Darn it.

683
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,641
I'm here to rent a car.

684
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,105
You're here to rent a car?

685
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,442
- Which car does he want to rent?
- Seriously.

686
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,237
This isn't a place you come to rent a car.

687
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,536
Honey?

688
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,751
I told you that I could come alone.
You must've been worried.

689
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,294
You love me so much.

690
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,922
That's why you follow me
everywhere, right?

691
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,882
He's my husband.

692
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,219
She's the customer I brought.

693
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,388
Shall we go?

694
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,557
I can't believe you.

695
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,645
It's hot, so please be careful.

696
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,106
We're in charge of towing, repair,
and car rental.

697
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,608
It's a one-stop service.

698
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,237
If you look here, there's a spot
for your address and phone number.

699
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,488
Here you go.

700
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,031
Okay.

701
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,507
Gosh.

702
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,468
My goodness.

703
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,847
I took over 30 photos of the car
so they wouldn't try to pull anything.

704
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,099
What were you doing there?

705
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,142
You almost got caught.

706
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:39,314
I figured out why the road was wet
on a clear day.

707
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,275
- What?
- It was the sprinkler truck.

708
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
Oh, the sprinkler truck.

709
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,363
The sprinkler truck driver said

710
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:50,242
that a rented truck
was always parked nearby.

711
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
I see. So you were there
to find the truck.

712
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,663
Yes. Here.

713
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,166
I see. Why was this truck there?

714
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,669
I don't know.

715
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,547
There's something else that's strange.

716
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,134
All the employees had
burn marks on their arms.

717
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:11,388
Didn't you see the burn marks on the arms
of the rental car agency employees?

718
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,348
<i>Burn marks.</i>

719
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,606
Calcium chloride.

720
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,818
I think I know what happened.

721
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,991
NAMGANG-GU

722
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,086
<i>The truck the sprinkler truck driver saw.</i>

723
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,715
<i>They're using it
to sprinkle calcium chloride.</i>

724
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,177
<i>When you sprinkle calcium chloride
on a wet road,</i>

725
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,597
<i>it soaks up moisture
and keeps the road wet for a long time.</i>

726
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,976
<i>That was why the road was wet</i>
<i>during the drunk driving accident.</i>

727
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,728
<i>It was because of calcium chloride.</i>

728
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:03,899
<i>Only the plants in the area withered
because of the sodium in calcium chloride.</i>

729
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,610
<i>When calcium chloride touches the skin,</i>

730
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,405
<i>it soaks up moisture and leaves wounds
that look like burn marks.</i>

731
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,199
<i>So they made a ghost to</i>…

732
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,954
<i>To give a mysterious explanation</i>
<i>for a car slipping on calcium chloride.</i>

733
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,373
They didn't want people to suspect them.

734
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,168
Okay. Let's go.

735
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,491
Hey.

736
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,702
Where are you going? Come here.

737
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,246
Where are you going, you punk?

738
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,664
Where are you going?

739
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,458
Get up. Get up now.

740
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,171
Don't act up.

741
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,132
- Donggi.
- Yes?

742
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,093
- Did you get everything?
- Yes, I filmed every single thing.

743
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,971
- Bring handcuffs.
- Lieutenant, what a drift.

744
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,556
- Be quiet and bring them.
- Okay.

745
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,726
- <i>My goodness.</i>
<i>- I'll be gentle with you.</i>

746
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,376
Who are these punks?

747
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,128
- Gosh.
- What's going on?

748
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,475
Who are you guys?

749
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,851
What's going on?

750
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,771
Who are they?

751
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,902
Who are you guys?

752
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,153
Us?

753
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,828
- TCI.
- TCI?

754
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,331
Hold on.

755
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,291
Oh. Are--

756
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,168
Are you a thinker?

757
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,381
I'm a feeler, you punk.

758
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,300
- Nice one.
- What does he mean?

759
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,219
Hyunkyung, take the left.
I'll take the right.

760
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,680
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

761
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,685
You guys did a good job
at the car rental agency.

762
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,187
Take a break today.

763
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,481
- No. No way.
- Hey.

764
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,108
- Bring it on!
- Go, go!

765
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,739
He's good.

766
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,993
- My goodness.
- Take this!

767
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,372
- We'll do it.
- Hold on. Not yet.

768
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,915
- No?
- Not yet.

769
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,211
- Bring it on.
- What's up with you?

770
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,507
For goodness' sake.

771
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,344
- My goodness.
- Are you okay?

772
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,679
You sneaky jerk.

773
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,892
- Now.
- Now?

774
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,185
- Now.
- Now?

775
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,436
- Let's go.
- Okay.

776
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,992
My hair.

777
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,120
Come on.

778
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,889
- Surrender.
- Come on.

779
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,100
My goodness.

780
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,480
Give me your hands.

781
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,155
Hold still.

782
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,251
Come here.

783
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,462
- Donggi!
- Yes, sir.

784
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,885
Relax your arm.

785
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:47,933
My goodness.

786
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,650
Are you that punk from earlier?

787
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,651
No.

788
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,693
- No?
- No.

789
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,446
You're not, you punk?

790
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,411
Donggi!

791
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,206
- Let go, you punk.
- Come on.

792
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,625
- For goodness' sake.
- Come here.

793
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,377
- Hyunkyung, nice play.
- Yes.

794
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,004
- You did all the work.
- Nonsense. It was all you.

795
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,215
Captain, are you okay?

796
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,299
- Don't talk to me.
- No?

797
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,843
- Go away.
- What do you want me to do?

798
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,011
Handcuffs.

799
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,229
I used the car well and returned it.

800
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,147
Call me if you find any scratches.

801
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,610
Did you have fun
with the ghost experience?

802
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,571
Enjoy the prison experience now.

803
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,450
- Inspector Cha, take him.
- Okay.

804
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,875
How was working with Inspector Cha?

805
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,377
I'm not sure yet.

806
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,507
But his brain definitely comes in handy.

807
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,884
Right? If Lieutenant Min approves of him…

808
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,553
My goodness.

809
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:13,685
NAMGANG POLICE STATION

810
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,187
- Dad.
- Hey.

811
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,858
It's hard to see Lieutenant Min's face.

812
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,151
Hello, sir.

813
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,737
Detective Eo, you're looking good.

814
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,155
Really?

815
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,450
- Get in. He'll give you a ride.
- No. I called a taxi.

816
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,995
You always turn me down.
You don't live alone, do you?

817
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:34,039
It isn't like that.

818
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,623
The taxi is here. I'll get going.

819
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,916
Okay.

820
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,293
- Bye, sir.
- Take care.

821
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,003
Get home safely.

822
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,800
Didn't you bring your bicycle today?

823
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,177
No.

824
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,554
It needs to rest once in a while
for it to last long.

825
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,767
You cherish your bicycle a lot.

826
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,854
Who is he?

827
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,066
He's Inspector Cha Yeonho
who recently joined the team.

828
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,609
He's my father.

829
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,821
It's nice to meet you. I'm Cha Yeonho.

830
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,114
It's nice to meet you.

831
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,533
Please take good care of Lieutenant Min.

832
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,662
Get in. You're going
in the same direction.

833
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,165
It's okay. I'll grab a taxi.

834
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,627
Get in. Why would you waste money?
We'll drop you off on our way.

835
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,879
Get in. She says it's the same direction.

836
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,005
Come on.

837
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,050
In that case…

838
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,689
Dad, I'm going to sleep.

839
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,774
Okay.

840
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,320
My goodness.

841
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,044
This taxi is like her home.

842
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,465
Her mom passed away when she was young,

843
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,677
so I didn't want to leave her
at home alone.

844
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,682
That's why she always rode around
in my taxi.

845
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,568
I told you not to pick me up.

846
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:31,823
What? Why is my princess in a bad mood?

847
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,494
Why is our car a taxi?

848
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,121
Can't we get a different car?

849
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,539
Well…

850
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,583
Why? Don't you like it?

851
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,587
Starting tomorrow, I'll walk.

852
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,090
<i>She ate in here.</i>

853
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,055
How's your studying going?

854
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,640
Geez. Don't talk to me.

855
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,101
I'm sorry.

856
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,854
<i>She studied in here.</i>

857
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,528
Is university life fun?

858
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,697
Fun, my foot. Gosh, I'm tired.

859
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,993
I'm going to sleep, Dad.

860
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,286
Okay. Get some sleep.

861
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,372
<i>She slept in here.</i>

862
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,424
She practically grew up in here,

863
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,094
so I feel very bad for her.

864
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,434
Your car is very classic.

865
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,312
Well, yes. It's quite old.

866
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,941
I feel the most comfortable in this car.

867
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,569
Perhaps it's because it was
the first taxi my father drove.

868
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,703
I take it you're not a talker.

869
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,040
Although you're intelligent,

870
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,960
you must struggle with human interactions.

871
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,421
You don't have any siblings.

872
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,801
You now live alone, away from your family.

873
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,095
You enjoy being alone.

874
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,305
You eat alone.

875
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,433
Right?

876
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,687
How did you know all that?

877
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,480
Sohee told me.

878
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:34,696
When you don't want to eat alone,

879
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,531
you should come home with Sohee.

880
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:41,035
I may not look like it,
but I'm a good cook.

881
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,461
Dad.

882
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:47,977
A MARRIED COUPLE FOUND DEAD
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT DAWN

883
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,453
CRASH

884
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,989
You wanted to see me?

885
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,994
Can't a captain have a face-to-face talk
with his subordinate?

886
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,047
Let me keep it simple.
Jungsub told me about you.

887
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,759
Things must've been hard.

888
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,097
For both the person who lost a loved one
and the person who caused it.

889
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,562
I understand everything else,

890
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,523
but why do you want to be a policeman?

891
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,651
There must be other things you're good at.

892
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,363
Is my past

893
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,700
a problem when it comes to work?

894
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,665
That's none of my business.

895
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,919
Your past must never be a detriment to us

896
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,839
or our teammates.

897
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,013
You'd better keep that in mind.

898
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,576
Please!

899
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,161
<i>Two cars ran over the victim.</i>

900
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,621
- What?
<i>- I looked into it.</i>

901
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,040
It's Cha Yeonho, that bastard.

902
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,418
I guess someone else has not forgotten
about this accident.

903
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,628
What's that?

904
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,672
- Why?
- <i>I know that feeling more than anyone.</i>

905
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,175
That dirty feeling makes me stronger.

906
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:28,346
Cha Yeonho.
