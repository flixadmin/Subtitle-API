1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,051
Previously on Crisis
on Infinite Earths...

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:06,052
There's a wave of antimatter sweeping

3
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:07,420
across this universe,

4
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,523
destroying everything in its path.

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,134
He fought to his last breath

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,403
knowing every moment was
another life saved.

7
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,138
Dig, we are working on bringing him back

8
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:27,140
the same way that he
brought me back, remember?

9
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,842
You're talking about a trip to Purgatory?

10
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,644
- Yes.
- Fine. Count me in.

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,346
I need you to come back to us.

12
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:34,414
You're my brother. Can't lose you, man.

13
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:36,115
Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,851
- Who are you?
- Jim Corrigan,

15
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,820
but I'm also Spectre.

16
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:42,656
It's your turn now.

17
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,625
Only you can light the spark, Oliver.

18
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,594
It is your destiny.

19
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,994
ANTI-MATTER WAVE
DETECTED NEARBY

20
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,637
What's happening?

21
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,204
Iris!

22
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:01,282
ALERT: EARTH-1 DESTROYED

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,409
Where are we?

24
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:05,178
This is the Vanishing Point.

25
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,749
It's a point outside of time and space.

26
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:12,218
- Something's wrong.
- No. Hey, hey.

27
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,460
What did you do?

28
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,696
Well, I held "The Book of Destiny,"

29
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:27,567
and I thought destiny could
use a little rewrite.

30
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:29,135
What do we do now?

31
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:32,770
PLANET MALTUS

32
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:36,087
TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO

33
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:44,084
Are we ready?

34
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,720
Just about.

35
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:48,622
You better suit up.

36
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:02,001
I love you.

37
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,770
I love you.

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,851
Ok. This will be temporal jump trial one.

39
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:20,354
All systems nominal.

40
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,056
I look ridiculous.

41
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,126
Is this really the height of
fashion at the Dawn of Time?

42
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,361
The suit provides a shield against...

43
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:29,730
- The coronal radiation...
- The coronal radiation...

44
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,531
My body will be... yes, yes, yes.

45
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,700
I'm familiar with the jingle,

46
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,769
but you couldn't have designed something

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,673
a tad less... bulky?

48
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,908
Remind me again, why did I marry you?

49
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:45,378
You have a thing for men
of towering ambition.

50
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,848
Are you seeing this quantum flux cascade?

51
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:52,018
I am just a time traveler here, my love.

52
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:53,887
You are the Monitor.

53
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,796
Engaging quantum portal.

54
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:05,632
Field is stabilizing.

55
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,902
The portal is engaging.

56
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:13,206
Next stop... the Dawn of Time.

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,023
I am in the Temporal Zone.

58
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,829
Oh, I wish you could see this, Xneen.

59
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:39,165
The birthplace of all creation.

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,566
It is beautiful.

61
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:45,739
Mar, I'm getting readings
here I don't understand.

62
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:48,008
Your presence has corrupted
the zone somehow.

63
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,611
It's releasing radiation
I've never seen before.

64
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,814
I think... I think this
might be anti-matter.

65
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,483
You have to get out of there.

66
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,953
Get out of there right now!

67
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,829
Xneen... Xneen,

68
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,798
can you hear me?

69
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,000
Something went wrong.

70
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:17,471
I do not think this is the Dawn of Time.

71
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,205
No, it is. It just isn't

72
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,042
the Dawn of Time of our universe.

73
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,510
What?

74
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,611
You breached the wall between our universe

75
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:28,648
and its opposite.

76
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,249
An anti-universe?

77
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,219
Your body was suffused
with coronal radiation.

78
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,622
The suit couldn't contain it.

79
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:41,761
Mar? Mar, can you hear me?

80
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:46,299
I'm sorry, my love. My towering ambition...

81
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,735
Has doomed us all.

83
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,122
THE VANISHING POINT

84
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:10,090
Dear Amanda,

85
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:13,459
so... you're dead

86
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:16,896
along with, well, everyone,

87
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:23,303
everyone who's ever lived
in any reality ever,

88
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:27,440
and me, I'm supposed to be a Paragon,

89
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,776
one of 7 people who are supposed to be

90
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:34,413
the multiverse's last, best chance.

91
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:37,350
I don't see it.

92
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:41,154
The so-called Paragon of Destiny,

93
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,123
she doesn't even believe
in tomorrow anymore.

94
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:48,728
The Paragon of Courage spends every day

95
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,664
working herself to the bone,

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,968
training for a fight that will never come.

97
00:05:57,505 --> 00:06:00,907
The Paragon of Honor just meditates

98
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,143
for hours on end.

99
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:11,150
The Paragon of Hope has lost hers...

100
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:18,124
And me, I spend my days trying to repurpose

101
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,959
the broken technology of this place

102
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:21,360
to find us a way out.

103
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:22,528
Careful, careful.

104
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:23,730
Narcissist,

105
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,798
sociopath, evil genius...

106
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:28,301
There are a lot of ways
to describe Lex Luthor.

107
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:30,870
Idiot!

108
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,839
Why couldn't I be trapped
at the Edge of Eternity

109
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,176
with someone possessing
more than 200 IQ points?!

110
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,144
But I find douchebag to be

111
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,180
the most descriptive.

112
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:43,116
As for Barry Allen, aka The Flash,

113
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:48,955
aka the Paragon of Love, he's just gone.

114
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,057
Missing.

115
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,296
What, you guys building modern art now?

116
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:59,265
Hey, team. We're repurposing

117
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,100
leftover time masters tech.

118
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,269
Mr. Luthor and I think we've retrofitted it

119
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:06,505
into a teleportation device.

120
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,307
To teleport us to where exactly?

121
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,943
Kate makes a good point.

122
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:13,246
There is no... there out there anymore.

123
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:16,816
So we send somebody to test it.

124
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,452
- I'll go.
- No.

125
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:21,621
We've lost too many good people already.

126
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,890
Thanks for volunteering, Lex.

127
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:27,493
Well, that's very cold.

128
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,130
Is it because I killed your
parallel reality cousin?

129
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,932
Start it up.

130
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,642
If this works...

131
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,045
We get out of here,

132
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,113
we defeat the Anti-Monitor,

133
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:50,183
and we find a way to get all
the people we lost back.

134
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:06,532
Perhaps it was too much to hope for.

135
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,802
Is there some way you can get it to work?

136
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:10,803
It was a longshot to begin with.

137
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:14,941
Watch out!

138
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,812
Barry!

139
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:22,181
Where am I? Where am I?

140
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:23,649
The Vanishing Point.

141
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:25,184
You've been gone for months.

142
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,652
What are you... what are you talking about?

143
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:28,521
I just left two seconds ago.

144
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:29,823
To go where?

145
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,091
To the Speed Force. I didn't...

146
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:36,329
I couldn't... it was like...

147
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,498
It was like running into
a mountain at Mach 10.

148
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,166
I couldn't...

149
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,904
There's no way out of here.

150
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,838
What did you see?

151
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:22,975
Everything.

152
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,611
I see everything now.

153
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:27,046
Then you're ready.

154
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,916
Why would you make me relive all that?

155
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:33,019
Every fight, every punch you've thrown,

156
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,587
every kick you've landed,

157
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,722
every arrow you've fired,
they have all led you here

158
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:40,626
to this moment, to the ultimate fight.

159
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,362
Who am I fighting?

160
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,263
Not who.

161
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,132
What.

162
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,967
The Anti-Monitor.

163
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,671
PURGATORY

164
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,538
The Monitor's adversary.

165
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:54,274
Not just adversary.

166
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:58,277
A being who stands against all
there ever was or will be,

167
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:01,147
the apocalypse itself given life and form

168
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,648
and terrible purpose.

169
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,350
How do I beat him?

170
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:05,985
With help.

171
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,621
It's time to get your friends.

172
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:11,056
Barry, wait. You look spent.
You need to rest.

173
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,526
No. I'm fine. I have to try again.

174
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,395
Hey, Barry, that's a bad idea, ok?

175
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,762
The effort alone could kill you.

176
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,298
It's better than just staying here.

177
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,211
We're not gonna let you kill yourself.

178
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,301
Get out of my way!

179
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:22,635
- Barry!
- We're not letting you

180
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,937
go anywhere.

181
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:25,338
So try and stop me!

182
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:26,739
In the condition you're in, Barry,

183
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,241
it's not gonna be that hard.

184
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:30,009
Cut it out! Whatever's going to happen

185
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,678
is not going to include
us turning on each other.

186
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:35,448
Maybe you're right. Maybe the Speed Force

187
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,183
is our last, best hope.

188
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,685
It is.

189
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,788
The Speed Force is the key to saving you.

190
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:48,328
It's the key to saving everyone.

191
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:57,416
Oliver?

192
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,985
Yes and no.

193
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,686
It's complicated.

194
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,889
Nice outfit.

195
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:05,791
Very... sith.

196
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:09,494
Oliver?

197
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,463
I am Oliver Queen,

198
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,399
but I'm also something more.

199
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,567
More what?

200
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,803
Some might call me a ghost,

201
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,439
a Spectre that's in tune

202
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:22,141
with the entire multiverse.

203
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:23,709
So there's still a multiverse out there?

204
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:26,011
No. It's gone,

205
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,213
replaced with its antithesis.

206
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:29,915
An anti-matter universe.

207
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:31,916
Which we need to prevent from happening.

208
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,852
Right now, the Anti-Monitor

209
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,687
is at the Dawn of Time,

210
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:37,423
fighting to make permanent his

211
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,391
destruction of worlds.

212
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:42,228
Then we go there, and we end him.

213
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,195
He's extremely powerful.

214
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:47,399
The 8 of us might not be enough.

215
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,934
We need a backup plan.

216
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,636
You have our attention.

217
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,639
Several millennia ago on
a planet named Maltus,

218
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,475
Mar Novu attempted to travel
to the birth of the universe

219
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,278
but instead opened a breach

220
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:00,779
to the anti-matter universe.

221
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:03,648
So the Monitor gave us the Anti-Monitor.

222
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,784
Correct. So while some of us

223
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,587
fight at the Dawn of Time,

224
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:10,055
others must go to Maltus.

225
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,324
And prevent Novu from
freeing his doppelganger?

226
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,492
I'm in.

227
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:15,394
Travel to an alien world? So in.

228
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:16,928
Same.

229
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,797
Come on. You know you don't want to risk

230
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,566
letting me out of your sight
for even a millisecond.

231
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:23,435
We can get to both through the Speed Force,

232
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,237
but I can't get into the
Speed Force right now.

233
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:29,775
It's probably because
there's no multiverse left,

234
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:31,943
but you said you're in
tune with the multiverse.

235
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,578
Does that include the Speed Force?

236
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:35,747
What you're asking me is
very dangerous, Barry.

237
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:41,019
But possible. You could give
me the energy boost I need.

238
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:42,821
Please.

239
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:46,592
We have to do this. Everyone's
lives depend on it.

240
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,738
I've unlocked your potential, Barry.

241
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:01,206
By touching my head?

242
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,275
Use this power with caution.

243
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:08,113
Do you trust me?

244
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:11,116
Are you Oliver Queen?

245
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,818
Yes.

246
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:17,723
Then I trust you with
every cell of my body.

247
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:21,593
Good. Now run, Barry.

248
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:25,764
Run.

249
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,152
Ok.

250
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:48,820
Thanks for the kind assist.

251
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:51,523
Why doesn't this alien
forest look more alien?

252
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:54,726
Let's focus. Mar Novu could be anywhere,

253
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:58,029
and it's not like we can just
do an Internet search for him.

254
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,299
Well, actually, maybe we can.

255
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,033
Look at that.

256
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:06,305
Any city that large has
to be a bureaucracy.

257
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,173
And?

258
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:10,175
Well, bureaucracies require some form

259
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:13,345
of central data bank to function.

260
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,648
We find that, we find Novu.

261
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:20,819
That's actually not a bad idea. Lex...

262
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,854
Where's Lex?

263
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:44,976
Sorry I'm late,

264
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:46,612
but actually my train was late.

265
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,747
Well, the second one. The
first one I did miss,

266
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,749
but that was my cab driver's fault.

267
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:54,186
I've got this great traffic
app, and he thought that...

268
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,822
Queen Consolidated?

269
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:58,724
Not exactly.

270
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:01,159
You're in the Speed Force, Barry.

271
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:03,262
What happened to you? You're not...

272
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:05,263
Spectrey anymore.

273
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,199
Well, I'm lost.

274
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:11,002
I'm out there somewhere
in the Speed Force, too.

275
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:16,107
Right. The Anti-Monitor attacked.

276
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,377
We were separated, and I am utilizing

277
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:22,281
various pieces of my essence

278
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:27,486
to keep me, Sara, J'onn, and Kate together.

279
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,721
That's why I'm here. This is...

280
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:31,490
This is where we first met.

281
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,993
Right. There are few things
more powerful in the universe

282
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,895
than memory and connection.

283
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:41,099
I am using our memories of our friends

284
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,967
and closest allies

285
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,571
to keep all of us from falling
out of the Speed Force.

286
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:47,772
Wait. What happens if they fall out?

287
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,074
We'll be consumed by anti-matter.

288
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,444
I can buy you time, Barry,

289
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,548
but you need to get to each of us.

290
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,283
I mean, the Speed Force is infinite.

291
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,851
I could never know where to begin to look.

292
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:02,120
Remember, Barry, memories and connections.

293
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:05,423
You need to consider our
greatest victories,

294
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,959
our most crushing defeats,

295
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:11,963
the moments when the bonds
between us were forged.

296
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,132
The bonds were forged.

297
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,401
Now do this, Barry.

298
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:20,639
Because you have to.

299
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:31,116
Hello?

300
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:36,755
What the hell is this?

301
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,993
I'm asking myself the
same question literally.

302
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:43,962
No. This... this can't be happening.

303
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:45,997
This... you... what are you doing here?

304
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,734
Well, I'll tell you that when you tell me

305
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:53,338
where... here... is.

306
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:55,941
Is this cosplay? Do
you want a selfie, bro?

307
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:58,042
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. We're not... no.

308
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm also The Flash.

309
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:03,615
You're also the what?

310
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:06,818
- The Flash?
- The Flash?

311
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,823
- The Flash.
- It's complicated.

312
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,926
I like your outfit. It seems... comfy.

313
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:16,561
I was thinking yours is pretty cool.

314
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:17,963
- Smooth.
- Seems safe and...

315
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,898
It's breathable.

316
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,167
I'm Barry Allen.

317
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,570
- No!
- What?

318
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:26,404
What does that mean? How can this...

319
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,206
This should be impossible now.

320
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:29,975
Should be impossible now?

321
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,276
You don't know about the...

322
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:33,512
Oh, my God. Don't do this to me.

323
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:34,980
I don't know about the what?

324
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:37,649
- Are you ok?
- Oh, my God.

325
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:41,486
I told Victor this was possible.

326
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,722
What does this mean?

327
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:55,734
What do you think you're doing?

328
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,135
What you should have done the moment

329
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,770
fleet feet dropped us off here...

330
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,339
Checked out the lay of the land,

331
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,607
looked for hidden dangers.

332
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:03,942
We are on an alien world.

333
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:05,476
Any number of chest busters or predators

334
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:06,712
could be lying in wait.

335
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,513
Don't you capes ever watch a movie?

336
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:10,215
You know what? Whatever
it is you're planning,

337
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,083
I'm gonna figure it out, and...

338
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,052
I'm gonna stop you.

339
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,887
I doubt that. In a contest

340
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,523
of mind over muscle, mind wins every time,

341
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,892
but here.

342
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:23,795
Let me make it easy for you.

343
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,730
Ask me what I'm up to.

344
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,500
Go ahead.

345
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:32,671
All right. What are you up to, Lex?

346
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:35,073
Universal domination, of course.

347
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,180
Oh, I probably should have mentioned

348
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:43,815
that I gave myself a few upgrades

349
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,284
when I checked "The Book of Destiny"

350
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,418
out of the library.

351
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,987
What are you doing?

352
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:51,056
God, I am so tired of
answering that question.

353
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,530
Moving on.

354
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:12,461
Yeah. The Black Canary.

355
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:15,128
She tried to shut me up,
but it's not gonna work.

356
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,730
I didn't kill those people.

357
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,432
Yes, I know. Felicity told me.

358
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,933
An impersonator, right?

359
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,302
Hate when that happens.

360
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,538
5 years on a deserted island.

361
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:29,141
That kind of thing really
changes you, doesn't it?

362
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:31,577
Must have been difficult if not impossible

363
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,880
to hold on to your sanity all those years,

364
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,682
and here you are,

365
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:39,652
pretending you have everything in control.

366
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:44,790
Felicity told you the truth,

367
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:47,226
and you should trust her judgment.

368
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:49,295
How can I do that?

369
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,329
Her perception of you is clearly clouded

370
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:54,299
by her emotional attachment.

371
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,670
She's not seeing you for
what you really are.

372
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,776
You have no idea what
this city is up against.

373
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,878
Actually, I think I do,

374
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:07,880
and I'm gonna stop him.

375
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,484
Who are you?

376
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:16,356
INVASION EXTRATERRESTRIALS ATTACK EARTH

377
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,190
I want to limit your involvement in this.

378
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,225
Why? Because I'm an alien?

379
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,927
I also happen to be your biggest weapon.

380
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:24,362
You're an unknown quantity,
and this isn't personal.

381
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,198
Except that's exactly how this feels.

382
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,934
When I... when I started living this life,

383
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,236
I was going up against human threats alone,

384
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:32,437
and I could handle that.

385
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:33,772
Then there were metahumans,

386
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:35,274
and I could handle that.

387
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,042
I just discovered that
there are multiple Earths,

388
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,344
and I was brainwashed
aboard an alien spacecraft.

389
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,079
I'm sure that was unnerving.

390
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:43,115
I don't get unnerved. When I
go up against something new,

391
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,416
I push back.

392
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,585
Right or wrong, it's who I am,

393
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,687
and it's what I do, so I am asking you

394
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,523
for just a little bit of space

395
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,358
so that I can draw a line somewhere

396
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:57,229
so that I can claw back just
a small sense of normalcy.

397
00:20:57,364 --> 00:21:00,465
I'm afraid we're well past normal.

398
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,603
J'onn, what are you doing here?

399
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:08,641
That... is a very long story.

400
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,720
Supergirl?!

401
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:24,256
Supergirl, please wake up.

402
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:26,992
- Hey.
- Ryan?

403
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:31,597
Yeah. I think Lex pulled a Luthor on us.

404
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,099
On the bright side, I haven't been knocked

405
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:36,001
unconscious on an alien planet before.

406
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:39,905
It's pretty much the same as being
knocked unconscious on Earth.

407
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,941
No broken bones. You'll be fine.

408
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:47,947
Thanks. This definitely makes
me question again why I'm here.

409
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,182
I haven't got special powers

410
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,117
or, you know, powers.

411
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:54,153
I'm pretty much the dictionary definition

412
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:56,689
of unspecial, and I definitely
don't feel like I'm

413
00:21:56,824 --> 00:22:00,893
a Paragon of Anything, let alone humanity.

414
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,261
Wait.

415
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:06,799
Are you sure you guys got the right guy?

416
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,601
You left your family because someone

417
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,970
you never even met told
you you were needed.

418
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:13,138
I'd say that makes you pretty special.

419
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:18,077
I don't know about hope,

420
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,312
but you're definitely the
Paragon of Pep Talks.

421
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:24,382
Years of practice. We
need to catch up to Lex.

422
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:26,018
How do you know where he's headed?

423
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:27,586
Well, before he knocked me out, he said

424
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,955
was looking for universal domination, so...

425
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:31,690
Hardly sounds like a newsflash.

426
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,192
The universal part is new,

427
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:35,260
and if I know him, he's looking to mess

428
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:40,766
with Novu's experiment, change
history to his advantage.

429
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,101
He really is a selfish asshat, isn't he?

430
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,137
You really have no idea.

431
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,340
What are you doing?

432
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:51,143
I'm guessing you haven't flown
on an alien planet either.

433
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:54,246
- I've never flown.
- No, but it's ok, Dr. Choi.

434
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:55,915
You don't have to be nervous.

435
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,884
It's just up, up, and away.

436
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:03,989
It's over, Deegan!

437
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:06,358
No. I decide when the story ends!

438
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:10,463
All right. Come on, Oliver. Where are you?

439
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:30,548
I wasn't here for this.

440
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,390
Told you you'd catch me.

441
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,063
Thanks for the save.

442
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:45,730
With a magic arrow, no less.

443
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,399
It's a gift from the Monitor.

444
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:51,636
- Barry?
- Hey.

445
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:54,006
Did you go out shopping for a new costume

446
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,174
while you were supposed to
be out saving the world?

447
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,976
What? No. No.

448
00:23:58,112 --> 00:23:59,778
It's a crazy, long story, and you wouldn't

449
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:01,680
believe me if I told you.

450
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,583
Can I talk to you for a minute?

451
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:08,487
Please. Excuse us.

452
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:10,489
Are you ok?

453
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,893
What I'm about to tell you
isn't gonna make any sense,

454
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,796
but you're not really h-here right now.

455
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,599
- You're actually...
- In the Speed Force.

456
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:26,338
I remember. I...

457
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,842
I remember everything.

458
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:33,145
Ok. Well, in that case...

459
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:38,951
That arrow from the Monitor,

460
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,386
I always felt like there was something

461
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,155
you weren't telling me.

462
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:48,360
I didn't want to burden you
with the choice I made.

463
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:50,195
The choice to do what?

464
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,366
You and Kara, Barry,

465
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,869
you were fated to die
trying to save the world.

466
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:03,575
Right before you died,

467
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,446
you said you'd given up
everything for me and Kara.

468
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:10,783
You made some kind of Devil's Bargain

469
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:12,417
with the Monitor to save us, didn't you?

470
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,819
No. It wasn't a Devil's Bargain, Barry,

471
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:16,054
and I'd make it again in a second.

472
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,590
It cost you your family, Oliver.

473
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,893
It cost you your life.

474
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:24,229
Dying's the easy part.

475
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,565
The dead are at peace,

476
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,266
but the real heroes are the ones

477
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,468
who have to keep going.

478
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,974
Go find the others.

479
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:51,323
Laurel.

480
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:56,228
Laurel, it's time. It's
time to put her to rest.

481
00:25:56,363 --> 00:26:00,098
What am I supposed to tell my parents?

482
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:02,400
My father, he... he has a bad heart.

483
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:04,937
He won't live through this.

484
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,813
It should have been me.

485
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,749
She was the true hero.

486
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,619
A hero sets an example, Laurel...

487
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,125
So follow hers.

488
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,827
Wear the mask.

489
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,430
Be the Canary.

490
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:34,733
That's how you keep your sister alive.

491
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:44,977
Oh, boy.

492
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,159
Engaging quantum portal.

493
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,259
I wouldn't do that.

494
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:58,761
Xneen?

495
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,462
No.

496
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:04,500
No, obviously.

497
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:06,401
Hi. Lex Luthor.

498
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,004
I'm here to make you an offer
I won't let you refuse.

499
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:10,973
How did you get in here?

500
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:12,407
Our security protocols are...

501
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,643
A joke, but the fact that I was able to

502
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,445
circumvent them with astonishing ease

503
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,647
is exactly why you need to listen to me.

504
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:20,883
- Xneen?
- Is taking a little nappy time.

505
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:22,752
Not to worry.

506
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:26,622
So you are a scientist.

507
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:29,458
Tell me you're not intrigued
by what I have to say,

508
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,260
or do you get regular visits from humans

509
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:34,597
with future knowledge?

510
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:36,198
Speak.

511
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,767
The experiment you're conducting

512
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,468
will not only destroy you

513
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:42,537
but your planet and your wife.

514
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:44,707
Another ancients zealot. I am so sick...

515
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:46,209
Don't know who they are.

516
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:47,610
I'm not even from this universe.

517
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:49,612
What I am from is the future,

518
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:53,081
so I know exactly how your little
time-jumping experiment will go wrong,

519
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:58,788
and I am willing to share my
future knowledge with you.

520
00:27:58,923 --> 00:28:00,589
And in return?

521
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:03,058
Well, I don't cotton to aliens,

522
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:06,929
but you will soon have certain abilities

523
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,364
that I will need in order
to deal with some,

524
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,868
shall we say, super problems

525
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:15,203
popping up in my world.

526
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:19,375
I do not have any... abilities.

527
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,376
Stick with me, kid.

528
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,178
So what do you say? Team up?

529
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,348
The Brave and the Bald?

530
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:32,054
Who are you?

531
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:36,058
Hey. This is awkward.

532
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,694
Long story short, you guys aren't

533
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,164
really you guys, and none of this is

534
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,233
really actually happening.

535
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:46,001
What are you talk... Hey! Hey!

536
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,703
Don't you touch her!

537
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,071
I'm so sorry.

538
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:55,745
It's a miracle.

539
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,379
- Barry?
- Hey.

540
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,214
- What's happening?
- It's a long, very weird story.

541
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,384
- I'll catch you up on the way.
- On the way to where?

542
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,285
You're not taking her anywhere.

543
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,754
I'm sorry. Like I said,

544
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:07,256
you guys aren't really here.

545
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,059
The Speed Force?

546
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:13,228
I can only assume. We were moving

547
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:15,064
through the Speed Force
when we were attacked.

548
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,532
By someone called...

549
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:17,967
The Anti-Monitor.

550
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:19,769
Doesn't even sound like an actual name.

551
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,369
We're all trying to stop him.

552
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:24,639
We're working together.

553
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:29,044
The two of you work together.

554
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:30,979
I know you don't trust each other.

555
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:34,784
Right now, I know you don't
even like each other,

556
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,753
but all that changes.

557
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:42,624
In fact, we all come to
depend on each other.

558
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,095
We all come to trust each other.

559
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,296
Why are you telling us this now?

560
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:54,669
This seems to be a pattern with you.

561
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:58,341
You don't trust people.
They don't trust you.

562
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:01,544
Then all of that changes,

563
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,480
and the bond between you
is stronger than iron.

564
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:07,750
I'm sorry. What's your point?

565
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:11,887
It's maybe something I can learn from.

566
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:15,690
So basically, you tore a little hole

567
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:17,593
in the space-time continuum,

568
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:20,128
opened a doorway into something
called the anti-matter universe.

569
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:22,331
Matter and anti-matter cannot coexist.

570
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,266
Hence a lot of bad stuff
happening that we would

571
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:26,268
just as soon not have happen,

572
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,103
so I think what we need to do is adjust

573
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,672
the ronstrom coefficient.

574
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,277
Lex, we need to talk.

575
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:42,707
Mar Novu, do not trust this man

576
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,807
with anything!

577
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,509
Give him a knife for his food,

578
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,077
and no matter how much he
thanks you for the dinner,

579
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,445
he'll stab you right in the back with it.

580
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,180
Or the front. I'm not choosy.

581
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,515
Last time, you caught me by surprise.

582
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,050
That's not gonna happen again.

583
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,551
Get Novu out of here.

584
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,654
Come with me, sir, please.

585
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,594
Xneen!

586
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,766
Ok. Listen to me. Whatever you do,

587
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:10,901
you can't open that portal.

588
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,836
The hairless one warned me.

589
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,838
No. This isn't a warning kind of situation.

590
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,841
This is a don't do it at any...
cost kind of situation.

591
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,876
It is my life's work.

592
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,379
Trillions of other people's lives,

593
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:25,082
an infinite number, will be lost

594
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,818
if you go through with it.

595
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,320
It's not worth it.

596
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:31,922
You just show up here as if by magic

597
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,857
and demand belief.

598
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:38,929
The fact I'm here at all should
be enough to convince you.

599
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:44,134
You are a remarkable individual.

600
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,173
Funny. A new friend of mine
just told me I'm special.

601
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,010
I didn't believe her until now.

602
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,453
I wonder, is it a double-cross

603
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,588
if I never trusted you in the first place?

604
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:08,291
Why do you Kryptonians always have
to take things so personally?

605
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,626
You tried to kill my cousin,

606
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,094
you tried to kill me,

607
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,596
you betrayed Lena,

608
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,498
left her with nothing but a ruined name

609
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,167
and a broken heart.

610
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,037
All I did was tell her the truth,

611
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,874
something you never had the courage to do.

612
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,743
Don't take it personally.

613
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,353
Hey! Stop trying to kill each other.

614
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,954
I got through to Novu.

615
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,123
You just ruined a perfectly
good bad guy plan,

616
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,158
you know that, new guy?

617
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,503
Where are we?

618
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,070
The anti-matter universe.

619
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,506
At the Dawn of Time.

620
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:57,040
We arrived, and he was already here...

621
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,709
The Anti-Monitor.

622
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:02,446
That's impossible. I got through to him.
I know I did.

623
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,916
Some fates are inescapable.

624
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,754
You spoke to one man across
countless universes,

625
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,591
but within the tapestry of the multiverse,

626
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,692
there will always be one Mar Novu

627
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,795
who cannot turn from his towering ambition,

628
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:23,300
and in that inevitability,
there is destiny.

629
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,537
Welcome to mine!

630
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:34,382
All of you,

631
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:37,084
listen to me.

632
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:41,322
This is why you were selected.
You're Paragons.

633
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,557
Yeah. I'm still a little unclear
on what all that means.

634
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:45,293
It means you're powerful enough

635
00:33:45,428 --> 00:33:47,195
to hold the line,

636
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,196
to buy us the time we need.

637
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:50,798
To do what?

638
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:53,968
Rebirth the universe.

639
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,703
What, like, a do-over?

640
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:58,873
The Dawn of Time is the
only place it can happen.

641
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,843
I'll light the spark, you fan the flame.

642
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:04,478
And how do we do that?

643
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:06,080
You'll know when it's time.

644
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:08,182
Why do you cosmic types
always have to be so obtuse?

645
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:11,085
If I knew, I'd tell you.

646
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:13,554
I don't.

647
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:15,656
All I have is trust.

648
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,196
Do you trust me?

649
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:24,164
With every cell in my body.

650
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:30,938
Let's do this.

651
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,288
Die, you creepy shadow things!

652
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,258
That's for Oliver!

653
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:54,194
Idiots! If anyone's gonna
take over the universe,

654
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,197
it's gonna be me!

655
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,182
It is too late.

656
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:17,785
After 10,000 years, I shall be victorious.

657
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,787
No, you won't be.

658
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:21,689
Such confidence.

659
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:24,292
You believe corrigan
prepared you for this fight.

660
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:27,928
I believe my entire life
prepared me for this fight.

661
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:29,763
All life ends.

662
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:32,900
Only death is eternal.

663
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:35,736
Only I am eternal.

664
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:40,274
We'll see about that.

665
00:35:58,694 --> 00:36:01,328
Is this typical for you
guys, saving the world?

666
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:02,563
Yes!

667
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,031
No!

668
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,066
My team and I usually mess things up

669
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:07,535
for the better!

670
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,604
Focus! We're in the fight
of our lives here.

671
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:57,217
You have failed...

672
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:59,853
This universe!

673
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:16,103
We... we did it.

674
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:18,205
So this is what being a hero feels like.

675
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,506
Interesting.

676
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,609
Where's Oliver?

677
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,277
There!

678
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:27,681
Oliver.

679
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:29,750
What is that?

680
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:31,351
"I'll light the spark"...

681
00:37:31,487 --> 00:37:33,854
"While you fan the flame."

682
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,523
He said you would know what to do.

683
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:37,224
I think dying kind of messed with his head.

684
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,992
Well, think. You're meant to be the genius.

685
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:40,794
A genius who's had the fortitude

686
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,763
to read "The Book of Destiny"
and retain his sanity.

687
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,865
I think the jury's still out on that one.

688
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,433
"The Book of Destiny."

689
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:49,036
I made myself the Paragon of Truth.

690
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:52,006
What if truth can tell
us what we need to do?

691
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:54,107
Being what?

692
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,210
Use what's left of the book

693
00:37:56,346 --> 00:37:57,878
to fan the flame.

694
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,881
How do we all use the book?

695
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:03,651
We focus.

696
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:06,754
A singular, laser-like focus.

697
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:07,955
On what?

698
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,123
Humanity,

699
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,992
truth,

700
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:13,927
love,

701
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:16,129
destiny,

702
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:17,965
honor,

703
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,700
courage...

704
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:22,636
And hope.

705
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:39,119
No!

706
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:45,526
No!

707
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:54,935
Oh, my God!

708
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,571
- Oliver!
- Barry, get us there.

709
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:05,079
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

710
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:10,918
I... I need both of you

711
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:12,452
to watch over my family.

712
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:14,355
Hey, Ollie. They're gonna
be fine, all right?

713
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,356
You're gonna be fine.

714
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:19,392
You did it.

715
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,329
You all did... you all did it.

716
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:23,964
Did what? What did we do?

717
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,999
Just look.

718
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:34,241
Ollie, we saw, but what is it?

719
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,577
It's the new universe.

720
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:38,713
It's kind of small for a universe.

721
00:39:38,848 --> 00:39:41,549
Wait for it, Barry.

722
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:46,854
It's almost time, almost time.

723
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,656
There. You did it.

724
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:51,992
No, Ollie, you did it, ok,

725
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:53,761
and that's why you got
to come back with us,

726
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,695
so we need you to hang on, ok?

727
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:58,532
Sara, this is just what the
Monitor said would happen.

728
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:02,670
- No.
- What?

729
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:04,738
There was an end...

730
00:40:06,742 --> 00:40:08,876
And there's a beginning.

731
00:40:11,848 --> 00:40:14,281
You remember what I told you?

732
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:19,086
Dying is the easy part.

733
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:22,622
I'm at peace.

734
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,894
The real heroes...

735
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,463
They're the ones that have to keep going.

736
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,166
So keep... going...

737
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,906
And don't ever stop.

738
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:44,478
This world, this new world...

739
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:48,515
It needs both of you.

740
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:11,472
Barry...

741
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:20,514
An end.

742
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,816
And a beginning.

743
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:31,191
Thank you, Oliver.

744
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:43,459
