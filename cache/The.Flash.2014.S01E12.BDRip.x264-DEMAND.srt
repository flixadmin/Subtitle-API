1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,529
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,770
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,964
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,363
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,489
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,163
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,169
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,004
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,762
Cisco, if you don't seal off the blast, people
in this building will die, including Caitlin.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,361
- Don't look for me again.
- Ronnie's alive.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,841
And he's out there, alone and scared.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,726
Hartley Rathaway. One of the finest
scientific minds I've ever encountered.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,651
Can't imagine how
you're gonna feel when you let me out.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,649
Why would I ever do that?

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,525
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,562
Honey. Honey.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,167
Dana. Oh, God. Someone...

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,328
- Help!
- Please help us.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,487
- Help!
- Help us, please!

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,767
Get the power to that line shut down.
You guys, lay down the hose line.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,208
- Help! Help!
- Help us.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,165
- We're wasting time.
- Help!

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,765
Hold on.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,691
Stay here, all right?

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,041
I got you.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,005
Hey.

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,041
No.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,091
My Wife!

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,084
Dana!

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,730
Everyone, back away.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,691
How did...?

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,484
I love you.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,607
Thank you, Flash.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,886
Dude, that was insane.

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,569
I mean, even I'm having a hard time
getting mad at you for dirtying up my suit.

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,649
When are we gonna consider it my suit?

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,003
- I'd be comfortable calling it our suit.
- Okay. Our suit.

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,925
Tonight was the fastest you've ever run.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,170
Yes, your training is paying off. That
couple is alive tonight because of you.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,283
I can still get faster. I know I can.

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,010
And you will one day. But for today,
I'd say you fulfilled your saved quota.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,204
Proper rest is what you need, as do we all.

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,570
Better yet, what we all need is
a proper drink. Who's up for a round?

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,926
Dude, it's movie night with Joe. I can't.
But I'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,646
- Bye.
- Night.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,286
What about you? Drinks on me?

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,209
I think I'll pass.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,170
You Okay?

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,162
I was looking for my tablet
at your workstation, and I found this.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,891
You said we should stop looking for Ronnie,
so I didn't stop looking for Ronnie.

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,241
Why?

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,444
Hartley, he said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,842
Hartley Rathaway?
Who is currently locked up...

56
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,691
...in our villain jail for going psycho
with sound waves?

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,486
Yeah, he's made some poor choices.
No argument there.

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,843
- But I looked into what he was saying and...
- Cisco, Ronnie's gone.

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,646
And it's time for me to
move on with my life.

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,846
Doesn't seem like it.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,845
What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,643
Look, I'm not an expert on love.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,686
But I think in order to move on
from Ronnie...

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,969
...you actually have to move on.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,850
Breach, level two.

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,166
Hold it right there!

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,561
Shawna?

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
There she is. Get her.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,085
- Crazy cool, right?
- How did you do that?

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,327
Grab my hand.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,888
- How the hell, Shawna?
- So you like?

72
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,570
Oh, I love.

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,607
Whoo!

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,565
H9)'-

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,566
The security cameras
in half the prison are shut down.

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,642
Then Clay Parker, according to this log, who
was locked in his cell, somehow vanishes.

77
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,569
Not completely.

78
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,647
- What's that?
- It's a kind of organic particulate residual.

79
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,124
I found it on the floor in here,
just outside the cell, out in the hallway.

80
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,368
The trail led me all the way outside.

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,610
Dad.

82
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,249
So word around here is
Parker pulled a Shawshank?

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,930
Yep. And none of the other prisoners
heard or saw anything.

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,606
They wouldn't talk to you about it.

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,770
Leaves us with not a lot to go on.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,767
Well, if there's anyone who could figure out
how Parker got out of here, it's you, son.

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,200
- Come on, Allen. Let's go.
- Duty calls.

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,323
So my dad just happened to come by?

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,564
The guard owed me a favor.

90
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,809
Thank you.

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,687
Thanks for getting me
out of that hell hole.

92
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,689
You would have done the same, right?

93
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,605
So...

94
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,962
...how the hell did this happen to you?
Don't know.

95
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,528
After you got locked up,
I started not feeling right.

96
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,401
I was passing out for no reason.
Waking up in odd places.

97
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,371
Took me a while before I could control it.

98
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,402
As soon as I could...

99
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,491
...I came for you.

100
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,401
So you can just jump wherever you want?

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,286
If I can see where I'm going.
We got a second chance, Clay.

102
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,281
We can leave Central City.
Do all the things we talked about.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,520
I can't leave yet, baby.

104
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,966
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

105
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,369
I skip town before paying him back,
he'll find us.

106
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,641
But with what you can do...

107
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,090
...we can pay off that debt.

108
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,486
Then we'll be free
and we can go anywhere in the world.

109
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,569
Together.

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,326
Not even Barry's cells move this fast.
I've never seen anything like it.

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,284
So Clay Parker is a metahuman?

112
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,691
Not so fast. The particulate
residue that Barry gathered...

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,841
...at Iron Heights does contain Clay
Parker's DNA but also DNA of a woman.

114
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,562
Run her DNA against the C.C.P.D.
criminal database. See if you get a match.

115
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,846
Yahtzee. Her name's Shawna Baez.

116
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,726
Mostly petty crimes,
and this girl likes to party, apparently.

117
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,002
A long list of disorderly conducts at bars.

118
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,441
So I'm guessing we find her,
we find Clay Parker.

119
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,130
- Barry?
- Yeah.

120
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,602
In the meantime, let's track
these particulates and see how they work.

121
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,729
I'll be right with you guys.

122
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,084
I have had the biggest
craving for Thai food.

123
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,601
You said you knew
what happened to Ronnie.

124
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,605
And how he was still alive.

125
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,885
And you said Professor Stein was at
S.T.A.R. Labs the night of the explosion.

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,481
Yes, he was.

127
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,129
Why?

128
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,961
The mystery isn't why Stein
went to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,450
It's why he didn't leave.

130
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,488
- Tell me.
- Can't. Have to show you.

131
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,609
You are not getting out of this cell.

132
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,449
Fair enough. But I know you, Cisco.

133
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,089
I know how much you looked up to Ronnie.
He was like family.

134
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,489
The family you built for yourself here.

135
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,566
I know how much
you wanna see that family healed.

136
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,330
Let me help you.

137
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,602
I don't believe you.

138
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,322
I'm telling you the truth, Cisco.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,050
When you are ready,
you know where to find me.

140
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,762
What's that smile about?

141
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,684
I saw my dad today.

142
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,925
No glass. No phones. Just me
and him face-to-face. Joe arranged it.

143
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,727
- That must have been amazing, Barry.
- Yeah. I really needed it.

144
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm sure he needed it too.

145
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,327
Were you there investigating the breakout?

146
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,203
- Mm-hm.
- That is a big story which I am not a part of.

147
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,683
My editor wants me writing
about the Flash and only the Flash.

148
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,484
- Is that a bad thing?
- I don't know.

149
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,564
I would like to be thought of
as more than the Flash PR flack.

150
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,481
I mean, if I don't write something soon,
I think I might lose my job.

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,083
Hey, we will find you a great story
to write about. Together.

152
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,164
Okay? You know I'm always here for you.

153
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,124
I know.

154
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,167
I didn't know you enjoyed
a bit of rough trade.

155
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,921
If I'm gonna let you out,
I'm not taking any chances.

156
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,169
Curiosity's a maddening thing, is it not?

157
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,322
What do you mean,
you've been asking around?

158
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,091
Do you know a Marcus Stockheimer?

159
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,569
Sure. He's some midlevel gangster.
Works mainly on the south side.

160
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,445
Word is Clay Parker
was a runner for Marcus.

161
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,248
When Clay got pinched, Marcus lost a lot of
money. Marcus doesn't like losing money.

162
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,362
So Parker can't leave Central City
until he's paid off his debt?

163
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,360
From what I'm told, if you're a member
of the Stockheimer crew, you get out...

164
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,965
...first thing you do is pay them a visit
or suffer the consequences.

165
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,531
All right. No more playing cop.

166
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,566
Promise me.

167
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,724
I hear you.

168
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,847
All right.

169
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,601
You were gonna show rne what happened
to Ronnie. Ronnie died inside the building.

170
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,125
- What are we doing out here?
- What do you see?

171
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,371
I don't know.

172
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,281
Buildings. Walls. Dirt.

173
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,203
Wells would be so disappointed
in your observational skills. Look again.

174
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,964
It's Japanese.

175
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,960
How can you speak six languages
and sound like a dick in every one of them?

176
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,083
It means "bomb shadow."

177
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,365
They found these all over Hiroshima
after the first atomic bomb was dropped.

178
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,088
This shadow belonged to Martin Stein.

179
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,087
The accelerator explosion did this to him?

180
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,411
You really don't see it, do you? You're gonna
gonna kick yourself when you figure it out.

181
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,811
Oh, man. You were full of it then,
and you're full of it now.

182
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,840
This is another one of your lame tricks.
We're going back into the pipeline.

183
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,291
You're not the only one
who understands vibrations, Hartley.

184
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,124
Those cochlear devices you're wearing...

185
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,807
...I've made a few adjustments.
No. Please, don't.

186
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,648
If you know how to find Ronnie,
then you better tell me. Right now.

187
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,969
Please. Make it stop.
Please. I'll show you. I'll show... Aah!

188
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,801
Try that again,
and I won't make it stop. Ever.

189
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,726
I'm impressed.
Didn't think you had that in you.

190
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,164
You have to take these off
if you want to find out the truth.

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
And why is that?

192
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,164
It will look a little conspicuous
where we're going next.

193
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,408
Mm. I was analyzing the particulates that
Clay Parker and Shawna Baez left behind.

194
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,204
I found something very interesting.

195
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,968
When Clay's cells come into contact
with Shawna's, they adopt her properties.

196
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,086
Something bothering you?

197
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,530
Why would you ask that?

198
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,486
You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing
you do when something's bothering you.

199
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,324
Ahem. I'm fine.

200
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,087
Okay.

201
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,242
Cisco says I don't have a life.

202
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,245
- You don't, do you?
- I do.

203
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,408
I cook and I eat.

204
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,884
And I read and I help you.

205
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,443
So, what you're saying is you do everything
that has nothing to do with having a life.

206
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,768
You don't have to be rude about it.

207
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,321
Ha, ha.
Hey, I'm not doing any better than you.

208
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,241
My social life consists of running
at superhuman speed and Netflix.

209
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,484
We are quite the pair, Mr. Allen.

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,764
Yes, we are, Dr. Snow.

211
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,805
There's an armed robbery in progress. Two
suspects. Male and female. In their 20s.

212
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,964
Sounds like our metahuman
Bonnie and Clyde are at it again.

213
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,083
Time to ruin their social life.

214
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,331
Just a few bags, baby.
Enough to pay back Marcus.

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,843
These things are heavier than they look.

216
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,203
Oh, I've read about you. You're the Flash.

217
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,683
I've heard you're real fast.

218
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,162
Let's see if it's true.

219
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,171
Catch me if you can.

220
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,884
I can. Unh!

221
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,569
You've gotta be kidding me.

222
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,611
Not too many men can keep up with me.

223
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,002
This is a bullet wound.
You're lucky it just barely broke the skin.

224
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,487
Guess I'm a lot faster
than a speeding bullet.

225
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,043
Shawna Baez. She can teleport.

226
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,043
As in, "Beam me up, Shawna"?

227
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,846
Yes. Of course. Quantum entanglement.

228
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,890
The ability to manipulate interconnected
particles over an infinite distance.

229
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,562
Or as Einstein put it,
"Spooky action at a distance."

230
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,209
Every time I got close, she'd disappear.
It was like we were playing a game of...

231
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,370
Peek-a-Boo. Come on, can't I name one?

232
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,925
How can I catch her
if I don't know where she's gonna be?

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,801
Everybody has limits, Mr. Allen.
Now that we know Shawna's powers...

234
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,684
...we'll focus on those limits.

235
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,411
All right. Let me know.
I'm gonna change. I gotta go help Iris.

236
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,691
- Hey, Barry.
- Hey, Eddie.

237
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,166
Hey, what are you doing here?

238
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,006
I thought I'd see if you wanted help
writing your story.

239
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,047
That is so sweet. I would love to, but we're
going to dinner with Eddie's mom tonight.

240
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,886
- And we're late.
- Can we do it another time?

241
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,326
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

242
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,124
- Great.
- All right.

243
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,129
- Bye.
- See you.

244
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,089
- Hey.
- What bars did Shawna and Clay frequent?

245
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,723
Uh, mostly south-side dive bars. Why?

246
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,051
I was just gonna check them out.
See if they fall into any old habits.

247
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,045
It's a good idea. I'll join you.

248
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,881
Everyone's wonderin'

249
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,761
Will you come out tonight?

250
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,606
Everyone's trying to get it right

251
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,807
Get it right

252
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,445
H9)'-

253
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,281
What?

254
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,324
What? Nothing. Uh, you look...

255
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,209
...really nice.

256
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,161
I don't always dress
like a high school principal.

257
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,883
So this is where Shawna Baez
and Clay Parker used to hang out.

258
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,969
It is, according to the files.

259
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,930
I thought we could kill two birds
with one stone.

260
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,765
Look for them
and get ourselves back out there.

261
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,922
You want a piece of my heart?

262
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,730
I keep making the same mistake.

263
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,248
Every time Iris falls,
I race to pick her up, thinking...

264
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,529
...that one of these times,
things are gonna change.

265
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,011
But things are never gonna change.
I am just destined to be just a friend.

266
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,570
You're not pining for someone who burst
into flames and wants nothing of you.

267
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,291
What is wrong with us? We're in our 20s.

268
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,804
We should be having fun.
We should meet people. Go on lots of dates.

269
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,087
Well, here's to liquid courage.

270
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,446
Uh... That is very fast.

271
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,849
- You drank all of it.
- Excuse me.

272
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,767
I would like to start a tab.

273
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,887
Okay.

274
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,081
C.C.P.D. confiscated everything
from S.T.A.R. Labs after the explosion.

275
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,044
Video. Audio. Traffic-cam footage.

276
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,884
Okay. SQ?

277
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,768
I saw Martin Stein the night S.T.A.R. Labs
went boom. He walked right past me.

278
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,922
You see, Stein specialized
in transmutation.

279
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,930
Molecular transmography.
Quantum splicing.

280
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,366
Taking two things and making them one.

281
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,047
Let's go to the videotape, shall we?

282
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,364
Okay, stop.

283
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,608
Now zoom in a few clicks.

284
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,565
Now advance it frame by frame.

285
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,243
His eyes.

286
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,007
They turned to white just like Ronnie's.

287
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,890
Now stop. There. In the mass of energy.

288
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,609
- Looks like...
- Ronnie.

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,365
And Professor Stein.

290
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,211
The dark matter merged them together.

291
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,131
Explains why Ronnie hasn't
seemed quite himself lately.

292
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,090
It's because he's not.

293
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,804
He's Martin Stein.

294
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,328
You can't say I didn't keep up
my end of the bargain.

295
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,441
I figure that makes us even-Steven.

296
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,045
Adiés.

297
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,970
Uh, excuse me. Could I get some water?

298
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,163
- Yo. Excuse me. For real?
- Mr. Barry Allen!

299
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,646
Come on down.

300
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,121
Or up. Come up here with me.

301
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,721
Oh, come show them what you got.
Come on.

302
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,810
Barry. Barry. Barry.

303
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,243
Barry. Barry. Barry.

304
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,563
Barry. Barry. Barry.

305
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,485
Look at him go. He's so fast. Ooh, shh.

306
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,689
I'm not much of a singer.
And you're not much of a drinker.

307
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,690
We are gonna bring this place down.

308
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,803
Okay. Just... Good girl.

309
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,924
Get ready.

310
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,643
Summer lovin'
Had me a blast

311
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,847
Summer lovin'
Happened so fast

312
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,005
I met a girl crazy for me

313
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,845
I met a boy cute as can be

314
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,929
Summer days driftin' away

315
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,367
To, uh, oh, those summer nights

316
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,170
Well-a, well-a, well-a, unh

317
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,204
You're fast and you can sing?
What can't you do?

318
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,402
Stop you from drinking, apparently.

319
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,126
I'm not even sure that was mine.

320
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,849
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

321
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
All right. Can I close out my tab, please?

322
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,888
Hey, Stevie. Can my friend here tap out?

323
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,809
Sure thing, Linda.

324
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,241
Uh, thank you, Linda.

325
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,445
You're welcome, Barry.

326
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,001
How do you know my name?

327
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,245
Barry. Barry. Barry.

328
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,280
Yeah. Uh, sorry about us up there.

329
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,606
Are you kidding?

330
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,486
No, that was some of the best singing
that I've heard come from that stage.

331
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,927
You definitely made my ears happy.
Don't worry.

332
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,605
Thanks.

333
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,327
So, uh, was that your girlfriend up there?

334
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,407
Oh, uh, no. No. She's a friend.

335
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,365
Okay.

336
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,730
Reel me in so our love can begin again

337
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,881
Hey, have you heard of this new phone app?
It's so cool.

338
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,289
Check it out. You just touch
someone's phone with your phone...

339
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,363
...and it downloads your contact info.

340
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,764
Wow. That is cool.

341
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,050
See? You have my number.

342
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,762
What you do with it now is up to you.

343
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,091
Okay.

344
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,089
- Barry, I don't feel good.
- Yeah?

345
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,682
Okay. Come on.

346
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,644
You Okay?

347
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,042
It's 80 grand. What I owe.

348
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,851
So are we square now?

349
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,961
Almost.

350
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,961
Heh, heh, oh.

351
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,606
Holy crap.

352
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,043
Glad you're impressed.
So are we cool now?

353
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,483
Absolutely. Couldn't be cooler.

354
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,610
Which is why I think we need
to keep working together.

355
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,485
With what I know and what you could do...

356
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,042
...oh, we could be
looking at a very lucrative future.

357
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,731
Police. Everybody down.

358
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,607
No. Baby. Oh, no.

359
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,771
Hold it right there.

360
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,484
Damn.

361
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,529
Are we still running?

362
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,722
No, we are here.

363
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,566
Ugh. Vodka and super speed.
Not a good combination.

364
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,802
Ha, ha. Come on.

365
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,685
So are you gonna call her?

366
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,405
Who?

367
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,406
That girl.
The one who gave you her number.

368
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,483
I hadn't really thought about it.

369
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,885
Yes, you have.

370
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,687
But I know you. You won't.

371
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,366
You'll let her slip
right through your fingers...

372
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,410
...because you think
you don't deserve happiness.

373
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,169
But what you don't realize is you need
a little saving too.

374
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,607
Little help, please.

375
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,006
Yeah. Okay.

376
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,444
There you go again.
Saving me from that evil dress.

377
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,846
Get in bed.

378
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,442
Did you sneak a peek at my goods?

379
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,685
Heh. I wouldn't be much of a hero if I did.

380
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,491
Yeah, but it's okay if you peeked a little.

381
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,684
You deserve a peek
for all the good stuff you do.

382
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,488
Drink lots of water.

383
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,689
Thank you for tonight.

384
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,371
I sang.

385
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,004
Anytime.

386
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,484
Hey, Barry?

387
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,485
Will you stay with me until I fall asleep?

388
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,368
Sure. Yeah.

389
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,806
Hi.

390
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,644
So loud.

391
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,040
Oh.

392
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,527
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

393
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,566
Let's just say I envy
your inability to get drunk.

394
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,649
I don't remember much from last night.

395
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,526
Yeah. That's probably for the best.

396
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,411
Summer lovin'

397
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,006
- Oh, God. That I do remember.
- Ha-ha-ha.

398
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,370
What's wrong?

399
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,520
Cisco has something he needs to tell you.

400
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,051
- Hartley's gone.
- He escaped from the pipeline?

401
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,685
How is that even possible?

402
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,844
I let him out.

403
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,205
Are you mad?
I can't tell with those glasses on.

404
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,086
I'd like to yell and wave my arms,
but I'm afraid I'd throw up.

405
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,170
Why? What were you thinking?
You know how dangerous he is.

406
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,408
Hartley said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

407
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,729
I told you to let it go.
I didn't want you looking into that for me.

408
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,201
I wasn't doing it for you. l...

409
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,928
I sealed Ronnie into the accelerator
before it blew.

410
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,481
He told me to wait two minutes.
And I waited, but he didn't come back.

411
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,483
And I can't stop thinking, 10...

412
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,047
...20 seconds...

413
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,844
...and Ronnie
wouldn't be like he is right now.

414
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,324
I've wanted to tell you so many times.

415
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,330
I'm so sorry.

416
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,889
So you carried that around
this whole time?

417
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,646
Do you know what Ronnie
would say if he was here?

418
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,648
He would say that you did the right thing.

419
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,727
It wasn't your fault. What happened
that night wasn't anybody's fault.

420
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,084
Come on.
Don't we have a teleporter to catch?

421
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,084
We do have a teleporter to catch.

422
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,251
And fortunately,
we do have a promising theory.

423
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,442
Take a look at this.

424
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,809
Now, this is the normal behavior
of the particulate that Shawna left behind.

425
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,209
Watch what happens
when we remove light.

426
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,529
Shawna can only become entangled
with something she can see.

427
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,764
- Take away her ability to do that...
- She can't teleport.

428
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,041
Exactly.

429
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,925
So we just need to get her into a
dark space. How do we do that?

430
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,130
- It's a valid question.
- Hello?

431
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,683
What?

432
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,686
Yeah, I'll be right there. All right.

433
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,450
What's wrong?

434
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,169
My dad. He's been stabbed.

435
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,161
Dad, what happened?

436
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,083
A rather stern reminder, I'd say, not to
poke around Marcus Stockheimer's business.

437
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,081
Dad, I told you to stop.

438
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,044
Your dad called me with more intel.

439
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,170
It helped us track down
Clay and Shawna and arrest Stockheimer.

440
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,921
I managed to screw up
Marcus' big heist too so...

441
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,003
You two kept working together
and didn't tell me?

442
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,801
It isn't his fault. I did it to help you.

443
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,685
You getting stabbed and beaten
is not helping me.

444
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,683
Look, I don't get to feel useful
very much in here.

445
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,925
So if I can help you for a change,
I'm gonna want to be there for you.

446
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Just like you've been there
for me all these years.

447
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,121
Yeah.

448
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,722
You said Marcus
had a big heist coming up?

449
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,961
Mm.

450
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,011
- Do you know anything else about it?
- Dad. Tell me who did this to you.

451
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,528
- It doesn't matter, slugger.
- You said you wanted to, so help me.

452
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,927
One of Marcus' boys.

453
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,730
Julius.

454
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,726
Okay.

455
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,851
What the hell?

456
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,565
Evening, Julius.

457
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,890
- How'd I get out here?
- You escaped.

458
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,608
When they catch me trying to escape, they're
gonna add five years to my sentence.

459
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,165
Ten, actually.

460
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,081
Unless you tell me where
Marcus Stockheimefls next job is gonna be.

461
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,641
Whoa.

462
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,041
Guards will be here any second.
I'd start blabbing.

463
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,486
Okay.

464
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,611
Okay.

465
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,362
It's a TDK money transfer truck coming
from the federal reserve bank in St. Louis.

466
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,360
Supposed to be millions.
Delivery's around 8.

467
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,803
- That's all I know. I swear.
- That's right now.

468
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,927
Got eyes on him.

469
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,402
Hey! Hey, what about me?

470
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,722
I think we got company.

471
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,287
What the...?

472
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,324
Okay.

473
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,885
Let's go.

474
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,042
I got this.

475
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,721
Why the hell do you care what we do?
Are you a cop or something?

476
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,524
Something.

477
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,525
Come on.

478
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,690
Barry, remember. She cannot teleport if she
cannot see. Limit her field of vision.

479
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,880
No.

480
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,323
He left me.

481
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,604
There any way she can teleport out of this?

482
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,805
It's impossible. It's one-way glass.
It's mirrored on the inside.

483
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,204
No one dangerous is ever
gonna get out of this thing again.

484
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,690
Shawna.

485
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,282
Clay left you.
He's out there and you're in here.

486
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,801
You know what the crazy thing is?

487
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,365
I still love him.

488
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,044
Cisco.

489
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,727
Crazy is right.

490
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,443
Some people are worth being crazy for.

491
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,927
I'm sorry if I was a bit of a drunken mess
the other night.

492
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,041
- Actually, it was pretty fun.
- Yeah, it was.

493
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,083
You know what?

494
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,887
I think everybody's been right
about you and me.

495
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,086
Both of us have been hung up
on people for way too long.

496
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,206
If what Cisco says is true...

497
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,166
...that Ronnie merged with Martin Stein...

498
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,930
...then he's not alive anymore.

499
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,243
Time for me to move on.
Find someone new to be crazy about.

500
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,722
- All right. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes. Sure.

501
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,762
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,804
That's for you.

503
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,046
I thought maybe you could
help me out if you're willing.

504
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,926
This is about the breakout at Iron Heights.

505
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,647
Clay Parker. He's still on the loose.
And we need to catch him.

506
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,604
Why are you giving this to me?

507
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,682
Because you're a good reporter.

508
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,767
And the only one I know.

509
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,204
You're not the only one who's fast.

510
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,123
- Hey, what're you doing here?
- Hey.

511
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,891
You came to check on me.
That is really sweet...

512
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,647
- ...but I think everything's gonna be okay.
- I'm glad.

513
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,851
- I actually am not here to see you.
- No?

514
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,202
No. I have a lunch date.

515
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,045
With who?
_Uh_

516
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,850
- Ready.
- Hey.

517
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,486
Oh, hey. You're our new stringer, right?

518
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,411
- Yeah.
- I'm Linda Park. Sports.

519
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,806
Iris West.

520
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,965
How did you two meet?

521
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,730
- It's actually a funny story.
- I'll tell you later.

522
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,644
- You ready?
- Yeah.

523
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,241
- See you.
- Have fun.

524
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,926
So an actual date this time. Good for you.

525
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,364
You didn't tell her
your dad's in the slammer?

526
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,482
No. I read in a magazine
that that's a big turnoff.

527
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,767
Smart.

528
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,928
Hey, did you see this?

529
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,924
No. I haven't.

530
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,210
The Flash.

531
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,047
I saw him once in here.

532
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,450
Watched him save Joe's life.

533
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,522
Joe told me about that.
I guess he was lucky.

534
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,960
Hmm.

535
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,924
Lucky Joe.

536
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,561
Strangest thing.
I get roughed by up Julius, end up in here.

537
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,448
Next thing I know, Julius is caught trying
to escape. Claims the Flash broke him out.

538
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,883
Won't be seeing Julius for a long time now.

539
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,371
Guess I'm lucky too, huh?

540
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,485
Dad.

541
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,769
If I was the Flash...

542
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,328
...don't you think that you'd be the first
to know about it?

543
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,405
Yeah.

544
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,970
Well, if the Flash were my son,
I'd tell him a few things.

545
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,131
First off, I'd tell him
it's a dangerous world, so be careful.

546
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,281
Then I'd tell him he's a hero.

547
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,286
And he's saving a lot of lives.

548
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,245
But the most important thing
for him to know, I feel...

549
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,451
...is that his father's proud of him.

550
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,801
Power grid's been going haywire
in this sector.

551
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,968
This system's so antiquated.

552
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,485
What was that?

553
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:13,244
