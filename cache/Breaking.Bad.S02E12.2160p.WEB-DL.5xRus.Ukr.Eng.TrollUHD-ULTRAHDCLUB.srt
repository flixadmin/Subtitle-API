1
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,279
Skyler, I'm so...

2
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:42,283
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

3
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:47,037
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:49,498
Is she beautiful?

5
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:57,298
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

6
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,091
Some accident up ahead.

7
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,219
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

8
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:07,391
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

9
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,476
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,327
Excuse me. Skyler White?

11
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:28,996
- 307.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,801
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...

13
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,678
Are you okay?

14
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,184
Meet your daughter.

15
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:04,698
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

16
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,867
Congratulations, Walt.

17
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:12,873
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

18
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,668
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:20,422
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

20
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,300
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over,

21
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:25,219
and deliver her himself.

22
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:31,392
Well, that...
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

23
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,477
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,021
No problem at all.

25
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:39,149
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can...

26
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,194
You three can be alone, okay?

27
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:45,030
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

28
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:48,909
- I really can't begin to thank you.
- Don't think anything of it.

29
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,078
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

30
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:52,787
- Thank you.
- She's beautiful.

31
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:54,415
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

32
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:55,916
Okay. Take care.

33
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,376
Bye.

34
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:08,429
Are you okay?

35
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:10,597
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is okay.

36
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,101
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:20,274
- Where's everyone else?
- Downstairs.

38
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,275
Hank and Marie took Junior for dinner.

39
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,572
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

40
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,699
- No.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:32,286
Did he?

42
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:37,207
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,752
- Anything at all?
- Actually, yes.

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,546
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

45
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,590
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

46
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:49,470
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

47
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,014
Doing it natural instead.

48
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:54,475
It just couldn't have gone any better.

49
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,185
Good.

50
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:03,651
Let me go get your things.

51
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:08,239
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

52
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,990
- I'll spend the night.
- Okay.

53
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,337
Dad.

54
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,173
I was in the shower, hey.

55
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:52,259
I overslept.

56
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,221
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

57
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:57,973
Yeah.

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,356
Baby, I gotta go.

59
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,859
Okay.

60
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,209
Somebody broke in.

61
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,002
Okay.

62
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,980
Oh, no. No, no, no!

63
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,524
Come on.

64
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,609
Damn.

65
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:55,030
Oh, God.

66
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,325
Oh, Christ.

67
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,623
This week was tough.

68
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,250
Toughest yet.

69
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,628
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

70
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:12,214
- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

71
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:14,425
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,593
I was scared shitless I wouldn't make it.

73
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,177
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,639
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,808
I know my boss was pissed.

76
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:26,020
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,528
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,596
All it would take is one friend,

79
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,359
and I'd be out ripping and running again.

80
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,695
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,865
I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:02,556
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,851
- You getting enough sleep?
- Actually, no.

84
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,563
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,232
- Yeah?
- A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:15,027
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:18,697
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,032
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:24,078
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:28,499
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,168
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,327
You need to avoid those type of people.

93
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,423
I know and I do.

94
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,011
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:42,930
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,016
Thank you.

97
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,856
So how's your job?

98
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,942
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

99
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,444
Doing backup training on my days off.

100
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:01,448
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

101
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:09,039
You seeing anyone?

102
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,710
No.

103
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,086
You?

104
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:16,880
What about that guy next door?

105
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,424
What do you mean?

106
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,968
Well, he seemed to have some expectation

107
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:22,776
of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,055
He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,890
Yeah.

110
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:28,434
Dad, he's our tenant.

111
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,477
End of story.

112
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,636
Why would I get involved with a tenant?

113
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,733
Okay.

114
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,485
There you go.

115
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,830
Oh, yes.

116
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,124
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

117
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,835
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

118
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:57,421
Yeah. And why not?

119
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,381
Good stock.

120
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,844
I'll get it.

121
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,346
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,349
Hello. Hello?

123
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,727
Nobody's there.

124
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:13,520
Oh, well.

125
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:17,316
Beat you.

126
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,860
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

127
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,528
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

128
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,280
Just Carmen.

129
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,117
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

130
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,703
<i>Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,289
Well, Holly.

132
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,333
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

133
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,086
Everybody is doing just fine.

134
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:40,144
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

135
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,383
I am trying to tell you, man.

136
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,511
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

137
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,179
<i>- I got robbed.
- What?</i>

138
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:51,892
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

139
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,811
All of it.

140
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,023
You get me, Mr. White?

141
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,317
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>

142
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,736
They knew exactly where to look.

143
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,829
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

144
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,076
<i>Mr. White.</i>

145
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,705
God!

146
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,374
Oh, no.

147
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:21,589
Okay. Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,889
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

149
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,142
All right. I just had to get a beer.

150
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,893
Finally.

151
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:36,687
All right, guys. Here we go.

152
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:40,691
<i>We got mild, medium and muy caliente.</i>

153
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,110
I got dibs on the breast.

154
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,447
- Los Polios Hermanos?
- Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

155
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,950
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

156
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,202
That baby is hungry.

157
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,787
Give me that baby.

158
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,123
Oh, sweetie, yes.

159
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,032
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

160
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,917
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

161
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:04,298
- Not at the table. We're eating.
- Hank, it's only a breast.

162
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,593
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- Oh, you are so provincial.

163
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:10,220
Hank, remember the day

164
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,848
when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

165
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:13,974
Yeah.

166
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,768
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

167
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:20,606
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

168
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:24,777
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would...

169
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:27,235
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

170
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,405
Oh, nice.

171
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,450
- Wow, that sounds expensive.
- Well, yeah.

172
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:36,330
- But for the baby, I mean...
- Well, why don't...

173
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,624
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

174
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,127
- Absolutely.
- No, no. Thank you.

175
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:44,838
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

176
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,715
We'll take care of it.

177
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,801
Back at work soon?

178
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,553
Since you're scheduled for surgery

179
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:56,016
I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:02,731
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,027
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

182
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:12,283
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

183
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,141
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

184
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,371
I wish.

185
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,630
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

186
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,377
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,839
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,140
I'll get her.

189
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:38,392
I'll get her.

190
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,237
Yes. Good girl.

191
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,781
That's a good girl.

192
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,242
My little girl, huh?

193
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,674
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,552
Come here.

195
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:16,555
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:22,603
Yeah.

197
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,778
Hey.

198
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,615
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

199
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,619
Let me show you.

200
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,664
Here. Come here.

201
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,751
Wanna see?

202
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:03,018
That's right. Daddy did that.

203
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,360
Daddy did that for you.

204
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:25,332
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,877
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:30,712
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,798
- Get out.
- No. You took the stash.

208
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,091
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

209
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:38,137
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:42,145
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something,

211
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,853
- and you were the one who took it!
- Shut up.

212
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,689
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,529
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:59,491
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,327
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:05,623
What was that, heroin?

217
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,667
Jesus.

218
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,670
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off...

219
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:14,048
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

220
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,342
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

221
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,053
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:24,224
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:27,937
Son of a bitch.

224
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:32,149
How much?

225
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:37,112
- How much what?
- How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:42,701
One-point-two million.

227
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,329
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,331
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,084
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,963
All right.
So where's my money?

231
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:56,674
What?

232
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,761
You are joking, right?

233
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,848
If I gave you that money

234
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,226
you would be dead inside of a week.

235
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,022
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

236
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,609
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

237
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,736
And the... And the meth.

238
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:21,282
You know, I could take it or leave it.

239
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,076
I'm clean, Mr. White.

240
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:25,869
For real.

241
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,301
Prove it. Pee in that.

242
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,345
- How gay are you, seriously?
- Pee in it.

243
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,889
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

244
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,435
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

245
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:51,937
No, huh?

246
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,722
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend

247
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:58,819
on the kindness of strangers to get high.

248
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:01,822
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

249
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,185
Not on her tummy, Walt.

250
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:34,146
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

251
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,982
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

252
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,943
- Yeah.
- Right there.

253
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,654
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up

254
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:46,617
I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

255
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,926
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

256
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,539
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, yeah?

257
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,042
Well, I think a towel will do.

258
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,631
Skyler, what is it?

259
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:05,886
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

260
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:15,312
- I told you it's not ready yet.
- Honey, just show it to them.

261
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,293
My God, son. That's wonderful.

262
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,919
Flynn.

263
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,505
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,092
SaveWalterWhite.com.

265
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,512
Well, I, for one, am telling everybody.

266
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:54,018
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

267
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,186
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

268
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,523
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

269
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:03,527
- See?
- But we can't ask for money.

270
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,655
Walt.

271
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,825
Okay.

272
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:14,079
I appreciate it. I really do.

273
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:16,790
Show me what else you put on.

274
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,922
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

275
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,132
- Just let him help.
- Skyler.

276
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:29,219
It's... You can't ask him to take it down.

277
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,349
- It'll crush him.
- Skyler, it's charity.

278
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:40,648
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

279
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,326
This is insane.

280
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,662
I have so much cash on hand

281
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,873
that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

282
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,335
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

283
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:04,493
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

284
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:06,090
I mean, it's...

285
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:07,925
It's insane.

286
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,178
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

287
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:12,972
What?

288
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:14,682
Gun molls.

289
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,850
<i>Haven't you ever seen White Heat?</i>

290
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,520
<i>Yeah, I've seen White Heat,</i>

291
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:22,772
- but I don't see how that pertains.
- Maybe you need a moll

292
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:25,650
more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

293
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,284
- Just...
- What good is money

294
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,136
that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest...

295
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:33,784
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

296
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,370
Out.

297
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,079
Let's see. What else is there?

298
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,582
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money

299
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,418
down by the rail road tracks."

300
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:45,170
No? No? Works for me.

301
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,172
Uncle Murray.

302
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,466
Oh, yeah.

303
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,302
Yeah, "Oh, many is the happy memory"

304
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:54,429
of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.

305
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,182
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago,

306
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:00,603
- "but he kicked it, left me millions."
- No, no.

307
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:06,066
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

308
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,819
No, I earned that money, me.

309
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:11,612
And now my son created his own website

310
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:15,743
SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

311
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:19,622
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

312
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:26,921
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

313
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,424
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

314
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:33,761
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

315
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:36,555
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

316
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:40,058
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

317
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:42,937
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- I know. I know.

318
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,564
You're thinking that I should be
funnelling money

319
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,848
into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

320
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,611
I am not going to have
my family think that some

321
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,988
mystery benefactor saved us.

322
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:56,158
Not some mystery benefactor, singular.

323
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,702
That would raise too many questions.
However...

324
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,955
Stay with me here.

325
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,706
Zombies.

326
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,711
<i>I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this Rain Man-type.</i>

327
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,298
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

328
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:14,426
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

329
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:18,055
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

330
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,891
This guy can hijack random desktops

331
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,770
all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

332
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:29,441
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000

333
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,987
little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

334
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,239
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop

335
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,701
all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable

336
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,830
from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White

337
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,165
cancer saint.

338
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:49,044
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

339
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:57,511
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

340
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:00,014
Not too much.

341
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,683
I mean, like, who is he, right?

342
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:05,603
I mean, first off, I taught him.

343
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,856
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

344
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,452
Now the cotton.

345
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,375
Needle?

346
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,714
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

347
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,552
My point exactly.

348
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:51,065
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

349
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:58,030
How much does he owe you, anyway?

350
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:01,742
Four hundred and eighty.

351
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:05,287
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

352
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:07,706
No, no.

353
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,251
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

354
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:13,254
What?

355
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,757
What?

356
00:25:17,258 --> 00:25:19,009
Thousand.

357
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:23,054
Not on your back, in case you throw up.

358
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,433
On your side. Sleep on your side.

359
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:37,861
And she's all like:

360
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,615
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

361
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:44,493
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

362
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:47,538
"I'm conversing
about life and death."

363
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,457
I mean, this here, what we've been doing

364
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,710
hell, Becky knows.

365
00:25:58,507 --> 00:25:59,925
Dad?

366
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:02,303
I overslept. I'm on my way.

367
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,152
Dad?

368
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,155
Dad, wait.

369
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:23,824
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

370
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,160
Dad.

371
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:30,831
Dad, will just wait? Let me...
Just talk to you for one second.

372
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:31,999
No, Dad.

373
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,501
Dad, come on.

374
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,506
Dad?

375
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:44,011
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

376
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:46,555
- Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
- Son of a bitch.

377
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:51,352
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

378
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,396
- Get away from me, man. Back off.
- Jesse.

379
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:55,755
- Jesse, no!
- Back off!

380
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,606
- Okay, everybody just calm down!
- What's with you, yo?

381
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:02,195
- Because I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

382
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,489
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

383
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,073
All right? I got civil rights.

384
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:07,993
Dad, no! Okay!

385
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:10,704
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

386
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,707
I pay my rent.

387
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,878
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

388
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:20,464
Look, as it so happens, we were just...

389
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,424
We were just talking about that now.

390
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,718
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

391
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:27,388
- If you would just let me.
- Eighteen months.

392
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:31,016
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

393
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,395
I backslid, okay?

394
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:36,355
Like, what?

395
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:38,566
What, you think I'm proud of this?

396
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,609
Like I do it on purpose?

397
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:42,236
Lying to me

398
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,406
shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

399
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,864
It takes one to know one.

400
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:49,941
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

401
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,746
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

402
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:55,833
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

403
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:00,921
Thank you for not being judgemental
24 hours a day.

404
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,009
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

405
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,095
Okay.

406
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,764
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

407
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:11,890
What are you doing?

408
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,727
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

409
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:18,731
- Dad. Dad, no, don't.
- Come on. Come on!

410
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:21,089
- Dad, no. Don't.
- I have tried 10 years

411
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:22,693
of love and understanding.

412
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:26,030
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

413
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,615
Dad, no.

414
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:31,201
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

415
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,663
- Dad. Daddy, no.
- No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

416
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:36,748
- I'd like to talk to somebody.
- Daddy.

417
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:39,584
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

418
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,768
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

419
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,464
- I want you in rehab.
- I'll go first thing tomorrow.

420
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:46,258
Not tomorrow. Today.

421
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:49,720
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

422
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:53,891
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

423
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:59,480
Daddy, please?

424
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:00,898
I'll go.

425
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,651
<i>Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?</i>

426
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,153
Tomorrow.

427
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,030
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:11,867
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:13,827
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

430
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,501
Tomorrow.

431
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,854
You meant all that?

432
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,233
I don't know.

433
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,861
I just think if we had enough money

434
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,365
nobody could make us do anything.

435
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,229
Oh, just let it ring.

436
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:24,899
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

437
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,819
It's okay, Holly.

438
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,238
It's okay, sweetie.

439
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:33,157
Good luck with that.

440
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,911
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some...

441
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,832
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

442
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,168
- What?
- It's one of your...

443
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:48,380
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

444
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,926
Oh, okay. Thanks.

445
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:55,262
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

446
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,683
<i>- This is Walter White.
- Hello, Walter White.</i>

447
00:31:03,854 --> 00:31:06,354
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling...

448
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,983
It's Jane.

449
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:10,110
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

450
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,695
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

451
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,825
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

452
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:18,684
Get somewhere where you can talk.

453
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:23,457
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

454
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,463
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

455
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:32,424
All Jesse wants is what's coming to him.

456
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,134
No more, no less.

457
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:35,803
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

458
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,661
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

459
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:45,437
<i>- He told you about the money.
- He told me everything.</i>

460
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,653
So, what is this?

461
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:56,490
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

462
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:58,783
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

463
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:00,327
Bring him what you owe him.

464
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:01,954
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

465
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:05,457
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

466
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,084
Well, I call it blackmail.

467
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:11,046
Dialling my number.
Talking to my wife.

468
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:13,322
And what's your end of this?

469
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:16,844
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

470
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:21,139
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him,

471
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:23,475
<i>and he will receive
every last dollar of it.</i>

472
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,019
He will, not you

473
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,854
at a time when I see fit.

474
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:29,523
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

475
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:32,443
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean...</i>

476
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,751
<i>- If you both get clean...
- You know what?</i>

477
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:36,655
I take that back. This is blackmail.

478
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:39,241
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher

479
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:42,077
<i>turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA</i>

480
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:45,372
<i>that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.</i>

481
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,337
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

482
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:00,429
Shit.

483
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:07,185
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

484
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:09,897
Send you outside to clap the erasers?

485
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,861
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

486
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:18,239
We won't have to. He'll pay.

487
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:20,824
And what if he doesn't?

488
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,910
Jesse, it's your money.

489
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:27,581
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

490
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:33,921
What is it, really?

491
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,507
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

492
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:40,261
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

493
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:45,975
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

494
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:49,436
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

495
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:57,444
I mean, he's my partner.

496
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:02,408
I'm your partner.

497
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,918
<i>The largest land animal in all the planet</i>

498
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:15,671
<i>lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society</i>

499
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,965
<i>led by the eldest female in the herd.</i>

500
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,970
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

501
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:19,276
She is finally asleep.

502
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:26,867
What you doing, learning about elephants?

503
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:41,882
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

504
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:20,713
Jesse.

505
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:22,923
Not you.

506
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:38,898
Nice job wearing the pants.

507
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,282
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

508
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,868
I guess you don't.

509
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:56,415
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

510
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:02,421
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

511
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,590
You are making a mistake.

512
00:37:20,564 --> 00:37:23,414
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

513
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,110
This is freedom.

514
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,155
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

515
00:37:28,364 --> 00:37:30,658
I can be anybody."

516
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,326
Who do you wanna be?

517
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:35,663
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

518
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:39,166
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

519
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,459
Right on.

520
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:43,837
<i>New Zealand. That's where
they made Lord of the Rings.</i>

521
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:46,924
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

522
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:50,010
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

523
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,179
And I can be a bush pilot.

524
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:54,974
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

525
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:59,270
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

526
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:08,195
But first, we gotta get clean.

527
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:10,454
And not because anybody is telling us to.

528
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:15,494
- We do this for us, right?
- Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

529
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:18,788
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

530
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:19,915
We're not.

531
00:38:20,124 --> 00:38:22,626
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

532
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,462
We're way better than that. I say...

533
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:29,508
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

534
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:34,930
Yeah, we can do that.

535
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,224
Definitely.

536
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,230
Excuse me.

537
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:53,574
What can I get you?

538
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:57,786
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.

539
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,544
Damn it.

540
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,090
Hey, honey.

541
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:12,968
No. I don't know what to tell you.

542
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:17,473
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

543
00:39:18,015 --> 00:39:21,393
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

544
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:24,480
What if we went up a size
and just kind of...

545
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:27,316
All right, all right. No, I understand.

546
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:30,527
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

547
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:34,406
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

548
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:37,368
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

549
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,203
Thank you.

550
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:41,455
God.

551
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:44,667
Well played.

552
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:56,553
They found water on Mars.

553
00:39:57,888 --> 00:39:58,973
They have indeed.

554
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:01,766
Don't know what to do
with that information,

555
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,311
but, hey, God bless them, they found it.

556
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,774
Oh, well, actually

557
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:13,696
they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen,

558
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:18,117
and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

559
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:22,663
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

560
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,665
So it's a...

561
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:29,503
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

562
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:34,633
- To water on Mars.
- To water on Mars.

563
00:40:37,678 --> 00:40:40,806
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

564
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:44,351
- Little girl.
- That's nice.

565
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,894
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

566
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:47,021
Thank you.

567
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:49,690
- I have a daughter.
- Yeah?

568
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,525
How old?

569
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,193
Old enough to know better.

570
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:56,030
Twenty-seven next month.

571
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:01,827
- You have other kids?
- Just the one.

572
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:07,499
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

573
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:11,837
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

574
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:14,423
But he helps out, though.

575
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:17,509
He's even changing some diapers
now, so...

576
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:20,930
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

577
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:24,725
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

578
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:28,187
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

579
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:31,774
So, any advice?

580
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:35,611
Having a daughter. Any advice?

581
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:39,406
No, not really. Just love them.

582
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:41,242
Just... Yeah.

583
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,995
I mean, they are who they are.

584
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:48,249
Yeah.

585
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:53,545
I've got this nephew.

586
00:41:56,423 --> 00:41:59,843
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

587
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:06,392
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

588
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:10,479
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

589
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,189
You know, that...

590
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:15,776
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

591
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:20,030
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

592
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,326
But of course, they don't.

593
00:42:26,537 --> 00:42:29,123
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

594
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,208
Family?

595
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:37,590
Yeah. Family.

596
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,801
You can't give up on them. Never.

597
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,054
I mean, what else is there?

598
00:43:30,184 --> 00:43:32,895
Jesse, it's me.

599
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:42,154
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

600
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:21,610
Jesus.

601
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,503
Jesse.

602
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:46,093
Jesse.

603
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:50,389
Jesse, wake up.

604
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:53,225
Jesse, wake up.

605
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:23,964
No, no, no.
