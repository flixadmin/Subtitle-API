Yeah.

153
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,483
If it worries you, look into it.

154
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,486
<i>[Steve]
"Look into it"? Right.</i>

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,368
<i>Nobody was looking into it.
Why would they?</i>

156
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,523
<i>Pablo's crew was turning up dead
all over Medellin,</i>

157
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,887
<i>and Jairo became the latest victim.</i>

158
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,327
<i>The terror that Pablo had spread
across the country</i>

159
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,008
<i>was finally back on him tenfold.
Los Pepes' method was working.</i>

160
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,401
<i>And you better believe
it was getting to Escobar.</i>

IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

162
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,521
[Carlos in Spanish]
What did you ask Santa for?

163
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,250
- [Juan Pablo] A game.
- Which one?

164
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,688
- [Juan Pablo] The Joker game.
- You think he'll bring it to you?

165
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,000
[Juan Pablo]
Dad?

166
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,050
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,731
Dad? Dad?

168
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,484
Pablo, my love?

169
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,203
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

170
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,282
Christmas without Christ.

171
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,926
Pablo.

172
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,609
I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

173
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,961
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

174
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights, Pablo.

175
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,768
[Tata] The children are staying here
and so are you.

176
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,081
[Hermilda] Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

177
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,767
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellin'?

178
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,127
[Pablo]
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

179
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,328
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

180
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,370
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

181
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,566
[Blackie]
Don Pablo.

182
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,924
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

183
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,731
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

184
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,241
- [low chatter]
- Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

185
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,326
- Thank you.
- Oh!

186
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,961
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

187
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,201
[woman taps on crystal]

188
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,410
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

189
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,931
How's it going, my love?

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,810
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

191
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,681
- Look, there's two.
- The Lloredas always treat us well...

NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN

194
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,250
<i>[Gilberio]
As gratifying as these displays may feel,</i>

195
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,971
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

196
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,362
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

197
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,128
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

198
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,725
Without a doubt.

199
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,922
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

200
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,162
What about Miami?

201
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,647
We buy time.

202
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,371
Let him think he still has control.

203
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,969
Until the moment we take it from him.

204
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,564
- [in Spanish] New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

[in English] Centra Spike
give us anything good for Christmas?

206
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,325
Well, Blackie's been getting calls
from Envigado.

207
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,683
The son of a bitch has got a girlfriend.

208
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,964
Here, I'll give that to Martinez.
I'm sure it's gotta get vetted.

209
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,804
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

210
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,090

[Berna in Spanish]
What do you have for me?

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,331
I got something new.

213
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,920
- Blackie.
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

214
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,891
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

215
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,681
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

216
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,410
<i>It's done.</i>

217
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,249
<i>[Steve] I didn't know how Los Pepes

<i>Not yet anyway.

<i>better and faster.</i>

221
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,481
All right, Blackie's had a girlfriend
in Envigado for a while.

222
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,891
According to Centra Spike,

223
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,760
the last known intercept
places her somewhere in this vicinity.

224
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,491
Yeah. And how's that relevant?

225
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,369
Intel says she's pregnant.

226
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,362
I know protocol is to vet intel,
wait for corroboration,

227
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,727
but I feel this one in my gut, sir.

228
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,649
Blackie's gonna show.

229
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,520
Los Pepes keeps getting the jump on us,
sicarios are gonna keep winding up dead.

230
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,489
This way, we get to Blackie first,

231
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,450
bring that son of a bitch in
and get something out of him.

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,084
Well, we could set up a perimeter.
No one walks in or out.

233
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,049
[Steve]
Collapse that perimeter house by house.

234
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,327
- [Martinez] Yeah.
- [Steve] Sounds good to me.

Don't fight with me anymore.

237
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,082
I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

238
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,083
That's harmful for you and the baby.

239
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,528
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

240
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,931
I'll find more later.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,288
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

242
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,284
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

243
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,681
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

244
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,651
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

245
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,256
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

What's going on?

250
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,890
Martinez gave the green light
to go after Blackie.

251

- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. Right.

Good evening, what can I do for you?

Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

Of course, with pleasure.

How's this for an ID?

Get out of the car and put your hands

That's correct, sir.

Miss, we need your cooperation.

Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

317

I told you. I haven't seen him.

Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

They're gonna do what they're gonna do
with or without me, right?

At least this way...
I'm on the inside and I can control it.

Mr. President, these men, the Castafios,

343
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,088
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

344
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,041
<i>Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.</i>

345
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,771
<i>And it will get even worse.</i>

346
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,491
<i>Colonel, I understand your concern.</i>

347
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,167
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

348
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,801
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

349
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,441
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

350
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,170
with regard to Los Pepes.

351
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,566
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

352
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,965
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

353
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,361
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

354
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,488
<i>It's our priority.</i>

355
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,087
I understand. Thank you, sir.

356
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,486
<i>[Steve] Los Pepes may have
seemed to be running the board,</i>

357
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,927
<i>but Escobar still had</i> a <i>trick or two
up his sleeve.</i>

358
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,368
<i>Remember! told you Ricardo Prisco
was</i> a <i>licensed doctor?</i>

359
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,001
<i>Well, he was.</i>

360
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,802
<i>And as such, he had privileges
at just about every hospital in Medellin.</i>

361

gunman he shot was recovering.</i>

What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

372

I say it was money.

The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

out of my mind.

And now? Hmm?

Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,803
What you're doing will have consequences.

461
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,566
That's why they're here. Right?

462
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,921
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

- Cali is going to want payback f0r...
- I know...

464
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,365
who my enemies are, Carlos.

465
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,282
And I can fight them all.

466
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,600
I know that.

467
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,931
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

468
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

469
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,009
Let me ask you something.

470
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,404
- Why are you here?
- Pablo...

471
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,845
For Tata.

472
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,641
Right?

473
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,362
To make her happier.

474
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,565
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

475
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,450
Have you done that?

476
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,168
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that...

477
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,407
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

478
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,011
My wife... and my children...

479
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,722

482
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,210
[in English]
Did you see this?

483
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,770
Reports of a massive bombing
in Cali last night.

484
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,201
- Gilberto Rodriguez's daughter's wedding?
- [chuckles]

485
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,044
I know of only one person in Colombia

486
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,282
with the balls big enough
to go after that guy.

487
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,089
Yeah, Pablo Escobar.

488
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,889
He had to have had a damn good reason.

489
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,885
I'd like to shift some of our resources
from Medellin to Cali.

490
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,962
Now's a bad time to deviate from Medellin.

491
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,486
Cali is trafficking
in the billions right now.

492
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,086
- If they get a free head start...
- You're not wrong.

493
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,447
But you're thinking about this
too logically.

494
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,530
The best thing for you right now
is to keep your head in the game.

495
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,321
Because right now,
the game is Pablo Escobar.

496
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,126
Right. Escobar.

497
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,524
I'll see you at the party tonight.

498
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,050
We could all use a few hours break
from this shit.

499
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,125
I'll see you there.

00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,731
Manuel.

[in Spanish]
Ma'am?

502
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,009
Take me to Mass.

503
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,601
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

504
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,489
Besides, you work for me.

505
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,041
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

506

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

507
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,450
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

508
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,525
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

Welcome, Ma'am.

512
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,845
Yeah, Bogota' is beautiful. It's a lot more
like an American city than I thought.

- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

515
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,651
[in Spanish] It's shameful for the country
to stand by while a group of mercenaries

516
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,930
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

517
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,127
It makes all of us look bad.

518
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,330
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

519
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,769
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

520
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,444
which is his responsibility...

521
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,601
Colombia will never forgive him.

Lovely party, Ambassador.

00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,887
It's nice we can pretend
we're all friends.

531

Believe it or not, the State Department
does the guest list, not me.

I can't wait to tell them
that he wants us to legalize drugs.

533
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,165
He thinks I should
publicly condemn Los Pepes.

534
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,450
They're criminals.
Their activities cannot be condoned.

Even if one does approve of the results.

Mr. President, I'm not one to bullshit.

Maybe that's hurt me in my career.

Yes, Los Pepes are an ugly business.

539
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,604
They're getting to Escobar.

540
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,522
That's all that matters at the present.

541
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,484
If I condemn them, I have to police them.

542
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,488
With politics and war...
the trick is in the timing.

543
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,851
Watch how they evolve,
how their actions are received.

544

And, uh, up till then,

Hmm. That's a joke. And it's funny.

Originally, Oregon.

You were in Afghanistan, right?

He was our guy in Afghanistan.

- He's in Washington now.
- You don't say.

And he told me the roadblock
was caused by the agency.

Something about an ongoing operation.

He actually said,
"That sounds like CIA Bill."

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,927
- Boss, come on!
- [screaming]

617
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,048
Let's go, boss!

618
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,721
- Come on!
- [screaming]

619
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,371
- Let's go!
- [shrieks] Carlos!

620
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,922
[sobbing]

621
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,011
N0!

622
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,205
Los Pepes...

623
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,766
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

624
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,686
the Castafios, the government, the gringos.

625
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,570
Let the bastards come.

626
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,009
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

627
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,768
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

628
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,286
Yes, boss.

629
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,804
Go for food and you go for firewood.

630
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,362
[softly] Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

631
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,722
I promise you.

632
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,449
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

633
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,169
[voice trembling]

634
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,845
[softly] Santa...

635
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,722
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

636
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,524
Wherever you are in this world.

637
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,925
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

638
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,209
G0 to Envigado for wood and food.

639
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,727
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

640
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,926
Got it.

641
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,808
This is all I could find, boss.

642
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,450
How do you open that shit?

643
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,204
Hlg0lo0k, boss.

644
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,004
[in Spanish]
This just came in.

645
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,122
Shit's getting real, Pefia.

646
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,569
[sirens wailing in distance]

647
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,851
- [Tata sniffling]
- Mommy, I'm cold.

648
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,210
She's freezing.

649
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,245
Put this on.

650
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,047
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

651
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,723
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

652
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,968
[softly] It won't be long.

653
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,251
Soon we'll be together again.

654
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,250
Forever.

655
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,930
[sniffling]

656
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,810
