1
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,085
What are they doing
with the bodies?

2
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,281
Get back to work.

3
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,359
No. I've been here
for weeks.

4
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,861
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

5
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:04,430
until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

6
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:06,365
You will know why.

7
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:10,670
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

8
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,171
Get back to work.

9
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:13,673
When do I get to play the game?

10
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,341
Game?

11
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,960
The game.
The Game of Faces.

12
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:21,380
You tried already.
You failed.

13
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,848
I didn't even know
I was playing.

14
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:25,267
Who are you?

15
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:26,952
No one.

16
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,472
Get back to work.

17
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:30,973
Who are you?

18
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:34,226
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

19
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:38,798
I'm from Westeros just like you.

20
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,551
Daughter of a lord
just like you.

21
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,388
Except I was an only child.

22
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,641
Heir to his fortune.

23
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:51,243
My mother died.

24
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:53,496
My father remarried
and his new wife

25
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,399
gave birth to a girl.

26
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:00,986
My stepmother didn't want any
rivals for her precious daughter,

27
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:03,055
so she tried
to kill me with poison.

28
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,324
I found out.

29
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,593
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

30
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:12,481
And my father was widowed again.

31
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:16,519
I've been serving them
ever since.

32
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,016
Was that true or a lie?

33
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,171
What?

34
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,006
Did you believe
every word I said?

35
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,429
Get back to work.

36
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:00,079
<i>Who are you?</i>

37
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:11,657
Who are you?

38
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,080
Arya.

39
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,383
And where did you come from?

40
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,885
<i>Westeros.</i>

41
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,008
My family home is Winterfell.

42
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,644
I'm the youngest daughter
of a great lord,

43
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:32,878
Eddard Stark.

44
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:34,513
He died in battle.

45
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,183
A lie.

46
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:40,286
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

47
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,522
Had to kill a stable boy.

48
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,357
Drove my sword through his back.

49
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,494
A lie.

50
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:50,446
I stabbed him in the gut.

51
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,015
<i>I tried to find
my mother and brother,</i>

52
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:54,683
<i>but I never did.</i>

53
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:57,119
<i>They were murdered
by Walder Frey.</i>

54
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:00,756
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

55
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,212
A man called the Hound.
Sandor Clegane.

56
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:08,347
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

57
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:10,382
He begged me to kill him,
but I wouldn't.

58
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,518
I left him
in the mountains to die.

59
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:15,020
I wanted him to suffer.
I hated him.

60
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,607
I hated him.

61
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:23,062
That's not a lie!

62
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:26,065
A girl lies to me,

63
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:29,568
to the Many-Faced God,
to herself.

64
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,754
Does she truly
want to be no one?

65
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:33,989
Yes.

66
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:41,997
I'm not playing
this stupid game anymore!

67
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,216
We never stop playing.

68
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:10,109
So, those villages
we were supposed to find?

69
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,994
We can't live on
berries and roots.

70
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,747
I can.

71
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,582
You're not hungry?

72
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,868
Of course I'm hungry.

73
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:21,453
You're an awful travelling
companion, do you know that?

74
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,706
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

75
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,391
I'm not your travelling
companion.

76
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:28,711
We are travelling together in
each other's company, therefore--

77
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,629
Do you ever shut up?

78
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,799
I sailed from King's Landing
to Pentos in a crate

79
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,302
<i>without ever saying a word.</i>

80
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:38,053
Why?

81
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:44,143
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

82
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,447
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

83
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:51,150
decided to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

84
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,153
I'm sure you visited many
brothels in many cities.

85
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,990
I killed my father.

86
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:03,879
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

87
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:08,751
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

88
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,946
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

89
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:22,514
at least your father
was a good man.

90
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:24,350
What do you know
about my father?

91
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:27,937
I met him.
I visited the Wall.

92
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:30,906
When I asked him about his men,

93
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,182
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

94
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:36,779
He actually cared about the
people under his command.

95
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:40,199
How do they put it in the Watch?

96
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,002
"We shall never see
his like again."

97
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,181
Oh, you didn't know.

98
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:04,556
I'm sorry.
I am.

99
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,394
How?

100
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,730
I only know what I heard.

101
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:12,948
How?

102
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,567
<i>He was leading an
expedition beyond the Wall.</i>

103
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:19,154
There was a mutiny.

104
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,473
He was murdered by his own men.

105
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:35,337
We better keep moving.

106
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:26,355
Valar morghulis.

107
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:28,490
Valar dohaeris.

108
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:32,227
I have nowhere else to go.

109
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:35,931
I've taken her to every
healer in Braavos.

110
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,967
I've spent every penny I had.

111
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:47,109
She suffers every day
of her life.

112
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:50,129
I just want it to end.

113
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,691
It hurts.

114
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:22,111
I know.

115
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:26,698
Don't be afraid.

116
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:30,152
I used to be like you.

117
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,321
I was sick.

118
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,591
I was dying.

119
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:42,131
But my father
never gave up on me.

120
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:47,336
He loved me

121
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,971
more than anything in the world,

122
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:51,757
just like your father loves you.

123
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,043
So he brought me here.

124
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:57,729
My father prayed
to the Many-Faced God.

125
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,067
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

126
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:05,137
It healed me.

127
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,335
I've devoted my life to him now.

128
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,016
You don't want to hurt anymore?

129
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,809
Drink.

130
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,092
<i>Is a girl ready?</i>

131
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:18,647
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

132
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:23,101
<i>Her hopes and dreams,
her loves and hates?</i>

133
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:25,937
All that makes a girl
who she is?

134
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,241
Forever?

135
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,780
No.

136
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:37,949
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

137
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:46,108
But she is ready
to become someone else.

138
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:02,441
Why Daenerys? Why is
she worth all this?

139
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:07,279
As I recall, the Mormonts
fought against the Targaryens

140
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,197
during Robert's Rebellion.

141
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,366
Do you believe in anything?

142
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,068
I believe in lots of things.

143
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:15,036
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

144
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:17,155
The gods, destiny.

145
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:20,409
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

146
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,911
No.

147
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,212
Neither did I.

148
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,631
I was a cynic just like you.

149
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,801
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

150
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:31,720
with three stone eggs.

151
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:34,556
When the fire burned out, I thought
I'd find her blackened bones.

152
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,677
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

153
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:42,731
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

154
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,853
Have you ever heard
baby dragons singing?

155
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:49,604
No.

156
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:52,107
It's hard to be
a cynic after that.

157
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,278
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

158
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,196
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

159
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:00,532
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

160
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:03,452
What if she conquers the world?
Then what?

161
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:05,754
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

162
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,789
First we have
to conquer the world.

163
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,708
We?

164
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,927
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

165
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:15,297
<i>She's ecstatic when you
bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>

166
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:18,517
<i>She hacks off my head
and restores your position.</i>

167
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:20,852
You command her army,
sail to Westeros,

168
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:23,805
defeat all your enemies and
watch her climb those steps

169
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,307
and sit on the Iron Throne.

170
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:27,609
Hurrah. Long live the queen.
Then what?

171
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:29,227
Then she rules.

172
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:32,447
So a woman who has not spent a
single day of her adult life

173
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,200
in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

174
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:37,786
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

175
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,656
Because her father, who burned living
men for amusement, was the king?

176
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:47,329
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

177
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,164
They probably
came ashore for--

178
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,666
<i>Water.</i>

179
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:05,013
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

180
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:15,323
Salt mines?

181
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,660
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

182
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:20,579
<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

183
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,415
What about the dwarf?

184
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,750
Worthless.

185
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:28,370
Cut his throat.

186
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:30,422
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

187
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,874
And then chop off his cock.

188
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,125
We'll sell it for a fortune.

189
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:36,294
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

190
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,713
Wait! Wait!

191
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,131
Wait, wait, wait!

192
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,767
You can't just hand
a dry cock to a merchant

193
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,302
and expect him to pay for it.

194
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:46,304
He has to know
it came from a dwarf.

195
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,658
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

196
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,443
It will be
a dwarf-sized cock.

197
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,478
Guess again.

198
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:01,403
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

199
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,581
Queen Daenerys
has outlawed slavery.

200
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:15,667
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

201
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,387
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

202
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:22,090
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

203
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:24,342
<i>The fighting pits in Meereen?</i>

204
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,345
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

205
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:31,316
You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

206
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,603
Him.

207
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:38,573
Him? He's got to
be 60 years old.

208
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:41,326
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

209
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,162
a bit withered,
been in the sun too long.

210
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:47,666
We can all see that. But he
is a veteran of 100 battles.

211
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,001
They wrote songs about him.

212
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,926
That true?

213
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:06,101
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

214
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,770
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

215
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:13,058
The Kingslayer.

216
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,478
Jousting. You're talking
about jousting.

217
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,863
A fancy game for fancy lads.

218
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:21,650
The men who fight in the pits of
Meereen will swallow him whole.

219
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,741
I killed a Dothraki
bloodrider in single combat.

220
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:36,665
Liar.

221
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:39,384
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

222
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:42,303
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

223
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:46,307
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

224
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,976
I'll prove my worth.

225
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:02,907
For my children.
Money.

226
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,580
Lord Baelish.

227
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,749
Yes?

228
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:14,119
Lancel Lannister.

229
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:18,256
Brother Lancel.

230
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,874
We abandon our family names.

231
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:21,710
Quite a family to abandon.

232
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:24,929
The city has changed
since you were here last.

233
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:26,848
We flooded the gutters
with wine,

234
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:29,350
smashed the false idols,

235
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:31,886
and set the godless on the run.

236
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:33,438
Well done.

237
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:42,113
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

238
00:22:42,148 --> 00:22:45,116
Should I send word
that I'll be delayed?

239
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:50,538
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

240
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:52,991
You'll find there's little
tolerance for flesh peddlers

241
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,576
in the new King's Landing.

242
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:57,462
We both peddle fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

243
00:22:57,496 --> 00:22:59,998
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

244
00:23:09,308 --> 00:23:12,644
Do you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

245
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:14,479
arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

246
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:17,348
The Faith arrested
the heir to Highgarden.

247
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,511
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

248
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:22,320
The king's orders.

249
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,439
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

250
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,391
House Tyrell won't
tolerate this insult.

251
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:29,527
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

252
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:31,529
I'm the insulted party,
Lord Baelish.

253
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:33,398
Ser Loras was promised to me.

254
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,416
Instead he chose
the company of boys.

255
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:37,771
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

256
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,040
Most curious.

257
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,377
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

258
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,413
Thoroughly repellant woman.

259
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:51,766
Forgive me.

260
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,768
I know you're still in mourning.

261
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:57,188
Lysa was a good woman.

262
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:58,523
A kind woman.

263
00:23:58,557 --> 00:24:01,526
<i>She was neither of those things.
We both know it.</i>

264
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,561
Still, I pity her son.

265
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:05,864
How fortunate the young
Lord of the Vale

266
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:08,199
<i>has a new father to counsel him.</i>

267
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:10,235
I know how hard it can be

268
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:13,071
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

269
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:16,073
If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights
of the Vale fight for their king?

270
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,494
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

271
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:23,448
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

272
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:25,283
Good.

273
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:31,472
If there's nothing else.

274
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:34,425
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

275
00:24:34,476 --> 00:24:37,178
Something so urgent I couldn't
trust the words to a raven.

276
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:40,114
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

277
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,067
To my shame, I failed you.

278
00:24:43,102 --> 00:24:45,403
But I have found Sansa Stark.

279
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:50,325
Alive and well and home again

280
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,826
living at Winterfell.

281
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:54,112
That's not possible.

282
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,497
My sources are well placed.

283
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,701
They tell me Roose Bolton

284
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:02,203
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

285
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:04,923
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

286
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:08,927
Roose Bolton is Warden of the
North by the grace of my father.

287
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,931
Indeed, his reward for stabbing
his own king in the heart.

288
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:16,351
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

289
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:18,803
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

290
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:20,722
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

291
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:22,690
than an alliance with
a hated southern house.

292
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:26,110
I will skin him and his bastard

293
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:27,979
like that wretch
on their bloody sigil.

294
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,814
I would counsel
patience, Your Grace.

295
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:31,699
Patience?

296
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,284
Sansa helped murder my son.

297
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,869
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

298
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:36,871
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

299
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,523
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

300
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:41,042
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

301
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,711
Let the enemies of the
throne slaughter each other.

302
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:47,115
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

303
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,634
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from here.

304
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:51,836
The weather has already
begun to turn.

305
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:54,772
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

306
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:57,225
while the victor
still licks his wounds.

307
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:01,312
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

308
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:04,682
My Uncle Kevan has all the
courage of a kitchen mouse.

309
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:06,301
Ser Jaime, then.

310
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:08,937
<i>Jaime's away on a sensitive
diplomatic mission.</i>

311
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:11,689
I have no idea
when he'll be back.

312
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,192
<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>

313
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:17,362
The Knights of the Vale are some
of the best fighters in Westeros,

314
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:19,631
trained to battle
in the ice and the snow.

315
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:22,533
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

316
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,786
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

317
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,372
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

318
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:29,557
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

319
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:33,011
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

320
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:34,762
What do you have to lose?

321
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:36,664
A brothel keeper?

322
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,216
And if you succeed?

323
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:40,385
Name me Warden of the North.

324
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:48,276
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

325
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,478
have him issue a royal decree.

326
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:53,364
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

327
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:55,683
And I'll know
you're a man of your word

328
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:58,736
when I see Sansa Stark's
head on a spike.

329
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,872
As I said...

330
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,857
I live to serve.

331
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,499
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

332
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,802
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

333
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:17,255
We've waited long enough.

334
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,507
I want you to be my wife.

335
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:21,592
Now.

336
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:24,512
What is it?

337
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:27,482
Do you want to marry me because
our families arranged it?

338
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,400
Or do you--

339
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:39,444
We can't.
Not yet.

340
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:40,661
Why not?

341
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,747
You know why not.
Someone will see.

342
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:45,116
You are going to be my wife.

343
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:49,203
I am going to be your husband.

344
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:52,790
We're allowed to walk through
the gardens together.

345
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,460
How many other girls have you
walked through these gardens?

346
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,098
I like the way your eyes go
squinty when you're jealous.

347
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:03,684
They do not go squinty and you
didn't answer the question.

348
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:06,154
They make a lovely couple.

349
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:09,357
A Lannister and a Martell.

350
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:12,810
<i>They have no idea
how dangerous that is.</i>

351
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:15,046
We must protect them.

352
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,048
Yes, my prince.

353
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:21,786
You haven't had to use that
axe of yours in a long time.

354
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:25,123
I hope you remember how.

355
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:27,825
I remember how.

356
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:34,041
<i># The Dornishman's
wife was as fair as the sun #</i>

357
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:39,163
# And her kisses
were warmer than spring #

358
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,115
# The Dornishman's blade #

359
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,450
# It was made of black steel #

360
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:47,955
# And its kiss
was a terrible thing #

361
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:52,209
# The Dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed #

362
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,297
- # In a voice that was sweet as a peach-- #
- All right, that's enough.

363
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,465
I'm coming to the best part.

364
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:00,467
We're trying to blend in.

365
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:02,553
Don't want everyone in
Dorne to hear your accent.

366
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:04,388
This song really is
all about the ending.

367
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:06,774
It can wait.
There.

368
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:11,979
That's the Water Gardens.

369
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:14,531
<i>And once we've got
the princess, then what?</i>

370
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:19,703
I like to improvise.

371
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:22,089
That explains the golden hand.

372
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,980
Unbowed. Unbent.
Unbroken.

373
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:48,515
For Oberyn.

374
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,517
For Oberyn.

375
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,342
Well, she's made
herself at home.

376
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:40,284
Myrcella.

377
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,705
Uncle Jaime?

378
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:46,740
I--

379
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,992
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

380
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:51,245
Let's speak in private.

381
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:54,081
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intended.

382
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:57,051
Excellent.
Good to meet you.

383
00:30:57,085 --> 00:30:59,053
We weren't expecting you,
Lord Jaime.

384
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:01,839
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

385
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,512
Let's not do something stupid.

386
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,818
That was something stupid.

387
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:16,403
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

388
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:18,522
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

389
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:20,274
But we have to--

390
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,163
Oh, for fuck's sake.

391
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,239
Take her!

392
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,627
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

393
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,862
I wasn't asking, princess.

394
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:25,255
- Ah!
- Drop your weapons!

395
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,766
<i>I am Obara Sand.</i>

396
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:38,185
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

397
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:41,522
I fight for Dorne.
Who do you fight for?

398
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,524
Drop your weapons.

399
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:04,878
When you were whole, it would
have been a good fight.

400
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:17,391
You fight pretty good
for a little girl.

401
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:46,303
Halt!

402
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,509
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

403
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,728
Well, why have we stopped?
Go on.

404
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:01,068
Rumors and gossip,
that's all they've got.

405
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:03,237
It's theater, nothing more.

406
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:06,406
If they arrested all the pillow
biters in King's Landing,

407
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:09,443
there'd be no room left in the
dungeons for anyone else.

408
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:11,361
Everyone knew
about him and Renly.

409
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:14,948
Renly Baratheon shagged half the
stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

410
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,833
Everyone knew, no one cared.

411
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,452
But he was the king's brother.

412
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:20,287
And Loras
is the queen's brother.

413
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,756
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

414
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,870
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

415
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,294
She wants to drag our
name through the dirt,

416
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,179
put us in our place.

417
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:31,298
Get some rest, dear.
You look appalling.

418
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,517
Let me deal
with Cersei Lannister.

419
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:43,026
Your Grace, I have
travelled a long way.

420
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:45,529
You must be exhausted.

421
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:50,701
Put the pen down, dear. We both
know you're not writing anything.

422
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:54,071
Ah, yes. The famously
tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.

423
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:57,124
And the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

424
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:02,412
I beg your pardon?

425
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:06,049
I know you're behind this absurd
incarceration of my grandson.

426
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:08,919
If you apologize for that
comment, perhaps I'll--

427
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,838
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

428
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:14,925
I was as shocked as anyone

429
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,594
when the Faith
arrested Ser Loras.

430
00:35:17,645 --> 00:35:20,230
I have no love
for these fanatics,

431
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:22,866
but what can a Queen Mother do?

432
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:26,103
Has the crown
suddenly stopped needing

433
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:29,406
the troops, gold, and
wheat my house supplies?

434
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,491
I can assure you,

435
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:33,527
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains--

436
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:35,195
Do you expect
the alliance to continue

437
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,948
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

438
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:40,334
As I said,

439
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:42,819
I didn't imprison anyone.

440
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:44,254
As for your
veiled threats--

441
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:45,739
What veil?

442
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:52,596
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought
peace to a war-torn country.

443
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:55,882
Do you really want to see the Seven
Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

444
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,554
I didn't trust your father.

445
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:03,223
<i>I didn't particularly like him.</i>

446
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:06,777
<i>But I respected him.
He was no fool.</i>

447
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:10,530
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

448
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,115
rather than destroy them.

449
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,368
House Lannister has no rival.

450
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:20,273
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

451
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,992
Just a small hearing
to determine

452
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:24,878
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

453
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:26,930
which I'm sure they don't.

454
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:30,450
Loras will be freed, our happy
alliance will continue...

455
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,088
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

456
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:38,425
Good day, Lady Olenna.

457
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,831
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

458
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,534
I don't pay attention to rumors.

459
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,904
<i>You were said to be
despondent when he died.</i>

460
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:11,475
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside

461
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,044
even as Stannis's army
closed in.

462
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:17,931
He was my friend.
He was my king.

463
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:20,383
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

464
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:23,437
<i>He was anointed
by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

465
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:28,024
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

466
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,611
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

467
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:34,114
I fought for him at the
Battle of Blackwater.

468
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:37,818
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

469
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,203
Why does it matter what I wore?

470
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:42,873
Do you deny all
the charges against you?

471
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,958
Fornication.

472
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:47,160
<i>Buggery.
Blasphemy.</i>

473
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:48,795
Of course I deny them.

474
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,881
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

475
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,866
Never.

476
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,051
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

477
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,703
Never.

478
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:01,675
That will be all, Ser Loras.

479
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,568
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

480
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:14,187
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forward.

481
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,189
You call me forward?

482
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,575
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

483
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,712
- I am the queen.
- You are.

484
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:25,182
And according
to the law of the Seven,

485
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:27,617
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

486
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:30,537
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

487
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:52,225
How do you respond to these
charges against your brother?

488
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,994
They are lies.

489
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:55,695
- All of them?
- All of them.

490
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,682
<i>Queen Margaery,</i>

491
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:00,233
<i>in the presence of the gods,</i>

492
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:02,485
do you swear that your
brother is innocent

493
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:04,404
of these charges against him

494
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,072
to the best of your knowledge?

495
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:08,158
Yes, I swear it.

496
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,661
Thank you, Your Grace.

497
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:38,939
Do you know this man?

498
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,492
Yes, very well.

499
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:45,278
<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,
heir to Highgarden.</i>

500
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,948
How did you come to meet?

501
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,617
<i>I squired for him.</i>

502
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:52,452
He took a liking to me.

503
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:55,664
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

504
00:39:56,707 --> 00:40:00,460
And what occurred
in his chamber?

505
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:04,965
We engaged
in intimate relations.

506
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,800
You lay with him?

507
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:08,385
That night and many others.

508
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:10,887
Liar.
He's a liar.

509
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,307
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

510
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,610
Yes.

511
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:19,529
Yes, Queen Margaery.

512
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:22,949
<i>She walked in on us once
not long ago.</i>

513
00:40:22,984 --> 00:40:25,652
She didn't seem surprised.

514
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:29,623
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

515
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:32,826
Why should the Faith or anyone
else take the word of a squire

516
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:34,494
over the heir to Highgarden?

517
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:36,546
<i>He has a birthmark, Your Grace.</i>

518
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:39,499
<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>

519
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,569
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

520
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:45,138
No! Liar!

521
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:50,844
What are you doing?
Let us pass.

522
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:53,346
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

523
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:55,315
to bring a formal trial

524
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:57,600
<i>for Ser Loras</i>

525
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:59,436
and Queen Margaery.

526
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:00,737
What?

527
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:02,822
Bearing false witness
before the gods

528
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:05,492
<i>is as grave a sin
as any, my lady.</i>

529
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:07,243
Take her.

530
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,996
<i>No. Tommen.</i>

531
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:11,781
Tommen!

532
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:15,118
You can't do this.
I am the queen.

533
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:17,837
Tommen!
Tommen!

534
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,373
<i>I am your queen.
How dare you?</i>

535
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,908
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>

536
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,594
<i>Tommen!</i>

537
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:49,986
What do you want?

538
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:52,872
Lord Ramsay sent me to
draw you a bath, my lady.

539
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,642
You want to be clean and fresh

540
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:57,716
for your new husband, don't you?

541
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:16,930
You're so beautiful,

542
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:19,983
but you need to keep him happy.

543
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:24,270
Ramsay gets bored easily.

544
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:26,439
You don't want
to end up like--

545
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:31,027
well, like the others.

546
00:42:31,078 --> 00:42:33,413
What others?

547
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:35,698
I shouldn't gossip.

548
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,334
Oh, it's good to see
the red again.

549
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,370
No point hiding anymore.

550
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:41,871
What others?

551
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:44,507
Let's see, there was Kyra

552
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,509
the blacksmith's daughter.

553
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:49,129
She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

554
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,633
But she talked
and talked and talked

555
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:57,053
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

556
00:42:57,104 --> 00:42:59,606
Then there was Violet.

557
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,142
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

558
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:05,145
But she got pregnant.

559
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:08,064
And, well, that was boring.

560
00:43:08,115 --> 00:43:11,785
Then Tansy.

561
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,453
Such a sweet girl.

562
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:18,658
Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

563
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,794
after a while, don't they?

564
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:23,129
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

565
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:24,297
Hunt?

566
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:26,166
Mmm.

567
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:32,505
Have you ever seen a body after
the dogs have been at it?

568
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,424
Not so pretty.

569
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:39,562
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

570
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:42,097
Why am I talking
about such things?

571
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:46,186
What was your name again?

572
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:47,854
Myranda.

573
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:52,692
And how long have yo
loved him, Myranda?

574
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,201
Did you imagine that he would be
with you forever, is that it?

575
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,417
And I came along and ruined it.

576
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:08,041
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

577
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:12,512
This is my home
and you can't frighten me.

578
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,104
Are you done with
your bath, my lady?

579
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:24,106
Go. I can finish
on my own.

580
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,084
Yes?

581
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,112
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

582
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:10,987
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

583
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,523
No.

584
00:45:13,574 --> 00:45:16,859
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

585
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:18,411
I'm not touching you.

586
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:22,248
Please.

587
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:24,250
He'll punish me.

588
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,788
You think I care
what he does to you?

589
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:48,835
Who comes before
the old gods this night?

590
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:53,456
Sansa of the House Stark

591
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:56,209
comes here to be wed.

592
00:46:58,379 --> 00:47:02,131
A woman grown,
trueborn and noble.

593
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:06,602
She comes to beg the
blessings of the gods.

594
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,556
Who comes to claim her?

595
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:21,451
Ramsay of House Bolton.

596
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:25,071
<i>Heir to the Dreadfort
and Winterfell.</i>

597
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:30,043
Who gives her?

598
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:37,500
Theon of House Greyjoy,
who was--

599
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:43,473
who was her father's ward.

600
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:49,312
Lady Sansa,
will you take this man?

601
00:48:19,093 --> 00:48:20,910
I take this man.

602
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:54,577
Are you pleased, my lady?

603
00:48:57,331 --> 00:49:00,366
Good. I want you
to be happy.

604
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:13,229
My father said
you're still a virgin.

605
00:49:18,852 --> 00:49:21,521
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

606
00:49:25,192 --> 00:49:28,444
Why are you still a virgin?

607
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,749
Afraid of dwarves?

608
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:34,367
Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.

609
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:37,970
He was gentle.
He never touched me.

610
00:49:39,606 --> 00:49:40,957
You're not lying to me?

611
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:42,792
No, my lord.

612
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:45,561
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

613
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:49,098
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

614
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:57,139
We're man and wife now.

615
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:59,225
We should be honest
with each other.

616
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,060
Don't you think?

617
00:50:02,062 --> 00:50:03,980
Yes.

618
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,825
Good.

619
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:19,912
Take off your clothes.

620
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:25,918
Oh, no, no, no.

621
00:50:26,003 --> 00:50:28,971
You stay here, Reek.

622
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:31,257
You watch.

623
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,339
Do I need to ask a second time?

624
00:50:46,406 --> 00:50:48,608
I hate asking a second time.

625
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:17,770
Reek...

626
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:21,007
I told you to watch.

627
00:51:26,747 --> 00:51:29,815
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

628
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:32,736
Now watch her become a woman.
