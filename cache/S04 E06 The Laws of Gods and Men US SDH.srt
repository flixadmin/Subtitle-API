<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,699
<i>( seagulls calling )</i>

3
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,039
( men shouting )

4
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,545
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that--

5
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,881
We've been here
since midday.

6
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,976
Easterners have
a difference sense
of time, I've often found.

7
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:09,063
Once I was waiting
for Salladhor Saan
here in Braavos.

8
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,774
Together, we were
going to run

9
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,402
three shiploads
of the finest--

10
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,465
<i>( doors close )</i>

11
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,765
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

12
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,018
Please, sit.

13
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,168
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

14
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,962
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

15
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,089
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

16
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,092
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

17
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,348
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

18
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,266
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

19
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,977
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

20
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,813
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

21
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,524
He shares no blood
with me.

22
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,860
He is a bastard
born of incest.

23
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,862
<i>As was his brother</i>
<i>before him.</i>

24
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,615
Yes, we have heard
this story.

25
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,326
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

26
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,830
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

27
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,748
A story about
a jealous uncle

28
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,543
whose attempts
to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

29
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:58,423
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

30
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,174
Gold you loaned him.

31
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,345
And you feel
your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

32
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,973
More than any man living.

33
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,184
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

34
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,229
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

35
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,732
and "blood right."

36
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,943
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

37
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,154
We prefer the stories
they tell.

38
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,239
More plain.

39
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,784
Less open
to interpretation.

40
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,873
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

41
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,207
4,000.

42
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,209
<i>And how many ships</i>
<i>do you have?</i>

43
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,211
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

44
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,922
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

45
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,217
32.

46
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,969
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

47
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,263
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

48
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:52,351
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

49
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,272
None.

50
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,900
You can see why
these numbers seem
unlikely to add up

51
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,529
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

52
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,948
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>we must respectfully</i>

53
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,077
<i>decline your request.</i>

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,246
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

55
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,381
My lord.

56
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,468
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

57
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,428
You would not be
either here.

58
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,555
In Braavos,

59
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,517
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

60
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,143
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

61
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,895
That would be the pirates.

62
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,440
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

63
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,693
This is the payment
that was demanded

64
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,070
by King Stannis
for my crimes.

65
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,447
I consider it
an honest accounting.

66
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,825
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

67
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,785
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

68
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,205
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

69
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,623
The war is over.

70
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,917
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,169
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

72
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,380
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

73
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,883
-<i> Tywin Lannister.</i>
<i>- How old is Tywin Lannister?</i>

74
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,345
- 67.
- 67. And when he dies,
who's in command?

75
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,639
A half-grown boy,

76
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>the product of incest?</i>

77
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,519
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

78
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,313
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

79
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,566
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

80
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,236
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

81
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,780
That is a problem
for another time.

82
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,117
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,412
There's only one
reliable leader left
in Westeros.

84
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,289
Stannis.

85
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,082
He's got the birthright.

86
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,042
He's in his prime.

87
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,961
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

88
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,172
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

89
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,548
he does it.

90
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,597
Saan:<i> The lookout</i>
<i>sees a pirate ship</i>
<i>sailing their way.</i>

91
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,849
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

92
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,726
"Bring me
my red shirt."

93
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,520
The first mate
brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

94
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,439
And when the pirates
try to board,

95
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,025
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

96
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,403
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

97
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,322
"Two pirate ships!"

98
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,117
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

99
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,203
But the courageous
captain hollers,

100
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,871
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

101
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,165
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

102
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,085
"Captain, why do you
call for your red shirt
before battle?"

103
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,670
The captain replies,

104
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,424
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

105
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,801
The next morning
the lookout screams,

106
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,262
"10 pirate ships!

107
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,932
- We are surrounded!"
- ( women laugh )

108
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,808
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

109
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,394
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

110
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,521
<i>waiting for his</i>
<i>usual command.</i>

111
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,524
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

112
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,151
Women:
"Bring me my brown pants!"

113
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,695
( laughs )

114
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,324
You think they ever
met a pirate who didn't
tell them that joke?

115
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,494
- Davos.
- ( chuckles )

116
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,121
I heard you were
rotting in a dungeon
in Dragonstone.

117
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,624
Only half rotted.

118
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,210
( laughs )

119
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,170
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

120
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,090
- This is Lhara.
- ( gasps )

121
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,800
- And this is--
- I am Lhara.

122
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,635
( squeals )

123
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,011
( laughs )

124
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,472
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

125
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,934
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

126
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,394
We?

127
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,646
You, me-- we.

128
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,648
( scoffs )

129
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,943
Once I thought
this man loved me.

130
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:33,072
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>he despises me.</i>

131
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:37,618
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold--

132
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,213
You won't be alone.

133
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,840
And you won't be poor.

134
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,142
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

135
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,935
I gave it to your wife.

136
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,105
( women laugh )

137
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,607
You're not my friend,
my friend.

138
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,568
( laughs )

139
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,320
I'll see you at sunrise.

140
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,199
Yara:
"I give you until
the full moon

141
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,536
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

142
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,874
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks</i>
<i>you call home.</i>

143
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,667
On the first night
of the full moon,

144
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,545
I will hunt down
every islander still
on our lands

145
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,464
and flay them living,

146
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,216
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,094
I found
at Winterfell.

148
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,681
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

149
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,392
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

150
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,562
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

151
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:50,232
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

152
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,485
<i>with more Theon.</i>

<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

<i>and Warden of the North."</i>

157
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,414
Yes!

158
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,249
Yara:
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

159
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,919
<i>and they mutilated</i>
<i>my brother,</i>

160

<i>your prince.</i>

161
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,590
<i>Your prince.</i>

<i>Everything</i>
<i>they've done to him,</i>

163
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,136
<i>they've also</i>
<i>done to you.</i>

164
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,930
Yes! Yes!

165
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,642
Yara:
<i>As long as they can hurt</i>
<i>our prince with impunity,</i>

166
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:29,855
<i>the word ironborn</i>
<i>means nothing.</i>

167
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,900
- ( moaning loudly )
-<i> ( metal clinking )</i>

168
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,114
<i>( Myranda moaning )</i>

169
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,619
( grunts )

170
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,630
Go left.

171
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,174
( men whispering )

172
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,847
( groans )

173
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,474
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know--

174
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,976
I'm here
for Theon Greyjoy.

175
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,436
Take me to the dungeons.

176
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,188
He's not in the dungeons.

177
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,943
( dogs panting )

178
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,785
( raspy breathing )

179
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>( door opens )</i>

180
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,712
-<i> ( alarm ringing )</i>
<i>- ( men shouting )</i>

181
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,298
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

182
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,967
( gurgles )

183
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,719
-<i> ( swords clanging )</i>
<i>- Man: This way!</i>

184
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,888
( barking )

185
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,228
( whimpering )

186
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,026
We're going home.

187
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,946
No!

188
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,911
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

189
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,996
You can't trick me.

190
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,248
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

191
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

192
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,752
Not Theon! Reek!

193
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,378
- Reek! My name is Reek!
- First mate:<i> They're here.</i>

194
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,922
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

195
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,757
Help me with him.

196
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,842
No, you can't!

197
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,552
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

198
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,515
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

199
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,809
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

200
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,022
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

201
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,983
-<i> ( dogs barking )</i>
<i>- ( Theon whimpering )</i>

202
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,868
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

203
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
( shouting )

204
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,923
( snarling, barking )

205
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,259
- ( groans )
- ( laughs )

206
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,885
Theon:
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

207
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,971
Loyal Reek!

208
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,480
Aah!
Theon!

209
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,621
Give me my brother
and no more of your
men will die.

210
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,666
You've got bigger balls
than he ever did.

211
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,589
But with those big balls
of yours...

212
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,762
how fast can you run?

213
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,851
<i>( cage rattling )</i>

214
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,397
<i>( dogs barking )</i>

215
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,026
Make for the ship, now.

216
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,861
But your brother.

217
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,863
My brother is dead.

218
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,332
Ramsay:
I have a treat for you.

219
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,000
A reward.

220
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,670
Reward?

221
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,005
Yes, Reek.

222
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,883
Those creatures
who came in the night,

223
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,510
they wanted
to take you away.

224
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,512
And you didn't let them.

225
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,931
You remained loyal.

226
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,852
I-- I didn't want
them to take me.

227
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,813
I was so scared.

228
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,982
- I didn't want them--
- Yes, yes, Reek.

229
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,160
It's a bath.

230
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,746
For you.

231
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,002
Remove those rags.

232
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,505
Now.

233
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,148
The britches, too, Reek.

234
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,817
Take them off.

235
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,009
( whimpering )

236
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,396
( water splashes )

237
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,838
( whimpers )

238
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,939
( gasps )

239
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,822
Do you love me, Reek?

240
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,247
Yes, of course, my lord.

241
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,542
Good.

242
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,669
Because I need you
to do something for me.

243
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,797
Something very important.

244
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,175
There's a castle, you see.

245
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,012
Some bad men
hold this castle.

246
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,307
I need your help
to take this castle back.

247
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,562
But how can--

248
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,108
I need you to play a role.

249
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,238
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

250
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,077
Pretend to be who?

251
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,871
Theon Greyjoy.

252
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,710
( goats bleating )

253
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,180
<i>( water splashes )</i>

254
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,937
<i>( water splashes )</i>

255
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,821
<i>( rock thuds )</i>

256
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,248
( roaring )

257
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,592
( bleating )

258
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,431
( roaring )

259
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,443
( Missandei speaking Valyrian )

260
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,018
( speaking Low Valyrian )

261
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,812
He is a goatherd.

262
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,608
He says he prayed
for your victory against
the slave masters.

263
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,152
I thank him
for his prayers.

264
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,196
( speaks Low Valyrian )

265
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,539
( speaking Low Valyrian )

266
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,503
It was your dragons,
he says.

267
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,006
<i>They came this morning</i>
<i>for his flock.</i>

268
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,843
( speaks Low Valyrian )

269
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,388
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

270
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,682
but now he has nothing.

271
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,101
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

272
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,813
- ( translating )
-<i> I cannot bring back</i>
<i>his goats,</i>

273
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:18,360
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

274
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,072
( speaking Low Valyrian )

275
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,294
Send the next one in.

276
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,138
<i>( servant speaking Valyrian )</i>

277
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,621
Queen Daenerys.

278
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,249
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

279
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:16,043
I thank you.

280
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,296
Mine is one of
the oldest and proudest
families in Meereen.

281
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,757
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

282
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,718
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

283
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,596
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

284
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,265
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

285
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,808
This pyramid included.

286
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,769
For that,
he has my gratitude.

287
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,729
I should be honored
to meet him.

288
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,230
You have, Your Grace.

289
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,940
You crucified him.

290
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,111
I pray you'll
never live to see

291
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,280
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

292
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,617
Your father crucified
innocent children.

293
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,245
My father spoke out
against crucifying
those children.

294
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,373
He decried it
as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

295
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,794
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

296
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,254
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

297
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,800
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

298
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,636
You'd be wise
to remember that.

299
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,639
What's done is done.

300
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,642
You are the queen
and I am a servant
of Meereen.

301
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,437
A servant who does
not wish to see its
traditions eradicated.

302
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,357
And what traditions
do you speak of?

303
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>The tradition</i>
<i>of funeral rite.</i>

304
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,694
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

305
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:29,241
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

306
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,368
are still nailed
to those posts,

307
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,746
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

308
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,842
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

309
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,010
so that they might receive
proper burials.

310
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,348
And what of the slave
children these noble
Meereenese crucified?

311
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,851
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

312
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,062
<i>Would you have begged</i>
<i>me for their right</i>
<i>to a proper burial?</i>

313
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,232
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

314
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:06,111
I can only speak
to you as a son who
loved his father.

315
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,697
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

316
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,324
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

317
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,826
and buried with dignity

318
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,495
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

319
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,377
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

320
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,384
Thank you, my queen.

321
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,230
How many more?

322
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,650
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

323
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,528
212?

324
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,497
Send the next one in.

325
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,043
These meetings aren't
always going to be this
early, are they?

326
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,879
I was up late last night.

327
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:10,175
So, does this mean
I am a master of
something now?

328
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,052
Coins, ships?

329
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,221
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

330
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,891
that I shall be
the Master of Ships
long before you--

331
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,648
Lord Tywin,
it's a great honor

332
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,234
to have been
granted a seat on
this council. I--

333
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,611
Tywin:
<i>The trial begins</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

334
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,446
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

335
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,948
Shall we begin?

336
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,741
Varys:
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

337
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,619
in the Riverlands,
my lord.

338
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,246
A coward and a traitor.

339
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,083
My birds tell me
the Hound slaughtered
five of our soldiers.

340
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,002
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

341
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,796
Disgraceful.

342
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,798
Tywin:
<i>What would it take to make</i>
<i>the common soldier</i>

343
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,967
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

344
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,636
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

345
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,514
Make it 100.
What else?

346
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,141
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

347
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,768
The Targaryen girl?

348
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,562
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

349
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,149
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

350
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,693
Conquered with what?

351
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,820
Varys:
<i>She commands an army</i>
<i>of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

352
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,863
Some 8,000 strong.

353
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,991
She has a company
of sellswords--

354
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,659
the Second Sons.

355
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,953
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her--</i>

356
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,373
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

357
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,417
And she has
three dragons.

358
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,751
Baby dragons.

359
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,920
Larger every year,
Your Grace.

360
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,173
Mormont is spying
on her for us.

361
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,593
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

362
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,596
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

363
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,057
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

364
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,101
a bit harder
than anticipated.

365
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,686
He's an old man.

366
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,730
He wasn't fit
to protect my son.

367
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,857
Joffrey didn't die
on his watch.

368
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,193
Dismissing him
was as insulting
as it was stupid.

369
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,196
Don't tell me you're
worried about a child
halfway across the world.

370
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,950
A child with two
seasoned warriors
counseling her

371
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,078
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

372
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,205
Lord Varys is right.

373
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,916
I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied
firsthand.

374
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,378
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

375
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,088
Less so in the bedroom.

376
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,758
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

377
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,635
Armies win them
all the time.

378
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,929
She must be dealt with.

379
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,057
How, my lord?

380
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,308
By force?

381
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,643
Eventually,
if it comes to that.

382
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,565
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

383
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,567
Most certainly,
my Lord Hand.

384
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,236
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

385
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,364
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

386
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,128
<i>( footsteps )</i>

387
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,303
Prince Oberyn.

388
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,680
Lord Varys...

389
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,975
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

390
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,603
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

391
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,647
And yet everyone does.

392
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,443
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

393
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,404
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

394
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,115
Five years.

395
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,783
May I ask why?

396
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,452
'Tis a big
and beautiful world.

397
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,247
Most of us live and die

398
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,957
in the same corner
where we were born

399
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,001
and never get to see
any of it.

400
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,421
I don't want to be
most of us.

401
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,589
Most of us
aren't princes.

402
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,511
( chuckles )
You are from Essos.

403
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,347
Where? Lys?

404
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,142
<i>I have an ear</i>
<i>for accents.</i>

405
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,060
I've lost
my accent entirely.

406
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,562
I have an ear
for that as well.

407
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,649
<i>How did you get here?</i>

408
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,317
It's a long story.

409
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,446
One you don't like
telling people.

410
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,739
People I trust.

411
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,909
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you
very interesting.

412
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,328
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

413
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,540
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they
serve here.

414
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,585
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

415
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,882
You did like boys before?

416
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,886
Really?

417
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,846
Girls? Hmm.

418
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,640
I hope you won't
be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

419
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,017
Not at all.

420
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,020
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

421
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,355
- What then?
-<i> Nothing.</i>

422
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,025
Everybody is interested
in something.

423
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,776
<i>Not me.</i>

424
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,029
When I see what
desire does to people,

425
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,156
what it's done
to this country,

426
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,076
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

427
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,497
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>the absence of desire</i>

428
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,625
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

429
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,376
Such as?

430
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,529
<i>( keys clinking )</i>

431
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,498
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

432
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,724
Really?

433
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,477
Father's orders.

434
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:58,481
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

435
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,823
( crowd murmuring )

436
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,785
Man:
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

437
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,001
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

438
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,711
<i>First of my Name,</i>

439
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,172
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

440
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,507
and Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

441
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,595
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

442
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,514
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

443
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:18,144
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

444
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,689
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

445
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,817
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

446
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,362
And if found guilty...

447
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,032
may the gods
punish the accused.

448
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,237
Tyrion of
the House Lannister,

449
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,491
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

450
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,828
Did you kill King Joffrey?

451
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,580
No.

452
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,916
Did your wife,
the Lady Sansa?

453
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,419
Not that I know of.

454
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,672
How would you say
he died, then?

455
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,799
Choked on his pigeon pie.

456
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,219
So you would
blame the bakers?

457
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,888
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

458
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

459
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,811
The crown may call
its first witness.

460
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,771
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

461
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,982
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

462
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,276
He slapped the king
across the face

463
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,778
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

464
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,321
( crowd gasps )

465
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,490
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

466
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,492
Right here
in this throne room,

467
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,454
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

468
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,456
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

469
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,458
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

470
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,626
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

471
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,462
he threatened
to have me killed.

472
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,839
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

473
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,467
- Tywin:<i> Silence.</i>
<i>- Pointing a loaded crossbow</i>
<i>at Sansa Stark</i>

474
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,469
while you tore
at her clothes
and beat her.

475
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,096
Silence!

476
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,058
You will not speak
unless called upon.

477
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,729
You're dismissed,
Ser Meryn.

478
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,738
Basilisk venom,

479
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,157
widow's blood,

480
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,451
wolfsbane,

481
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,828
essence of nightshade,

482
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,623
sweetsleep,

483
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,833
tears of Lys,

484
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,169
demon's dance...

485
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,129
( mumbling )

486
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,756
blind eye--

487
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,841
I think you have
made your point,
Grand Maester.

488
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,843
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

489
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,179
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

490
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,848
My stores were plundered.

491
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,266
By whom?

492
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,852
Pycelle:
<i>By the accused,</i>
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

493
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,522
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

494
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,899
Tywin:
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

495
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,152
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

496
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:17,490
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

497
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,076
Without question.

498
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,161
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

499
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,790
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

500
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,542
the king's fool.

501
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,504
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

502
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,383
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

503
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,928
She wore this necklace

504
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,055
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

505
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:44,350
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

506
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,271
and terrible poison
was found inside.

507
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,358
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

508
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,611
It was.
The Strangler.

509
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,282
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

510
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:03,578
And used to strike down
the most noble child

511
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,831
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

512
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,709
( crowd murmuring )

513
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,591
Cersei:
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

514
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,635
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

515
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,263
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

516
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,473
and you will know
the debt is paid."

517
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,977
Your own brother
said this to you?

518
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,106
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

519
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,527
I confronted him about
his plans to put Joffrey
on the front lines.

520
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,573
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

521
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,075
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

522
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,954
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

523
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,082
Tyrion said,

524
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,461
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

525
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,130
What debt?

526
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,924
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

527
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,634
in the Tower of the Hand.

528
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,428
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

529
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,222
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

530
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,099
He wasn't pleased.

531
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,729
Thank you, Your Grace,

532
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,148
for the courage
of your testimony.

533
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,291
Mace:<i> Do you remember</i>
<i>the precise nature</i>
<i>of this threat?</i>

534
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,835
Varys:
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

535
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,839
<i>He said, "Perhaps you</i>
<i>should speak more</i>
<i>softly to me, then.</i>

536
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,675
Monsters are dangerous

537
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,219
and just now kings
are dying like flies."

538
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,597
And he said this
to you at a meeting
of the small council?

539
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,974
Yes.

540
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,977
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

541
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,354
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

542
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,773
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

543
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,275
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

544
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,611
( crowd murmuring )

545
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,699
You're excused,
Lord Varys.

546
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,745
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

547
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,753
One.

548
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,633
You once said

549
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,345
that without me,
this city would have
faced certain defeat.

550
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,224
You said the histories
would never mention me,

551
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:34,061
but you would not forget.

552
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,605
Have you forgotten,
Lord Varys?

553
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,485
Sadly, my lord,

554
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,155
I never forget a thing.

555
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,292
We will adjourn for now.

556
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,046
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

557
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,590
Guard:
<i>Clear the court!</i>

558
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,393
( crowd chatting )

559
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,820
Jaime:
<i>You'd condemn</i>
<i>your own son to death?</i>

560
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,031
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

561
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,657
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

562
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,868
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

563
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,495
I know nothing
of the sort.

564
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,997
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

565
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,791
As did I.

566
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,460
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

567
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,296
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

568
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,799
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

569
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,676
- It won't be murder.
It'll be justice.
- Justice?

570
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,846
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

571
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,724
If Tyrion is found
guilty, he will be
punished accordingly.

572
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,727
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished
accordingly.

573
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,274
Once you said family
is what lives on.

574
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,193
All that lives on.

575
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,571
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

576
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,825
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

577
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,410
I'm a Kingsguard,

578
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,496
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

579
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,206
I'm well aware
of your oath.

580
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,041
What happens to your name?

581
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,753
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

582
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,672
Your nephews?

583
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,465
Lancel Lannister?

584
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,551
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

585
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,094
What happens to my dynasty

586
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,596
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

587
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,266
It survives through me.

588
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,687
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

589
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,356
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

590
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:45,359
if you let Tyrion live.

591
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,195
Done.

592
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,365
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

593
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:53,576
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

594
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,580
He'll plead for mercy.
I'll allow him to join
the Night's Watch.

595
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,001
<i>In three days' time,</i>
<i>he'll depart for</i>
<i>Castle Black</i>

596
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,878
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

597
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,589
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

598
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,507
<i>You will leave</i>
<i>King's Landing</i>

599
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,885
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

600
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,512
You will marry
a suitable woman

601
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,390
and father children
named Lannister.

602
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:20,519
And you'll never
turn your back on
your family again.

603
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,942
You have my word.

604
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,069
And you have mine.

605
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,035
<i>( bell tolling )</i>

606
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,803
Not going well,
is it?

607
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,264
- You're going
to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

608
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,309
When you are,
you need to enter
a formal plea for mercy

609
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,728
and ask to be sent
to the Wall.

610
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,480
Father's agreed to it.

611
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,358
He'll spare your life
and allow you to join
the Night's Watch.

612
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,069
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

613
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,946
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

614
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,031
Jaime:
<i>Father is not Joffrey.</i>
<i>He'll keep his word.</i>

615
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,741
How do you know?

616
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,872
Do you trust me?

617
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,336
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

618
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,380
This will all be over soon.

619
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,232
The crown may call
its next witness.

620
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:55,447
<i>( footsteps )</i>

621
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,643
State your name.

622
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,520
Shae.

623
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,731
Do you swear
by all the gods

624
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,400
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

625
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,153
I swear it.

626
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,071
Do you know this man?

627
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,915
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

628
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,625
How do you know him?

629
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,879
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

630
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,383
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

631
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,385
What do you know of this?

632
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,389
I know that he's guilty.

633
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,724
( crowd gasps )

634
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,893
He and Sansa
planned it together.

635
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,144
( crowd murmuring )

636
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,730
Tywin:
<i>Silence!</i>

637
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,232
<i>Continue.</i>

638
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,943
Shae:
<i>She wanted revenge</i>
<i>for her father,</i>

639
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,737
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

640
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,323
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

641
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,909
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

642
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,579
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

643
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,749
He hated you, my lord.

644
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,585
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

645
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,295
to put in Joffrey's wine.

646
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,006
Oberyn:
<i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>know all this?</i>

647
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,968
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

648
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,098
I wasn't just her maid.

649
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,602
I was his whore.

650
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:51,522
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Mace:<i> I beg your pardon?</i>

651
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,357
You said you were his...

652
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,317
His whore.

653
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,406
How did you come
to be in his service?

654
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,782
He stole me.

655
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,075
I was with another man,

656
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,910
a knight in
your lordship's army.

657
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,371
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

658
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,665
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

659
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:14,294
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

660
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,839
"You belong to me now,"
he said.

661
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:20,843
"I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night
in this world."

662
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,470
( crowd laughs )

663
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,140
Silence.
Silence!

664
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,474
<i>( laughing stops )</i>

665
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,268
Oberyn:
And did you?

666
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,562
Did I what?

667
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,398
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

668
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,816
<i>( crowd laughs )</i>

669
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,902
I did everything
he wanted.

670
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,113
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

671
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,157
Whatever he felt
like doing to me.

672
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,992
<i>I kissed him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

673
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,660
<i>I licked him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

674
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:50,038
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

675
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,915
I was his property.

676
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,876
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

677
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,044
so he could use me
when he was bored.

678
00:45:56,128 --> 00:46:00,591
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

679
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,011
I took his face
in my hands and said,

680
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,930
"I am yours
and you are mine."

681
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,642

682
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,019
Shae.

683
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,524
Please don't.

684
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,029
I am a whore.

685
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,698
<i>Remember?</i>

686
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,452
That was before
he married Sansa.

687
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,288
After that,
all he wanted was her.

688
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,958
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

689
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,086
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

690
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,130
<i>( crowd clamoring )</i>

691
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,223

I wish to confess.

693
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,563

I saved you.

00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,742
I saved this city

698
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,329
and all your
worthless lives.

699
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,749
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

700
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,585
- ( clamoring )
- Tywin: Tyrion.

701
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,840
Tywin:
Do you wish to confess?

702
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,097
Yes, Father.

703
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,015
I'm guilty.

704
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,394
Guilty.
Is that what you
want to hear?

705
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,396
You admit you poisoned
the king?

706
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,065
No, of that
I'm innocent.

707
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:44,152
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

708
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:48,574
I am guilty
of being a dwarf.

709
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,326
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

710
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,579
Tyrion:
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

711
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:58,542
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

712
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,460
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

713
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,212
Tyrion:
<i>Nothing but this--</i>

714
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,173
I did not do it.

715
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,801
I did not kill Joffrey,

716
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,470
but I wish that I had.

717
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,140
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

718
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,477
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

719
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,397
<i>( crowd clamoring )</i>

720
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,652
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

721
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,698
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

722
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,950
I would gladly
give my life

723
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,202
to watch you all
swallow it.

724
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,288
- Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.
- ( crowd shouting )

725
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,999
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

726
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:45,005
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

727
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,175
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

728
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,595
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

729
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:56,475
I demand a trial
by combat.

730
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,269
<i>( crowd shouting )</i>

731
00:49:21,833 --> 00:50:40,495
<i>( "Rains of Castamere"</i>
<i>playing )</i>
