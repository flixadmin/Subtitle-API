our job, sir.

- Well, you went way beyond
just doing your job.

653
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,168
And I know you did it
because of how much

654
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,337
you care for
the people of this city,

655
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,717
which is how I know I can leave
it in your capable hands.

- What do you mean,
leave it?

657
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,179
- The mayor's
offered me the job

658
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,975
as the new
chief of police.

659
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,183
- What?

660
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,560
- Dave.
- David.

661
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,437

Of course that leaves me

my own replacement.

665

As...as captain?

669
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,914
- Captain Joe West.

Oh, I like
the sound of that.

Yeah.

of both of us.

all along.

A supportive father.

all of those things.
