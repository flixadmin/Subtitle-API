1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,435
Jackie chan:
Uncle, how does this,

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:07,439
um, device locate
the scattered demon chi?

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,210
Uncle chan: Ancient
Chinese compass detects
energy imbalance.

4
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:14,780
When demon chi is activated,
compass picks up frequency,

5
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:18,050
leading us directly
to the immortal object.

6
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,485
Tohru: A reversal spell

7
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,086
will then draw
the bad chi out

8
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,056
of the immortal object and
into the containment jar.

9
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,891
Uncle:
Uncle getting to that!

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:29,495
A reversal spell will
then draw bad chi out

11
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:33,265
of the immortal object and
into the containment jar.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,868
Jade chan: So, it's your
basic demon chi-o-matic.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,470
Shipping and handling
not included.

14
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,607
TV host: On the next
<i>international island</i>
<i>challenge,</i>

15
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,543
2 more families will meet on
the polynesian island of boru

16
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,079
to face off in
a grueling test

17
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,680
of mental
and physical endurance.

18
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,817
Which family is tough enough
to be called the best

19
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:55,687
and take home a prize package
including 2 all-terrain
vehicles

20
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:00,759
and a flat-screen TV
with DVD and surround sound?

21
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,294
Jade: No way.

22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,430
Host: Which family
will avoid elimination

23
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:07,166
by earning
this amnesty idol?

24
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,143
Jade: Well,
that's a first.

25
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,512
A demon chi with
it's own series.

26
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,754
Uncle: Aiyaa! Bai tza.

27
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,724
Water demon chi
has been activated.

28
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,193
Jade: And that's her...
Zucchini?

29
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,162
Tohru: It's a gourd--
the immortal relic

30
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,698
used to defeat her
thousands of years ago.

31
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,537
Jackie: And now it's
on national television.

32
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,073
We must get to that island
before drago.

33
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,741
Jade: Boru, here we come.

34
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,777
I am so gonna kick butt
in that game.

35
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,312
¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh ¶

36
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,781
Jackie: We're not going to
boru to compete, Jade.

37
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,517
You will stay here
with tohru.

38
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,552
Jade: Oh, come on,
uncle Jackie!

39
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,990
I've seen every single
episode of <i> international</i>
à <i> island challenge.</i>

40
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,691
You gotta take me!

41
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,826
Jackie: Jade...

42
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,494
Jade: I know, I know.

43
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,830
I always have to play
the home version.

44
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:51,570
Drago: Ah, henchmen,
waste of time.

45
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,773
Excess baggage
killing my mojo.

46
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,043
Solo is the way to go.

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,257
Bai tza.

48
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,594
Ratso! Finn! Chow!

49
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,363
Never mind.

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,465
Right. Canned 'em.

51
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,813
Jackie: Keep your eye out
for the gourd...

52
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,482
And try to blend in.

53
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,919
Uncle: Uncle doesn't blend.

54
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,187
Jade: Hey, Jackie.

55
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,622
Jackie: (Gasps) Jade!

56
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,457
What are you
doing here?

57
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,758
Jade: Get serious.

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,594
Tohru: Uh, sorry, Jackie.

59
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,429
Jackie: Jade, listen to me.

60
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,966
I told you before
we are not here
to play games.

61
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,401
Rickie rothman: Of course
you're not, chung family.

62
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,903
You're here to win!

63
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,439
Johnny chung, right?
Rickie rothman, producer.

64
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,307
Nice to meet ya.
Love to chat more,

65
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,610
but you guys were supposed
to be here 2 hours ago.

66
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,612
We're running very late
so let's get you on the set.

67
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,313
'K?

68
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,450
Jackie: But we're not--

69
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,784
Jade: Worthy
of this great honor.

70
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,287
Rothman: Humble.
Nice touch.

71
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,055
Come on, people.
Let's move it.

72
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,357
Places!

73
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,598
Jackie: You're
making a mistake.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,533
We aren't the players
you want.

75
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,670
Production assistant:
Humble. Nice touch.

76
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,473
Uncle: Aiyaa!
That belongs to uncle.

77
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,074
Production assistant:
No luxury items.

78
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,076
Uncle: Give that back to--

79
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,445
production assistant:
And 3...2...1...

80
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,282
Host: Welcome to <i> international</i>
à <i> island challenge.</i>

81
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,616
Let's meet our 2 teams.

82
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,287
From Hamburg, Germany,
the dusseldorfs.

83
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,557
And from Peking, China,
it's the chungs.

84
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,430
Uncle: Uncle wants
his demon chi detector
back right now.

85
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,499
Host: But if one
of these families

86
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,368
wants to take home
our fabulous prize package

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,471
and the title
<i>international island</i> champ,

88
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:12,644
they're going to need this--
the all important
amnesty idol.

89
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,649
Win this, and your entire team
lives to see another day.

90
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,321
Lose, and you'll be forced
to vote off a member
of your own family.

91
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:26,525
So, if you're all ready,
let's get things started

92
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,661
with a little fruit punch.

93
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,230
Tohru: Oh, good.
I am kind of thirsty.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,069
Host: Remember,
to win this game,

95
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,971
each family member must make
it across the balance beam

96
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,542
without falling
into the slime pit.

97
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,877
Chung family, you're up.

98
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,584
Jackie: We need
to secure the relic.

99
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,753
We don't have time
for this.

100
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,688
Jade: They'll hand it to us
when we win.

101
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,824
Now, watch out
for the mangos.

102
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,025
Jackie: Yaa!

103
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,293
Aah!

104
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,627
Whoa. Whoa!

105
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,003
Greta Dusseldorf:
Aim for the big one.

106
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,438
Heinrich Dusseldorf: <i> Ja!</i>

107
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,174
Jade: Come on, tohru.

108
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,777
You're almost there, baby.
You can do it!

109
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,848
Heinrich: Game over,
mountain man.

110
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,385
Jade: Tohru!

111
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,387
(Tohru grunts)

112
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,222
Aah!

113
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,058
Uncle: Ooh.
That's gonna leave a mark.

114
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,963
Host: And the dusseldorfs
win amnesty!

115
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,798
Kids: Whoo hoo!

116
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,169
Host: Chungs,
I'll see you tonight
at the ejection ceremony

117
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,871
where one of
your family members

118
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,639
will be voted off the show.

119
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,674
Tohru: Sorry, <i> sensei.</i>

120
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,215
Jade: Tohru, listen.

121
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,583
You get my back,
I'll get yours.

122
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,385
Tohru: What are you
talking about?

123
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,854
Jade: Power, my friend.
If we stick together,

124
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,158
we can protect ourselves
at the ejection ceremony.

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,959
Jackie: Jade.
Jade: What?

126
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,294
We were just talkin'.

127
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,731
Uncle: Jackie! Bad chi
attracts bad chi!

128
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,467
Drago will be
on his way soon.

129
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,702
Jackie: That's why we have
to grab that idol,

130
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,671
find uncle's
demon chi detector

131
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,541
and get off this island
right away!

132
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,016
Jade: Relax.
They're not home.

133
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,284
Jackie: Unh!

134
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,020
Jade, go back
to the tree house.

135
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:39,624
Jade: Jackie, 3 words:
Flat. Screen. Television.

136
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,127
Jackie: How many times
do I have to tell you?

137
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,930
We must stay focused
on our mission,

138
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,431
not the game.

139
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,234
Jade: Come on. With
my brains and your brawn,

140
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,936
we can kick Dusseldorf butt,

141
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,238
score all those prizes,
and get the gourd.

142
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,007
Jackie: Shh.
Just be quiet,

143
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,144
and give me a signal
if you see anyone coming.

144
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,147
Jade: Great.
I love being the lookout.

145
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,216
(Snake hisses)

146
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,084
Jade: Jackie!

147
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,152
Jackie: Aah!

148
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,861
Jackie: Aah!

149
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,329
Jade: don't move around
so much.

150
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,231
You're just making it angry.

151
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,237
(Jungle brush rustling)

152
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,245
Jade: Hey...
Dusseldorf family! Ha.

153
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,647
Small island, huh?
What's the 4-1-1?

154
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,884
Dusseldorf dad:
I don't understand.

155
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,051
Jade: Tell me about it.

156
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,553
(Snake hisses)

157
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,489
Jade: Listen. Uh, I think
you should know that

158
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,360
I just saw
this humongo wild boar
in your supply crates,

159
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:52,531
and I think it stole
your, uh, schnitzel!

160
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,366
Dad: Schnitzel?!

161
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,168
Jade: Yeah. It just
ran off into the bushes!

162
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,071
Dad: Save the schnitzel!

163
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,545
Jade: Jackie, they're gone.

164
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,814
Jackie:
That's a relief. Unh.

165
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,623
Jade: Whoa. Double trouble.

166
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,994
They're back.

167
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:27,098
Jackie:
Unh. Maybe we are going
about this the wrong way.

168
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,368
Why don't we just talk to them
and ask for the idol?

169
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,504
I'm sure they are
reasonable people.

170
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,973
Hello, Dusseldorf family.

171
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,142
I need to have
a word with you.

172
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,345
Now I know this is going
to be hard to believe.

173
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,981
But the amnesty idol
you have

174
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,017
contains traces
of ancient water demon chi

175
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,119
that must be contained
to protect the earth

176
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,788
from the forces of darkness.

177
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,257
So if you will please
give me the idol,

178
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,926
my uncle will cast a spell
to remove the chi,

179
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,128
and all will be well.
Heh heh.

180
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,132
Jade: Nice try, champ.

181
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,202
Host: As you know, chungs,

182
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,804
this is
the ejection ceremony

183
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,840
meaning one of you
will be going home tonight.

184
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,275
The process is simple.

185
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,743
The person
with the most votes

186
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,612
must leave the island
immediately.

187
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,080
Let's begin.

188
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,857
Jade: It's nothing personal,
dude.

189
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,426
Uncle: Uncle
has been bamboozled!

190
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,962
Jade, we had a deal!

191
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,968
Uncle: Uncle not ready
to leave!

192
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,004
Production assistant:
Sorry, show policy.

193
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,605
Uncle: What about
personal property?

194
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,040
Production assistant:
We ship it.

195
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,441
You should get it
in about a week.

196
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,644
Ha ha. Or 6.

197
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,845
Uncle: Aieeya!

198
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,080
No helicopter!

199
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,516
Man-made bird
cannot be trusted!

200
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,084
(Gasps)

201
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,886
Production assistant:
There is nothing
to worry about, sir.

202
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,788
It's perfectly safe.

203
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,591
Uncle: No. Uncle
not meant to fly.

204
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,793
Do you see wings on uncle?

205
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:05,930
Production assistant:
Ok, ok, please calm down, sir.

206
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,132
Tell you what.

207
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,733
There's a supply boat
coming in the morning.

208
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,268
You can spend the night here

209
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,537
and take the boat
back to the mainland.

210
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,905
Does that sound better?

211
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,648
Production assistant:
So I'll come get you
in the morning, ok?

212
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,116
Uncle: Bring bagels.

213
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,999
(Doorknob rattles)

214
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,508
(Uncle snores)

215
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,919
Cruise director: The ship
will be arriving in port
in 10 minutes.

216
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:04,723
We hope you all enjoy
your polynesian adventure
on boru this afternoon.

217
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,260
But hurry back because
mambo madness begins
at 4:00 sharp.

218
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,197
Drago: Ah.

219
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,364
(Hisses)

220
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:22,340
Drago: This time,
the chi's all mine.

221
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,678
Host: Ok, everybody.
New day, new opportunity
for amnesty.

222
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,313
So who's
- up for a quick bite?

223
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,881
Because each family member

224
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,016
must eat everything
on their plate.

225
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,952
But if you lose
your breakfast,

226
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,321
your family loses
the competition.

227
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,791
So open wide,
and down the hatch.

228
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,328
Jackie: We must win this event
and get that idol.

229
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,830
Jade: don't talk to me.
Talk to coconut.

230
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,859
Heinrich: Ah! Unh! Unh!
(Vomits)

231
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,127
(Tohru laughs)

232
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,098
(Jade gulps)
Flat screen TV,
here I come.

233
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,070
Jade: Mmph!
(Vomits)

234
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,839
Uncle: Aieeya!

235
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:31,643
No boat! Uncle gets seasick
at aquarium!

236
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,179
Production assistant:
Nothing to worry about.

237
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,481
Just keep your eyes
on the horizon

238
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,149
and you'll be fine.

239
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,985
Uncle: Uncle needs
his personal property.

240
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,488
Production assistant:
Underneath your seat.

241
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,589
Hit it, frank!

242
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,291
(Frank guns engine)

243
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,206
Host: Because neither team
could keep their
breakfast down,

244
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,641
you'll have to compete
in a tiebreaker round--

245
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,610
the ultimate tropical test

246
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,246
of physical strength
and endurance.

247
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,081
Jade: Bring it on.
(Heinrich laughs)

248
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,417
Host: On your mark...

249
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,986
Get set...

250
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,321
Go!

251
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,210
Tohru: Boaah!

252
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,947
(Heinrich laughs)

253
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,289
Jackie: Aah!

254
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,892
Unh! Unh! Aah!

255
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,393
Host: Ah.

256
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,205
(Heinrich and
mom Dusseldorf grunt)

257
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,209
Jade: Yes.

258
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,189
Heinrich: Unh!

259
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,127
Dad: Eeeaah! Aah!

260
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,528
Heinrich: Oof!

261
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,197
Jade: Whoo hoo!

262
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:41,773
Jade: I win! I win!
I win! I win! I--

263
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,075
(drago laughs)

264
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,477
That's where you're wrong,
shortstop.

265
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,646
I win.

266
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,117
(Drago laughs)

267
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,162
Jackie: Aah! Hot sand!
Hot sand! Hot sand!

268
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,627
Jackie: This is not good.

269
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,468
Dad: Who is that?

270
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,203
What is going on here?

271
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,206
Host: Uh, this isn't
in my script.

272
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,342
Drago: Water,
water, everywhere,

273
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,811
and more than
an ocean to drink.

274
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,146
Jackie: We need uncle!

275
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,181
Tohru, take Jade
and find him.

276
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,050
I'll keep drago busy.

277
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,989
Jackie: Nice trick, drago.

278
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,424
But if you ask me,

279
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,893
your act is still all wet.

280
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,063
Drago: Nobody likes
a critic, chan.

281
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,887
Jade: Jackie!

282
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,056
Tohru: <i> Sensei</i>
àis not on the island!

283
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,333
Uncle: You hoo!
Water boy!

284
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,202
Tohru: <i> Sensei!</i>

285
00:17:52,838 --> 00:18:01,479
(Uncle yells the reversal
spell in Chinese)

286
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,692
(Uncle coughs)

287
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,696
(Captain grumbles)

288
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,877
Jackie: Uh, those were
amazing special effects.

289
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,646
Rothman: Special effects?

290
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,048
Jade: Uh, yeah.

291
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,483
I don't know
how you guys do it

292
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,084
week in and week out.

293
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:43,054
Rothman: Uh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, it was

294
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,123
quite a piece
of television magic,

295
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,058
if I do say so myself.

296
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,194
Host: Well, nobody told me
about the Tsunami.

297
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,662
Rothman: You're the host,
pretty boy.

298
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,498
You're not in the loop
on everything.

299
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,201
Jade: Flat screen TV,
here I come.

300
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,203
Rothman: Chungs,
you're disqualified.

301
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,438
Jade: What?

302
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,006
Rothman: Your rejected
family member

303
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,909
returned to the competition.

304
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,245
Dusseldorfs, you win!

305
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,181
(Dusseldorfs cheer)

306
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,686
Jade: What? Did you wanna
gloat or something?

307
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,022
Heinrich: May I write you?

308
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,725
Jade: I'm in the book.

309
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,765
Jackie: Jade,
do not be upset.

310
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,268
We captured the demon chi.

311
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,370
Jade: Uh, can I watch
cartoons on it?

312
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,872
I don't think so.

313
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,674
Tohru: <i> Sensei,</i>
àwhy did you not

314
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,143
remove drago's
fire power, too?

315
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,747
Uncle: Fire attached like
strong glue to drago's spirit.

316
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:46,450
It will take much bigger
magic to remove.

317
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,720
Jade: Speaking of scale-face,
where did he go?

318
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,627
Buoy dings,
seagull cries)

319
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,334
Jade: Hey Jackie, what
was your favourite thing about
being a kid?

320
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,671
Jackie: Being a kid.
Sometime, when I look
at a kid,

321
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,372
I really say,
"what are they thinking?"

322
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,576
They are not worried about
pay the bills,

323
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,345
the car bill,
the house mortgage.

324
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,646
Sometimes,
I really want to--

325
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,883
yes. I want to go back. Boom!
Become a small baby.

326
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,585
I don't want
to worry tomorrow

327
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,053
what kind of
stunt I'm gonna do,

328
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,055
what kind
of action sequence.

329
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,090
I have to choreograph
all action sequence.

330
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,359
That sometimes
really makes me worry.

331
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,095
That's what's good
about children, yeah.
