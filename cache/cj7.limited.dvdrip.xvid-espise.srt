1
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,704
Good morning, sir!

2
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,854
Dicky Chow!

3
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,727
Just look at yourself.
You're covered in dirt.

4
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,093
- I just...
- Don't move!

5
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,860
And don't give me the usual routine.

6
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,796
Why are you always so untidy?

7
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,540
What's the matter, Mr. Cao?

8
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,708
Explain yourself!

9
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,977
Let me talk to him.

10
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,949
Where did the dirt come from, Dicky?

11
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:35,317
Well, on my way to school,
I slipped and fell over.

12
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,381
Don't your mom or dad
bring you to school?

13
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,626
Mom died a long time ago
and Dad's very busy.

14
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,123
What does your dad do?

15
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:45,625
He's a coolie.

16
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,804
I'd like to meet him one day.
Would that be possible?

17
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,344
I don't think he has the time.

18
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,904
When he's available, then.
Will you let me know?

19
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,175
Go clean up before class starts.

20
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:08,182
Thanks, Miss Yuen.

21
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,021
I want to be a superstar.

22
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,788
- Like who?
- Nicole Kidman.

23
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:22,158
She gets $20 million for a movie.

24
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,427
I wouldn't mind being her either.

25
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,967
I want to be an entrepreneur.

26
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:28,530
What kind of business?

27
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,006
Any kind, as long as it's really big.

28
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,475
Big business always pays out.

29
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,871
Why not?

30
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,117
I want to be a poor person.

31
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,391
Stop!

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,026
My dad says
if you have integrity...

33
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,398
...don't bullshit, don't fight,
and study really hard...

34
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,701
...then people will respect you
even if you're poor.

35
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,226
Don't...

36
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,495
Don't come over here!

37
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,995
Put it down!

38
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,599
Go back to your seat!

39
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:04,526
The name of this amazing dog is CJ1.

40
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:09,696
It was developed jointly by U.S.,
French and German scientists.

41
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,427
Imagine! Jointly developed!

42
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,299
- Do you want a go?
- Yes, please.

43
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,372
Back off, loser!

44
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,979
There are only two in the world.

45
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,345
The U.S. President's daughter
has the other one.

46
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,451
- What are you doing?
- Eating noodles.

47
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,123
Stand up!

48
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:37,459
No matter how much you eat,
you are doomed to be a dwarf.

49
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,290
Now get lost!

50
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:44,162
The quality of the students
in this place gets worse every day.

51
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,567
What have we here, another alien?

52
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,566
- What are you doing?
- Eating rice.

53
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,871
You're just like a huge tub of lard.

54
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,378
Maybe you should
go see the doctor.

55
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,178
You eat so much.
It's horrible!

56
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:05,755
Someone call the police
to shoot this monster!

57
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,722
Eat to death! Giant monster!

58
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:09,985
What are you doing?

59
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,128
Bullies! Heroes don't hit women.

60
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,672
Not you again!

61
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,275
Ignore him.

62
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:29,577
Go away, poor boy.
We don't want you around.

63
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,950
Go away, poor boy.

64
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,930
Hi.

65
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,465
Hi.

66
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,629
You've been sent off the field too?

67
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,702
Yes.

68
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,401
Did you forget your sneakers?

69
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:04,213
I brought them,
but I didn't wear them on purpose.

70
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,644
Why?

71
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,747
Because I wanted to be with you.

72
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,228
Are all your shoes like that?

73
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:24,231
Yes, they are.
My dad gets them from the dump.

74
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,403
Your dad's so nice.

75
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,004
He is, actually.

76
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,499
But I so much want a new pair...

77
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,838
...because I really love sports.

78
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,213
I'd like you to keep the old ones.

79
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,611
Why?

80
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,950
Then we'd be punished together,
forever.

81
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,641
Get that panel up there.

82
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,968
Quickly!

83
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,874
You. Hurry up.

84
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,996
You're no longer needed. Go home.

85
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:26,995
Hey, boss?

86
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,733
With it being so hot right now,
my son can't sleep.

87
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,666
I need to buy an electric fan.

88
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,169
Can't you keep me on?

89
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,366
You should be
paying me back instead.

90
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:42,274
I paid all the bills
when your wife got sick and died.

91
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,109
Look at yourself.
You'll die before your debts are repaid.

92
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:48,286
You're starving yourself so your son
can go to that fancy school.

93
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:52,048
If my son can go to public school,
why can't yours?

94
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,249
Well, I want him
to have opportunities.

95
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,223
I don't want him to end up like me.

96
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,590
But you have to have capability.

97
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,129
He's highly capable.

98
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,766
I'm talking about you, not him.

99
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,604
All you have is a casual job
with no prospects.

100
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,102
How are you going to cope?

101
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,731
- I can manage.
- You can't manage!

102
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,041
- I can.
- You can't!

103
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,475
I can manage.

104
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,148
Very well. Block B. Foundations.

105
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,780
Thanks.

106
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,124
If you want to die, I can't stop you.
Shame on you.

107
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:21,703
You're back.

108
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,671
Can we have dinner? I'm starving.

109
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,110
Just step back a bit.

110
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,613
- What's going on?
- Turn round.

111
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,201
Come here.

112
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:46,326
What?

113
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,472
An electric fan!

114
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,073
That's so great! Is it real?

115
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:52,971
We finally have a fan!

116
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:56,045
- Now sit down and let me turn it.
- Quickly, Dad!

117
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,916
Dad, did you find this
in the garbage?

118
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:06,818
No, I bought it.

119
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,892
It cost a lot of money.

120
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,391
You were ripped off!

121
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,496
No, it was fine when I bought it.

122
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,030
So how come it's not working now?

123
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:19,431
Dumbass.
Use your head next time.

124
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,606
"Dumbass"?
Where did you get that from?

125
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,035
A guy in my class.

126
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,175
Oh, really? Well, let me tell you...

127
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,844
...we may be poor,
but we don't use bad language.

128
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,776
We don't steal. We don't rob.

129
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,247
We don't take things
that don't belong to us.

130
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:38,286
You must concentrate
on your studies.

131
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:44,785
I didn't study at all when I was young
and look where it's gotten me.

132
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:11,917
We're having an apple today?

133
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,317
Yes, we are.

134
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,921
But put it down now.

135
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,620
Finish your dinner first.

136
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,397
Hey, Dad, my sneakers
are worn out again.

137
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,830
Will you buy me some more?

138
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:28,096
I need you to get me a better pair,
or I'll be sent off the field again.

139
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,141
Got it. Don't worry.

140
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:40,346
You're still eating!
Lay off the cockroach.

141
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:43,120
You can get it after you've finished.

142
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,357
Nice. You've improved.

143
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,431
Not bad.

144
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,863
<i>There have been many sightings lately
of UFOs, Unidentified Flying Objects.</i>

145
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,104
What happened to the can'toons?

146
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,572
They'll be back in a minute.

147
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,212
<i>Could you please tell us
what happened?</i>

148
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,938
<i>I saw a flying object.</i>

149
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,209
<i>It flew from here to there
with a "whew" sound.</i>

150
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,279
<i>Can you describe the object
in more detail?</i>

151
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,185
<i>That object could really fly!</i>

152
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,223
<i>Though it wobbled a bit.</i>

153
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,860
<i>I suspect it had crashed before.</i>

154
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,029
<i>Crashed?</i>

155
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,926
<i>Yes, like a car crash.
It might have been broken.</i>

156
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,964
<i>I took a picture of it.</i>

157
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,868
<i>What kind of camera did you use?</i>

158
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:50,980
<i>It was expensive,
but I can't possibly tell you the make.</i>

159
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,648
<i>Did this particular flying object
make a sound?</i>

160
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,720
<i>It made some "whew" sounds like I just
told you. "Whew." Do you hear me?</i>

161
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,758
Unbelievable.

162
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:23,336
Don't run off like that.

163
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:26,517
Dad, this is called a CJ1.

164
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,020
Everyone at school has one.
They're great!

165
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,187
Really?

166
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,524
Let's go home. Put it back.

167
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:47,995
What's the matter?

168
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,098
Why can't I have it?

169
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,367
We'll buy it
after I get paid next month.

170
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,703
Now, put it down.

171
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,850
Let go!

172
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,492
Didrt you hear me?
I have no money.

173
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:17,667
If you buy me this,
I'll never ask for anything ever again.

174
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,359
I beg you.

175
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,399
What about this one?
What features does it have?

176
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,372
Let go.

177
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,341
Let go!

178
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,579
Let go!

179
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,424
Let go!

180
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:46,354
Come back!

181
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,359
Sir? Do you wish to buy that?

182
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:07,946
Come on, Dicky. Don't cry.

183
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,087
Stop crying now.

184
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,755
Good boy, stop crying.

185
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,116
Dicky.

186
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,286
Are you Mr. Chow?

187
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:18,121
I'm Miss Yuen, Dicky's teacher.
Good to meet you.

188
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,729
Miss Yuen. Good to meet you too.

189
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,433
Is Dicky well-behaved at school?

190
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,694
Yes, he's quite good.

191
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,898
He's in a really bad mood right now.

192
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,700
I know.
Kids just want every toy they see.

193
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,876
True.

194
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:35,944
Just happens I didn't bring
any money today, so...

195
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,377
Dicky, go to your dad.

196
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,943
Come here.

197
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,154
- I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
- Don't worry. He's like that.

198
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,217
In fact, I'd like to do a home visit.

199
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:50,258
He did tell me,
but I'm very busy at work...

200
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:53,658
I believe that a good education
doesn't just rely on the teacher.

201
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,163
That's why I'd like to involve you.

202
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:57,925
It'll be good for him.

203
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,964
Ah, yes. I see.

204
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,338
Dicky, I need to go now.

205
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:07,509
Don't be so grumpy.
And listen to your dad, okay?

206
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,912
Okay?

207
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:13,843
- I must go.
- Okay.

208
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,610
- Bye, now.
- Bye, now.

209
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:52,936
Dicky.

210
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,668
Look at me.

211
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,509
I have something
way better than CJ1.

212
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,151
Do you want to see it?

213
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,158
Are you sure?

214
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:18,158
In that case, I'll throw it away
and get back to work.

215
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:03,873
Goodbye, sir.

216
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,140
Goodbye.

217
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,413
Fanny.

218
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,214
Where's this amazing toy, then?

219
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:13,685
Look!

220
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,098
What's so great about that?

221
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,563
It's fun. Look!

222
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,900
It doesn't look that fun to me.

223
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:29,197
What do you think?

224
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,265
Actually, I agree. It's no fun.

225
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,772
Never mind. See you tomorrow.

226
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,612
What's that thing you're holding?

227
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,185
Nothing.

228
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:45,616
It looks like rubbish.

229
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,118
Says who?

230
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,728
This is way better than CJ1.

231
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,191
So, what's it called?

232
00:23:57,768 --> 00:24:00,202
It's called CJ7.

233
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:02,471
Pathetic piece of crap.

234
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:06,302
Your dad found it in the garbage.

235
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,212
Don't talk about my dad like that!
I'm going to beat you up.

236
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,445
Oh, yeah?

237
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:28,128
Hello.

238
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,168
How many times
do I have to tell you?

239
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:11,364
We might be poor,
but we don't fight.

240
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,374
You really disappoint me.

241
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,843
Look at this.
Your uniform's all torn.

242
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:18,871
What was the fight about?

243
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,049
They were laughing at me.

244
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,717
What about?

245
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,794
Well?

246
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,365
Fine.

247
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:46,006
If you're not going to tell me...

248
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:52,581
...then I have no choice
in the matter.

249
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:06,730
Last chance!

250
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,336
It's moving!

251
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,092
There are ghosts.

252
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,600
Ghosts? Where?

253
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:48,663
There. In the ball.

254
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,808
Don't change the subject!

255
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,277
You think you can run rings around me,
but you're not as clever as you think.

256
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:01,440
Your uniform's a mess. What will
you wear for school tomorrow?

257
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,154
Do I have to
go hunt for another one?

258
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,558
I'll deal with you later.

259
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,239
There's a ghost!
Hanging over there!

260
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,503
Help! Ghost! It's horrible!

261
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,013
There's a red ghost hanging there!

262
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,450
Hanging! Too horrible!

263
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,020
Calm down!

264
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,582
It's a broken lamp. Can't you see?

265
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,597
Not again!

266
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:54,270
You're a ghost too.

267
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:59,102
Stop shouting! I'll send you outside
if you don't stop! Understand?

268
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:41,209
Are you on drugs or something?

269
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,387
What are you doing?

270
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,252
Please don't lock me in!

271
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,554
There's a ghost.
You have to believe me.

272
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,856
Let me out!

273
00:28:55,065 --> 00:29:00,367
Please let me out!

274
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:15,779
Help me, Lord.

275
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:07,156
- Learned your lesson now?
- Yes, Dad.

276
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:08,626
Will you behave yourself now?

277
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:10,493
I will. I really will.

278
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,194
I have to get back to work.

279
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:16,233
Okay! Off you go.
Bye!

280
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,879
Are you from outer space?

281
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,678
Have you come to invade Earth?

282
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:46,157
I think you might be
an alien toy dog.

283
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,314
My name is Dicky.

284
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,683
Can I call you CJ7?

285
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,589
If you wag your tail,
it means you like it!

286
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:19,495
CJ7!

287
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:17,077
The apples in our house
are always rotten.

288
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:19,016
So how come this one's not?

289
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,588
You know magic?

290
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,864
Wow! It's so sweet.
You really do know magic.

291
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,431
I'm going to be rich!

292
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:52,716
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on Earth...

293
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:57,292
...then you really are
a superdog from space.

294
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:58,518
Go!

295
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,820
Oh, my God!

296
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:51,437
I have a test today and I've been
playing with you instead of studying.

297
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:54,947
But I really want to get 100.
Can you help me?

298
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,967
What's that you're making?

299
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,841
Dicky Chow.

300
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:28,313
Why are you
wearing those glasses?

301
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:30,418
My eyes hurt.
Do you want to take a look?

302
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,749
No, I don't. Sit down.

303
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,859
Begin writing now!

304
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,534
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

305
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,673
A fly?

306
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:07,710
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

307
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,020
I now have the results
of today's test.

308
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:25,030
And for the first time,
Dicky Chow got 100.

309
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:33,736
- Thank you, sir!
- Hold on a minute.

310
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:37,746
I want to see those glasses.

311
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,398
Those super-glasses were fantastic!

312
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,164
It's P.E. Next,
so I'll need super-sneakers!

313
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:14,740
This is so exciting.

314
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,752
Excellence at the high jump...

315
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,587
...requires talent, hard work...

316
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,094
...training, a good night's sleep...

317
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:30,232
...and finally,
respect for your teacher.

318
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,061
This is my personal record.

319
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,703
So far no one has bettered it.

320
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,811
I have new sneakers today, sir.

321
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,245
Sir! He just broke your record.

322
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:03,830
Dicky, it doesn't ring true
that a kid can jump that high.

323
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:06,635
Be a good boy and do it again.

324
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:31,251
Dicky Chow.
What are those shoes you're wearing?

325
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:32,853
It's none of your business!

326
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,421
This is too much.

327
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:36,489
You drove me to this.

328
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:37,682
Come down!

329
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,050
- Dicky! Are you out of your mind?
- I...

330
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,750
Over here. Catch him!

331
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,516
Come to your senses, Dicky.

332
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:13,589
Miss Yuen, bitterness, like the sea,
is boundless.

333
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:17,590
Dicky!

334
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,895
Dicky Chow! How can you jump
so high? Come down this minute!

335
00:42:57,173 --> 00:43:00,233
How on earth
can you sleep like that?

336
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,108
Wake up. It's nearly time for school.

337
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,182
What do I have to do
to get you up in the morning?

338
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:11,813
It was all a dream?

339
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,084
You're real.

340
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,589
I'm getting ready right now!

341
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:27,501
Dad, I'm going to get 100
on the exam today.

342
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:28,871
What?

343
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:30,471
I'm going to get 100!

344
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,698
Really?

345
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:36,140
Yes! All on my own! 100!

346
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,875
That's great.

347
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:56,294
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on Earth...

348
00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:00,731
...then you really are
a superdog from space.

349
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:01,961
Go!

350
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:27,560
Run!

351
00:44:50,453 --> 00:44:52,387
So, what happened back there?

352
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,954
You're supposed to be
the superdog from space.

353
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:01,255
Don't tell me
you were just pretending.

354
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:04,194
Seriously.

355
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,926
I have to get 100 on the exam.

356
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:11,096
I need you
to work your magic for me.

357
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:15,303
Come on, now. Please!
I'm not joking.

358
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:20,306
You have to give me
magic weapons.

359
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:28,708
Time's up.

360
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,614
What?
But I haven't started yet.

361
00:46:34,357 --> 00:46:36,018
What's with the turd?

362
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,989
Turd? It's not that!

363
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:41,026
Shows how much you know!

364
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:53,904
You set me up!

365
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,308
I'm going to kill you!

366
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:06,748
Give me the magic weapons now!

367
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,697
Why, you...

368
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:25,869
You...

369
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:46,894
Please, sir. Can I say something?

370
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:48,563
No, you can't.

371
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,758
You are a poor student.

372
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,596
You are always dirty,
and you are very wicked.

373
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:57,238
You discredit the school.

374
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,237
There's nothing more to say.

375
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,303
Now clean him up!

376
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,247
CJ7?

377
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,650
Please come out.

378
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:20,325
Why would I be mad at you?

379
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,792
We're good friends.

380
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:26,468
The turd wasrt important.

381
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:28,930
I've seen it all before.

382
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:33,675
Let's just forget it ever happened.
Okay?

383
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,274
In fact, I love you very much.
Do you know that?

384
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,516
CJ7? Come here.

385
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,021
Closer!

386
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,634
I'm going to stab you to death!

387
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:10,303
Rubbish dog from space.
You're low-tech and boring.

388
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:14,381
I got blamed and laughed at.
And all because of you.

389
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:18,645
If you're just an animal, then say so!
Don't pretend you have magic powers!

390
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,050
But did it ever say that?

391
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:26,218
Did I get it wrong?

392
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,164
Have I made a mistake?

393
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:34,461
I know I've made a mistake!

394
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:50,318
Wait!

395
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,819
Hey! Wait!

396
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,420
Wait!

397
00:50:09,305 --> 00:50:10,397
Dicky! What's happened?

398
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:12,733
CJ7 has disappeared.

399
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,513
Look.

400
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:26,088
CJ7?

401
00:50:28,124 --> 00:50:29,921
I'm sorry. I missed you so much.

402
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:33,027
I thought I'd never see you again.

403
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,699
And you're not angry with me.

404
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:45,267
You two already met?

405
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:49,977
Is it a toy?

406
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:51,271
Yes, it is.

407
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:55,716
And it can walk and move its eyes?

408
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:57,215
Where did you get it?

409
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,047
Someone at school lent it to me.

410
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,649
Where's the cover?

411
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,987
Where do the batteries go?

412
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:08,891
It doesn't need them. It's high-tech.

413
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:12,826
I've never seen
anything like it before.

414
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,200
Did you see that?

415
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:20,397
Yes, I did.

416
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,544
It's all bendy.

417
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,404
Don't! I have to give it back soon.

418
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:26,843
It's fine.

419
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:29,540
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Nothing!

420
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:45,859
See, I told you it'd be fine.
It gets its shape back. Look!

421
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,399
This is fun.

422
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:50,868
No more squeezing it!
That's enough!

423
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:53,707
Everything is high-tech nowadays.

424
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:58,438
Basically there's no future
for uneducated people like us.

425
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,849
Dad, I don't want
to lie to you, so...

426
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:07,216
...CJ7 came out of the ball
you gave me.

427
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:09,721
It came from outer space.

428
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,385
How many times
do I have to tell you?

429
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:17,362
We might be poor, but we don't lie...

430
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,296
...we don't fight...

431
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:22,699
...and we don't take things
that don't belong to us.

432
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:27,136
Study hard and be a useful person
in the future.

433
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:41,612
It's so hot.

434
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:39,932
Well, I'll be... The hottest night
and it starts to work. Lucky, or what?

435
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:41,131
I'm off to school now.

436
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,278
- Have you got your lunch box?
- Yes, I have.

437
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:45,879
Hey. How was the exam?

438
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,246
How come your head's gone red?

439
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,621
You don't look so good today.

440
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,294
Didrt you sleep last night?

441
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:05,293
Get inside and go to sleep.

442
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:08,102
You! Stop!

443
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,033
What's that thing inside your bag?

444
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:11,536
Nothing.

445
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,942
I need to check your schoolbag!

446
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:16,906
What for?

447
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,274
I don't have to tell you that.

448
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,944
Let go!

449
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:34,987
What's that?

450
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:36,826
Let me see.

451
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,933
Give it to me! Let me see first!

452
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,263
Give it to me! Don't pull!

453
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,266
Get it!

454
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:07,792
What is this weird thing?

455
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,931
Don't touch it!
Give it back to me!

456
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:11,565
Get the tool box!

457
00:56:15,137 --> 00:56:16,365
Open it up and look inside.

458
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:17,596
Here.

459
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,468
Let him go!

460
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:23,572
Can't do it.

461
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:25,246
Try this.

462
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:30,379
No! Don't do that!

463
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,878
It's not working.

464
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,453
How is that possible?

465
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,269
You won't do that to my thing!

466
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,837
So what? Going to hit me?

467
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,304
You won't know what's hit you!

468
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:04,851
Let him go!

469
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:14,686
You let him go.

470
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:16,626
You let me go first.

471
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,141
I don't want a fight.

472
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,428
Don't force me to do this!

473
00:58:52,294 --> 00:58:53,352
Are you okay?

474
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:55,928
I'm fine. Thank you.

475
00:58:56,465 --> 00:58:57,557
You're welcome.

476
00:58:57,766 --> 00:58:59,199
What's going on here?

477
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,930
Why were you fighting? Tell me!

478
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:08,141
You're going to stand here
until you tell me!

479
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:14,512
CJ7!

480
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,714
I knew you'd be okay!

481
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,412
Stop. Don't.

482
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,591
Good boy.

483
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,089
What is that thing?

484
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:27,091
Look! CJ7, sit!

485
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,727
That's cool.

486
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,628
What else does it do?

487
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,234
CJ7, happy face!

488
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:36,434
Angry face!

489
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:38,373
Sad face!

490
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:42,434
Saw a pretty lady!

491
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:45,737
Your apartment's on fire.

492
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:49,041
But you just won the lottery!

493
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:51,950
Oops! The whole family is dead.

494
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:55,520
You've got 100 on the exam!

495
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,992
Wicked.

496
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:01,219
Look!

497
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:10,037
Wow, fireworks!

498
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:13,370
Where did you get it?

499
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:15,167
I want one too.

500
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:16,674
I can't tell you that.

501
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:20,042
But I want to thank you
for not telling Mr. Cao about this.

502
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,238
Of course not!

503
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,884
We don't discuss
our business with adults.

504
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:25,383
- You have my word!
- You have my word!

505
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,417
Hey, you're amazing.
Do you want to be on our judo team?

506
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,561
They'd all make fun of me.

507
01:00:33,762 --> 01:00:35,423
They wouldn't dare.

508
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,394
Would you make fun of her?

509
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,282
Look at this.
My son got 100 on his exam.

510
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:01,547
That's a great kid!

511
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:02,951
Yes!

512
01:01:05,227 --> 01:01:06,956
- Look!
- Get away!

513
01:01:07,162 --> 01:01:08,891
He got 100.

514
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:14,467
Boss.
My kid got 100 on his exam.

515
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,700
So he cheated.

516
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:21,975
What makes you say that?

517
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:25,078
My sors really smart, but even
he can't pass without cheating.

518
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,078
So how can your son get 100?
Hard to believe, dickhead.

519
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:30,148
You're not serious.

520
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:37,115
Look at the ink. He got zero
and changed it to 100. He's a liar.

521
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,952
But he's not like that.
I know him better.

522
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:43,392
Your son cheated.

523
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,499
- I can't let you say that.
- He cheated!

524
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,464
I'll hit you if you say that again.

525
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:49,568
Your son cheated.

526
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,263
You hit me? Just you try!

527
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:06,284
Your son cheated!
You hit me?

528
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:08,422
You're fired!

529
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,351
Your son cheated!

530
01:02:34,149 --> 01:02:35,480
Quick!

531
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,180
Get inside.

532
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:44,353
Tell the truth.
Did you cheat on your exam?

533
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:45,693
No, I didn't.

534
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:50,058
I think you got zero,
then altered it to 100. Is that right?

535
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:53,795
Yes.

536
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:58,000
But that's not the same as cheating.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

537
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,697
What's wrong with you?

538
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:02,843
It's so tough
to send you to that school.

539
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:05,544
I'm sorry, Dad.

540
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:08,509
I'll say it again.
Even though we're poor...

541
01:03:08,717 --> 01:03:10,082
Okay! I know!

542
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:13,379
You're so annoying.
Can you stop going on about it?

543
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,359
I changed it. So what?

544
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:39,607
If there's nothing else,
I'm leaving.

545
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:46,848
What are you doing?

546
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:48,420
Why are you taking my things?

547
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,559
If you can't work hard,
then you don't get to play.

548
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,455
- Give it back to me!
- No.

549
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,289
Why are you taking my stuff?

550
01:03:55,497 --> 01:03:58,625
Why? Because I'm your father!
And I can!

551
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:01,803
You're bullying me.
I don't have a dad like you!

552
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,438
You always get zeros.
I don't have a son like you.

553
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,301
Leave me alone!

554
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:07,736
Say it again!

555
01:04:07,943 --> 01:04:10,241
Leave me alone forever!

556
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:11,810
Okay!

557
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:16,309
If you can use your own brains
to get over 60...

558
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,213
...then I'll leave you alone forever!

559
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,944
- It's a deal!
- It's a deal!

560
01:04:20,188 --> 01:04:22,884
I'm going to get that grade.
Just watch me!

561
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:26,322
We'll see about that, Zero Hero!

562
01:04:26,528 --> 01:04:29,793
That's not fair! I'll show you!

563
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,398
Don't bother me anymore!

564
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,766
What are you looking at?

565
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:51,819
- Mr. Chow.
- Miss Yuen.

566
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,113
- Is something wrong? Please come in.
- I won't, thanks.

567
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:57,417
But Dicky forgot his lunch box today.
Could you see that he gets it?

568
01:04:57,626 --> 01:04:59,821
Sure. Let me ask someone
to open the gate.

569
01:05:00,028 --> 01:05:04,021
No, please don't. If his classmates
see me, he'll never live it down.

570
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:05,199
How come?

571
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,958
- I have to go.
- Wait.

572
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:10,794
Dicky told me everything.

573
01:05:11,006 --> 01:05:13,099
He was just being temperamental.

574
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:16,436
If you'd allow it, he could
come to my house after school.

575
01:05:16,645 --> 01:05:18,510
We can talk about what happened.

576
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,714
And there's another exam tomorrow,
so I can help him to review.

577
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:23,111
What do you think?

578
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:24,745
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

579
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:27,922
- You're welcome. It's nothing at all.
- I appreciate this so much.

580
01:05:28,123 --> 01:05:30,887
- It's just a small thing. Nothing, really.
- It's not nothing.

581
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,219
The thing is...

582
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:36,056
I can't give him very much myself,
and that makes me feel very guilty.

583
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:40,394
But if you were to help him study,
I could never repay you.

584
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:43,704
You really don't have to.
It's the least I can do.

585
01:05:44,706 --> 01:05:46,333
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

586
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:48,572
Sure. You just leave Dicky to me.

587
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:51,538
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

588
01:06:26,548 --> 01:06:28,539
How's the boss feeling today?

589
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,115
You dare to come back?

590
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:31,785
I have to. I need to eat.

591
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:57,436
I know I have a big mouth,
but I think we understand each other.

592
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:58,635
What?

593
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:02,647
I shouldn't have said that
about your son. Let's forget it. Here.

594
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:05,219
Well...

595
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:07,984
- But he really did cheat.
- Who doesn't, sometimes?

596
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,784
The kid is very smart.
I know he'll be successful.

597
01:07:10,992 --> 01:07:13,153
I pray to God that you're right.

598
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:15,295
So take it and buy him some candy.

599
01:07:15,497 --> 01:07:16,794
Hey! This is far too much.

600
01:07:16,998 --> 01:07:20,434
Use it for books, then. Or school fees.
But now get back to work.

601
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:28,504
Today must be my lucky day.

602
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:00,766
I thought you'd never pass.

603
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:04,405
Good.

604
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:06,198
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

605
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,103
What's happening?

606
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,243
Where's your safety belt?

607
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:44,475
What's going on here?

608
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,476
Help!

609
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:52,816
Give me your hand!

610
01:09:53,021 --> 01:09:56,957
Reach out! Give me your hand!

611
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:04,295
Why haven't these been moved?

612
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:07,065
What was that? Hey! Be careful!

613
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:21,008
I'm so sorry.

614
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:24,742
Dicky, you have to come with me.

615
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,391
Is this your house, Dicky?

616
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,336
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat?

617
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:06,409
Dicky, I'm going
to tell you something.

618
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:18,889
There was a terrible accident,
and your dad passed away.

619
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:45,226
There are some things
we can't control. Do you understand?

620
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,929
Don't talk anymore, miss.
I want to sleep.

621
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,825
Please leave me.

622
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:54,460
Dicky, open the door.

623
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:55,825
I'm sorry.

624
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:57,334
Miss Yuen...

625
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,270
...l'm very tired.

626
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:06,775
I need to sleep.

627
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:10,817
Dicky.

628
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,848
My dad won't leave me alone.

629
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:22,356
He'll be home when I wake up.

630
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,999
I need to sleep now.

631
01:13:29,704 --> 01:13:31,103
Dicky.

632
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,380
Dad.

633
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:42,960
Why aren't you in your pajamas?

634
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,140
Hey. What's up?

635
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,011
Dad, don't ever leave me.

636
01:17:07,855 --> 01:17:10,119
I'll listen to you...

637
01:17:10,391 --> 01:17:12,188
...l'll study hard...

638
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:13,621
...I won't bullshit...

639
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:15,261
...I won't fight...

640
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:18,955
...and one day
I'll be a really useful person.

641
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:21,833
That's good.

642
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:42,886
CJ7!

643
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,054
How are you?

644
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,460
What's that noise?

645
01:17:53,701 --> 01:17:55,464
Yeah, what is it?

646
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,337
Why are you so tired, CJ7?

647
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,251
What's happened to him, Dad?

648
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:56,252
Maybe the batteries have run out.

649
01:18:56,464 --> 01:18:58,364
It wouldn't look like that!

650
01:18:58,566 --> 01:19:00,363
But it's very high-tech.

651
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,361
<i>The new term starts soon...</i>

652
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:40,227
<i>... and we have a picnic
before going back.</i>

653
01:20:40,434 --> 01:20:42,561
<i>Everybody's very happy.</i>

654
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,202

doesn't fight anymore...</i>

655
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:47,738
<i>... because he's fallen in love.</i>

656
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,716
<i>Maggie likes me best...</i>

657
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:10,095
<i>... but my love is Fanny.</i>

658
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,998
<i>And she loves me very much too!</i>

659
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:22,041
<i>Johnny always takes what's mine.</i>

660
01:21:22,243 --> 01:21:25,371
<i>Maybe he'll stop
when I tell the teacher about him.</i>

661
01:21:27,615 --> 01:21:30,709
<i>Every pupil has his own true love.</i>

662
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:32,886
<i>And so has my dad.</i>

663
01:21:46,734 --> 01:21:51,068
It's just amazing. When we saw you in
the hospital you appeared to be quite...

664
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:55,402
Dead, yes. But now I'm right as rain.
Not even the doctors can explain it.

665
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,805
And how have you been since then?

666
01:21:58,012 --> 01:21:59,809
Well, I do have a bit of a problem.

667
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:01,481
What kind of problem?

668
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:03,707
I'm far too handsome.

669
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:08,548
Very funny.

670
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,925
I mean it.

671
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:17,494
<i>It's not easy to win a girl over...</i>

672
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:19,825
<i>... especially if you're not that funny.</i>

673
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:21,626
<i>But Dad won't give up.
He's my hero.</i>

674
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:26,330
You don't think I'm handsome,
Miss Yuen? You can't be serious.

675
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,078
<i>I'm so lucky
that I still have you, CJ7.</i>

676
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:36,112
<i>Every day, while you sleep...</i>

677
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:38,945
<i>... I close my eyes
and count to three...</i>

678
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:42,680
<i>... hoping when I look again,
you'll wake.</i>

679
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,849
<i>I want you back so much.
Where are you, CJ7?</i>

680
01:22:49,897 --> 01:22:53,663
One, two, three...

681
01:24:19,164 --> 01:28:18,664
