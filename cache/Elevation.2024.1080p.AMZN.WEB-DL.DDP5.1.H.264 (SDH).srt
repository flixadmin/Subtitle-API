00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,866
It's Friday night, you know.

168
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,468
Is it?

169
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,203
Mm-hmm.

170
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:19,940
If this was before,
what would you be doing?

171
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,811
I'd probably be at the 19th
hole with my father-in-law.

172
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,746
(Katie chuckling)

173
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,650
I'm sorry, I never pictured you
as the country club type, Will.

174
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:30,251
-(both laughing)
-I wasn't.

175
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,920
But Tara's family loved it.

176
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,455
I hated it.

177
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,925
And now I miss it.

178
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,133
(gunshot)

179
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,604
Goddamn it.

180
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:52,973
(Katie chuckles softly)

181
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,516
(machine whirring and beeping)

182
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,784
(Hunter gasping)

183
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,287
We're out of filters, so
I'm-a have to give you a shot.

184
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,263
(insects chirping)

185
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,901
(knocking)

186
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,070
(door opens)

187
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,479
Hello, Nina.

188
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,148
How are you?

189
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:39,019
How's the drinking?

190
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,155
Keeps me from killing myself.

191
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,992
How's yours?

192
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,262
Keeps me from killing you.

193
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,169
I'm leaving tomorrow.

194
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,638
For Boulder.

195
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,743
Well, that's probably the last
thing I expected you to say.

196
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,678
I don't have a choice.

197
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,215
You'll die.

198
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,951
They can't be killed.

199
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,688
You believed that,
you wouldn't still have

200
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,724
this pirate flag on your wall.

201
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,992
I found a safe way there.

202
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,734
There is no safe way.

203
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,003
I know every map.

204
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,106
Every route. Two days' walk.

205
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,408
Impossible to stay
above The Line the whole time.

206
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:37,846
Hunter's machine.

207
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,049
The last filter burnt out.

208
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,519
The hospital in Boulder
will have a crate of 'em.

209
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,554
But if I don't go, Hunter dies.

210
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,962
The place was probably looted.

211
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,363
No one had time to loot.

212
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,465
You're gonna have to go
below The Line

213
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,567
at least a dozen times.

214
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,835
You can't survive a dozen

215
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:01,836
encounters with those things.

216
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,103
You survived.

217
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,305
That was luck.

218
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,842
Luck is not a strategy.

219
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,476
Luck won't help you.

220
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,211
You're the only person
who fought them and lived.

221
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,847
You've studied them for years.

222
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,682
-That'll help me.
-So what? "Do me a favor, Nina.

223
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,417
Let's go. Let's die together."

224
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,952
But last year, you thought
you found a way to kill them

225
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,355
if you could get back
to your old lab.

226
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,891
That's why Tara went with you.

227
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,559
I have a way to Boulder.

228
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,261
It's mapped out. We only go
below The Line twice.

229
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,229
Twice?

230
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,532
That's not possible.

231
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:31,866
It is.

232
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,066
Calway Mine.

233
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,269
It goes through the mountain.

234
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,604
A mine?

235
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:37,938
A fucking mine, Will?

236
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,340
That's your plan?

237
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,843
That's a death trap
by definition.

238
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,410
My company did a big job there.

239
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,379
I walked every inch.

240
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,448
I know those tunnels.

241
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,251
You don't know anything.

242
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,088
You're desperate.

243
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,057
Desperate people get killed.

244
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,225
8:00 a.m.

245
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,427
Cathedral Point Overlook.

246
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,095
Who says I'm going?

247
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,364
Everything you've done up here
since day one says that.

248
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:08,202
Shooting at that goddamn
Reaper scale every night.

249
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,471
All you think about
is killing one of these things,

250
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:13,273
and you need something
from down there to do it.

251
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,108
You owe me this much.

252
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,477
For Tara.

253
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:18,913
Will.

254
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,953
Boulder is 2,000 feet
below The Line.

255
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,420
Even if you make it there,

256
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,922
they'll be there waiting
for you.

257
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,191
It only takes one of them.

258
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,629
I know.

259
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,901
(door creaks open)

00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,134

WILL:
I have to go tomorrow.

00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:58,245
He's got four days,
five at the most.

284
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,681
HANNAH:
I'll stay here with him.

285
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,524
TIM:
Changed the zero to 200 yards,

286
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,259
so you'll be able to engage 'em
from further out.

287
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,595
Oh.

288
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,363
AP rounds.

289
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,365
These are from
my own personal stash.

290
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,703
Slow 'em down a bit more
than a regular 556.

291
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,403
Good luck out there.

292
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,205
-Thanks.

(door closes)

294
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,943
Were you planning
on telling me?

295
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,546
Huh?

296
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,180
You just gonna run off
and get yourself killed

297
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,215
without saying a word,
like Tara?

298
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,719
(Will scoffs softly)

299
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,722
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

300
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:41,789
Yeah, it was.

301
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:42,890
-Hey, Tim?
-TIM: Yeah.

302
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,191
My gear?

303
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,760
WILL:
Katie, what are you doing?

304
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,595
-KATIE: Going with you.
-WILL: No, you're not.

305
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,296
Not asking permission, Will.
You can't go out there alone.

306
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,065
You need a partner
to watch your back.

307
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,634
Right. Nina's going with me.

308
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,569
Oh, I'm definitely going now.

309
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,104
(sighs)
The town needs you up here.

310
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,705
And I need to see
what's down there.

311
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,041
Why? What's the point?

312
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:03,645
We're rats on a sinking ship,
and we need to find a way off.

313
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,080
No, we don't.
We can survive up here forever.

314
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:07,548
-Everyone except Hunter.
-(scoffs)

315
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,784
I don't want to live
like this forever, Will.

316
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,485
And we both know
Hunter doesn't, either.

317
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,987
Well, it's not his decision
to make.

318
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,187
Not at eight years old.

319
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:18,158
We're gonna have to fight them
eventually, Will.

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,829
It might as well be today.

321
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,001
(door opens)

322
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,138
-(sighs softly)
-(door closes)

323
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,076
We don't need your help.

324
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,778
You don't need anyone's help,
do you, Nina?

325
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,279
You ever seen one
coming for you?

326
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,050
Up close.

327
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,120
Not just a flickering light
in the distance.

328
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,824
The way they tear people apart.

329
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,027
Bullets bounce off them

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,028

497
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:12,433

498
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,569
(screeching fades in distance)

499
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:21,375
Y'all okay?

500
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,445
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

501
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,047
(Will sighs)

502
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:30,819
(insects chirping,
animal howling)

503
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,722
(glasses clinking)

504
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,397
18-year-old, single malt.

505
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,076
Those grenades did nothing.

506
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:04,752
To one more night alive.

507
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:11,992
(exhales)

508
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,533
It is different.

509
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,604
Seeing them up close.
(sniffles)

510
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:27,307
We're not meant to share
the planet with those things.

511
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:32,614
Maybe the Jesus freaks
were right.

512
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:37,519
Maybe the Reapers are
judgment for mankind's sins.

513
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,621
For eating God's apple,
then clear-cutting

514
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,756
the Garden of Eden
with the knowledge it gave us.

515
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,925
I don't buy that.

516
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,860
So what do you buy?

517
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,230
KATIE: They're Earth's
new apex predators.

518
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,967
And we're prey.

519
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,975
So how do we
take our place back?

520
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,181
They came out of nowhere,
all at once.

521
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,451
No one's had a chance
to study them.

522
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,854
You study something
long enough,

523
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,288
you can figure out
how to kill it.

524
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,223
If it doesn't kill you first.

525
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,397
A lot more of us are gonna die.

526
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,734
But one day,
we're gonna beat them.

527
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:35,242
Three years, day and night,
researching them.

528
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,745
Something had to stand out.

529
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:42,517
What they did when they
first came out of the ground.

530
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,084
Which was?

531
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,623
Wipe out 95% of the world's
population in a month.

532
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,593
They didn't stop
to eat or sleep.

533
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:52,927
They just didn't stop.

534
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,229
I don't follow.

535
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:00,068
Predators kill to eat.

536
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,869
The Reapers kill to kill.

537
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:04,072
And they only killed us.

538
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,841
It's like it's all they wanted,
was just to get rid of us.

539
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:09,142
I don't think there's
some master plan, Nina.

540
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,746
Simply what you said.

541
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:13,715
They're predators
and we're prey.

542
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:16,050
I didn't say that. Katie did.

543
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,886
So what are you saying?

544
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,993
Nothing. It's just a question.

545
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,795

00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,438
What if she has found
a way to kill those things?

550
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,107
WILL (voice-over):
I don't believe her.

551
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,409
-Why not?
-She wants it too badly.

552
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,645
-What does that mean?
-You know what I mean.

553
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,647
If anyone could
figure it out, it's her.

554
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:21,082
She's a physicist.

555
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,650
Yeah, with a Messiah complex.

556
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:24,652
Baby, that's all physicists.
They make a living

557
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:26,453
unlocking God's secrets.

558
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:29,256
I get it. You trust her.

559
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,159
But this is a suicide mission.

560
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,927
It's not your job
to save the world.

561
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,395
-What is my job?
-To stay alive.

562
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:39,199
You would have said something
different when we first met.

563
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:42,369
That's before you almost died
in childbirth

564
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:46,874
and we had a one-pound infant
clinging to life in the NICU.

565
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,341
This is for Hunter.

566
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,877
No, it's not.

567
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,646
Not for Nina.

568
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:54,314
This is about her wanting to be

569
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:55,850
the first person
to kill a Reaper.

570
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,118
And she'll die to do it.

571
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,786
She's not suicidal, Will.

572
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,322
She's after immortality.

573
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:04,458
Why can't you see that?

574
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,160
She doesn't have a family.

575
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:08,863
She's never had a family.
She ca--

576
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,572
It's just a matter of time
before he runs out of filters.

577
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:20,742
That's a year from now,
at least.

578
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,844
And the Reapers will
still be down there.

579
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,747
So what's the difference?

580
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,917
Another year together.

581
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,353
(voice-over):
That's the difference.

582
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,060
(sighs)

583
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:07,088
NINA: When we come out,
it'll be close to dark.

584
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,857
Can't hit the city at night.

585
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,726
WILL: There's a ranger station
on the other side.

586
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,695
We can stay there
until daybreak.

587
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,396
What's the plan in there?

588
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,932
This is level nine.

589
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,600
The ladder will take us down
to level eight.

590
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:22,537
We take eight
across the mountain, 2.2 miles.

591
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,240
We exit at 8,023 feet,
on the other side,

592
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:29,076
12 miles west of Boulder.

593
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,113
Anything below level eight
is under The Line.

594
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,581
We exit at 8,023 feet?

595
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:34,849
That's right.

596
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,118
How exact is that?

597
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,421
Very.

598
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,490
How do you know these tunnels
are perfectly straight?

599
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:44,992
That they don't bow
somewhere in the middle?

600
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,426
That would take us
below The Line.

601
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,262
Or did you not think
about that?

602
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,467
-Oh, you son of a bitch.
-Easy.

603
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,604
We're going below The Line,
aren't we?

604
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:03,211
-Will?
-For how long?

605
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,081
231 yards.

606
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,317
(laughs) What?

607
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,253
Both ends of the tunnel are
above 8,000 feet, so...

608
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:15,823
So, nothing! These tunnels
are not hermetically sealed.

609
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,291
How do you know
there aren't any fissures

610
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:19,026
that lead to the lower levels
of the mine?

611
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,095
You should have told us this
before we left the refuge.

612
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:22,697
It's 231 yards.

613
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,832
And besides,
your tracker will tell us

614
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,334
if one of them is
within a half a mile.

615
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,603
-No, it won't.
-It just did.

616
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:30,104
Above ground.

617
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,539
It's not gonna work
under a mile of rock.

618
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:34,175
It's 45 seconds.
Why are you so worried?

619
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,509
They come from
underground, Will.

620
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,545
They're built for it.
We're not.

621
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,347
They can see in the dark.

622
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,549
They detect the smallest amount
of CO2, which we exhale

623
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,351
and will build up
pretty fucking fast

624
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,585
inside a fucking mine.

625
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:47,255

KATIE:
It's welded shut?

647
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:09,997
What now?

648
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:17,204
Climb down to level seven.

649
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:18,973
That's below The Line, Will.

650
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,342
-Yeah.
-For how long?

651
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,046
About a thousand yards.

652
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,281
A thousand yards?

653
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,183
That's ten football fields.

654
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,885
I mean,
how-how steep are these cliffs

655
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:32,119
that we're trying to avoid?

656
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,021
They're impassable.

657
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:36,490

it hits them,

995

I never should have
encouraged her to come with me.

996

997

to hold them off,

than you could possibly
hate me.

easier than blaming myself.

1004

1005

You can't blame yourself.
