1
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,954
Drago: You look tired.

2
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,523
Why don't you
knock off early?

3
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,691
Agent: Ooh!

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,668
Drago: Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

5
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,539
Demon chi...

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,174
And all for me.

7
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,575
Jackie chan, yawning:
Oh, Jade,

8
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,111
what are you doing
out of--aah!

9
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,379
Drago!

10
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,682
Drago: Did I wake you,
sleepyhead?

11
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,351
So sorry!

12
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,620
Jade chan: Hey, Jackie,
what are you doing out of--

13
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,422
wha--drago!

14
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,857
(Jackie and Jade grunt)

15
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,629
Jade: Ok, jackienator--
you go left, I'll go right,

16
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,797
and we'll catch drago--

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,632
Jackie: Jade,
you stay here.

18
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,469
Jade: You can't go in
without backup!

19
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,605
Jackie: Hyah! Hut! Haut!

20
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,708
Have you come to section 13
to turn yourself in?

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,678
Drago: In your dreams, chan.

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,812
Jackie: Uhh!

23
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,080
Uhh!

24
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,653
Drago: I'm here to throw
a little barbecue.

25
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,955
(Alarm blares)
Huh?

26
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,730
Black: You're surrounded,
drago. Game's over.

27
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,300
Drago: Over? I'm just
gettin' warmed up.

28
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,445
Jade: Call me crazy,
but I'm thinking it's time
for a security upgrade.

29
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,781
Drago: Raaahh!

30
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,483
Surrounded!

31
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,985
Outnumbered!

32
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,390
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone solo.

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,563
But I will not repeat
<i>your</i> mistakes, father!

34
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,534
I will find the biggest,
baddest henchmen in the world

35
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,870
and fulfill my destiny.

36
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,074
(Jade yawns)

37
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,244
Jade: (Gasp)
It's my birthday! Yes!

38
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,814
(Loud yawn)

39
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,717
Oh...There you are!

40
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,519
What's everybody doing?

41
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,721
Black: Is the chi
containment unit stable?

42
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,391
Uncle chan: You want
demon chi kept safe? Yes?

43
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,960
Then let uncle work
without lookie-loos!

44
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,863
Jade: Hello! Anybody wanna
say something?

45
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,264
Tohru: Good morning, Jade.

46
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,567
Jade: Is that...All?

47
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,169
don't you know
what today is?

48
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,139
Uncle: Hot cha!
Very important day!

49
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,374
Day for uncle's hair cut!

50
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,978
Jade: Aw, come on!
You know it's my birthday.

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,581
Now, for breakfast, I want
chocolate chip pancakes

52
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,382
with whipped cream
and strawberries and--

53
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,717
Jackie: I'm sorry, Jade.

54
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,687
Things are a little busy
around section 13
this morning.

55
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,389
We will have to celebrate
your birthday later.

56
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,158
Jade: What?! How much later?

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,560
Jackie: Ehh...
Just be patient.

58
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,929
Jade: Oh...

59
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,442
Drago, quietly: Next.

60
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,049
(Whipping sounds)

61
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,519
Next.

62
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,056
Next!

63
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,700
Punchy: Duh! Get away!
Get away!

64
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,039
Drago: Raaah!
You are all pathetic!

65
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,041
I'm looking for henchmen--

66
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:40,946
bone-crushing,
skull-caving henchmen!

67
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,850
I can't believe I'm gonna
say this out loud, but...

68
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,586
I never should have
fired the enforcers.

69
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:48,887
Strikemaster ice: Yo, dude.

70
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,958
You seen the rest.
Now eyeball the best!

71
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,661
Punchy: Duh!

72
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,195
Henchman: Uhh!

73
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,133
(Buzz)
(Smash)

74
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,534
Strikemaster ice:
So we got the gig or what?

75
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,935
Drago: What's your name?

76
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,471
Strikemaster ice:
They call me strikemaster ice.

77
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,907
This here's my crew--
dj fist,

78
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,575
and mc cobra.

79
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,645
Yo, gecko-boy be buggin'!

80
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,959
Drago: It's near.

81
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,761
Let's go.

82
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,463
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, hold up, dog.

83
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,898
Now, we don't work
for free.

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,702
You want our services,
you gots to show some green!

85
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,403
Yizzle!

86
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,778
Drago: You each now
have a small piece of
my fire demon power--

87
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,314
dragon speed...

88
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,516
Dragon strength...

89
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,784
And dragon breath.

90
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,920
Strikemaster ice:
That'll work!

91
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,488
Drago: You're on the clock now

92
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,424
and we have demon chi
to claim.

93
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,294
Uncle: The containment
unit is unharmed.

94
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,763
Demon chi cannot escape.

95
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,798
Black: I'm installing
heat and motion sensors

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,569
to make sure our
fire-breathing friend
can't pay another visit.

97
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,605
Jade: All right, then.
Let's get Jade's birthday
train back on track.

98
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,175
Hmm...What's first,
lunch at pizza burger?

99
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,011
Or maybe I should
open my presents!

100
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:24,049
Tohru: (Giggles)
I love birthdays.

101
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,586
Uncle: Aiyaa! Demon chi
has been activated!

102
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,389
Jade: No way.
Not on my birthday!

103
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,291
Uncle: Dai gui,
the earth demon.

104
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,193
Tohru: The flower
of the immortals.

105
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,496
The demon chi
is trapped within.

106
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:40,665
Jackie: The coronado bridge
in San Diego!

107
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,236
I am sorry, Jade.

108
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,572
Your birthday celebration
will have to wait just
a little longer.

109
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,009
Jade: That's ok. We can
party in San Diego!

110
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,812
Jackie: Uh...
It's too dangerous.

111
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,080
You will stay here.

112
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,381
Jade: That's not right.

113
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,483
You can't dis
the birthday girl.

114
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,254
Uncle: Demon chi
is very close.

115
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,090
Jackie: Then all we
have to do is find the...

116
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,559
Flower.

117
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,262
Jade: Hey, Jackie!

118
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,763
Jackie: Aah!

119
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,499
Uncle: Demon chi
is in this room.

120
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,469
Florist: Ahem!
May I help you?

121
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,539
Jackie: Uh, it's a
flower freshness detector.

122
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,841
My uncle is very picky.

123
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:27,512
Drago: So am I.
I want a flower that
smells like demon chi.

124
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,814
(All gasp)

125
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,215
Tohru: Drago.

126
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,751
Jackie: And...
Strikemaster ice?

127
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:36,221
Jade: Hey, pizza-face
got a drago makeover!

128
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:40,125
Strikemaster ice: Yo dog,
you didn't say nothin' about
puttin' the hurt on chan.

129
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,328
First day on the job
and we're already
gettin' a bonus.

130
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,030
(Attack cries
and grunting)

131
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,371
Drago: Chi loves me...
Chi loves me not.

132
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,174
Jade: (Gasps)
Hurry, uncle!

133
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,178
Jackie: Uhh!

134
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,483
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
start pickin' out flowers,
chan, for your funer--

135
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,486
ah-ah-ah-choo!

136
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,558
Jackie: Bless you?

137
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,796
Strikemaster ice:
Ah-choo!

138
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,098
Whoo! Ah-choo!

139
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,434
Ah-choo!

140
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,902
Jackie:
You must be allergic.

141
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,403
Strikemaster ice:
Ah-choo!

142
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,705
Jackie: Bless you.

143
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,173
(Flower pots crashing)

144
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,341
Jackie: Bless you.

145
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,675
Strikemaster ice:
Ah-choo!

146
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,477
Uncle: No, no.

147
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,778
Strikemaster ice:
Ah-choo!

148
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,113
Uncle: No...No...

149
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,184
Uncle: Hot cha!

150
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,925
Drago: For me?
You shouldn't have.

151
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,470
Jade: Hee-yah!

152
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,474
I picked this for you.

153
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,377
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

154
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,013
Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

155
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,986
Tohru: Uhh!

156
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,054
Strikemaster ice: Ah--

157
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,298
uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

158
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,401
Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

159
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,536
Drago: No!

160
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,241
Uhh!

161
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,110
Florist: My hydrangeas!

162
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,381
Uncle: Jackie,
pay nice man.

163
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,852
Jade: Now that we have
the flower power,

164
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,521
it's time to party down!

165
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,990
I'm still the birthday
girl for 10 more hours.

166
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,693
Jackie: We'll be
back home in time for
a big birthday dinner.

167
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,994
Uncle: Aiyaa!

168
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,228
Jackie: Huh?

169
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,030
Jade: Oh, no!

170
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,099
Uncle: Moon demon tso LAN?

171
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,934
Lotus pod?

172
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,537
One more chi is nearby!

173
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,872
Turn car around!

174
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,310
Tohru: 2 demon chi powers
on the same day?

175
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,445
Jade: Figures.

176
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,113
Tohru: I'm sorry, Jade.

177
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,249
You know we
would all prefer to
celebrate your birthday.

178
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,952
Jade: (Sighs) Whatever.

179
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,788
Drago: Was that
a joke back there?

180
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,790
Did I hire clowns?

181
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,861
I give you powers beyond
your wildest imagination

182
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,797
and you amateurs can't
get past an archaeologist,

183
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,234
a tub of guts, an old man,
and a little girl?!

184
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,207
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, he's buggin' again!

185
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,252
Drago: You three
are about to get
a second chance.

186
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,594
Tohru: I know it isn't
much, but happy birthday.

187
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,562
Jade: Oh, thanks, t.

188
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,772
Uncle: Moon
demon chi is there!

189
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,440
(Drago growls and Jackie,
Jade, uncle, and tohru gasp)

190
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,911
Jackie: Jade, stay here.

191
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,448
Jade: Oh!

192
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,924
Drago: Smells like
chi spirit.

193
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,928
Jade: Step away
from the lotus pod!

194
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,630
Jackie: Jade!

195
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:39,898
Jade: I'm your backup,
remember?

196
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,357
Tohru: The demon chi
stays. You go.

197
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,226
Drago: We'll see
about that.

198
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,465
What? It was here
a second ago.

199
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:23,241
Uncle: Moon demon chi--
control over gravity.

200
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,177
(Drago snarls)

201
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,828
Jade: Uncle, let's
bring the "floater"

202
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,497
back down to earth.

203
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,199
Tohru: Uhh!

204
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,835
Uhh!

205
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,103
Ooh!

206
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,242
Jade: Hey, boy,
come over here!

207
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,476
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

208
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:02,147
Jade: Mmm! Cotton candy!
Yummy in your tummy!

209
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,115
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee--

210
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,984
Jade: No hitchhiking!

211
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,723
Drago: I'll come back
for you later.

212
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,932
Jackie: Whoooooa!

213
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,133
Uhh!

214
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,403
Tohru: Uh...Whoops.

215
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,442
Jackie: Which way
did they go?

216
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,949
Bwaa!

217
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,018
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

218
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,025
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

219
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,264
Bad day, bad--bad day!

220
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,935
Jade: Uncle!

221
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:00,638
Uncle: Leave
Chinese Bear alone!

222
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,848
(Fist, cobra, ice,
and drago scream)

223
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,550
(Seals clapping)

224
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,322
Jackie: Nice panda,
come to--

225
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:21,292
wh-whooaaa!

226
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,294
Jade: Jackie!

227
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:30,435
Jackie: Whooaaa--oof!

228
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,171
Good catch, tohru.

229
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,612
Jade: Step on it, t!

230
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:44,115
Jackie: don't worry,
we'll bring it back
later! Thank you!

231
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,224
Jade: Whoa! The panda's
going all moony.

232
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:58,696
Uncle: Panda will
return to normal once
the demon chi is removed.

233
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,899
Jade: Hey, boy, trade ya!

234
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,768
Cotton candy for that
yucky demon chi!

235
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,009
Uncle and tohru: Yu-mo-
gue-guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

236
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,279
Yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao.

237
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:18,716
Jade: Yes! And now
it's time for Jade's
birthday bash!

238
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,755
Uncle: Uncle was
afraid of this.

239
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,490
Tohru: <i> Sensei?</i>

240
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:34,899
Uncle: Chi-o-matic
can only hold
one power at a time!

241
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,138
Drago: Fore!

242
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,047
Now that is some
serious hang time!

243
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:53,184
Uncle: Jackie!
Drago must not obtain
earth demon chi!

244
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,187
You must become
living vessel.

245
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,790
Jade: Ooh! Ooh! Let me
be the living vessel!

246
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,059
I can handle it.
I have experience.

247
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,829
Come on,
it's my birthday!

248
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,211
Drago: It's
a 2-for-1 special.

249
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,850
Noooooo!

250
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,887
Jackie: Ooh, tingly.

251
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,024
Uncle: Jackie! Do not
let drago touch you!

252
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,427
He will try to drain
demon chi!

253
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,297
Drago: Oh, I won't just
touch you, chan.

254
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,866
I'll rip you apart!

255
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,507
Jackie: Did I do that?

256
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,975
Uncle: Of course!

257
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:55,513
Why do you think it is
called earth demon chi?

258
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,986
Jade: You dine with the t,
you get a helping of the j.

259
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,654
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, shortstop,

260
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,024
why don't you let
the grown-ups handle
this, a-ight?

261
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,126
Jade: Afraid I'll whoop
your butts again?

262
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,927
Strikemaster ice:
You got the crust,
little lady.

263
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,864
Let's see if you
got the sauce.

264
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,036
Whoa!

265
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,050
Drago: Hey, chan...Catch!

266
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,094
(Jackie coughs)

267
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:46,030
Jackie: Uncle! Have you
fixed the chi-o-matic?

268
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,633
Uncle: Do not rush uncle!

269
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,101
Drago: Fire in the hole!

270
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,169
Jackie: Aah!

271
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,827
Drago: All that digging
must have made you
thirsty, chan.

272
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,162
How about a little juice?

273
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,666
Tingly.

274
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,601
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

275
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,936
Drago: No!

276
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,537
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

277
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,307
Yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao.

278
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,017
(Rumbling and crackling)

279
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,487
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
ice gonna bring the heat!

280
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,034
Jade: And this is for
ruining my birthday!

281
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,102
Hee-yah!

282
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,844
Come on, yin-Yang,
let's get you home.

283
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,049
(Footsteps)

284
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,887
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, d, a little hizzle?

285
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:20,358
(Drago roars)

286
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,326
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-
guai-fie-Dee-tsao.

287
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,729
Yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao.

288
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,064
Yu-mo-gue-guai-fie-
Dee-tsao.

289
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,776
Black: 4 down, 4 to go.

290
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:43,814
Jackie: And someone is
still the birthday girl
for 4 more minutes.

291
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,883
(Jade snoring)

292
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,890
Jackie: Shh.
She is sleeping.

293
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,138
Jade: Hey Jackie, is there
a yin and Yang to your
personality?

294
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,707
Jackie: Yin-Yang. I think
everybody have a yin-Yang.

295
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,710
Yin-Yang. Sometimes
I feel I'm very strong,

296
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,912
but sometimes I do feel
I'm very weak.

297
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:19,617
In my body, the Yang always
want to beat the ying.

298
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,118
Sometimes when
I'm doing a stunt,

299
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,221
this side tell me,
"dangerous,"

300
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,556
but another side tell me,
"no, you can do it."

301
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,160
So, this way, I do
have a yin-Yang, yes.
