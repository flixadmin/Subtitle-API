00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,667
He and Gold stayed buddies
since Zandia orphanage.

155
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,252
So what? They kept in touch.

156
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,130
Doesn't mean Sebastian Blood
is the man in the skull mask.

157
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,550
His last name is Blood.
That can't be a good sign.

158
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,179
He's dedicated his life, risked his life,
to help the people of the Glades.

159
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,183
And in his spare time, he's a murderer
trying to create an army of human weapons?

160
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,561
You're a bodyguard who fights crime
at night with his billionaire boss.

161

Not a lot of people
show their real face in public.

162
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,692
Oliver, what are you thinking?

163
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,238
Laurel gave me a case number to start with.

164
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,117
We need to know if Sebastian
really killed his father.

165
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,953
Then we figure out if there's a chance
he has the <i>Mirakuru</i> formula.

166
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,832
-I'm on it.
-What if this is just another trap set by Laurel?

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,169
She could be setting you up, and this time
you wouldn't have Sara to save you.

-I have to show you something.

Easy there, tiger.

-When did you start juicing?
-I'm not.

173
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,733
Then how do you explain what I just saw?

174
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,657
-You remember that night I went missing?
-Yeah, Thea and I were pissed.

175
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,827
I never told you guys
what really happened to me.

176
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,580
You were right about your friend Max.
He didn't OD.

177
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,499
He was murdered.
He was injected with something...

178
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,838
...and I was injected with the same thing.
But it didn't kill me, it made me stronger.

179
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,132
-Thea must be freaking.
-No, she doesn't know.

-I don't want her to.
-Why not?

181
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,221
I can't. Not yet. Not until I know
more about what happened to me.

182
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,516
-I don't wanna scare her.
-And you're not worried about scaring me?

183
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,852
Come on,
I was going crazy not telling someone.

184
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,687
So, what are you gonna do?

185
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,650
Well, the Arrow once told me
all I was good for was taking a beating.

186
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,030
Maybe it's time
I started handing out a few of my own.

187
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,281
I don't follow.

188
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,702
Now I don't need his help to protect this city.
Let's find us a bad guy.

189
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,832
I have good news and bad news.

190
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,377
I suggest the good news first.
Tends to soften the blow of the bad news.

191
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,841
Okay, dealer's choice. Good news is we found
the case file on Sebastian's dad's murder.

192
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,386
-Anything in it to suggest he killed him?
-Oliver, meet bad news.

193
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,138
That file was sealed years ago.

194
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,476
And since the file is over 27 years old,
there is no digital copy for me to hack.

195
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,396
The only hard copy is stored
the old-fashioned way in the city archives.

196
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,066
So I go in and take it the old-fashioned way.

197
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,403
Except security in the file room is so
old-school, you need a keycard to get in...

198
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,324
...which even if you had, you wouldn't
know where to start looking for the file.

that beer on me at Tommy's party?

got broken up by the cops.
