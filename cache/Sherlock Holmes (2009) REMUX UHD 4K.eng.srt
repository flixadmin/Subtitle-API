1
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,290
Head cocked to the left...

2
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,250
partial deafness in ear.

3
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:42,668
First point of attack.

4
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,465
Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

5
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,636
Three, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

6
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:55,181
Four, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.

7
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,851
Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.

8
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,728
Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.

9
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,481
Full faculty recovery, unlikely.

10
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,055
I like the hat.

11
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,724
I just picked it up.

12
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,642
Did you remember your revolver?

13
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,060
Knew I forgot something.

14
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,439
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

15
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,901
I think that's quite enough.

16
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,903
You are a doctor, after all.

17
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,619
Always nice to see you, Watson.

18
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,999
Where's the inspector?

19
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,418
He's getting his troops lined up.

20
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,919
That could be all day.

21
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,771
Sherlock Holmes.

22
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,274
And his loyal dog.

23
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,193
Tell me, doctor...

24
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,196
as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

25
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,949
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

26
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,284
Watson. Don't.

27
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,165
Observe.

28
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,920
How did you see that?

29
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,463
Because I was looking for it.

30
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,387
Lord Blackwood.

31
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:23,722
You seem surprised.

32
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:27,393
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

33
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,354
Indeed.

34
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,237
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

35
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,406
Good lad.

36
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,825
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

37
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,578
We've one for the doctor...

38
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,246
and one for the rope.

39
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,206
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

40
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:51,250
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

41
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,043
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

42
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,670
Right, lads. That's it.

43
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,551
- Right. Pick him up, lads.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,636
If you don't mind.

45
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,556
Get him out of my sight.

46
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:13,272
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

47
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:18,694
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

48
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:21,780
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

49
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,783
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

50
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,620
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

51
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,955
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

52
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,791
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

53
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,293
Gentlemen.

54
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,669
Cheese.

55
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:07,493
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

56
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,501
156 over 80. Very good.

57
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,129
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

58
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:20,714
Tell me something.

59
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,883
Your new premises...

60
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,301
when are you moving in?

61
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,303
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:29,848
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

63
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,433
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.

64
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,062
Good God.

65
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:38,148
- That was gunfire.
- No.

66
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:41,402
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:44,822
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,199
I'll... I'll go and check.

69
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,326
- Your colleague...
- Yes?

70
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:51,870
Won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,164
No, he won't.

72
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,918
Mrs. Hudson.

73
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,671
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,548
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

75
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,301
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,345
He just needs another case. That's all.

77
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,597
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

78
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:14,184
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you
know, not in a domestic environment.

79
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,856
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

80
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:22,651
- Same time next week.
- Come along, captain.

81
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,070
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?

82
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,739
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,209
Permission to enter the armory?

84
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:40,419
Granted.

85
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,341
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,510
that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

87
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,849
It's not working.

88
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,642
Can I see that?

89
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,944
You know, it's been three months...

90
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,405
since your last case.

91
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,450
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...

92
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,041
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

93
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,461
I can't but agree.

94
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,215
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

95
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,008
The sooner, the better.

96
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:29,927
Paper.

97
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:33,806
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

98
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,267
from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

99
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:40,979
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,773
Is it November?

101
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,567
Yes, Holmes. All right.

102
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,529
Lady Radford reports...

103
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:50,906
Oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

104
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:55,369
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

105
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:59,248
I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,457
Yes.

107
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,211
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

108
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,553
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

109
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,430
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

110
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:19,685
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

111
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,895
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

112
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,189
They appear most sinister.

113
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:26,024
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

114
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,484
Is it poisoned, nanny?

115
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,987
There's enough of that in you already.

116
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:32,698
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

117
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,200
as per usual, nanny.

118
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,537
He's killed the dog. Again.

119
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,081
What have you done to Gladstone now?

120
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,376
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

121
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,211
He doesn't mind.

122
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,465
Holmes, as your doctor...

123
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:54,845
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...

124
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:59,057
you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

125
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,312
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

126
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,065
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

127
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,484
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.

128
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,195
Mary's coming.

129
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,282
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

130
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,327
Have you proposed yet?

131
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,539
- No, I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.

132
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:24,833
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

133
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,085
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

134
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,795
You wear a jacket.

135
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:45,187
A man? Outside my house?

136
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,695
Straighten your tie.

137
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,458
Holmes.

138
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,585
You're early.

139
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,463
Fashionably.

140
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,632
Miss Mary Morstan.

141
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,134
My goodness. What a pleasure.

142
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,930
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

143
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,473
Pleasure is mine.

144
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:29,731
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

145
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,858
I've heard so much about you.

146
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,361
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

147
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,738
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

148
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,408
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

149
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,327
making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

150
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,288
That's not quite right, is it?

151
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,416
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

152
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,297
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

153
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,885
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...

154
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,513
hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

155
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,142
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

156
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,352
so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

157
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,522
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

158
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,358
And neat, like all military men.

159
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,486
Now, I check his pockets.

160
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:22,034
A stub from a boxing match. Now I
can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

161
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,869
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

162
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,371
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

163
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,373
He's cost us the rent more than once.

164
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,210
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

165
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,880
What about a complete stranger?

166
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:37,799
- What can you tell about me?
- You?

167
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,567
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...

168
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,988
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.

169
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:42,137
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,390
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,273
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,067
Yes, well done. Shall we...?

173
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,527
- Waiter?
- Your student...

174
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,029
is a boy of 8.

175
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:02,074
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- Charlie, huh?

176
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,077
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

177
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,828
Is there ink on my face?

178
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,914
There's nothing wrong with your face.

179
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,041
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

180
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,377
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

181
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,170
A very impetuous act by the boy.

182
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,464
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

183
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:20,425
which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

184
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:25,097
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

185
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,103
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

186
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,605
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

187
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,233
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

188
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:39,111
that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

189
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,780
until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

190
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,615
You broke off the engagement...

191
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,618
and returned to England
for better prospects.

192
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,413
A doctor, perhaps.

193
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:58,046
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

194
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,968
I didn't leave him.

195
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,803
He died.

196
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,314
Well done, old boy.

197
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,936
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.

198
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,057
Get up and fight.

199
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,353
Fight.

200
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,021
- Finish it.
- Come on.

201
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,196
Get up and fight, come on.

202
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,406
Come on.

203
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:50,992
Get up.

204
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:55,330
Get up and fight.

205
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,047
That's it, big man, we're done.

206
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,132
You won, congratulations.

207
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:08,218
We ain't done yet.

208
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,268
This mustn't register
on an emotional level.

209
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,104
First, distract target.

210
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,065
Then block his blind jab.

211
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,110
Counter with cross to left cheek.

212
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,446
Discombobulate.

213
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,490
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.

214
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:33,785
Employ elbow block, and body shot.

215
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,289
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.

216
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,917
Now fracture.

217
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,296
Break cracked ribs.

218
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,131
Traumatize solar plexus.

219
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,091
Dislocate jaw entirely.

220
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,305
Heel kick to diaphragm.

221
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:59,769
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...

222
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,731
diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...

223
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,734
full psychological recovery,
six months...

224
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,485
capacity to spit at back of head...

225
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,863
neutralized.

226
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,893
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,226
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

228
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,937
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,857
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

230
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,237
You lot, shut up!

231
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,239
Charlie. Charlie!

232
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,533
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

233
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,423
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,763
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,452
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,287
Let's go.

237
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:24,873
What started merely as an experiment...

238
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,960
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:31,088
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

240
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:33,548
there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:36,468
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,970
But, now...

243
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,471
and this is remarkable...

244
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,266
if I change to atonal clusters...

245
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,772
voilá, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

246
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,524
as though a regimented flock.

247
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,317
Watson, this is exceptional.

248
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:57,280
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

249
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,075
How did you lure them in?

250
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:01,952
Excellent question.

251
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,997
Individually. I've
been at it for six hours.

252
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:07,833
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

253
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:12,504
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

254
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,132
You are Blackwood's last request.

255
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,604
Look at those towering structures.

256
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:34,067
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

257
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:36,153
Most innovative.

258
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,532
What an industrious empire.

259
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,203
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

260
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:49,416
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

261
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,297
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

262
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,135
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don Giovanni?

263
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:04,890
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

264
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:10,395
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

265
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:13,190
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

266
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,944
I knew she'd been engaged.

267
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,237
She had told me.

268
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,073
So that's no to the opera, then?

269
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:30,874
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.

270
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:32,542
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.

271
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,211
I want it back.

272
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,121
This way, Mr. Holmes.

273
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,251
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

274
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,879
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

275
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:19,548
Care to come along?

276
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:23,009
No, old cock. I've no business
with him whilst he's alive.

277
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:25,470
Suit yourself, mother hen.

278
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:40,569
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

279
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:44,531
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

280
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:47,993
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

281
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,744
As though...

282
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,248
he can get inside their heads.

283
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,254
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

284
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:02,174
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

285
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,845
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

286
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,890
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

287
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,808
having seven heads and 10 horns.

288
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:14,269
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

289
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:16,688
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

290
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,441
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

291
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,484
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

292
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:24,321
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

293
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:28,116
and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

294
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:30,577
I love what you've done with the place.

295
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,539
So glad you could accept my invitation.

296
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,751
I just have a small point of concern.

297
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:41,338
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.

298
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:44,341
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

299
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:48,470
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

300
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,056
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...

301
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:55,060
your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

302
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,775
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

303
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:04,611
Either that or,

304
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:08,657
shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

305
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:12,244
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

306
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:16,414
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

307
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:20,126
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

308
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:23,088
You see,
five lives might have been spared.

309
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:26,258
Those lives were a necessity.

310
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,594
Sacrifice.

311
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:33,056
Five meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

312
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:35,642
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

313
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,560
After you're hanged, of course.

314
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:42,565
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

315
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:46,361
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

316
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:50,615
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

317
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:55,620
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

318
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,456
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

319
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,209
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

320
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:05,839
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

321
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,091
That worries me.

322
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:11,594
Steel your mind, Holmes.

323
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,263
I need you.

324
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:15,849
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

325
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,600
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.

326
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:19,436
Pay attention.

327
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,939
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

328
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:26,151
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

329
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,863
or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

330
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:33,283
it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

331
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,375
What did he want?

332
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:44,127
Not sure.

333
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:47,255
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

334
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,009
Lord Henry Blackwood...

335
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:55,597
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

336
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:59,100
the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

337
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,686
and the attempted murder of a sixth.

338
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:04,356
Do you have any final words?

339
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,983
Death...

340
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,195
is only the beginning.

341
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,458
...forever and ever. Amen.

342
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,066
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

343
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:12,424
London's so bleak this time of year.

344
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,261
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

345
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,930
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

346
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,561
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

347
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:27,605
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

348
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,774
and your favorite...

349
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,318
olives from the Cyclades.

350
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,737
Thought we might have a little tea party.

351
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:38,366
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

352
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,618
A file with my name on it.

353
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,788
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

354
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,793
"Missing naval documents lead to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

355
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,965
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

356
00:28:57,428 --> 00:28:59,554
Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

357
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,641
I was simply studying your methods...

358
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,836
should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

359
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,814
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

360
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,774
But your signature was clear.

361
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:15,403
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

362
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,781
Or just another souvenir?

363
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:21,493
Let's not dwell on the past.

364
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,704
Shall we?

365
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:29,000
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

366
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:32,420
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

367
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:36,508
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

368
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,304
I'm Irene Adler again.

369
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:50,146
Thank you.

370
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:57,695
I need your help.

371
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,656
I need you to find someone.

372
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:04,702
Why are you always so suspicious?

373
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,371
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

374
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,542
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

375
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:17,506
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

376
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,509
Who are you working for?

377
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,888
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

378
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,391
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

379
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,061
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

380
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:33,189
Do you remember The Grand?

381
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:35,566
They gave me our old room.

382
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,331
Hold the door.

383
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,374
Thanks, doctor.

384
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,440
Ma'am.

385
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:23,322
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

386
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:26,242
That's precisely why I hired you.

387
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,995
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

388
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,747
He'd better.

389
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:34,125
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

390
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,961
He's essential to my plan.

391
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:39,296
Get off out of it.

392
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,091
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

393
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:44,260
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

394
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,972
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

395
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,517
rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

396
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:53,602
God save the queen.

397
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:56,063
God save the queen, sir.

398
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:57,565
Get off out of it.

399
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,028
Look at you.

400
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,240
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

401
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:07,449
Are you a masochist?

402
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:09,702
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

403
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,664
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

404
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,499
Made a proper idiot out of you.

405
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,294
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

406
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:20,921
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

407
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:22,506
It doesn't matter.

408
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,801
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

409
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:28,804
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

410
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:31,056
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

411
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,184
We've done our last case together.

412
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,935
I've already read it.

413
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:37,813
Missing person:

414
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:40,983
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

415
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:42,193
Case solved.

416
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,654
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

417
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:47,448
- Midget.
- So you agree?

418
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,866
No, I don't agree.

419
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,619
It's more than technicality, you see.

420
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:54,872
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

421
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,542
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has...

422
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,210
What were you doing?

423
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,005
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

424
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:29,073
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

425
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:31,909
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.

426
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,495
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

427
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,499
Holmes. Where are you going?

428
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,921
Watson.

429
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,341
Watson.

430
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,197
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

431
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:14,243
My lucky day.

432
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:17,287
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

433
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,751
Don't move.

434
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:27,840
Now, what have we got here?

435
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,300
It's...

436
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,347
Thank you.

437
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:38,434
That's the Irene I know.

438
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,151
Good boy.

439
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,988
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

440
00:35:33,156 --> 00:35:35,532
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

441
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,867
She's scared of him.

442
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,202
Yet she works for him.

443
00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:41,747
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

444
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:44,666
but I advise you leave the case alone.

445
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:46,376
Well, I may not have a choice.

446
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:50,672
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

447
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,717
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

448
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,362
Get what's in your hand
out of my face.

449
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,678
- Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.

450
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,973
Sir, lnspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

451
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,810
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

452
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,062
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

453
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,730
No, "you" means you.

454
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,316
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...

455
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:10,818
Well...

456
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,279
it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

457
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:25,040
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

458
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,084
I pronounced the man dead myself.

459
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:30,504
What are the facts?

460
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:33,924
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

461
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,802
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

462
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:41,557
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

463
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:43,267
Don't try that.

464
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,687
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

465
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:48,438
Certainly.

466
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,065
What's the major concern?

467
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,693
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

468
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:55,737
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

469
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:57,406
Yes, as you should.

470
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,451
It's a matter of professional integrity.

471
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,581
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

472
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,932
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

473
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,518
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

474
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,814
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

475
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,985
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

476
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,990
You took your time, Holmes.

477
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,327
"And on the third day"...

478
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,123
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

479
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:50,375
and they're smashed open
from the inside.

480
00:37:50,543 --> 00:37:53,170
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

481
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,673
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

482
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,929
Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

483
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,266
Anyhow, where's our witness?

484
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,726
He's over there.

485
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:10,062
And apparently, he is cata...

486
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,271
Cat...

487
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:12,940
Catatonic, sir.

488
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,026
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

489
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:22,032
If you lot don't stop behaving like
quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.

490
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,702
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

491
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,288
Good day, sir.

492
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,874
Hello.

493
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,627
It's all right.

494
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,504
I'm a doctor.

495
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:48,141
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

496
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:52,980
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

497
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:54,606
Well?

498
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:57,901
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

499
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,570
He had no pulse.

500
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,910
Ready.

501
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,246
Down.

502
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,759
Good Lord.

503
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,929
That's not Blackwood.

504
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,934
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

505
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:36,940
Time of death?

506
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,486
Diptera is...

507
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,156
approximately...

508
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:47,909
two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

509
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:50,120
at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

510
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,622
May I borrow your pen?

511
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,713
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

512
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:10,932
I know what I saw.

513
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,144
It was Blackwood.

514
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,773
As clear as I see you.

515
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:22,235
And when the dead walk...

516
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,989
the living will fill these coffins.

517
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,386
Well,

518
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,559
Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.

519
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,769
You really believe he was resurrected?

520
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,938
The question is not if, but how.

521
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,107
- The game's afoot.
- Follow your spirit...

522
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,025
And upon this charge, cry:

523
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,529
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

524
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,325
There you are.

525
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,077
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

526
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:59,457
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

527
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,419
You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

528
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:05,880
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

529
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,382
right down to the number
and the placement...

530
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,801
of the bullets that killed him.

531
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,553
You have to admit, Holmes...

532
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,348
that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

533
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,641
is theoretically possible.

534
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:22,813
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

535
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,733
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

536
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,110
instead of theories to suit facts.

537
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:32,156
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

538
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,994
Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

539
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,789
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

540
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,334
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

541
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,543
Very good, Watson.

542
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:48,422
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

543
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,342
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored...

544
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,052
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.

545
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,515
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H. is for?

546
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,226
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

547
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,357
They should be able to
give us an address.

548
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,071
What a coincidence.

549
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,699
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

550
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,284
Really? I think not.

551
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,663
The time. I have to get back, Holmes.

552
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,706
Taking tea with the in-laws.

553
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,167
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

554
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,878
- No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.

555
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,381
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

556
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,800
Even if it's to do with Mary?

557
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:42,393
I see two men. Brothers.

558
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,395
Not in blood, but in bond.

559
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,775
What of Mary?

560
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:53,737
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

561
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,906
Go on.

562
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,285
I see patterned tablecloths...

563
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,912
and, oh, china figurines...

564
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,039
and, oh, lace doilies.

565
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:05,749
Doilies.

566
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,420
Lace doilies? Holmes.

567
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,882
Does your depravity know no bounds?

568
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,884
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...

569
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,886
and, oh, she has a beard and...

570
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,221
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

571
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,015
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?

572
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:23,100
Please, enough.

573
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:27,438
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

574
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,983
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

575
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,234
Do you have my money?

576
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,945
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

577
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,198
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.

578
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,450
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!

579
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,162
I see.

580
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:50,669
Thank you.

581
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,467
Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

582
00:43:56,635 --> 00:44:00,137
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

583
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:04,058
And I have some change in my pocket.

584
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:10,981
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.

585
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,734
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

586
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,903
I have to go see Mary.

587
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,988
Give her my best.

588
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,908
And her family, as well.

589
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,033
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

590
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,786
having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

591
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:09,456
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

592
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:14,044
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

593
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,088
Something did.

594
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,841
Irene Adler was here.

595
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,095
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

596
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,392
Putrefaction.

597
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:36,734
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

598
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,573
Phosphorous.

599
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,242
Formaldehyde.

600
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,089
It looks like...

601
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,176
he was attempting to combine...

602
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:05,721
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

603
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,606
More importantly...

604
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,734
let's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

605
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,529
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

606
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,659
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

607
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,966
Peculiar.

608
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,721
Hydrated rhododendron.

609
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,998
Holmes.

610
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,667
Look at the crest.

611
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,586
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

612
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,505
Of course he was.

613
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,966
The question is, to what end.

614
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:31,181
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

615
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,683
How so?

616
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,060
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

617
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,855
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

618
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,523
Yes.

619
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,692
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

620
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,195
Is it candy floss? Molasses?

621
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,739
Maple syrup?

622
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,031
Barley sugar.

623
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,950
Toffee apple.

624
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,040
Let me guess.

625
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,334
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

626
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:03,464
you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

627
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,883
Just one minute, boys.

628
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,843
Oh, Dredger.

629
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,864
Meat...

630
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,407
or potatoes?

631
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,785
My 10 minutes are up.

632
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,631
You all right?

633
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,042
Holmes...

634
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,002
what is that?

635
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,402
Holmes!

636
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,540
Watson...

637
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,168
what have you done?

638
00:55:25,347 --> 00:55:27,139
I haven't slept all night.

639
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:29,308
Not a wink.

640
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,145
Why I ever believed...

641
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:37,066
that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

642
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:41,445
- having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

643
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:45,866
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last seven months.

644
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:47,827
Would you like to know my conclusion?

645
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:51,330
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

646
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:55,668
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

647
00:55:55,836 --> 00:56:00,423
where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

648
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:04,593
You've never complained
about my methods before.

649
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,054
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

650
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:09,098
How am I complaining? I never complain.

651
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:12,184
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

652
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:16,564
or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

653
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:17,940
We have a barter system.

654
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,443
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

655
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,652
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

656
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,447
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

657
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,781
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

658
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,408
Gladstone is our dog.

659
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:32,621
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

660
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:41,672
I understand.

661
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,549
- Do you?
- I do.

662
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,178
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

663
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,305
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

664
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:50,639
I'm not sensitive.

665
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,017
What you need is a rest.

666
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:55,853
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

667
00:56:56,021 --> 00:57:00,441
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

668
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:04,403
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

669
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:07,656
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.

670
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,617
- You are not...
- What, invited?

671
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:12,411
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

672
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,121
Now you're not making any sense.

673
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:15,331
You're not human.

674
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:16,832
John Watson?

675
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:19,376
Yes.

676
00:57:19,544 --> 00:57:21,337
Your bail's been posted.

677
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,761
Mary.

678
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:34,100
Just Watson.

679
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,361
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

680
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,867
Step lively.

681
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:57,748
Back off. Back off.

682
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,376
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

683
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,506
Right, you, you're out.

684
00:58:06,675 --> 00:58:08,217
Until next time, Big Joe.

685
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:10,761
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

686
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:14,473
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

687
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:16,835
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

688
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:20,312
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

689
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:23,274
Now, please tell me you have answers.

690
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:25,734
All in good time, Lestrade.

691
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:29,405
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor
game where we guess what you're thinking?

692
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:32,783
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

693
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:36,787
I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

694
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:40,082
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

695
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:41,584
For whom?

696
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:45,462
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

697
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:59,518
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

698
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:02,104
but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

699
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:10,279
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

700
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:14,241
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

701
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:15,784
As to where I am...

702
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:20,122
I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.

703
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,417
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

704
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:27,129
the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...

705
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,547
a Brittany sage.

706
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:33,469
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

707
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:37,640
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

708
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,143
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

709
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,729
Lord Chief Justice,
that'd be your official title.

710
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:47,483
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

711
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:49,985
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

712
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,696
you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

713
00:59:52,864 --> 00:59:54,657
in whose headquarters we now sit...

714
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,993
on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

715
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:02,581
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

716
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:09,004
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

717
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,175
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

718
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,095
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

719
01:00:16,263 --> 01:00:18,180
and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

720
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,685
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

721
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,354
Yes.

722
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:28,190
They're practically interesting.

723
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,775
Be as skeptical as you like.

724
01:00:29,943 --> 01:00:33,404
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

725
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:36,991
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

726
01:00:37,158 --> 01:00:39,952
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

727
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,706
We know
you don't believe in magic, Mr. Holmes.

728
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:46,458
We don't expect you to share our faith...

729
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:48,043
merely our fears.

730
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,796
Fear is the more infectious condition.

731
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,965
In this instance...

732
01:00:55,343 --> 01:00:57,052
fear of your own child.

733
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:02,016
Blackwood is your son.

734
01:01:02,183 --> 01:01:05,644
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

735
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:07,730
with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

736
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,900
together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

737
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,111
which makes you either brothers...

738
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:17,031
or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

739
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:25,497
Very few people
are privy to that information...

740
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:27,499
and we want to keep it that way.

741
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:34,423
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

742
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,008
His mother wasn't my wife...

743
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,427
but she shared our beliefs.

744
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:40,763
She was a powerful practitioner...

745
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,599
though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

746
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,603
Death followed him wherever he went.

747
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,189
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

748
01:01:50,357 --> 01:01:53,525
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

749
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,279
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

750
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,990
The boy was a curse.

751
01:02:00,158 --> 01:02:03,118
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

752
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,703
His power grows daily.

753
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:06,955
His resurrection is evidence of that.

754
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,625
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

755
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:14,296
His secret lies in the book
of spells. This is the source of his power.

756
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:17,758
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of the world.

757
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:20,719
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

758
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:24,515
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

759
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:29,144
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

760
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,854
Yes.

761
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:33,941
So...

762
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:39,571
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

763
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:41,824
is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

764
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:44,493
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

765
01:02:46,121 --> 01:02:47,955
But not for you.

766
01:02:48,123 --> 01:02:50,082
And certainly not for a price.

767
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,922
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

768
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,926
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

769
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,429
Food for thought.

770
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,874
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

771
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:35,711
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

772
01:03:36,296 --> 01:03:40,215
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality...

773
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,885
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

774
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,386
...of the wine.

775
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:48,474
Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally.

776
01:03:50,018 --> 01:03:51,560
I found your man.

777
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:54,062
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

778
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:56,315
If you still need him.

779
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,068
Oh, dear.

780
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:05,240
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

781
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,742
He's a professor, isn't he?

782
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,828
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.

783
01:04:09,996 --> 01:04:14,249
I've never known a professor to carry
a gun, and on such a clever contraption.

784
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:20,756
Eye patch, nice touch.

785
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:23,759
So case closed...

786
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,929
which makes this a social visit.

787
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,015
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

788
01:04:30,725 --> 01:04:33,227
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

789
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:35,604
which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

790
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:39,316
Let it breathe.

791
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,402
I've never been in over my head.

792
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:46,114
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

793
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:50,369
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

794
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:56,959
If I'm in danger, so are you.

795
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,297
Come with me.

796
01:05:04,926 --> 01:05:06,635
What if we trusted each other?

797
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:09,596
You're not listening.

798
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:14,351
I'm taking you to either the
railway station or the police station.

799
01:05:26,197 --> 01:05:27,656
So...

800
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:32,828
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.

801
01:05:34,706 --> 01:05:36,331
You decide.

802
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,917
- Which will it be?
- What...?

803
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,378
I told you to let it breathe.

804
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,339
Can you taste the comet?

805
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:53,765
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

806
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:56,852
Never.

807
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:47,796
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

808
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:50,465
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

809
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,970
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
- Naturally, sir.

810
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,931
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

811
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:01,351
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

812
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,521
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

813
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,982
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

814
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:13,029
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

815
01:08:13,197 --> 01:08:16,950
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

816
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:22,831
Just joking about the wife, sir.

817
01:08:27,378 --> 01:08:28,879
We've checked everything, sir.

818
01:08:29,046 --> 01:08:31,882
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

819
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:34,217
So body in the bathtub...

820
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:38,638
his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

821
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,683
his ring, sir.

822
01:08:57,825 --> 01:08:59,534
Why did you drain the water?

823
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:03,371
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

824
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:07,542
The decent thing to do is to catch the
killer, not provide comfort for the corpse.

825
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,725
What is that?

826
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:29,231
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.

827
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:33,026
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...

828
01:09:33,194 --> 01:09:36,905
high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

829
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,407
Constable, you could do worse...

830
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,869
than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

831
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:45,747
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

832
01:10:45,057 --> 01:10:46,725
Mr. Holmes?

833
01:10:55,276 --> 01:10:57,527
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

834
01:10:57,695 --> 01:10:59,487
It was in the pantry, sir.

835
01:10:59,947 --> 01:11:01,740
I don't know what to make of this.

836
01:11:01,908 --> 01:11:03,658
Excellent work.

837
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,577
Adieu.

838
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:47,035
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

839
01:11:48,245 --> 01:11:49,496
Sir Thomas is dead.

840
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,709
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

841
01:11:57,755 --> 01:11:59,756
Have you lost your mind?

842
01:11:59,924 --> 01:12:01,883
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

843
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,927
Of course he does.

844
01:12:05,846 --> 01:12:07,681
That's why we're here.

845
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:10,892
That's why we're all here.

846
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,568
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

847
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:25,115
A magnificent but simple purpose.

848
01:12:26,242 --> 01:12:28,326
To create a new future.

849
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:32,414
A future ruled...

850
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:34,332
by us.

851
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:41,423
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

852
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,300
Magic will lead the way.

853
01:12:44,468 --> 01:12:46,928
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

854
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,014
they'll bow down in fear.

855
01:12:53,978 --> 01:12:57,772
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

856
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,274
It will be again.

857
01:13:00,192 --> 01:13:02,444
The Civil War has made them weak.

858
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:07,449
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

859
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,826
so we'll take it back.

860
01:13:11,454 --> 01:13:13,830
We will remake the world...

861
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,250
create the future.

862
01:13:18,544 --> 01:13:22,297
These men are with me, Standish...

863
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,007
but...

864
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,675
are you?

865
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:29,054
No, sir. I am not.

866
01:13:30,056 --> 01:13:32,932
These powers that you're playing with...

867
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,143
no man can control.

868
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:39,064
Well, gentlemen...

869
01:13:40,566 --> 01:13:43,985
someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

870
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:48,323
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

871
01:13:53,537 --> 01:13:55,538
Save me!

872
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:13,306
Gentlemen...

873
01:14:13,474 --> 01:14:15,350
don't be afraid.

874
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:18,144
As you can see...

875
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:21,439
we are protected.

876
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,193
Come, drink your allegiance here.

877
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:35,203
You control the police, now use them.

878
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:48,216
Didn't know you were here.

879
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:51,636
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

880
01:14:53,013 --> 01:14:54,514
Be my guest.

881
01:14:56,016 --> 01:14:57,960
- In here, chaps.
- Where would you like me...

882
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,478
- to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.

883
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:14,200
- Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

884
01:15:14,368 --> 01:15:17,245
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

885
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,414
Yes.

886
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,958
Thanks for that, by the way.

887
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:28,464
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

888
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:37,098
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

889
01:15:43,063 --> 01:15:45,106
None of it human.

890
01:15:45,983 --> 01:15:47,525
He's not a butcher, let me see.

891
01:15:57,661 --> 01:15:59,913
Yellow flame, green bursts.

892
01:16:00,497 --> 01:16:01,789
An industrial worker.

893
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,362
Coal.

894
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,255
River silt.

895
01:16:09,423 --> 01:16:11,799
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

896
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,135
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry, what?

897
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,971
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

898
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,973
I wondered.

899
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:22,477
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

900
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:24,020
It's on the stepladder.

901
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:38,993
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

902
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,580
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

903
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:44,749
It'll probably be a factory by the river.

904
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,668
What's that?

905
01:16:47,086 --> 01:16:48,586
Never mind.

906
01:16:50,422 --> 01:16:52,674
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

907
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,175
No, not a clue.

908
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:57,303
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

909
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,846
Nine Elms.

910
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,015
A factory by the river.

911
01:17:01,392 --> 01:17:04,352
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

912
01:17:04,937 --> 01:17:06,604
Not us.

913
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,774
You.

914
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:11,693
Yes.

915
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,321
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

916
01:17:24,415 --> 01:17:25,707
He's left it there on purpose.

917
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,688
More coal, doctor.

918
01:17:53,152 --> 01:17:55,862
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

919
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,572
Oh, God. Yeah.

920
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,574
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

921
01:17:59,742 --> 01:18:02,410
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

922
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:06,414
You would not last one day in the navy.

923
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:12,670
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

924
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:16,424
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

925
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:20,094
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

926
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,430
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

927
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,849
If only just a sense.

928
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:29,187
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

929
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:52,251
Come on, come on.

930
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:09,102
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

931
01:19:09,269 --> 01:19:11,938
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

932
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:26,869
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

933
01:19:27,037 --> 01:19:28,621
Like what?

934
01:19:28,914 --> 01:19:31,999
Not sure. Something mechanical.

935
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,793
Holmes.

936
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,170
Look at this.

937
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:01,946
- 1:18.
- Chapter and verse.

938
01:20:02,114 --> 01:20:05,867
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

939
01:20:06,285 --> 01:20:09,287
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

940
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:14,292
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

941
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,336
beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

942
01:20:18,922 --> 01:20:22,884
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

943
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:27,972
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

944
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,558
Show me your face,
it'll be the end of your world.

945
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:32,685
Save your bullets, Watson.

946
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:34,353
A gift for you.

947
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:41,819
What was that about saving bullets?

948
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,536
She followed you here, Holmes.

949
01:20:52,539 --> 01:20:55,416
You led your lamb to slaughter.

950
01:20:58,378 --> 01:20:59,754
Holmes.

951
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,090
This game was designed to hurt.

952
01:21:14,853 --> 01:21:16,187
Watson!

953
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:21,609
It's warm in here, Watson.

954
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,451
In over your head yet, darling?

955
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:40,086
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

956
01:21:40,254 --> 01:21:41,921
Let me take your weight.

957
01:21:43,048 --> 01:21:44,840
Give us a leg up, old boy.

958
01:21:47,344 --> 01:21:49,136
These German locks
always give me trouble.

959
01:21:54,893 --> 01:21:56,394
It's a band saw.

960
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:01,816
No matter, we have plenty of time.

961
01:22:03,527 --> 01:22:04,860
Holmes.

962
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:14,996
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

963
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,964
Holmes, hurry up.

964
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,349
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

965
01:23:00,459 --> 01:23:02,460
And we'll bounce in three, two...

966
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:05,046
one.

967
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:17,626
Thank you.

968
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,393
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

969
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:30,696
Thank you.

970
01:23:31,114 --> 01:23:33,741
We should help the doctor.

971
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:46,837
Holmes!

972
01:25:18,597 --> 01:25:20,389
Mr. Holmes.

973
01:25:22,434 --> 01:25:23,851
Sir.

974
01:25:27,397 --> 01:25:29,315
Mr. Holmes.

975
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:41,869
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

976
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:46,957
Sir!

977
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:50,794
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

978
01:25:52,088 --> 01:25:53,589
Now, Watson's alive.

979
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:56,675
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

980
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,818
Will the train be departing on time?

981
01:26:14,986 --> 01:26:17,279
The train's been delayed, madam.

982
01:26:17,447 --> 01:26:19,490
Shouldn't be long now, though.

983
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:39,426
The train will depart when I tell it to.

984
01:26:41,054 --> 01:26:44,348
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

985
01:26:48,687 --> 01:26:51,021
I fulfilled my contract.

986
01:26:51,189 --> 01:26:52,439
I found Reordan.

987
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:54,775
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

988
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,777
So that's me, finished.

989
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:00,823
Your job was to manipulate Holmes'
feelings for you...

990
01:27:00,991 --> 01:27:02,575
not succumb to them.

991
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:07,288
You have fulfilled nothing.

992
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:10,124
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

993
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:14,295
Finish the job or the next dead body...

994
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:17,089
will be Sherlock Holmes.

995
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,659
The surgeon should be along shortly.

996
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,833
He should be able to rest now.

997
01:27:55,962 --> 01:27:57,463
Excuse me.

998
01:28:01,468 --> 01:28:03,177
Is that the best you can do?

999
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:05,179
Yes, for now.

1000
01:28:05,347 --> 01:28:07,473
I must attend to my other patients.

1001
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:10,893
Doctor.

1002
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:13,020
Doctor.

1003
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,105
Please.

1004
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:22,029
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1005
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:25,616
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1006
01:28:26,576 --> 01:28:29,536
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1007
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:38,045
Solve this.

1008
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,881
Whatever it takes.

1009
01:28:51,184 --> 01:28:53,060
This is beyond your control.

1010
01:28:53,228 --> 01:28:54,853
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.

1011
01:28:55,021 --> 01:28:57,815
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.

1012
01:28:57,982 --> 01:29:01,860
It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.

1013
01:29:02,028 --> 01:29:03,737
- Solve this.
- Are you, Holmes?

1014
01:29:03,863 --> 01:29:05,932
Accept that this was beyond your control.

1015
01:29:06,032 --> 01:29:09,368
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public in frenzy.

1016
01:29:09,536 --> 01:29:10,869
Holmes!

1017
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:33,559
Widen your gaze.

1018
01:29:33,727 --> 01:29:36,270
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.

1019
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:40,858
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1020
01:29:41,025 --> 01:29:43,110
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.

1021
01:29:43,278 --> 01:29:45,764
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.

1022
01:29:45,864 --> 01:29:48,808
- His power grows daily.
- This is the source of his power.

1023
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:49,908
I need you.

1024
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,619
His secret lies in the book of spells.

1025
01:30:19,898 --> 01:30:22,691
Three more will die...

1026
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:26,111
and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1027
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:29,156
We know you don't believe in magic.

1028
01:30:30,325 --> 01:30:32,075
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1029
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:33,243
Is that better?

1030
01:30:33,411 --> 01:30:35,871
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

1031
01:30:37,123 --> 01:30:41,001
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1032
01:30:48,092 --> 01:30:50,010
Give up, Holmes.

1033
01:30:52,305 --> 01:30:54,681
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1034
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:02,189
Good morning.

1035
01:31:05,777 --> 01:31:08,862
Now, you need to work.

1036
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:10,989
Familiar artwork.

1037
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:15,369
You look gorgeous.

1038
01:31:18,456 --> 01:31:20,833
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1039
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,217
You made the front page.

1040
01:31:30,635 --> 01:31:32,344
Only a name and no picture.

1041
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:37,683
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1042
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:39,893
and that's my area of expertise.

1043
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:42,020
I feel safer already.

1044
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:46,608
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1045
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:49,528
Yes.

1046
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:52,239
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1047
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:55,242
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1048
01:32:00,498 --> 01:32:01,999
Well, I'm...

1049
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,959
I'm just so...

1050
01:32:04,127 --> 01:32:05,711
very glad that you're...

1051
01:32:05,879 --> 01:32:07,254
well...

1052
01:32:07,714 --> 01:32:09,172
with us.

1053
01:32:13,344 --> 01:32:17,681
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1054
01:32:18,182 --> 01:32:21,226
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1055
01:32:21,394 --> 01:32:23,854
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1056
01:32:24,022 --> 01:32:27,441
he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1057
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:32,613
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1058
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,283
But that's for another time.

1059
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:39,620
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1060
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:43,081
that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1061
01:32:43,249 --> 01:32:46,335
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1062
01:32:46,502 --> 01:32:50,047
I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1063
01:32:50,214 --> 01:32:52,132
with a few enhancements of my own.

1064
01:32:53,092 --> 01:32:57,137
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1065
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:01,808
and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

1066
01:33:03,102 --> 01:33:05,646
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1067
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:08,982
share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1068
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,944
that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1069
01:33:12,111 --> 01:33:14,196
a gateway to immeasurable power.

1070
01:33:14,364 --> 01:33:18,116
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1071
01:33:18,284 --> 01:33:20,661
the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1072
01:33:21,454 --> 01:33:24,373
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

1073
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:27,626
the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and hair of a man.

1074
01:33:27,794 --> 01:33:29,169
Map.

1075
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,842
The points of the star
represent the five murdered girls...

1076
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,971
but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1077
01:33:39,222 --> 01:33:40,514
It's a widely held belief...

1078
01:33:40,682 --> 01:33:44,059
that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1079
01:33:44,227 --> 01:33:46,979
are coded references to this system.

1080
01:33:47,146 --> 01:33:50,148
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men...

1081
01:33:50,316 --> 01:33:53,819
each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1082
01:33:53,987 --> 01:33:55,362
therefore the system.

1083
01:33:57,156 --> 01:33:59,366
Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1084
01:33:59,534 --> 01:34:01,535
We found his body here.

1085
01:34:02,161 --> 01:34:05,372
Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1086
01:34:06,332 --> 01:34:07,874
He died here.

1087
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,335
Standish, ambassador to America...

1088
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:13,630
where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1089
01:34:13,798 --> 01:34:17,884
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1090
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:20,303
is here.

1091
01:34:20,972 --> 01:34:24,307
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1092
01:34:24,475 --> 01:34:27,310
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1093
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:29,396
Only the lion remaining.

1094
01:34:29,564 --> 01:34:30,731
Right here.

1095
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,568
Parliament.

1096
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:40,866
Right.

1097
01:34:41,034 --> 01:34:44,578
You four stay here
and the rest of you come with me.

1098
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:47,622
- Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1099
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:52,919
Ladies first.

1100
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,588
Now.

1101
01:34:55,548 --> 01:34:56,908
Follow these instructions.

1102
01:34:57,008 --> 01:34:58,550
- Aren't you...?
- Go.

1103
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,347
Hello, hello, hello.

1104
01:35:04,974 --> 01:35:07,100
Did the devil turn up?

1105
01:35:08,352 --> 01:35:09,728
Well...

1106
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:11,772
never mind.

1107
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:13,940
You got the next best thing.

1108
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:41,635
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1109
01:35:42,804 --> 01:35:44,304
but Mr. Holmes here...

1110
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:48,141
he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1111
01:35:49,352 --> 01:35:50,894
and the order.

1112
01:35:52,939 --> 01:35:53,980
I see.

1113
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:58,318
Well, at least that solves the great
mystery as to how you became inspector.

1114
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:05,617
Excuse me, my Lord...

1115
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,662
but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1116
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:12,499
Well, inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement...

1117
01:36:13,126 --> 01:36:16,503
so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1118
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,091
Thank you, Lestrade.

1119
01:36:21,592 --> 01:36:23,176
My Lord.

1120
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:32,144
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1121
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:34,312
or just the one I prevented?

1122
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,941
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1123
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:45,240
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1124
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,369
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1125
01:36:50,121 --> 01:36:52,831
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1126
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,376
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1127
01:36:56,544 --> 01:36:58,879
than a case where everything
goes against you.

1128
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:03,049
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1129
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:04,843
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1130
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,304
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1131
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:12,100
Very clever.

1132
01:37:12,518 --> 01:37:15,061
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1133
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:16,897
It's mercy.

1134
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:19,566
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1135
01:37:19,734 --> 01:37:22,194
Don't you see that it's for their own...?

1136
01:37:24,989 --> 01:37:27,699
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1137
01:37:27,867 --> 01:37:30,744
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1138
01:37:30,912 --> 01:37:32,329
and you've given it to me.

1139
01:37:32,496 --> 01:37:33,705
I've told you nothing.

1140
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:37,584
But your clothes say
infinitely more than you could ever hope.

1141
01:37:37,752 --> 01:37:39,919
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1142
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:44,424
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1143
01:37:45,718 --> 01:37:48,929
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.

1144
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:53,099
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1145
01:37:55,353 --> 01:37:58,104
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1146
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:01,358
in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1147
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:04,444
Both houses meet today.

1148
01:38:05,029 --> 01:38:07,030
The whole government will be present.

1149
01:38:16,415 --> 01:38:19,709
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1150
01:38:20,419 --> 01:38:22,212
You would have made a valuable ally.

1151
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:31,554
How terrible is wisdom...

1152
01:38:31,722 --> 01:38:34,599
when it brings no profit to the wise.

1153
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:36,810
We take power at noon.

1154
01:38:37,812 --> 01:38:40,146
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1155
01:39:07,008 --> 01:39:09,259
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1156
01:39:09,427 --> 01:39:11,928
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1157
01:39:12,096 --> 01:39:14,931
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1158
01:39:15,099 --> 01:39:17,600
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1159
01:39:17,768 --> 01:39:18,935
Anyway.

1160
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:22,605
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1161
01:39:22,773 --> 01:39:24,441
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1162
01:39:24,608 --> 01:39:26,318
I hope you know what you're doing.

1163
01:39:27,028 --> 01:39:28,695
Here's the key.

1164
01:39:28,863 --> 01:39:32,699
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1165
01:39:34,076 --> 01:39:35,118
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1166
01:39:35,286 --> 01:39:36,536
If you would, captain...

1167
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:39,539
take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1168
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:43,043
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1169
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,627
Right away, sir.

1170
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:53,261
The end is nigh.

1171
01:39:53,429 --> 01:39:57,724
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1172
01:39:57,892 --> 01:40:01,519
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1173
01:40:01,687 --> 01:40:04,356
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1174
01:40:04,523 --> 01:40:07,359
and every eye shall see him...

1175
01:40:07,526 --> 01:40:11,112
and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1176
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,282
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1177
01:40:44,313 --> 01:40:46,773
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1178
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:49,733
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1179
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:51,194
The first of its kind.

1180
01:40:51,362 --> 01:40:53,321
You deduced that how?

1181
01:40:53,489 --> 01:40:55,240
From my pocket.

1182
01:40:55,408 --> 01:40:58,410
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1183
01:40:58,577 --> 01:41:01,704
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1184
01:41:01,872 --> 01:41:03,957
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1185
01:41:08,754 --> 01:41:11,129
Now we know
what the ginger midget was working on.

1186
01:41:11,257 --> 01:41:13,133
It'll revolutionize warfare.

1187
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,843
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1188
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,637
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1189
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:20,890
Right. How many men
did you count on the...?

1190
01:41:24,395 --> 01:41:26,438
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1191
01:41:57,219 --> 01:41:58,511
Woman!

1192
01:41:59,638 --> 01:42:01,514
Shoot him. Now, please.

1193
01:42:13,903 --> 01:42:18,656
My lords.

1194
01:42:19,617 --> 01:42:20,867
The time has come...

1195
01:42:21,035 --> 01:42:23,369
for only those who believe to remain.

1196
01:42:25,206 --> 01:42:26,498
Behold...

1197
01:42:26,665 --> 01:42:28,541
Lord Blackwood.

1198
01:42:41,514 --> 01:42:43,181
You seem surprised.

1199
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:49,312
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1200
01:42:50,481 --> 01:42:54,234
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1201
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,863
Listen to the rabble outside.

1202
01:42:59,532 --> 01:43:01,032
Listen...

1203
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,575
to the fear.

1204
01:43:03,202 --> 01:43:04,869
I will use that as a weapon...

1205
01:43:05,037 --> 01:43:06,955
to control them...

1206
01:43:07,456 --> 01:43:08,706
and then the world.

1207
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:15,380
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1208
01:43:19,009 --> 01:43:22,011
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1209
01:43:24,682 --> 01:43:27,559
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1210
01:43:27,726 --> 01:43:28,935
Electromagnetic waves?

1211
01:43:29,103 --> 01:43:30,770
When triggered, the electrodes...

1212
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:33,523
will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.

1213
01:43:33,691 --> 01:43:37,569
The gas will travel up that shaft and
filter through the ventilation system...

1214
01:43:37,736 --> 01:43:40,363
that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...

1215
01:43:40,531 --> 01:43:43,616
the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.

1216
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:47,120
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1217
01:43:47,288 --> 01:43:49,122
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

1218
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:53,626
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1219
01:43:54,253 --> 01:43:55,878
indestructible...

1220
01:43:56,046 --> 01:43:57,297
and eternal.

1221
01:43:57,881 --> 01:43:59,716
Move it. Move it.

1222
01:44:00,134 --> 01:44:02,635
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1223
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:06,347
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1224
01:44:06,515 --> 01:44:09,475
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1225
01:44:09,643 --> 01:44:12,770
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1226
01:44:12,938 --> 01:44:16,524
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1227
01:44:37,296 --> 01:44:39,922
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Irene.

1228
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:51,225
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1229
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:56,147
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1230
01:44:56,315 --> 01:44:57,357
All others...

1231
01:44:57,524 --> 01:44:58,858
will perish.

1232
01:45:06,116 --> 01:45:07,784
I need your pipe.

1233
01:45:11,455 --> 01:45:12,872
Nut him!

1234
01:45:38,148 --> 01:45:39,565
- Right.
- What?

1235
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,401
- Coat.
- Got it.

1236
01:46:19,606 --> 01:46:20,898
The new order...

1237
01:46:22,359 --> 01:46:23,443
begins now.

1238
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:30,616
Woman.

1239
01:46:31,452 --> 01:46:33,077
What are you waiting for?

1240
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:37,165
That.

1241
01:46:48,469 --> 01:46:50,136
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1242
01:46:52,723 --> 01:46:54,599
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.

1243
01:47:21,627 --> 01:47:23,044
Relax...

1244
01:47:23,212 --> 01:47:24,253
I'm a doctor.

1245
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:38,828
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1246
01:48:40,872 --> 01:48:42,081
We're safe now.

1247
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:44,417
Interesting assessment.

1248
01:48:46,962 --> 01:48:48,629
Run off.

1249
01:48:50,882 --> 01:48:52,675
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1250
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:56,095
Fare thee well.

1251
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:03,269
I don't want to run anymore.

1252
01:49:06,148 --> 01:49:08,608
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1253
01:49:32,799 --> 01:49:33,966
No!

1254
01:50:39,825 --> 01:50:41,283
There was never any magic.

1255
01:50:43,537 --> 01:50:45,037
Only conjuring tricks.

1256
01:50:49,668 --> 01:50:51,669
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1257
01:50:51,837 --> 01:50:55,089
like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.

1258
01:50:55,257 --> 01:50:57,800
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1259
01:50:59,386 --> 01:51:01,887
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1260
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:05,349
like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1261
01:51:06,309 --> 01:51:10,271
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1262
01:51:11,606 --> 01:51:14,066
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1263
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:16,318
a mixture of egg and honey...

1264
01:51:16,987 --> 01:51:19,238
designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1265
01:51:24,244 --> 01:51:25,578
Holmes!

1266
01:51:25,746 --> 01:51:28,497
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1267
01:51:28,665 --> 01:51:30,499
required more modern science.

1268
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:33,586
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1269
01:51:33,754 --> 01:51:36,756
that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1270
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:40,259
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1271
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:43,095
That might've been a challenge for me...

1272
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:46,849
had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1273
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:54,607
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1274
01:51:54,775 --> 01:51:57,860
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1275
01:51:59,196 --> 01:52:01,614
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...

1276
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,366
yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1277
01:52:06,453 --> 01:52:09,789
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1278
01:52:10,957 --> 01:52:12,416
All it took was a spark.

1279
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,089
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1280
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:21,967
Ingenious.

1281
01:52:22,135 --> 01:52:25,596
Like all great performers, you saved
your pièce de résistance for the end:

1282
01:52:25,764 --> 01:52:30,559
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1283
01:52:30,727 --> 01:52:32,269
Had it worked...

1284
01:52:32,437 --> 01:52:35,314
your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1285
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:37,983
as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1286
01:52:38,151 --> 01:52:40,152
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1287
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,738
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...

1288
01:52:42,906 --> 01:52:45,616
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1289
01:52:45,951 --> 01:52:49,662
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1290
01:52:51,623 --> 01:52:54,500
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1291
01:52:54,668 --> 01:52:56,836
as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1292
01:52:57,671 --> 01:52:59,630
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.

1293
01:53:01,925 --> 01:53:04,009
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1294
01:53:14,813 --> 01:53:18,440
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1295
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:21,360
Then you'll be hanged.

1296
01:53:21,528 --> 01:53:23,362
Properly, this time.

1297
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:25,656
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1298
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,919
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1299
01:54:20,921 --> 01:54:22,463
I have.

1300
01:54:23,757 --> 01:54:25,341
Naked.

1301
01:54:29,304 --> 01:54:31,430
Storm's coming.

1302
01:54:31,723 --> 01:54:35,267
Well, we've still got a moment.

1303
01:54:39,272 --> 01:54:40,522
Moriarty.

1304
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:42,107
What?

1305
01:54:42,275 --> 01:54:44,276
That's his name.

1306
01:54:44,861 --> 01:54:47,029
And he is a professor.

1307
01:54:49,157 --> 01:54:51,241
Everyone has a weak spot...

1308
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,911
and he found mine.

1309
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:57,289
Where was it, precisely?

1310
01:55:08,176 --> 01:55:11,303
Please don't underestimate him.

1311
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:13,847
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1312
01:55:14,015 --> 01:55:16,266
and infinitely more devious.

1313
01:55:16,434 --> 01:55:18,644
We'll see about that.

1314
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,496
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1315
01:55:39,499 --> 01:55:41,166
Sadly...

1316
01:55:41,793 --> 01:55:43,460
yes.

1317
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,654
Just keep it under your hat.

1318
01:56:10,822 --> 01:56:13,741
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1319
01:56:13,908 --> 01:56:15,868
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1320
01:56:16,036 --> 01:56:17,036
Scribbles.

1321
01:56:17,203 --> 01:56:18,704
- Scribbles?
- Notes.

1322
01:56:18,872 --> 01:56:21,540
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1323
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:29,715
Come on, what's wrong?

1324
01:56:29,883 --> 01:56:32,426
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1325
01:56:32,594 --> 01:56:35,971
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1326
01:56:36,598 --> 01:56:38,891
Now, five minutes here
and we'll go home.

1327
01:56:39,059 --> 01:56:40,434
Our home.

1328
01:56:40,602 --> 01:56:42,269
Get up those stairs.

1329
01:56:50,195 --> 01:56:51,737
Don't worry, dear.

1330
01:56:51,905 --> 01:56:53,989
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1331
01:56:54,157 --> 01:56:56,450
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1332
01:56:57,077 --> 01:56:58,744
Holmes.

1333
01:57:00,771 --> 01:57:02,398
Good afternoon.

1334
01:57:02,665 --> 01:57:06,752
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1335
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,004
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1336
01:57:09,339 --> 01:57:11,882
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1337
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:15,761
and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1338
01:57:15,929 --> 01:57:17,262
Good afternoon, dear.

1339
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:19,098
Get on with it, Holmes.

1340
01:57:19,265 --> 01:57:22,935
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1341
01:57:23,103 --> 01:57:26,105
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1342
01:57:26,272 --> 01:57:27,856
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1343
01:57:28,024 --> 01:57:30,442
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1344
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:31,777
Carry on.

1345
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:35,489
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1346
01:57:35,657 --> 01:57:38,450
allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...

1347
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:40,661
and the neck to remain intact.

1348
01:57:40,829 --> 01:57:44,289
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1349
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:46,083
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1350
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:49,920
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1351
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,757
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1352
01:57:53,925 --> 01:57:55,634
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1353
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:01,598
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1354
01:58:01,766 --> 01:58:03,142
Right.

1355
01:58:03,309 --> 01:58:08,605
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.

1356
01:58:08,773 --> 01:58:12,401
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the rhododendron ponticum.

1357
01:58:12,569 --> 01:58:15,654
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...

1358
01:58:15,822 --> 01:58:19,324
for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1359
01:58:19,492 --> 01:58:22,911
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1360
01:58:23,079 --> 01:58:25,414
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1361
01:58:25,582 --> 01:58:27,457
...mad honey disease.

1362
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:31,420
Oh, he's demonstrating
the very effect I've just described.

1363
01:58:31,796 --> 01:58:33,130
He doesn't mind.

1364
01:58:35,675 --> 01:58:38,093
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1365
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,095
Mr. Holmes?

1366
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:43,640
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1367
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:47,477
Sir, lnspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1368
01:58:48,021 --> 01:58:51,356
- What is it is this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1369
01:58:51,524 --> 01:58:54,109
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1370
01:58:54,277 --> 01:58:57,863
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.

1371
01:58:58,323 --> 01:59:01,366
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1372
01:59:01,534 --> 01:59:03,327
Can I help you, officer?

1373
01:59:04,078 --> 01:59:05,120
Shot in the head.

1374
01:59:06,789 --> 01:59:08,540
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1375
01:59:09,667 --> 01:59:11,001
Yes.

1376
01:59:12,503 --> 01:59:14,755
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1377
01:59:14,923 --> 01:59:16,590
Indeed, sir.

1378
01:59:18,718 --> 01:59:20,052
Point blank range?

1379
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:21,470
Moriarty.

1380
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:25,057
Professor Moriarty.

1381
01:59:27,602 --> 01:59:29,561
Oh, there's a good boy.

1382
01:59:29,729 --> 01:59:31,313
Everything's gonna be fine.

1383
01:59:32,523 --> 01:59:34,191
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1384
01:59:34,359 --> 01:59:37,402
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1385
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:40,113
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1386
01:59:42,075 --> 01:59:45,118
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1387
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:46,995
not the poison.

1388
01:59:47,163 --> 01:59:49,581
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1389
01:59:49,749 --> 01:59:52,209
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.

1390
01:59:52,377 --> 01:59:54,836
And Adler was just the diversion.

1391
01:59:55,004 --> 01:59:57,631
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.

1392
01:59:57,799 --> 02:00:01,677
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.

1393
02:00:01,844 --> 02:00:04,137
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1394
02:00:04,305 --> 02:00:07,975
simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1395
02:00:08,768 --> 02:00:10,769
It's the future, Watson.

1396
02:00:13,064 --> 02:00:15,524
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1397
02:00:18,861 --> 02:00:20,445
- Well...
- Well...

1398
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:24,658
- Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1399
02:00:25,243 --> 02:00:26,660
Clarkie.

1400
02:00:28,913 --> 02:00:30,747
Case reopened.
