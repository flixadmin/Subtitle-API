1
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,479
<i>You've both met bad men before.</i>

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,799
The man we're about to meet
is the devil.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,279
<i>My name's Mosley.
Oswald Mosley.</i>

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:11,999
You've come to my attention.

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,519
Michael Gray.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,359
<i>You lost all your cousin's
money in America,</i>

7
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,279
<i>playing the fool.</i>

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,439
And poor old Arthur Shelby.

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,399
His wife has been seen
with another man.

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,279
Ah!

11
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,119
May you Peaky Blinders all rot.

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,839
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

13
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,399
- I want to meet your family.
- No, you don'<i>t.</i>

14
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,799
Mr Thomas,
it is the purest opium

15
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,639
that has ever arrived
in Europe.

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,319
£250,000.

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,039
All we have to do
is keep it here for a week.

18
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,199
I vote against it, Tom.

19
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,159
Those in favour?

20
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,079
Motion carried.

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,599
Agh!

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,839
We're talking about
an empty chair, Ada.

23
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,079
My chair. My throne.

24
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,559
<i>Someone wants my crown.
I think it might be Michael.</i>

25
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,999
Mr Shelby, my name
is Captain Swing.

26
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,239
<i>Michael, your kin,</i>

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,399
was making deals

28
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:04,039
<i>with the very men
who want you dead.</i>

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,839
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

30
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,479
It's time.

31
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,519
And you know it.

32
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:12,639
Let me guess.

33
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,359
Don't fuck
with the Peaky Blinders.

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,719
There will be a war,
and one of you will die.

35
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,759
But which one, I cannot tell.

36
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,199
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,719
Kill...and kill.

38
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:26,959
I have a job for you.

39
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,679
<i>I'm going to shoot
Oswald Mosley.</i>

40
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,919
<i>Kill the man, kill the message.</i>

41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,719
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man.

42
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,279
The Chinese, the Italians. <i>..</i>

43
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,919
Mosley knew nothing!

44
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,839
He knew nothing!

45
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,559
Who?!

46
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,279
Talk to me.

47
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,119
Maybe I've found him...

48
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,159
...Arthur,
the man I can'<i>t</i> defeat.

49
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,839
- Mosley.
- I don'<i>t</i> know.

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,239
I don'<i>t</i> fucking know.

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,199
Doesn't make sense.

52
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:20,959
Let's...

53
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,399
Let's go inside.

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,639
We'll work it out,
have a drink.

55
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,919
I need to walk.

56
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,479
The work's all done, Tommy.

57
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,159
It's all done.

58
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,479
We can walk away
from all of this.

59
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,199
It's so easy. It's so soft.

60
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,999
Such a small change.

61
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:33,023
http://hiqve.com/

62
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,839
Arthur took the bullets out.

63
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,999
On the <i>way</i> back.

64
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,919
He said you stopped
at a crossroads to throw up.

65
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,079
You're not even a soldier
any more, Tommy.

66
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,799
You didn'<i>t</i> check your weapon.

67
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,879
You're not a soldier,
you're a coward.

68
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:32,159
I heard you pull the trigger.

69
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,079
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye. <i>..</i>

70
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,999
If you still need a <i>way out...</i>

71
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,439
...here are six of them.

72
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,119
Mother.

73
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,759
They let you pass through.

74
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,239
They wouldn'<i>t</i> let me pass.

75
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,199
As if there were to be
another consequence.

76
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,359
Hello?

77
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,719
<i>Mr Shelby, I imagine
you're curious</i>

78
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,199
<i>as to who it was prevented
the assassination last night.</i>

79
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,359
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

80
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,799
<i>It's a unit of volunteers</i>

81
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,799
<i>bringing the bodies
of your dead to you,</i>

82
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,919
<i>to send to heaven
in your own way.</i>

83
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,959
<i>Last night's operation</i>

84
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,559
<i>was carried out by soldiers
from three Dublin brigades</i>

85
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,079
<i>of the Irish Republican Army.</i>

86
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,839
<i>We need to keep
Mr Mosley alive.</i>

87
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,919
That's all you need to know.

88
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,719
<i>Also, you should know
that saving Mosley's life</i>

89
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,159
<i>wasn't our only intervention
last night.</i>

90
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,959
We've made some changes

91
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,999
to the structure
of your organization.

92
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,359
Ever since you began
to build your empire. <i>..</i>

93
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,279
<i>...you</i>'ve had a crutch
to lean on.

94
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,119
Last night, we kicked
away that crutch.

95
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:36,239
<i>From now on, it will be us
that you lean on.</i>

96
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,239
<i>Please be aware, Mr Shelby,</i>

97
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,079
that the deaths
of your people...

98
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,559
<i>...are your own
responsibility...</i>

99
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,679
...because you consistently fail
to understand

100
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,319
your own limitations.

101
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,839
Mum...

102
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,919
<i>...it</i> was the ambitions
and strategies

103
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,399
of one man that caused this.

104
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,439
And I swear in the name
of Almighty God. <i>..</i>

105
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,799
<i>..</i> .No matter what it takes,

106
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,039
no matter how many lies
I have to tell. <i>..</i>

107
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,639
<i>...</i> I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

108
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,639
Monsieur.

109
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,399
Monsieur!

110
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,159
J'arrive.

111
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,879
You want a drink?

112
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,839
I'll have a glass of water,
please.

113
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,679
Windows got broke

114
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,199
because a lot of people here
are drunk and angry.

115
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,479
You know?

116
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,799
Half the men on this island
made their living

117
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
bootlegging till today.

118
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,999
The other half
fixed their boats.

119
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,559
Maybe you should take
your water into the hall.

120
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,319
Yeah, I learned
a lot of things in France.

121
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,879
Island is crawling with
you fucking commissary men.

122
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,439
Closing our warehouses down.

123
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,479
Throwing men out of work.

124
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,559
Ten years our boat ran whiskey

125
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,159
down the President Roads
to Boston.

126
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,679
Now we have fucking nothing.

127
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,119
And you sit in front of us
and order fucking water.

128
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,759
Is that meant to be a joke?

129
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:28,879
No.

130
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,159
I ordered water

131
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,679
because I no longer
drink alcohol...

132
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,519
...of any kind.

133
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:41,919
You, my friend...

134
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,519
<i>..</i> .are going to drink a toast.

135
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:49,919
You will raise your glass to
the poor people of Miquelon,

136
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,879
whose lives you bastards
have destroyed.

137
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,919
Drink it.

138
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,999
Hey.

139
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,279
Drink.

140
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,279
You're not leaving this bar

141
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,199
until you have raised a toast
to the people of Miquelon.

142
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:10,919
OK.

143
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,439
OK.

144
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,519
I understand that,
today of all days,

145
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:23,999
you would be angry.

146
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,159
But if you'd have read my card
instead of burning it,

147
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,799
you would realise

148
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,639
that this
is a misunderstanding.

149
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,319
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

150
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:41,039
but you need to sit down
and let me read my newspaper.

151
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,919
ll est bon, lui, hein?

152
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,199
Before this goes any further,
please let me explain.

153
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,679
I will not drink your toast,

154
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,879
cos four years ago,
I forswore alcohol.

155
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:03,999
Putain.

156
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:05,999
No.

157
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,319
Don't.

158
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,279
Since I forswore alcohol,

159
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,439
I've become a calmer
and more peaceful person.

160
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,279
Get in.

161
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,639
Sometimes,

162
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,799
in moments
of personal conflict...

163
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,359
<i>...</i> I can resort to my old <i>ways.</i>

164
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,039
If this were to happen now,

165
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,439
it would indeed be a black day
in Miquelon.

166
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,959
Now, my guests
will be arriving shortly.

167
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,479
I need to prepare the room.

168
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,839
Can you show me where?

169
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,519
Excusez-moi.
Ou est L'Hótel Robert?

170
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,079
They think we're distillery men
here to take our whiskey back.

171
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,079
We're late. He's always early.
Let's go.

172
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,119
<i>There will be a war,
and one of you will die.</i>

173
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,719
<i>But which one, I cannot tell.</i>

174
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,279
Hello, Tommy.

175
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,599
There's a man out there having
his face stitched back up.

176
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:44,119
That was a misunderstanding.

177
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,439
Hello, Michael.

178
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,479
I wasn'<i>t</i> sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

179
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,439
Oh, yeah?

180
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,039
What do you think?

181
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,639
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

182
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,199
Tommy and I
haven't even spoken.

183
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,599
Well,
we've both been very busy.

184
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:08,959
You've been too busy to punish
the people who killed her.

185
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,079
You know, Michael,

186
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,919
when you're dealing
with a very powerful enemy,

187
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,199
taking revenge
sometimes requires time.

188
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,999
You have to...

189
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,439
<i>..</i> .pick your moment.

190
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,039
That moment will come.

191
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:32,079
But now we have
a business interest in common,

192
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,759
and any bad blood will be
diluted by time

193
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,679
and a practical self-interest.

194
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,399
Well, Tommy, we're all keen
to hear what you have to say.

195
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,639
I'm very much looking forward

196
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,999
to working with you again,
Michael. You look very well.

197
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,399
You too.

198
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:50,679
How is the family?

199
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,999
Yeee-haaaw!

200
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,919
This projector is a gift
from Charlie fucking Chaplin,

201
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,799
and he sent it all
the <i>way</i> from Hollywood.

202
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,599
Now sit down
and watch the film.

203
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,439
Oh, God. No.
Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

204
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,799
don'<i>t</i> do that,
you're going to hurt yourself.

205
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,919
Yes, hi.
Is that the Bell Tavern?

206
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,519
If there's a Gypsy in there
called Johnny Dogs,

207
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,479
can you tell him to come
and round up his fucking kids?

208
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,799
It's Christmas.
A time for family.

209
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,399
Mum, I was watching <i>that.</i>

210
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,359
OK, everyone, OK.

211
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,759
When's he coming?

212
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:42,479
We're having
this Christmas party early

213
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,199
because tomorrow,

214
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:47,119
me and Charles and Ruby
are going on a big ship

215
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:50,239
to Canada,
to be with their daddy.

216
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,879
But we told Father Christmas
about the party. <i>..</i>

217
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,319
...and he brought
you all presents!

218
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,679
- Oh!
- Yes!

219
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,719
Race you!

220
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,119
Ada, where the fuck
is Father Christmas?

221
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,199
I don'<i>t</i> know.

222
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,639
He was supposed to be here
by now.

223
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,679
Yeah.

224
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,519
Where the fuck are you, Santa?

225
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,159
Ohhh! Ohhh!

226
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,639
Ugh!

227
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,559
No!

228
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,239
Ugh!

229
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,759
You've got me!

230
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,519
I've got a gun.
You'd better run!

231
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,479
You'd better run!

232
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,599
Gentlemen, today is
the last day of Prohibition.

233
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,599
But rather than see it
as the end of something,

234
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,319
I believe that,
for men like us,

235
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,879
it can present. <i>..</i>

236
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,359
...a new beginning.

237
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,839
A new opportunity.

238
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,279
An opportunity
I would like to share

239
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,959
with people I know I can trust.

240
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,559
For the last 12 years,

241
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,079
the men of this island

242
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,519
have been making their living
from bootlegging whiskey,

243
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,199
from navigating the waters

244
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,519
and avoiding
American border patrols.

245
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,719
But now that whiskey is
about to become legal,

246
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,119
the trade will fall
back into the hands

247
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:05,879
of capitalists from New York,
Boston and Toronto.

248
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,079
But...

249
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,839
...when one door closes...

250
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,359
...another one opens.

251
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,239
We can take advantage
of the systems

252
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,119
that are in place
on Miquelon Island

253
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,599
and offer selected boat crews

254
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,079
the opportunity
to carry on working.

255
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:23,759
But this time
with a different cargo.

256
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,839
You want me to pour?

257
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,279
No.

258
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,639
Now it's all over
the fucking island.

259
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,119
This is an island with
no morals and no opinions -

260
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,559
just a load of fucking boats

261
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,559
with nothing to carry
and nowhere to go.

262
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:00,519
The reason <i>why</i> Miquelon
was used to run whiskey

263
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:01,639
in the first place

264
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,399
is cos it sits outside
the territorial waters

265
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,759
of both America and Canada.

266
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:08,999
Technically,
it's French territory.

267
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,199
The FBI, the RCMP
have no jurisdiction.

268
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,999
Where do you get this stuff?

269
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,319
I have established

270
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,079
a supply chain
over the last four years

271
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,639
with associates in Belfast.

272
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,319
We decided it was time to
break into the American market.

273
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,839
That, my friend,

274
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,319
is the finest opium
in the world.

275
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,159
Delivered to my warehouse
in Liverpool

276
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,719
directly from Shanghai.

277
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,159
Michael...

278
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,799
When it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

279
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,079
I trust him.

280
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,159
What about the French police?

281
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,679
I have been in communication

282
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,839
with the Miquelon Prefet
des Gendarmes.

283
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,959
We fought in <i>two</i> of the
same battles in France.

284
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,199
We consider each other
comrades.

285
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,759
I have offered my comrade
12 million francs

286
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:01,399
if the boats between Miquelon
and Boston keep running.

287
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,359
We will have to take
your proposal

288
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,839
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

289
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,159
Perhaps we can meet

290
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,879
after you've spoken
with Uncle Jack, Michael,

291
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,879
who I believe
is your wife's uncle,

292
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,039
Jack Nelson.

293
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,799
Hey!

294
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,799
The guy knows things
that can get him killed,

295
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:20,879
and he says them out loud.

296
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:23,279
I have a high regard
for Mr Nelson.

297
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,359
He has a history
not unlike my own.

298
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:28,439
Jack Nelson's past
is forgotten.

299
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,199
Not forgotten. Fucking gone.

300
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,239
No, not gone,

301
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,439
just erased from the records,
like my own.

302
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,039
Give him my regards, will ya?

303
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
You haven'<i>t</i> touched your drink,
Tom.

304
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,039
You know, since we last met,
Michael...

305
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,759
...well, I've become
a better man.

306
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,639
I now realise that whiskey
is just fuel

307
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,519
for the loud engines
inside your head.

308
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,919
Catch yourself on!

309
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,399
What is this guy,
a fuckin' poet? Eh?

310
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,519
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don'<i>t yet</i> write <i>it.</i>

311
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,999
They say the fog
is going to get worse.

312
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,399
We'd better get off this island
before it traps us here.

313
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,959
Just understand -

314
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,319
Uncle Jack decides everything,
OK?

315
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,839
And I decide
when a meeting is over.

316
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,799
So sit down till I say.

317
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,639
Maith fear.

318
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,839
Put some fuckin' hair
on your chest, huh?

319
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,319
Good boy.

320
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:23,919
Now, give us all a poem
before we go.

321
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,879
Want to hear a poem?

322
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:32,239
Want to hear a poem?

323
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,639
What about you, Brainbox?

324
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,119
I was angry with my friend

325
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,919
I told my wrath

326
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,039
My wrath did end

327
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,239
I was angry with my foe

328
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,679
I told it not

329
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,079
My wrath did grow.

330
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:22,479
It's from <i>The Poison Tree</i>
by William Blake.

331
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,839
You won'<i>t</i> have heard of him.

332
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,279
Meeting over.

333
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,639
Oh, and by the way,

334
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:33,359
my friend,
the Police Commissioner,

335
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:37,559
told me that he'd spoken to
his FBI liaison officer,

336
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,999
and he told him

337
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,719
that there is an informant

338
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,759
in your organization
in South Boston.

339
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,079
I tell you this

340
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,119
in the spirit
of corporate hygiene.

341
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,599
Here you are, Michael.

342
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:58,999
Beware the man
with a bleeding heart <i>tattoo...</i>

343
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,919
<i>...with</i> "Maria" written in red.

344
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,919
Have a good day, gentlemen.

345
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,639
This time, don'<i>t</i> burn <i>it.</i>

346
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,679
Arthur...

347
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,279
Come on, come on.

348
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,399
God.

349
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,199
Oh, God,
if Polly was still here,

350
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,199
she'd never have let it
get this bad.

351
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:18,919
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

352
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,799
Arthur!

353
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:21,999
I am not Polly,

354
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,279
but I am still
your fucking sister.

355
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,559
You swore to me
you would stop using.

356
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:31,119
It's Christmas Day, Ada.
Christmas Day.

357
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,839
Yes, it's Christmas.

358
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,039
So where the fuck
are the fucking presents?

359
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,519
I'll be all right in a bit. <i>..</i>

360
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,519
Great.

361
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,959
My brother
off his face on junk.

362
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,759
Every day,

363
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,679
there's a question
without an answer.

364
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,639
A leak without a bucket.

365
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,079
Me without a clue what to do.

366
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,079
Fuck.

367
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,399
I love you, Ada.

368
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,799
Children!
Father Christmas has been!

369
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,399
Father Christmas!

370
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,159
What did you ask for?

371
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,679
What have we got?

372
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,399
Father Christmas got stuck up
the chimney again, did he?

373
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,039
Mm.

374
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,199
What ship are you on tomorrow?

375
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:28,719
Oh, the best,
the most expensive one.

376
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,559
And then we'll get there,

377
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,079
and Tommy will say,

378
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,439
"Hello, Lizzie.

379
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,039
"Hello, children,"
in that dead voice.

380
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,599
Come on, Lizzie,
he'll be on holiday.

381
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,879
Being away might change him.

382
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,639
Even on holiday, Ada,

383
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:47,239
even on top
of a rocky mountain,

384
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,519
he'll be the same <i>way</i>
he's been since Polly died.

385
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:51,959
No more Polly...

386
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,679
<i>..</i> .no more whiskey,

387
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:55,999
no more Tommy.

388
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,519
Yeah, I'm calling
from Miquelon Island,

389
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,839
from the police station.

390
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,719
There is a boat leaving
the island now,

391
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,959
heading across the border.

392
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,399
When it docks at St John's,

393
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,199
a man named Michael Gray
will board a ferry to Boston.

394
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,279
Listen very carefully.

395
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,439
He's wearing a dark coat,
a blue suit

396
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,559
and carrying a black briefcase.

397
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,039
Inside the briefcase

398
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,319
is five pound
of pure, refined opium.

399
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:53,959
Concerned citizen.

400
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:57,079
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

401
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,079
Yes, I do.

402
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,439
But I don'<i>t</i> drink any more.

403
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,199
I have business.

404
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,799
I need to get off this island.

405
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:32,319
You shouldn't be in here, Karl.

406
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,639
Are you going to answer it?

407
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,959
No, I don'<i>t</i> work for him
any more.

408
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,919
It might be important.

409
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,239
That's <i>why</i> I don'<i>t</i>
want to answer <i>it.</i>

410
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,119
Can I answer it?

411
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,399
No.

412
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:08,479
Hello?

413
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,679
Mm-hm.

414
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,679
Fuck.

415
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,639
Do you know who this man is?

416
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,399
All right, come on, Arthur.

417
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,719
Hiya...

418
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,039
Hey, that tickles.

419
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:26,959
His brother, Thomas Shelby,

420
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:30,079
says don'<i>t</i> serve him opium
ever again,

421
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,199
or someone will write

422
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,959
Arthur Shelby's name
on your chest

423
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,399
with a bayonet.

424
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,959
So. <i>..what</i> the fuck?

425
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,679
I can'<i>t</i> talk about anything
in here.

426
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:33,559
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

427
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,079
Tommy Shelby steps back
into your life and, right away,

428
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,319
this is what happens?

429
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,919
No names in here.

430
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,199
Sorry. Let's just call him
the devil.

431
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,319
Take a seat.

432
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,759
How is Laurence?

433
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,639
Oh, you know.
Missing his father.

434
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:54,599
What the fuck happened,
Michael?

435
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,639
- It's in hand.
- Whose hand?

436
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,479
No, really.

437
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,399
Whose fucking hand, Michael?
Hmm?

438
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,839
Like everything else
in this city,

439
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:14,239
it's in the hand
of your Uncle Jack.

440
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:17,119
I need him to get the charges
lifted and get me out of here.

441
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,839
I already talked to him.

442
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:21,279
He told me
what the devil proposed.

443
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:25,519
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

444
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,999
He wants to take on Boston?

445
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,159
No-one is taking on anyone.

446
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,119
It's in hand.

447
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,279
There are deals being made
at a high level,

448
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:35,879
but there are some people
at the middle level

449
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,359
and lower levels
who cannot be trusted.

450
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:38,399
Michael,

451
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,239
- this sounds fucking...
- Shut up and listen.

452
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,839
It was Tommy himself
who warned us of the informant.

453
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,479
We're guessing
that the informant

454
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,759
was the one that tipped off
the police about me.

455
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:52,839
Then the devil's plan
has already begun.

456
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,719
What's the point
of ships and planes

457
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,679
if you can'<i>t</i> get away?

458
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:59,839
Gina, in today's paper,
you will read about a man

459
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,399
being fished out
of the Boston Harbour

460
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,799
with a bleeding heart tattoo

461
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,599
and the name "Maria"
written on his arm.

462
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,319
Single shot to the head.

463
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:08,639
Yeah, I know,
I read it already.

464
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:13,119
His death will lead to others.

465
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,959
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

466
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,079
And while the clean-up
is being carried out,

467
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,119
you must keep things
to yourself.

468
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,439
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

469
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,199
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

470
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:28,759
Do you understand?

471
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,999
Michael, I just want the truth.

472
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:40,599
No, fuck that -
I <i>need</i> the truth!

473
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,119
Why are you doing business
with him again?

474
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,879
Gina,
tell me what you're thinking

475
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,399
of getting Laurence
for Christmas.

476
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,839
There are plenty of men
who can supply powder

477
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,159
all over the world -
I don'<i>t</i> understand

478
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,439
<i>why it</i> needs to be <i>him.</i>

479
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,599
Some of my business

480
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,399
with Tommy Shelby
is unfinished.

481
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:07,079
This is my opportunity
to finish <i>it.</i>

482
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,079
So speak to your uncle and
get me the fuck out of here.

483
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,879
Oh!

484
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,079
Hello?

485
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,159
Who?

486
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,759
Sure.

487
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,439
Why the hell not?

488
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,199
I heard you were in town
and I thought, "Well, hey."

489
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:08,679
Little man
hitting the big time.

490
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:09,879
You like jazz?

491
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,359
No.

492
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,559
What do you want? Whiskey?

493
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:19,879
Water.

494
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:22,919
I don'<i>t</i> have any water.
What else do you want?

495
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,919
I have a message
for your Uncle Jack.

496
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,879
Tommy, relax.

497
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:32,639
Have a fucking drink.

498
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:35,599
You know my uncle's planning

499
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,679
on buying the
United States import licence

500
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:40,999
to all the best Scotch
and Irish whiskey distilleries.

501
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,919
He's on his <i>way to</i> London
right now to make those deals.

502
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:47,759
Every drop in every state

503
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:49,919
will be another dime
for Uncle Jack.

504
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:51,399
Yeah.

505
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,279
He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

506
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,039
I've only seen photographs -

507
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,319
when he was young,
police mug shots,

508
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:02,599
and, more recently,
in high-society magazines.

509
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:05,159
I think
this represents progress.

510
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:06,279
Yeah.

511
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:11,199
And before you tell me
what you want me to tell him,

512
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:13,239
I have a message
from him to you.

513
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:15,839
No deal.

514
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,399
Hmm.

515
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,679
In England, when someone gets
this close to Tommy Shelby,

516
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:27,279
it's, oh, the horror.

517
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,759
Oh, the desire...

518
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,239
<i>...to</i> fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say,

519
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,679
"Yes, sir.

520
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,479
"Please, sir."

521
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:47,199
So it's Uncle Jack
you fall on your knees for, eh?

522
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:48,639
Not Michael.

523
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,999
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

524
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:58,879
You smell of jail, Gina.

525
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:01,399
And you drink too much.

526
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,999
Yes, but booze is legal.

527
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,719
Your white powder's not.

528
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:09,679
Jack has friends
in the government now.

529
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,959
Do you have any idea
how far he's risen?

530
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:16,719
All the way to the fucking top.

531
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,519
Can'<i>t</i> have white powder
on his shiny black boots

532
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:21,599
when he's on his <i>way</i>

533
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:23,439
to meet the President
of the United States

534
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:25,519
cos, yeah,

535
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:27,039
that's where he goes now.

536
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:31,359
So he can'<i>t</i> really be
taking such a big risk

537
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:32,679
on such a little deal.

538
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:36,359
Go home, boy.

539
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,799
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

540
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,599
Yeah, you have another whiskey,
Gina.

541
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,919
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

542
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,999
You mind if I smoke?

543
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,759
If it's legal, it's OK.

544
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,159
Before I go...

545
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,479
<i>...you</i> should know. <i>..</i>

546
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:00,439
<i>...that it</i> was me

547
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,639
who tipped off
the border police

548
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:05,919
about the contents
of Michael's suitcase.

549
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,919
I'm the reason he's in jail.

550
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,519
I wanted to give your uncle
a dilemma.

551
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:20,919
His favourite niece's
husband...

552
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,399
...banged up in Boston...

553
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:26,239
...for smuggling opium.

554
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:29,479
What does he do?

555
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,159
If he intervenes
and has him released,

556
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:33,639
how will that play
in the Oval Office?

557
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:35,799
If he does nothing,

558
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,839
how does that play
in South Boston?

559
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:39,399
Oh, fuck you.

560
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:45,279
Fine.

561
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,599
Stay here.

562
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:48,799
Deal here.

563
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:50,919
Die here,
for all I fucking care.

564
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,719
Die at whose hand, Gina? Eh?

565
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:04,719
My message to your uncle
is this.

566
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,039
If he doesn'<i>t want</i>
to buy my opium,

567
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:10,679
I will sell
to the East Boston Jews.

568
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:18,399
Oh, baby.

569
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,399
Do you want to start
a fucking war?

570
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:25,079
With that amount of opium,

571
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,519
the balance of power
between the Irish,

572
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,079
the Jewish and the Italians

573
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,879
would shift heavily
in favour of the East.

574
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:37,999
I have excellent contacts

575
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,759
with the family
that runs East Boston.

576
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:42,679
The Solomons family.

577
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:44,399
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

578
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,759
Once you people have accepted

579
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:51,159
that you must treat us
as equals...

580
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:57,639
<i>..</i> .then I think our families
will work together very well.

581
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:01,919
Have a good day, Gina.

582
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:24,519
Yep?

583
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,119
Yes, I'll accept the call.

584
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,959
<i>Hello, Lizzie.</i>

585
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,119
Tommy...

586
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,439
It's Ruby. She's not well.

587
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,479
She's got a temperature of 101.
Doctor's just left.

588
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,199
What did he say?

589
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:53,359
<i>He says he thinks it's flu,</i>

590
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:55,439
but he's going to come later
to check on her.

591
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,999
She's been coughing and...

592
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,799
Tommy, he said it's not
a good idea for us to travel.

593
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,279
<i>We can't board that ship
to Boston today.</i>

594
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:12,839
That's all right, Lizzie,
don'<i>t worry.</i>

595
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,919
Don'<i>t</i> worry, you just stay
there for now

596
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:17,119
and get her better and, er. <i>..</i>

597
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,199
Can I speak to her?

598
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,199
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

599
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,759
Yeah, well, let her sleep.

600
00:50:24,879 --> 00:50:26,079
Let her sleep.

601
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,559
Lizzie, I've a bit more
business to do here.

602
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,959
<i>Look, you just book
a new passage</i>

603
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,319
when Ruby's feeling better.

604
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:36,719
It doesn'<i>t</i> matter if you don'<i>t</i>
get here for Christmas,

605
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:37,999
just as long as you get here,
right?

606
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,799
<i>And then I'll get
this business done,</i>

607
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:44,639
you get here
with the children. <i>..</i>

608
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:46,119
...and then no more.

609
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:50,239
And it'll just be us
and the clean air

610
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:51,719
out in the West.

611
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,199
<i>I've found a place
in the mountains.</i>

612
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,719
<i>There'll be snow.</i>

613
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,599
Tell Ruby. <i>..</i> Tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

614
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:00,039
Hmm.

615
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,439
<i>How long has she been coughing?</i>

616
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,079
<i>A few days.</i>

617
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,879
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

618
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,559
out in the cold by the river.

619
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,639
Are you OK, Tommy?

620
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,119
Your voice,
it sounds different.

621
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:20,719
<i>It's just cold.</i>

622
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,199
I'll get this business done
in Boston...

623
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,999
<i>..</i> .and that'll be
the end of <i>it.</i>

624
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,199
And then I just want to...

625
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,679
<i>...</i> I just want to pick Ruby up

626
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,359
and hold her in my arms,
<i>y</i>'know?

627
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,759
I miss the weight
of carrying her.

628
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:39,319
<i>I gave her her presents early.</i>

629
00:51:39,439 --> 00:51:41,159
She loves them.

630
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,039
But last night,
she was burning up.

631
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:47,799
She was delirious.

632
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:49,359
She kept talking.

633
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:52,239
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

634
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,879
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

635
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:57,399
Yeah.

636
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:00,559
When she was delirious,

637
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:03,359
she kept saying
these Gypsy words, er. <i>..</i>

638
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,519
<i>"Tickner maura,
tickner maura, o beng, o beng, "</i>

639
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:10,839
<i>over and over again.</i>

640
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,239
What? Lizzie, <i>what...?</i>

641
00:52:15,439 --> 00:52:17,759
What did you say?
What did Ruby say?

642
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:19,679
Tickner, tickner maura.

643
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:21,719
<i>- Something like that.</i>
- Did she say any. <i>..</i>

644
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,679
Did she say any other words
that you didn'<i>t</i> understand?

645
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:27,999
"O beng, o beng." I don'<i>t</i> know.

646
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,359
No, Lizzie, did she say
any other words in Romany?

647
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:31,679
Fucking listen to me!

648
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:33,239
I don'<i>t</i> know Romany words,

649
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,759
<i>Tommy. I don't think so.</i>

650
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:37,239
Just "tickner maura"
and "o beng"?

651
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,199
Yes.

652
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,319
Could she see anything
when she was burning up?

653
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:42,279
<i>- What could she see?</i>
- Oh, fuck.

654
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:43,959
Lizzie, please, just answer
the fucking question!

655
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,759
She said she could see a man.

656
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,879
A man with green eyes.

657
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,639
<i>She was delirious.</i>

658
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:52,439
<i>She was burning up.</i>

659
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,039
What the fuck is the matter?

660
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:55,199
All right, listen, Lizzie,

661
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:56,279
- I'm coming home.
<i>- Tommy,</i>

662
00:52:56,399 --> 00:52:57,879
- it's just a fever, love.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

663
00:52:57,999 --> 00:52:59,799
I'm coming home. I'll be
on the next steamer back.

664
00:52:59,919 --> 00:53:01,319
<i>You keep her out of school.
You hear me?</i>

665
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:02,719
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from. <i>..</i>

666
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:04,799
- Tommy...
<i>- Keep her away from the river.</i>

667
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:06,839
<i>Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.</i>

668
00:53:06,959 --> 00:53:08,919
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives

669
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:10,719
the words
that Ruby has been saying.

670
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,879
<i>Do you hear me?
Tell Johnny's eldest wife</i>

671
00:53:12,999 --> 00:53:14,959
to put a Black Madonna
around her neck.

672
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:16,039
You listen to Esmeralda

673
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,039
the same <i>way</i> you listen
to a fucking doctor.

674
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,079
<i>You hear me?</i>

675
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,399
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

676
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:24,119
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

677
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,719
<i>And you get Curly there.</i>

678
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,519
<i>Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses.</i>

679
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:29,599
And you do everything

680
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:31,639
that Johnny Dogs
and his wives fucking tell you.

681
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:32,839
Do you understand me?

682
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,199
I'm sorry, Lizzie.
Do you understand?

683
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,039
<i>OK!</i>

684
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:39,759
I'll do it.

685
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:41,159
All right, I'm coming home.

686
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:53,639
Polly?

687
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,119
Polly?

688
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:01,439
They know
I'm trying to get out.

689
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:03,919
Pol...

690
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:06,759
<i>...they</i>'re coming for me.

691
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:47,999
You son of a fucking bitch.

692
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,559
You sound American, Michael.

693
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:52,959
I have to go back
to England early.

694
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:54,799
Let's make this quick, eh?

695
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:57,199
You just fuck people up
and you run <i>away.</i>

696
00:54:57,319 --> 00:54:58,399
No, this business
will continue.

697
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:00,639
Jack Nelson is also travelling
to England.

698
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:03,639
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licences.

699
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,199
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

700
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,479
Well, I have copies
of his itinerary.

701
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:09,999
Of his personal correspondence.

702
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:11,759
Letters from the President
of the United States,

703
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,399
and his many mistresses.

704
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,159
I have contacts
in his organization.

705
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:20,239
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

706
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,719
You're dead, Tommy.

707
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,719
You're out
of your fucking depth.

708
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:28,639
You're dead already.

709
00:55:31,399 --> 00:55:33,799
You threatened
to sell to the Jews.

710
00:55:33,919 --> 00:55:35,679
And I have contacts
in this prison.

711
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,519
These boys here will look
after you during your <i>stay.</i>

712
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,479
I don'<i>t</i> need your fucking
people to look after me.

713
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,919
Jack Nelson's getting me
out of here.

714
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:41,959
Oh, yeah?

715
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,519
Is he?

716
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:46,119
This is a letter.

717
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:48,079
Here, give him this letter,
will ya?

718
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:49,559
This is a letter

719
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,879
from the President's
personal secretary,

720
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:53,279
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

721
00:55:53,399 --> 00:55:56,199
Just until the press
lose interest, Michael.

722
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:00,959
Fuck you.

723
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:02,759
You'll be released eventually.

724
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:05,959
And then you can execute
your business with me. <i>..</i>

725
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,359
...as before.

726
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:12,359
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

727
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:15,079
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

728
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,519
and go our separate ways
once more, eh?

729
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:22,839
So, you didn'<i>t</i> learn.

730
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:27,159
When my mother died
at the hands of your ambition,

731
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:29,639
you didn'<i>t</i> learn
your limitations.

732
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,359
I have no limitations.

733
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:40,319
Oh, and by the way, Michael. <i>..</i>

734
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,999
...according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

735
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:46,639
he bought passage
for five people

736
00:56:46,759 --> 00:56:48,159
from Boston to Liverpool.

737
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,239
Five people - his wife,
his mistress,

738
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,559
President Roosevelt's son,
himself...

739
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,479
...and Gina Gray.

740
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:01,559
Gina's coming to London,
Michael...

741
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,479
<i>..</i> .where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

742
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:07,919
Fuck! You fucking bastard,
Tommy!

743
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:09,999
- Spirits, Boston Irish. <i>..</i>
- You're the devil!

744
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:11,679
- ...and Uncle Jack.
- You're the fucking devil!

745
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:13,279
I'm ready for the conversation.

746
