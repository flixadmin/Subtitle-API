1
00:00:01,911 --> 00:00:03,445
Previously on Gotham..

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:05,112
Ooh...

3
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:08,464
What you call sanity...

4
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:09,705
Hey!

5
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:11,073
...is just a prison in your mind.

6
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:12,776
Bang.

7
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:14,843
Wake up!

8
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:20,048
You're the one who's been following us.

9
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:21,717
Do you know her?

10
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,252
That's my mom.

11
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:26,481
Isabella's death has altered things,

12
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,336
- and I can't continue.
- No!

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Ed, I will not let you leave.

14
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,768
I don't want to kill him.

15
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:37,172
I want to destroy him.

16
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:39,741
Tetch infected him
that night in the hospital.

17
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:41,297
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

18
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:42,634
I swear.

19
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,700
After the wedding,

20
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:47,107
Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

21
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:48,516
I'll never see you again.

22
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,814
Lee, you cannot marry him.

23
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:51,938
Get the hell out of here!

24
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:14,340
"And the end will
come when he hands over"

25
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,441
the kingdom to God, the Father,

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,914
after he has destroyed all dominion.

27
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,115
The last enemy to be destroyed

28
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,825
"is death."

29
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,950
In nomine Patris

30
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:31,585
et Filii tu y Santos.

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,186
Amen.

32
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,153
Amen.

33
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,523
Jim.

34
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,699
What the hell are you doing here?

35
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:47,183
If Falcone sees you, God
only knows what he'll do.

36
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,195
I had to do it, Harv.

37
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,943
He was infected. He would've killed her.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,185
It was a legit kill.

39
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,599
That's the law.

40
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:57,157
This is family.

41
00:01:58,093 --> 00:01:59,392
The man's burying his son.

42
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:00,960
Lee's burying a husband.

43
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,997
I wanted to...

44
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,333
I don't know.

45
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,534
To what?

46
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,336
Say sorry?

47
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,639
Talk about the past?

48
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:16,075
This isn't the time or the place.
Come on.

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,670
This is Edward.

50
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,271
Leave a message.

51
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,607
Or don't.

52
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,342
Doesn't really matter.

53
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,345
- Hey! Ooh.
- What?

54
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,646
Mayor, the press have assembled
in the conference room.

55
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,880
- They are requesting your presence.
- The press? Why?

56
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:58,618
The latest figures are in.

57
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,320
Fine.

58
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,724
Let the vultures have at me.

59
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,026
Hey, there he is.

60
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,267
They're through the
roof across the board.

61
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,569
Yeah, jobs are up, market's up.

62
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:18,137
Crime way, way down.

63
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,373
You did it.

64
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:23,910
Enjoy the moment, sir.

65
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,212
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.

66
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,918
Praise well deserved, Mr. Mayor.

67
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,454
I really think we need to
cash in on this good news

68
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,422
immediately.

69
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,725
You are a clever fellow, Tarquin, but...

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,059
I wish Ed were here.

71
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,627
My sole job as deputy chief

72
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,730
of staff is to serve
you with the exact same

73
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,866
zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.

74
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,202
Thank you all so much for coming.

75
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:50,436
Thanks, everyone.

76
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,871
Bob, great to see you.

77
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,506
Bill, take care.

78
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,678
Margaret Hearst. Know her?

79
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:01,180
Of course.

80
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,383
When I saw these numbers
come in, I thought who better

81
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:06,686
to help us capitalize on
this than Margaret Hearst?

82
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:09,455
The whole city... no, the whole
country... watches her show.

83
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,024
She can take you to a whole new level.

84
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,426
Solidify your legacy
on a national scale.

85
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,529
"National scale"?

86
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,297
She's in my office,

87
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,366
and she is dying to meet you.

88
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,168
Turn her down now, she won't come back,

89
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:24,170
like... ever.

90
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,105
What do you say?

91
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,644
How's my hair?

92
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:57,236
Hope you don't mind.

93
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:58,638
I helped myself.

94
00:04:58,773 --> 00:04:59,871
What do you want?

95
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:00,970
I'm here

96
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,171
as a messenger.

97
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,911
Okay, I'm listening.

98
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:07,780
You messed up, Jim.

99
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,348
Killed the don's son.

100
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,017
He's beside himself.

101
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,551
I've never seen him like this before.

102
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:14,619
I want to speak to him.

103
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,453
Oh, no, we're way past that.

104
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,725
It's only a matter of time
before he gives the nod to...

105
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,194
...put a bullet in your head.

106
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,495
You could try.

107
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,898
I don't... try.

108
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:29,435
And I never stop.

109
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,237
You won't see me coming.

110
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,439
And you won't feel a thing.

111
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,043
If we don't get a chance
to talk before then,

112
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:39,545
it's been really nice knowing you.

113
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,114
You're a good egg.

114
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,284
Also...

115
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,053
nice shot on Mario.

116
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,788
I never liked him.

117
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,041
Nice place.

118
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,713
What's with the raggedy clothes?

119
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,249
Why are you back?

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,586
To see you, of course.

121
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,591
Why now?

122
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,829
Why wait 11 years to see me?

123
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,464
That's right.

124
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,499
11 years.

125
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:37,003
You didn't even check up on me.

126
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:39,805
What can I say?

127
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,275
I'm sorry, and you have no idea

128
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,677
how many times I thought of you.

129
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,112
How many times, Mom?

130
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:47,280
I had to leave.

131
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:49,448
I had no choice.

132
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,987
You know that orphanage I left you at?

133
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,691
It's the same one I was
left at by who knows who.

134
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,326
St. Maria's.

135
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:02,028
It's where I got my name.

136
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:06,299
I grew up there and on the streets.

137
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,634
It was on the streets that I had you.

138
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,835
Who's my father?

139
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:12,638
You're not dating that kid, are you?

140
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,310
You should go.

141
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,212
Wait, I me... I was a dumb kid, okay?

142
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:20,513
I got in trouble with the law.

143
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,614
I had to leave or they were
gonna take me to prison.

144
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:23,913
I had to run and run fast.

145
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:25,712
And you can't run fast
with a five-year-old.

146
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,646
Not just a five-year-old.

147
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,123
Your five-year-old.

148
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,326
Your daughter.

149
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:35,661
That was a bad call.

150
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,496
Okay?

151
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:42,201
I just wanted to come here,
and tell you that I love you.

152
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:45,404
And I'm sorry.

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,706
All righty then.

154
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,976
This has been so fun.

155
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,277
Bye.

156
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,347
Selina.

157
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:55,548
Good-bye.

158
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,714
Mayor, this...

159
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,458
is Ms. Hearst.

160
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,726
Perhaps you've truly found

161
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,400
your calling in office, Mr. Cobblepot.

162
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:20,675
Or perhaps...

163
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:23,916
you just know how to show people
only what they want to see.

164
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,016
Hmm?

165
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,729
Either way, I plan

166
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,830
to get inside your head
and share what I find

167
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,364
with the citizens of Gotham.

168
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,502
Does that deter you?

169
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,071
Please.

170
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,171
Then I think

171
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:36,670
the exclusive interview should happen

172
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:37,736
here at City Hall

173
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:39,437
this Friday, live.

174
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,845
Actually, I would prefer
to do it at home and...

175
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,013
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

176
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,349
This Friday or not at all.

177
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:49,219
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.

178
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,289
I'm not a fan.

179
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,292
I shan't be holding back.

180
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,995
My audience expects the
truth and I give it to them.

181
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,630
The truth is in my numbers,

182
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,998
Ms. Hearst.

183
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:03,667
Then Friday it is.

184
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,569
Gotham will see their mayor...

185
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,237
as he truly is.

186
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,707
Dig deep.

187
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:13,310
I have nothing to hide.

188
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,328
Melanie Blake.

189
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,830
Found wandering the train tracks

190
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,898
late last night in a state of undress.

191
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,433
She collapsed soon after,

192
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:38,569
and died in the ambulance
of coronary failure.

193
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:41,371
At some point prior to her
appearance on the tracks,

194
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:45,476
somebody applied a strong
electrical current to her.

195
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,977
Considering the extent of the burns,

196
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:48,212
I'm guessing literally

197
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,614
thousands of volts were passed

198
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,949
through this poor girl.

199
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,083
Torture?

200
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,284
Perhaps.

201
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
She say anything before she die?

202
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:57,554
No.

203
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,022
She was...

204
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,125
stabbed as well?

205
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,661
Melanie was stabbed three
days ago by her boyfriend.

206
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:05,596
She was pronounced
dead in the ambulance.

207
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:06,864
Wait, w-what?

208
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,998
Two days ago,

209
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,800
this girl was taken to the morgue,

210
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,135
dead.

211
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,436
And yet last night,

212
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,737
she's walking down the train
tracks after getting zapped

213
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,671
with 10,000 volts in her noggin?

214
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:18,338
Doesn't anyone die in Gotham anymore?

215
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:20,577
Is it possible she wasn't actually dead,

216
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,579
and just walked out of the morgue?

217
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:24,915
These days I no longer say impossible.

218
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,116
Unlikely.

219
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:28,318
The morgue.

220
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,554
It's not a morgue, it's a motel.

221
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:36,760
Harvey!

222
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:39,796
As acting captain, I
demand that you arrest

223
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:42,666
Detective Gordon for
the murder of my husband.

224
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:43,934
Lee...

225
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,869
please.

226
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:47,938
Please?

227
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:49,239
Please...

228
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,408
what?!

229
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,110
You didn't have to kill him.

230
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:54,445
Dr. Thompkins, if I may,

231
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,946
your husband took a drug that...

232
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,414
Nathaniel Barnes was infected

233
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,349
with the same virus.

234
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,918
He's alive.

235
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,253
Jim spared his life.

236
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,529
And yet he gunned down
Mario on his wedding day.

237
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:24,608
You're the real virus, Jim.

238
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,345
You seep into people's lives

239
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,846
until you destroy them.

240
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,720
You haven't heard the end of this.

241
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:26,570
Father?

242
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:30,207
Help me.

243
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:31,675
My God.

244
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,449
Of course. How?

245
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:42,653
He's not to be trusted.

246
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,388
Who?

247
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,239
Sorry to bother you so late, Mr. Mayor.

248
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:05,108
Yes. What is it?

249
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:07,411
Someone broke into
the cemetery and dug up

250
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:09,413
your father's remains.

251
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,556
GCPD.

252
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,969
You the night manager
here, Mister, uh...

253
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,472
Pollard?

254
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,047
Dwight, please, that's
correct. Something wrong?

255
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,683
Only if you call dead people
walking out of here wrong.

256
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,385
What?

257
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,552
Melanie Blake.

258
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:39,217
- She would have been here two days ago.
- Yeah.

259
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,926
Stabbing victim.

260
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,195
Drawer 12.

261
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,102
That's not right.

262
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:54,604
That's because she's on the M.E.'s slab,

263
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,106
dead, again.

264
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,041
What?

265
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:00,910
You have any security
cameras here? Guards?

266
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:02,111
No, we don't need them.

267
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,446
Nothing ever happens down here.

268
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:07,050
Sorry.

269
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:08,418
Hey.

270
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,886
You jumpy, Jim?

271
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,888
Uh, we're all good.

272
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:16,059
You got something you want to share?

273
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,063
No.

274
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,798
Let's stick around.

275
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,700
See where this Dwight takes us.

276
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,439
I don't get it.

277
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:32,308
Why is it so important
to the Court of Owls?

278
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,878
It's just an ornament.

279
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:36,479
I don't know.

280
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,781
Men died protecting it.

281
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,183
So we hide it,

282
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:41,518
hold onto it for leverage in
case they come for us again.

283
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,487
Perhaps in the cave.

284
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,779
Ms. Kyle.

285
00:15:11,316 --> 00:15:14,184
What a surprise.

286
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,252
For what do we owe this pleasure?

287
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:18,621
I was just leaving this here for Selina.

288
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,191
Oh.

289
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:22,992
Uh... come in.

290
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,163
Please stay.

291
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,033
We've been meaning to thank you
in person for the other night.

292
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:31,401
I can't. I have a train to catch.

293
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,036
Please just see that she gets this.

294
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:34,403
Would you mind if I asked

295
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:35,872
what's in the box?

296
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:41,010
Some things I kept from
my time here in Gotham.

297
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,446
It's not something you'd like
to give to Selina yourself?

298
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:44,981
I tried reaching out to her.

299
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:46,983
She's too angry.

300
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,985
Not that I can blame her.

301
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,453
Please, just...

302
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:52,455
see that she gets this.

303
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,812
Ms. Kyle?

304
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:02,815
Take it from someone who
misses his family very much.

305
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:05,484
Please don't leave just yet.

306
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,355
I know where she is.

307
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:12,124
Let me talk to her.

308
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,172
Okay, thanks.

309
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:28,474
This keeps getting better and better.

310
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,243
Guess where Dwight Pollard
worked before the morgue.

311
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,611
Indian Hill.

312
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:33,679
How'd you know?

313
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,181
Where else in Gotham do the dead

314
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:36,615
get brought back to life?

315
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:42,355
The cops came by, idiot.

316
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,422
How'd she get out?

317
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,490
Never mind.

318
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:45,625
I have to get to the venue.

319
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,726
I'll come by after.

320
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,127
Should we grab him now?

321
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,363
No, I want to see where he's going.

322
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:55,668
The autopsy showed
that Mario did have the virus.

323
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,371
Mario was my son.

324
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:02,675
Whether he was sick or
not is of no concern to me.

325
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,910
Gordon took his life.

326
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:06,846
What are you gonna do?

327
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:10,483
I cared for Jim Gordon.

328
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:13,853
In some ways, he was more
like my son than Mario.

329
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:15,988
His life is mine to take.

330
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,391
That's the natural law.

331
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,160
Blood for blood.

332
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:24,497
I hate him.

333
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:26,565
God, I hate him.

334
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,268
Everything bad that's
happened in my life

335
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:30,836
has happened because of him.

336
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:32,838
If Gordon dies,

337
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:36,042
it's a weight we'll both have to carry.

338
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,044
I'm used to such burdens.

339
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,180
You're not.

340
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:43,049
He'll die by my hand, not yours.

341
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:46,919
But this is something
you'll need to live with.

342
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:50,630
Can you?

343
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,757
What is that?

344
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:14,984
Your mother brought it to my house.

345
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,152
Just leave it there.

346
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:18,954
I'll get it later.

347
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,596
Selina... I know how long

348
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:30,499
you've waited to see your mother.

349
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,902
I can't imagine all you must be feeling.

350
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:36,238
She left me here, Bruce.

351
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:38,107
Alone.

352
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,485
You're right.

353
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,153
It's hard to forgive.

354
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,222
It may be the hardest thing

355
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,958
any of us have to do in this life.

356
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,861
But she's reaching out.

357
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,830
And it may be your only
chance to reach back.

358
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,337
She's a crook.

359
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,272
Can't you see that?

360
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,141
She's still your mother.

361
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,110
Push her away now and you
may never see her again.

362
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,351
Okay.

363
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,919
Weird...

364
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,789
But not illegal.

365
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,673
Okay.

366
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,675
Weirder.

367
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,880
The people of this city are slaves.

368
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,215
Mm-hmm. See, they get up every day

369
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,186
and go to work so they
can pay their taxes,

370
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,687
their mortgages.

371
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,423
See, they believe what
the papers tell them.

372
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,527
They fear what the
politicians feed them.

373
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,429
See, they are mentally
shackled, and yet,

374
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,665
they do nothing about it!

375
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,137
Yeah! Nothing!

376
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:16,440
But there was someone who understood.

377
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,710
Someone who spoke out, who stood up,

378
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,747
to the jailers, puppets.

379
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,517
A man with no fear.

380
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,923
Hello, Gotham City!

381
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,159
We're the Maniax. And I'm Jerome,

382
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,728
the shot caller of our little gang.

383
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,999
We're here to spread the
message of wisdom and hope.

384
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,171
Some people have no manners.

385
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,507
You're all

386
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,275
prisoners.

387
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:55,479
What you call sanity,

388
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,848
it's just a prison in your minds

389
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:01,419
that stops you from seeing
you're just tiny little cogs

390
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,921
in a giant, absurd machine,

391
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:05,189
Wake up!

392
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:07,258
Oh!

393
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,527
Time to go.

394
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:10,761
But don't worry.

395
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,930
We'll be back very soon.

396
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,199
Hang onto your hats, folks.

397
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:17,468
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!

398
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,344
All right!

399
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,511
Show's over!

400
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,813
Time to go home.

401
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,282
GCPD!

402
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:37,088
Let's go!

403
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,864
Let's go!

404
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,009
You see Dwight?

405
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,544
He was probably the last
one to jump on the clown car.

406
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,481
Bringing back the dead is
something we need to, uh...

407
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,018
Oh, no... What?

408
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,152
Back!

409
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,354
Who the hell's that?

410
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,090
It's Victor Zsasz.

411
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,969
Falcone put out a hit on me. Oh!

412
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,311
Would've been nice if
you told me that earlier!

413
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:18,412
He's only after me.

414
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,747
Zsasz is very professional in that way.

415
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,635
Trapped behind here,
we're sitting ducks.

416
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,305
I need to draw their
fire. Find me later.

417
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,574
Wait, Jim. Don't!

418
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,510
Damn it.

419
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:44,386
Everyone out! It's not safe.

420
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,717
- Hey, who is this guy?
- What are you deaf?

421
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,260
Get out of here!

422
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:21,660
It's inevitability, Jim.

423
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,061
Embrace it.

424
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,045
You've had a good run.

425
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
You should know that.

426
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:29,594
Who's there?

427
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:40,972
Father?

428
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:50,482
Father.

429
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:51,950
How can I help you? What can I do?

430
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,218
Find me, my son.

431
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:55,120
I cannot rest

432
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,155
until I lay underground once more.

433
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,192
He cannot be trusted!

434
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,694
Who?

435
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,996
Isabella is over on
the other side with us.

436
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,598
Whispering tales of murder.

437
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:08,366
Dark plots are in motion, my son.

438
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:09,667
Don't trust him!

439
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:10,934
Who?

440
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,568
The birthday boy.

441
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,618
You want to know about your husband.

442
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:29,988
Was he a diseased maniac?

443
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:33,258
Would he have killed you?

444
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,760
Well, I can tell you this.

445
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,996
I've never felt better in my life.

446
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,131
Clearer, stronger.

447
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,333
More focused.

448
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:44,169
Even now, I can feel it

449
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:47,105
coursing through my veins.

450
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,973
Restoring my body.

451
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,278
So, Mario could've lived

452
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:55,313
a normal life with it.

453
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,948
Would've given us time to find a cure.

454
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,283
Jim didn't have to kill him.

455
00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:00,185
Cure?

456
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,287
This virus isn't the disease.

457
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:05,023
It's the antidote.

458
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,859
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

459
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:10,195
I don't need a cure.

460
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,030
The murderers,

461
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,032
thieves, rapists.

462
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,206
James Gordon is one of them.

463
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:24,209
When I get out of here...
And trust me, I will...

464
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:27,846
He'll be the first that I judge.

465
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:31,316
He and all the other human
garbage that plague this city.

466
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,985
All will be tried,

467
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,555
convicted and executed!

468
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,492
I will purge Gotham,

469
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,760
and the innocents will thank me!

470
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,029
Their savior!

471
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,833
Their executioner.

472
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:53,271
I know, and the best part is,

473
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:56,541
that fake painting is still
hanging in the gallery.

474
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:59,544
Perhaps we might be able
to talk about something

475
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,114
other than your previous
illicit exploits, Ms. Kyle.

476
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,716
Oh, I'm sorry, Alfred.

477
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:07,519
This was a great meal.

478
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:08,887
You're quite the chef.

479
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,488
Thank you very much, miss.

480
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,923
He's a catch, this one.

481
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,759
Got a stiff right hand, too.

482
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,594
Easy mark, though.

483
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,096
Thank you...

484
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,998
very much, cheeky monkey.

485
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,700
Oh, you poor thing.

486
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,068
Come here.

487
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,038
Oh...

488
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:29,207
I see what you mean, though.

489
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:31,443
Oh, well, that's just...

490
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:33,411
Just hilarious. You
know... Really. Thank you.

491
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,246
Thank you very much...

492
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,684
Oh, I guess I better go.

493
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,153
It's late. Stay.

494
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:44,222
Alfred will drive you to
your hotel in the morning.

495
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:46,391
You're very kind.

496
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,735
Mr. Mayor?

497
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,938
Unless you are bringing strong coffee,

498
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:01,206
or you have information

499
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,375
on my father's stolen remains...

500
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:06,111
...go away.

501
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,212
Yeah, but...

502
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:19,090
The birthday boy.

503
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,710
Your Honor.

504
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,613
Can I help you?

505
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:16,815
Why?

506
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,518
Why would you do such a thing?

507
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:22,353
What are you talking
about? What is that?

508
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,889
You are a sick man!

509
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,660
What are you plotting?

510
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:30,295
What's the angle?

511
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,796
Who are you in on this with?

512
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,331
I-I have no idea.

513
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:34,499
Look, you're exhausted.

514
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:35,834
Y-You haven't slept in days...

515
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,068
You barely...

516
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,557
Mr. Stemmel?

517
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:00,792
The TV crew is ready.

518
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,560
It's time for the interview.

519
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,062
Have you seen the mayor?

520
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:18,864
Carmine... call it off.

521
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:21,969
Why?

522
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:23,294
I saw Barnes.

523
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,214
The virus has completely taken over.

524
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,034
He's insane.

525
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,655
What makes you want to save Gordon?

526
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:29,823
Please, just call it off.

527
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,114
You said you hated him.

528
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,749
That wasn't true, was it?

529
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,751
Call it off now!

530
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:36,753
You talk of hate

531
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:38,154
and revenge,

532
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,758
but that's only to mask
what really scares you.

533
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:45,728
You still love James Gordon.

534
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:54,203
Where is he?

535
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,405
We're minutes away.

536
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,173
They're looking for him.

537
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,274
Well, look harder.

538
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,677
Here he is!

539
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:01,945
Sorry I'm late.

540
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,715
Mayor stuff.

541
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:11,220
Mr. Mayor, this is a pin...

542
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,660
I hope you're ready, Mr. Mayor.

543
00:32:17,696 --> 00:32:21,364
The world is watching.

544
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,633
And we're live in three,

545
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:25,635
two...

546
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,707
Mayor Cobblepot,

547
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,376
as Gotham is enjoying an historic spike

548
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:36,179
in job growth and prosperity,

549
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:39,315
it is also going through
one of the safest periods

550
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,550
in its history.

551
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,585
And I'm sure everyone is wondering,

552
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,087
"How did he do it?"

553
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:46,990
Uh...

554
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,804
Well...

555
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:14,517
Whoa, hey!

556
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:15,818
Hello to you, too.

557
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:17,553
You didn't think you'd get rid of me

558
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:18,721
that easily, did you?

559
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,723
I thought we might need something

560
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,924
with a bit more bite.

561
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,363
So, why didn't you tell me about Zsasz?

562
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,700
It's my business.

563
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:31,968
Yeah? Not yours.

564
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:33,569
That's a bit ridiculous, seeing as how

565
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:36,239
I'm standing next to
you most of the time.

566
00:34:00,598 --> 00:34:02,498
What's up?

567
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:06,969
Drop it, Jim.

568
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,938
It's your time to die today.

569
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:10,440
Not his.

570
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:11,741
Don't listen to him, Jim.

571
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:14,410
Shoot him now!

572
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:16,546
Relax, Zsasz.

573
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,048
Job's cancelled.

574
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:24,687
You can go home.

575
00:34:24,723 --> 00:34:27,490
Okay, boss.

576
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,670
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:45,975
If it was up to me, you'd be dead.

578
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:02,692
Whew!

579
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:13,392
So from humble errand
boy to kitchen worker

580
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,983
to the so-called "King of Gotham,"

581
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:19,886
it is said that many
died so you could rise.

582
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,561
Oh...

583
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:24,829
An exaggeration.

584
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:28,132
People love to invent scandal.

585
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,469
But it was murder that
sent you to Arkham,

586
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,571
a prison for the criminally insane.

587
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:36,641
I rescued the city

588
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,878
from the madman, Theo Galavan.

589
00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:42,247
Some call it murder.

590
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:44,249
Others a public service.

591
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,452
And after your controversial release

592
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:50,655
from prison, you met your father,

593
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,123
Elijah Van Dahl.

594
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:55,660
A man whose identity

595
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,128
your mother kept from you.

596
00:35:57,164 --> 00:35:58,363
Oh, my God.

597
00:35:58,398 --> 00:36:00,164
Yes, it must have been very upsetting.

598
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,500
What? Yes.

599
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,569
He also died under
suspicious circumstances.

600
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,639
His wife and step-children
disappearing soon after.

601
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:09,540
I-I have to go.

602
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:11,610
Why? Is it because there's
substance to the rumors

603
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:13,945
that you had them killed to
inherit your father's wealth?

604
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,047
Fa-Father, Father wait!

605
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,047
Are you feeling well, Mr. Mayor?

606
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,052
I'm fine. I-I'm great.

607
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,353
Why would I not be fine?

608
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,822
The people of Gotham, and America,

609
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:25,023
want to know the truth.

610
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,058
To hell with the people!

611
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:34,999
Father, wait!

612
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,335
Father?

613
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:43,841
No! No!

614
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:12,370
A very good job.

615
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,350
Ah.

616
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:26,718
He bought it?

617
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:28,252
Hook, line and sinker.

618
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,556
Ah, voice wasn't quite
right, but, uh, you know...

619
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,129
Bravo, boys.

620
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,431
Penguin lost his mind on national TV,

621
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,033
just like you said he would.

622
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:44,369
It's all about the power of suggestion.

623
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:46,938
And whispering in the right ears.

624
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,607
Do what I say, and you'll
be the next chief of staff.

625
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,177
Tell him, "I'm still grieving."

626
00:37:52,212 --> 00:37:54,245
Margaret Hearse is in your
office waiting for you.

627
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,048
And remember to say
exactly what I told you

628
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,649
about his father.

629
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:21,506
Why don't you just leave
these bodies for the cops?

630
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,174
Have him arrested.

631
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,242
That's too easy, Tabitha.

632
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:29,247
I want this to be a slow...

633
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:31,582
painful death.

634
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:35,086
One of a thousand deep cuts.

635
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:36,988
First we take away his mind...

636
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,623
That's the part I like.

637
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:42,160
We destroy his empire
and take it for ourselves.

638
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:45,863
And then, when this
bird is broken and alone,

639
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:48,633
we do the humane thing

640
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:50,168
and put him out of his misery.

641
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,136
Mm.

642
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,013
If there's anything I
can do for you, Ms. Kyle,

643
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:03,381
please don't...

644
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,616
hesitate to ask.

645
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:20,731
Wait here.

646
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:23,267
What's wrong? Just do it.

647
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:28,172
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

648
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,174
I was headed back tomorrow.

649
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,643
My money, where is it? 100 grand.

650
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,078
I don't have your money.

651
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:36,481
What do I have to
do, beat it out of you?

652
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:38,683
Leave her alone! I told
you to stay outside!

653
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:40,084
Who's this?

654
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,219
Nobody.

655
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,386
We can get you the money.

656
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,588
Is that so?

657
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:45,323
Who from?

658
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,326
The guy that dropped you
off in the Rolls Royce?

659
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:53,698
One of you talk.

660
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,234
Who's the rich guy? Mom...

661
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,270
Leave her alone. Well, well.

662
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,740
I hope she know what a
lying cheat you are, Maria.

663
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,207
Bruce will give you the money.
He's a good friend of mine.

664
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,341
Would you relax? Bruce Wayne?

665
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,212
Well, now,

666
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:09,413
that changes everything.

667
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,349
Why settle for a hundred?

668
00:40:11,384 --> 00:40:15,386
Perhaps I'll pay him a visit, tell him

669
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:17,288
all about you.

670
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:20,892
Who was that?

671
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,261
That was my past coming
back to punish me.

672
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,530
Was he the reason you
left Gotham before?

673
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:26,898
It's complicated.

674
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:29,133
We have to warn your friends.

675
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:30,968
Cole is not someone
they should mess with.

676
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,206
Good job, Mom.

677
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,784
Were you followed?

678
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,486
No, no thanks to you.

679
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:50,788
How did the girl escape?
You led the cops right to me.

680
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,055
I turned my head for a minute.

681
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:53,488
She must have stumbled out.

682
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,957
But this proves that your designs work.

683
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:57,461
She came back to life.

684
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,263
But not for long.

685
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:00,798
The current's still too strong.

686
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,300
Her body couldn't take it.

687
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,468
We have to move quickly.

688
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,337
Gather the others.

689
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:08,272
It's time to get him.
