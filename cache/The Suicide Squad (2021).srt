it's rolling round the bend

And I ain't seen the sunshine

I'm stuck in Folsom prison
and time keeps draggin' on

"Always be a good boy
don't ever play with guns”

But I shot a man in Reno
just to watch him die

12

You fail to follow my orders in any way

I'd rather not be called at all.

But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

Savant do again?

[Emilia] It's Brian Durlin.

He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

Yeah, well, I'm putting 20 on

do you think it is, mate?

I don't know, I'm not familiar

He's a weasel. He's harmless.

he's killed 27 children,

In his hands,

-A style watch.
-A star latch?

A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?

to nick something,

you take a partner,

I didn't ask to be a father
in the first place.

You make that perfectly clear.

Your mother sprung that one on me.

Well, she's not around anymore,
so you can lay off of her, okay?

299
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,094
Oh, I tried to lay off her,

that I stole, only that I got caught!

I don't only care that you got caught,

I care that you got caught

309

for stealing something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do! It's embarrassing!

No, what's fucking embarrassing
is having you as my father.

00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:33,884
when I came here that
any goodness I ever had in me

00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,429
had been wrung out bare by my old man.

317
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,848
And I also told you to go out there
and do your own thing

318
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:43,269
and stay far away
from me or anyone like me, didn't I?

319
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,605
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

320
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:48,316
I have nothing good to offer you?

321
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,362
Because my court date is coming up,

322
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,533
and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.

323
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,952
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

324
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,079
you're gonna send
my 14-year-old daughter to prison?

325
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:02,121
No.

326
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,708
Your daughter is 16, Dubois.

00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,544
-You're a real father of the year.
-Fine.

328
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:08,961
You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

329
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,588
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

330
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,548
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

331
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,177
Not juvie.
Being 16 in the state of Louisiana

332
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,804
means that under
the right circumstances,

333
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:20,556
she could be tried as an adult.

334
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,183
And, if convicted,

335
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,228
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

336
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,106
And in here, well, you never know
what might happen

337
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,441
to a frail young thing like that.

338
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,152
Shames me to say

339
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:37,611
that we have the highest mortality rate
in the entire U.S. prison system.

340
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,244
[guard] Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

341
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,371
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

342
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,081
I'm protecting this country.

343
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,083
-Everyone stand down.
-Miss Waller, I--

344
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,169
Stand down!

345
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,422
[Bloodsport breathing heavily]

346
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,800
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

347
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,677
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

348
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,720
...if this mission
weren't more important

349
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,180
than you could possibly imagine.

350
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,557
Fuck your mission.

351
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,350
You have the military
experience necessary,

352
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,852
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

353
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,521
you have what it takes to be a leader.

354
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,231
No, I'm no fucking leader!

355
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:11,774
Then I'll make you one.

356
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:14,610
[dramatic music playing]

357
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,782
Are you in or out?

358
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,705
Good. Let's meet your team.

359
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,500
-Come on.
-Fuck me, man.

360
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:31,878
[guard] Let's go.

361
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,295
She was gonna kill his kid?

362
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,760
[Waller] Each member
of the team is chosen

363
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,388
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

364
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:46,475
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

365
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,978
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

366
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,188
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

367
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,315
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

368
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,276
-Are you having a laugh?
-What?

369
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,027
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

370
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,697
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

371
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:00,739
But better.

372
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,950
- I always hit my targets dead center.
- I hit them more in the center.

373
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,577
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

374
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,287
-I use smaller bullets.
-What?

375
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,914
They go inside your bullet holes
without even touching the side.

376
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,626
Next up is King Shark.

377
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,627
[Peacemaker] Holy shit.

378
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,462
What the fuck?

379
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,214
[Waller] Some people claim

380
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,300
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

381
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,427
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

382
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:22,636
Does it talk?

383
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,389
-[King Shark] Book read.
-[Bloodsport] Wow. [chuckles]

384
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:26,599
[Peacemaker]
Book's upside-down.

385
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,226
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

386
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,688
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

387
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,857
Be a mite careful,

388
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,316
as he's developed a taste

389
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,901
-for human meat.
-Huh?

390
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,320
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

391
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,864
-Ratcatcher 2.
-[inmate whistles]

392
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,658
-[inmates cheering]
-Settle down!

393
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
Ooh.

394
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,202
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

395
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,621
He's dead.
This is his daughter. [knocks]

396
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,581
Cazo, will you be joining us?

397
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,667
[groans] I just woke up.

398
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,961
I don't function well
early in the morning.

399
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,421
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

400
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,756
Hmm, it's all right.

401
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,842
-Get your ass out here!
-[gasps]

402
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,970
[sighs, moaning]

403
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,225
Millennials.

404
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,020
[continues moaning]

405
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,980
Oh, no way.

406
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,358
-That's not coming with us.
-She controls rats.

407
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,944
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

408
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,822
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

409
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,784
I'm not shakin'
the rat's hand.

410
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:28,077
[Sebastian whines]

411
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,330
<i>And finally, we have Abner Krill.</i>

412
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,166
What's that 'round his neck?

413
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:36,335
A power dampener.
They call him the Polka-Dot Man.

414
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,546
[scoffs] Polka-Dot Man.

415
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,215
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

416
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:43,968
He does.

417
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,053
He throws polka dots at people.

418
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,680
Hey, Polka-Dot Man,

419
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,266
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

420
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,643
You fucking pussy!
[laughing hysterically]

421
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,147
-[chuckles]
-These are soldiers?

422
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,815
We need to debrief.

423
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,444
[glass squeaking]

424
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,741
[groans] Fuck.

425
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,035
Corto Maltese

426
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,789
is a small island nation
off the coast of South America.

427
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:18,127
Over the past 100 years, the country
has been ruled with an iron fist

428
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:19,712
by the Herrera family.

429
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,175
But, a week ago, this guy,

430
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,928
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

431
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,223
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

432
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,226
took control
of the Corto Maltese government

433
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,770
in a violent military coup.

434
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,649
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

435
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,568
Although the United States

436
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,404
did not condone
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

437
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:48,157
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

438
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,078
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

439
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,871
So, you want us to kill Luna?

440
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,414
No.

441
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,374
This is Jotunheim.

442
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:02,296
A scientific experimentation facility
containing something known only

443
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:04,882
as Project Starfish.

444
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:09,549
Our intelligence sources tell us that
Starfish is extraterrestrial in origin.

445
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,765
In the hands of the Luna regime,

446
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:17,311
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

447
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:21,482
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim

448
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:25,319
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

449
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:26,737
How are we supposed to get in?

450
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,990
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

451
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,951
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

452
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,829
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

453
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,957
known as La Gatita Amable.

454
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:40,918
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

455
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,420
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

456
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,007
Any questions?

457
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,801
What is that?

458
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,804
[Waller] That is an overhead projector.

459
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:53,305
Do you ever use it anymore?

460
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,807
No, not really.

461
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,767
So, why don't you just throw it away?

462
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,769
[Waller] Peacemaker?

463
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,647
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

464
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,565
Think there's any connection?

465
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,819
No.

466
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,696
No...

467
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:09,780
Nanaue.

468
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,032
[Peacemaker] ...connection.

469
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,116
Hand.

470
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,870
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue,
very good.

471
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,374
We're all gonna die.

472
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,293
I hope so.

473
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,671
Oh, for fuck's sake.

474
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,965
[dramatic music playing]

475
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,024
[explosion]

476
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,322
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

477
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,449
[Waller on radio]
It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.

478
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:56,493
All right, we cut through the jungle
to get to Valle Del Mar.

479
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,454
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

480
00:24:58,621 --> 00:24:59,663
That's the word.

481
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,416
How we getting in?
Especially with Charlie the Tuna here.

482
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,917
How the hell am I supposed to know?

483
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,211
You're the leader.

484
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,545
You're supposed to be decisive.

485
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,465
And I've decided that you should eat
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

486
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,758

you would make the perfect wife.

However, upon spending

after World War ll.

They built Jotunheim to continue
their unorthodox experiments.

the bounty on the Nazis' heads

that the next time I got a boyfriend,

I'd be on the lookout for red flags.
And if I saw any,

I would do the healthy thing

You there?

982
00:55:24,737 --> 00:55:25,904
The military must have put

983
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,157
signal jammers around the city.

984
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,951
Your comms are down,
but we can still activate the bombs,

985

not to mention what will happen
to your daughter.

986

So, no funny business.

Do you copy, Dubois?

988
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,209
Copy.

989
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,127
[mouthing] Fuck you!

990
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,589
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

991
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:46,300
you wouldn't really do that, right?

992
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:49,261
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

You know what I think?

999
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,797
I think you have a serious case
of daddy issues.

1000
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,425
I have no issues
with how much I loved my father.

1001
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,395
Although he was a genius...

1002
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,693
we lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

1003
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,947
burdens.

1004
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:55,369
He built the machines I employ today...

[giggling]

1006

the secrets of calling the rats.

[rats squeaking]

1008
00:57:03,544 --> 00:57:06,296
They brought us trinkets to live on.

1009
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:10,884
And they kept us warm at night,
when we would have frozen.

1010
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:16,807
-But eventually...
-[Young Cleo] Papa.

1011

Papa, wake up.

1012
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,977
...my father's burdens...

1013

1014
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,606
[Young Cleo] No.

1015
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,608
No, Papa.

1016
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,111
-And he was gone.
-Papa, wake up.

1017
00:57:33,991 --> 00:57:36,868
I took his machinery
and came to America.

1018
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,662
That is the dream, right?

1019
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,832
But I was arrested

1020
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:45,210
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

1021
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,797
The state considered the rats a weapon.

1022
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:52,384
What?

1023
00:57:55,596 --> 00:57:57,639
You remind me of my daughter...

1024
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,309
the reason I'm here.

1025
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,229
Why are you so afraid of rats?

1026
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:06,731
My old man.

1027
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,484
When I was a lad,

1028
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:11,611
if I didn't finish a task right,

1029
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,906
he would dole out the punishment.

1030
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:19,491
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

1031
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,375
And it was full of starvin' rats.

1032
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:28,629
As imperfect my father was...

1033
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:34,468
he loved me.

1034
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,640
I wish I could give that to you.

1035
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,020
Don't you worry, yeah?

1036
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,731
I'm gonna get you out of here alive.

in the next few hours.

Looks like we gotta find
something to do

How about some, uh...

What do you guys drink
around here, Fernet?

How about a round of Fernets
for the table.

-Si.

01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:14,527
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

1296
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,864
If we find out you have
personalized license plates, you die.

1297
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:19,073
What? No.

1298
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,117
-If you mismatch blacks, you die.
-No.

Harley. Those last three aren't things.

1301
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,207
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

1302
01:16:28,374 --> 01:16:30,042
but that isn't
an open invitation for you

1303
01:16:30,126 --> 01:16:31,210
to cough without covering your mouth.

1304
01:16:31,294 --> 01:16:33,004
All right, we're gonna need you
to drive the minibus,

1305
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,756
with all of us inside,
past the guards at the front gate.

1306
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,468
Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

1307
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:40,845
There are security cameras everywhere.

1308
01:16:41,012 --> 01:16:42,638
They're being dealt with.

1309
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:55,567
We'll neutralize the soldiers there
and enter.

1310
01:16:55,735 --> 01:16:58,237
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1311
01:16:58,404 --> 01:17:00,531
I am walking back and forth.

1312
01:17:00,698 --> 01:17:01,573
Okay.

1313
01:17:01,741 --> 01:17:03,909
You're gonna lead me and Ratcatcher 2
to Project Starfish.

1314
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,828
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1315
01:17:05,995 --> 01:17:07,204
[Bloodsport] No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1316
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:09,916

starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1318
01:17:13,711 --> 01:17:15,963
Once we're clear,
we blow the tits off that thing,

1319
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,423
and go home.

1320
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:19,800
This is suicide.

1321
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,803
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1322

01:24:51,627 --> 01:24:53,670
your government didn't send you here

to protect the world
from alien technology.

1422

Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

Although the Cold War was ended,

1427
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:16,110
your government saw the potential
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

1428
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:20,777
but banish the thought of any such
experiments being held on American soil.

1429
01:25:21,824 --> 01:25:26,324
Your people have always been squeamish
about the sacrifices necessary

for scientific advancement.

1431
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,624
So,

1432
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:34,962
the United States made a secret deal
with the Corto Maltese government

1433
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:37,589
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

in Jotunheim.

1435
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:41,176
And they hired me to oversee them.

1436
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:45,181
And now, because of
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

1437
01:25:45,348 --> 01:25:47,641
they're gonna destroy

my country, not to be its puppet.

to show that to?
