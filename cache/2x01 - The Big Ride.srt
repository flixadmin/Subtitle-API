1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,750
Robin!

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
I heard what happened to Robin.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,590
She wasn't in the street,
she was one step off the curb.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,050
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Name's Butcher. Billy Butcher.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,220
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,470
- That's where I come in.
- To do what?

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,980
Frenchie, I need your help.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,810
- Who is he?
- This here is Hughie Campbell.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,200
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,570
- Who's that?
- She's a Supe terrorist.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,200
- Her name's Kimiko.
- Bonjour, Kimiko.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,870
I've always wanted to be in The Seven.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,420
Please welcome Starlight!

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,420
It's just a question of how bad
you wanna be in The Seven.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,420
We are going to be stationing you
in Sandusky, Ohio, for a while.

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,180
- I'm Hughie.
- Annie. Would you like my number?

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,060
Looks like you got your tongue
halfway down the opposition's throat.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,150
- She's not a bad person.
- She's a Supe.

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,150
Hugh Campbell killed Translucent.
What if he was helped?

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,320
- Whoa.
- Keep those hands down by your side.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,110
You have to explain, Hughie.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,070
You were the only thing I could count on.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,790
This is about Compound V.
It gives Supes their powers.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,370
What are you talking about?
We're born like this.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,710
That was diabolical!

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
No one's putting Supes
in the national defense.

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,380
Stay the fuck back or I'll laser you!

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,340
If they let us into the military,
this will never happen again.

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,430
I know what it's like to lose someone.

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,600
Homelander raped my wife, Becca.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,480
You and me, we're in this together.

32
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,070
We have to go back. This will never stop.
It's just gonna be more blood.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,570
If you don't like to play,
why did you join the team?

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,460
- You came here without Butcher?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm out.

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,970
- You came.
- I'm a fucking superhero.

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,840
He's having a heart attack.

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,600
No more lies. You fucking promised me.

39
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,610
Hey, pal. I'm your father.

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740

I'm on page 134.

44

Chain of command doesn't apply to
other military contractors in the field,

45
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,530
- I don't see why it should apply to us.
- Caprese sandwich?

46
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,700
When they're in actual combat,
whom exactly do your heroes report to?

I can report to the American people

103
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,940
that Black Noir has conducted an operation

104
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,110
killing the super-terrorist
known as Naqib.

105
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,740
But that doesn't mean
sacrifices won't still be made.

106
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,040
The proof of that, sadly, lies before us.

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,420
For today, we mourn
a fallen member of The Seven.

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,220
Translucent.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,810
Murdered in cold blood
by the cartel super-terrorist El Diablo.

110
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,560
Before he left, Translucent said to me...

111
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,530
almost as if he knew
something was gonna happen,

112
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,650
he said, "Hey, Homelander.

113
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,950
Tell my son Maverick that I love him."

114
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,620
He also said,
"You find those super-terrorists."

115
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,670
Well, "super villains" is really
the only term,

116
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,840
but he said, "You find them, Homelander.

117
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,630
And you stop them."

118
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,390
So I say to you, Maverick,

119
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,810
and to all the sons and daughters
of this great nation, I will stop them.

120
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,270
I will save you.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,490
I'll do it for you.

122
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,110
For America.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,290
For a dear...

124
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,710
dear old friend.

125
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,360
Well, I'm not gonna lie, it's hard.

163
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,490
It's really hard.

164
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,370
It comes in waves, you know?

165
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,290
Yeah, but this one,
he's just really been our rock.

166
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,380
He sat us down and he said,
"We're more than just a team.

167
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,090
We're a family.
And we need to pull together like one."

168
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,630
Starlight. Thank you for saying that.

169
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,010
Well, thank you.

170
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,890
I don't know
where we would be without you.

171
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,970
Isn't she the best?

172
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,180
- Isn't she the best?
- You both are...

The burner phone,
did you snap the SIM card?

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,570
Jesus.

211
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,280
- When was the last time you slept?
- Head down. Sorry. I just...

212
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm wanted,
and you're kind of super famous, so...

213
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,170
- Did you snap the card...? Okay.
- Yes. Yes, I snapped the card, okay?

214
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,250
And no one followed me down here.
They can't trace my chip down here.

215
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,130
We're okay.

216
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
You look good.

217
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,020
Yeah, you... you look good too.

218
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,850
You look very, you know...

219
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,940
Yeah, I'm lying. I'm sorry.

220
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,690
- You look like shit.
- I know.

221
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,700
- I know.
- Where are you guys living?

222
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,830
Club Med in Ibiza. It's been awesome.

223
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,370
- Foam parties will change your life.
- Idiot.

224
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,260
Um...

225
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,510
Here it is.

226
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,600
Shit.

227
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I know him.

228
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
- You do?
- Yeah.

229
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,400
I mean, not for a while,
but, yes, from my Capes for Christ days.

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,610
Are you sure you can do this?

231
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,700
I have a choice?

232
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,130
Hey, I...

233
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,130
I saw a really great picture of you
at the Teen Choice Awards with, urn...

234
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,180
What's his name, Ansel Adams?

235
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,600
Alden Ehrenreich.

236
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,480
- Are you stalking me on Instagram'?
- No.

237
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,940
No, of course not. Get over yourself.

238
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,270
So did the PR people
put you together or what's...?

239
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,730
- No, he's a nice guy.
- He's an actor.

240
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,030
He's an actor
who didn't lie to my face every day.

241
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,780
Okay, yeah, I got it. Ouch.

242
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

243
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,660
I... Hughie, I just...

244
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Hey.

245
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,300
Get some sleep.

246
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,350
I'll sleep when I know you're safe.

247
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,360
You think this is fun?

248
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,650
You think water is supposed to be fun?

249
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,820
Try swimming in the Mariana Trench,
you little fucking idiots!

250
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah, not so fun now.

251
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,580
No, it's dark and it's cold,
and you're so alone.

252
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,050
You're so goddamn fucking alone.

253
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,140
Swim free, little fish. You made bail.

254
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Hey, man.

255
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Want a Fresca'?

256
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,700
Thanks.

257
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,330
Hey, I know you.

258
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,120
Yeah, you're Raven... Ravenwing.

259
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,040
It's Eagle. Eagle the Archer.

260
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,760
Out of Cleveland.
We met, like, five times at Vought Con.

261
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,880
I mean, nope, that doesn't matter.

262
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,640
- You bailed me out?
- Yeah.

263
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,180
Why?

264
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,100
Because even heroes need a hand
once in a while. Come on.

265
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,980
The Translucent franchise,
especially Invisible Force 2, is...

266
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,860
Please. My baby needs a mother!

267
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,950
Oy.

268
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,950
Shut your trap, you dumb bird.

269
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,620
Or else I'll bollocks you.

270
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,870
But that's exactly
what William Butcher did.

271
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,420
He murdered
Vought vice president Madelyn Stillwell,

272
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,840
using upwards of 30 pounds of C-4.

273
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,800
Why would William Butcher do it?

274
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,970
Disgruntled perhaps
over his deceased wife,

275
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,430
a former Vought employee.

276
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,730
And why was Madelyn Stillwell's baby
found safe in a yard 17 miles away?

277
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,110
- It is a puzzle.
- These are among the many questions...

278
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,860
Where is Monsieur Charcuterie'?
Why hasn't he called?

279
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,030
Who cares?

280
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,660
- He could be dead.
- No, he's too much of an asshole to die.

281
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,450
...or any of his known associates,
Marvin Milk, Hugh Campbell or this man,

282
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,840
who's real identity is unknown,
please call 1—888-0-CRIMES.

283
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Christ.

284
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,180
We gotta get out of here. Now.

285
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,640
Good passports do not come cheap?

286
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
I sell the RPGs,
smuggle in the Kalashnikov,

287
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,310
we have enough money, that's it.

288
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,060
- Where will you go, Petit Hughie?
- We could just stay here.

289
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,650
With Frenchie's gangbanger friends.

290
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,570
The cots, they got 31 flavours
of semen on them. You'll love them.

291
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,240
And you have a better idea?

292
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,830
Maybe we can stay,
all of us, in your asshole!

293
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,410
Or maybe we could not run.

294
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,960
You are like a record that is broken.

295
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,330
Well, we shouldn't just give up.

296
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,920
Guys, we get some Compound V,
we bring it to The New York Times,

297
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,760
- we burn Vought to the ground.
- You got some V, Hughie?

298
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
'Cause I don't.

299
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,050
We could get some.
Someone could help us get it.

300
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,100
And who might that be?

301
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,850
You didn't hear the television?

302
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,230
We are famous now. Butcher even more so.

303
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,980
- Fuck Butcher. We don't need him.
- A—Team had Hannibal.

304
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,860
Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin.
Beatles, Brian Epstein.

305
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,360
We don't need Butcher.

306
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,570
Okay. Who's gonna be our captain?

307
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,700
You?

308
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,790
- I mean, guys, just hear me out, okay?
- Shut the fuck up!

309
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,630
This is over.

310
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,900
Homelander, hi.

311
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,450
Ashley.

312
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,910
Glad to see you're making yourself
at home.

313
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,710
Yeah.

314
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,580
Renovation is definitely overdue.

315
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,130
It's like 2003 called,
they want their office back, you know?

316
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,220
- I liked it.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

317
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,890
Homelander, I just wanna thank you again
for recommending me for this job.

318
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,770
I was so surprised
to get the call.

319
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,270
I am gonna fill Miss Stillwell's shoes
as best I can.

320
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,610
God rest her soul.

321
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,410
Yeah. God rest it. Yeah.

322
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,870
Any luck catching her killer?
That Butcher maniac?

323
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,420
No. Not yet.

324
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,630
But we will.

325
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,840
Good news.

326
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,510
I think I found a hero.

327
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,050
Perfect candidate to replace Translucent.

328
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,840
Really?

329
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,800
So soon?

330
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,270
He's in the gym right now.
You wanna meet him?

331
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,350
Do I? Lead the way.

332
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,990
That's Blindspot, right?

333
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,700
A differently abled member of The Seven.

334
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,330
We'll poll through the roof
with millennials.

335
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,710
Inclusion's a big priority for them.

336
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,830
Amazing.

337
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,710
And then I think we find an ethnic
or female or, fingers crossed,

338
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,880
an ethnic female
to replace The Deep, and we're golden.

339
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,470
Homelander, wow, you're...

340
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,810
It's an honor, sir.

341
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,190
Wait. Hold on. You can tell it's me?

342
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,780
Wow.

343
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,150
That's impressive.

344
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,530
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

345
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,530
Can I just say, "That is amazing"?

346
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,830
And you, my friend, are a true hero.

347
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,500
Not because of what you do
for a job, but...

348
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,250
- Because of what you've overcome.
- Thank you.

349
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,250
That means everything, coming from you.

350
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,260
Stop it. Come on.

351
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,880
Hey, guys, um...

352
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,760
- I just have one question if that's okay.
- Yeah.

353
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,930
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

354
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,060
All right. So...

355
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,190
What happens if, I don't know, I do this?

356
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,320
And now you're just another useless,
fucking blind guy.

357
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,290
This must be some kind of a joke, Ashley.

358
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,580
What made you think I would ever allow
a cripple into The Seven?

359
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,710
For fuck's sakes, Ashley,
don't look at him. Look at me.

360
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,470
Ashley! Look at me.

361
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,430
- Sorry, sorry.
- Let's get one thing straight.

362
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,930
The only reason you're here and not doing
corporate PR for fucking DivaCups

363
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,730
is that I brought you here.

364
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,860
You are dispensable,
which means you answer to me.

365
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,270
Okay. Okay.

366
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,570
From now on, I will set my own agenda,

367
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,820
I'll approve my own marketing,
and I'll write my own talking points.

368
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,950
You will tell me everything
that goes on on the 99th floor.

369
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,950
And I mean everything.

370
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,960
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

371
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,460
If a fucking lightbulb goes out,
you will tell me.

372
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,510
And, Ashley...

373
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,130
...in no fucking way do you decide
who goes in The Seven.

374
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,930
I decide.

375
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,220
Do we have an understanding?

376
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Yes.

377
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,070
Translucent was laid to rest today

378
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,030
surrounded by family, friends, fans,
and Vought comrades.

379
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,200
You can see the memorial,
featuring a performance by Starlight,

380
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,910
singing "Never Truly Vanish,"
on Voughtify.

381
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,200

383

[announced
Bet you can't resist this arrest.

384
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,170
America's hottest crime—fighter
is giving law enforcement

385
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,880
a superpowered makeover
in Citizen Starlight.

386
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,600
Coming this fall from Vought.
Go ahead, make her day.

387
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,020
You know how it is. Don't wanna
get stuck with the cleaning bill.

388
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,820
Okay.

389
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,150
So, what's your poison? You a leg guy?

390
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,120
An arm, please, actually.

391
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,160
Four hundred.

392
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,980
So do you want me to saw or chop or...'?

393
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,480
Whatever floats your boat, tiger.

394
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,870
Shit!

395
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Holy Shit! Holy Shit!

396
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,180
Thank you! That was so...

397
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,180
I keep the arm, right?

398
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,010
Just keep it refrigerated.

399
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,520
For an extra grand,
I'll let you chop off my dick.

400
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,110
Where's the closest ATM?

401
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,720
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

402
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,350
- What the hell happened?
- Hey!

403
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,220
Holy shit. Sit him down!
Sit him down. Bring him over here.

404
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
Shit.

405
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,950
Listen, he's broken
every single bone in his arm.

406
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,830
Broken half his ribs. I can't do nothing.
Take him to the hospital.

407
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,160
[
- Hospital.

408
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,750
Translate for me.
"Take him to the hospital."

409
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,710
Fuck!

410
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,630
Move, move.

411
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,770
Okay?

412
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,830
What'd he say? What's going on?

413
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,040
Frenchie, what'd he say?

414
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,820
- Cops seen this?
- No one's seen it.

415
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,740
I ain't trying to get life without parole.

416
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,040
They promised me

417
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,750
they would only smuggle in guns
and cocaine and fentanyl.

418
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,920
- Not fucking...
- Not human fucking cargo?

419
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,500
- Jesus Christ, Frenchie.
- They didn't tell me.

420
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,920
Or you didn't ask.

421
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,530
A Supe.

422
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,700
A Supe terrorist.

423
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,290
They got paid
to smuggle in a Supe terrorist.

424
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,800
How about this one?
How does it make you feel? Anyone?

425
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,680
- I hate it.
- That's a strong reaction, Margaret.

426
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,350
I'd love to follow up on that.

427
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,180
What do you mean when you say
you hate the term "Super Terrorist"?

428
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,140
I just mean, it's really scary.

429
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,940
It makes me wanna lock the door
and hide under the bed.

430
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,190
Which means a double-digit drop
the opening weekend

431
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,440
of the Tek Knight movie.

432
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,610
I keep saying,
"Super Villain" is the better term.

433
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,410
Jill, ask them what they think
about "Super Villain."

434
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,240
What about the term "Super Villain"?

435
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,410
That sounds better to me. More exciting.

436
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,120
- More exotic.
- Okay.

437
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,710
Okay, turning our attention back to these,
which do you prefer?

438
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,590
"Saving America,"
can I get a show of hands?

439
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,510
Okay. How about "Saving the World"?

440
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,220
Wow. Unanimous, strong reaction.

441
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,810
- So, what is it about...'?
- Nope. It's "Saving America."

442
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,190
I don't know.
I feel like "Saving the World" has a...

443
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,830
It's Americans that are gonna keep us
in the Army, not the fucking world.

444
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,370
It's "Saving America."

445
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,870
Pull the trigger.

446
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,920
Great. Great.

447
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Hey, man.

448
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,150
Thanks for letting me crash.

449
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,940
Sorry, about the bathroom.
I'll clean it up.

450
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,200
No need to apologise.

451
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Okay.

452
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,500
- Shit. You scared me.
- That's just Carol.

453
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,670
Good friend.

454
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,540
Carol, this is The Deep.

455
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,460
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Deep.

456
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,720
Would you like a Fresca?

457
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,430
Thank you.

458
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,020
Anyway, no need to apologise.

459
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,440
We've all been there. It's tough.

460
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,270
- Been where?
- Rock bottom.

461
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,690
I...

462
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't think I'm at rock bottom.

463
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,450
For me, my aha moment came

464
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,120
with a hostage situation at Kroger.

465
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,950
Multiple shooters.

466
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,880
I showed up, I'm letting arrows fly,
my aim is perfect.

467
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
But...

468
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,720
there's only so many arrows
a quiver can hold.

469
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,100
I just ran out.

470
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
And then...

471
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,230
we lost a lot of good people that day.

472
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,110
Then you start to question,

473
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,610
like, fucking arrows against TEC-9s?

474
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,820
...But?
- But I came to see

475
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,780
that archery isn't irrelevant,
it's timeless.

476
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,620
It's a pure and ancient art.

477
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,250
Carol helped me see that.

478
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,800
- What are you, his therapist or something?
- No.

479
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,090
No, therapy's very destructive, actually.

480
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,260
You could say I'm his teacher.

481
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,590
What about you, Deep?

482
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,600
What about...? What about me?

483
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,770
How did you end up here?

484
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,560
You can tell her, Deep.

485
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,400
Tell her what?

486
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,700
About your drinking.
About your self-esteem issues.

487
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,200
- Really open up, Deep.
- No, I don't...

488
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,740
I don't have a drinking... I'm fine.

489
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,410
- This is a safe space, Deep.
- If you don't have any self-esteem issues,

490
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,870
why are you constantly demeaning women?

491
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,420
- That's a good question.
- Okay, thank you.

492
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,170
I don't know what the fuck this is,
but it's weird as fuck, so I'm leaving.

493
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,090
We just want to help.

494
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,970
- Carol really helped me, Deep.
- No, thank you.

495
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,050
Help you get back into The Seven.

496
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,450
Yesterday, The Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children

497
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,200
at Splash Zone in Sandusky, Ohio.

498
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,960
He was later arrested and taken
to the Sandusky General Detention Center.

499
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,580
He was released on bail shortly after.

500
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,300
Did you make this?

501
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,890
You wrote something.

502
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
"Boy-ll

503
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,730
What boy?

504
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,110
I do not understand. What boy?

505
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Okay, so?

506
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,830
They were wired the money
from a blind account

507
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,460
to smuggle the bastard in.

508
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,380
- Cold trail.
- Amazing fucking friends of yours.

509
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,220
I never said they were my friends?
I only said we will be safe here.

510
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,180
- Okay, all right. What do we do?
- You just call 911.

511
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,890
What, an anonymous tip?

512
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,180
Yeah, I'm sure
that'll go straight to the mayor.

513
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,690
You saw that video.
What if he does that to an airplane?

514
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,610
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

515
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,650
So, what's your big plan, Hughie?

516
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,530
Okay, the CIA lady, right? Raynor?

517
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,610
Right.

518
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,370
The same CIA that wants to clamp our nuts
into some jumper cables.

519
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,830
We could call Butcher.

520
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,120
- For the last time, we don't need Butcher.
- Then what?

521
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
We should...

522
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,960
call Annie.

523
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,090
"Call Annie."

524
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,970
Annie?

525
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Yeah.

526
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,480
You mean Starlight?

527
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,480
'Cause that's who she is.

528
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,570
Vought has her phone so bugged,

529
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,570
they're praying that you do that.

530
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,370
No.

531
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,670
- You fucking called her?
- No, no. I'm not stupid, okay?

532
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,420
- I texted her.
- Fuck.

533
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,760
And then we met up,
but we're getting some Compound V.

534
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,300
- Fuck you! Are you fucking crazy?
- M.M., easy!

535
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,930
- You crazy? What are you doing?
- We were careful!

536
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,010
- We used burner phones.
- Kid, you don't get it.

537
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,680
They could've been following you.
They could be watching us right now!

538
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,480
If you're the fucking reason
why I can't finish

539
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,030
that Vermont country dollhouse,
I will fucking end you.

540
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,240
You've been walking around for days
like you wanna kick my ass,

541
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,660
so do it already.

542
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,750
Goddamn it.

543
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,290
Shit!

544
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,800
I don't want to kick your ass, Hughie.

545
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,590
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

546
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,720
I want to get home to my wife and my kid.

547
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,430
That's it.

548
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,850
If I still can.

549
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,280
- This guy could kill a lot of people...
- Hughie, let somebody else handle it.

550
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,700
There's no one else!
No one's coming to save us.

551
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
You don't get it.

552
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,280
You are not a soldier.

553
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,200
You're not a spy.

554
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,910
- You're a kid that sells stereo equipment.
- No, I don't!

555
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,170
I don't have a job.

556
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,300
Or Robin.

557
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,880
Or my dad. Or Annie.

558
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,140
One way or another, they all...

559
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,890
Now all I have is this.

560
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,190
This. Which is really
fucking depressing, but it's true.

561
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,240
So maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

562
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,660
But I can be Harry Potter.

563
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,410
Or, you know, John Connor

564
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,660
or, what's her name
from The Hunger Games?

565
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,790
Katniss.

566
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,670
The point is, I could be that person
that nobody thinks is awesome,

567
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,670
but it turns out
they're kind of fucking awesome.

568
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,140
M.M., listen, we help the CIA lady,

569
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,770
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

570
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,770
Ever think of that?

571
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,360
- My baby needs a mother!
- Oy.

572
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,150
Shut your trap, you dumb bird.

573
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,990
Or else I'll bollocks you.

574
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,740
But that's exactly
What William Butcher did.

575
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,790
Gecko?

576
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,620
Is that you?

577
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,380
Starlight? Annie, hi.

578
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,380
- Hi.
- My God, hi.

579
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,640
- Look at you, bigtime Seven hero.
- Shut up.

580
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,810
You know, I work in Vought Tower
at the labs on 67.

581
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,520
You don't say.

582
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,520
I see your posters everywhere.
They're marketing the shit out of you.

583
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,610
I'm happy for you, really.

584
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,230
Buy you some coffee?

585
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,820
Thank you.

586
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,530
Yeah, at the Capes for Christ
Bible Camp, yes, totally.

587
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,580
That Passion play we put on?
You were the best Jesus.

588
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,950
No one's gonna take a nail
through the hand like I can.

589
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,540
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

590
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,040
My God, those freckles.

591
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,000
- You know he wanted to make out with me?
- Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up?

592
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,510
- Sacri-licious.
- Yeah, we never did.

593
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:03,970
- Why not? He was so cute.
- Yeah, it was what Ezekiel always said.

594
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,220
And my mom too.

595
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,470
That God is watching over you,
every second.

596
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,940
I thought that he was watching us,
and I thought that he'd be upset.

597
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,110
Yeah, it's a messed up thing
to tell a kid.

598
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,780
Yeah, but looking back?

599
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,490
I should've made out with Big Game.

600
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,950
I should've done
a lot more stuff because...

601
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,200
there is nothing up there.

602
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,370
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

603
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,590
Not God, not Homelander.

604
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,340
Not anybody.

605
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,930
It's all just...

606
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,970
lies.

607
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,320
I need a favour.

608
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,070
Yeah. Yeah, anything
for a Bible Camp alum.

609
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,250
I need you to go into the labs on 67
and steal me a sample of Compound V.

610
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,420
Um...

611
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,920
I...

612
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,840
I don't know what that is.

613
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,930
See?

614
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,970
Another lie.

615
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,470
I know how we're made.

616
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,810
And it is not Jesus.

617
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,520
I can't. I mean, it's impossible.
I'm a nobody there. I'm a lab rat.

618
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,190
They cutoff my limbs
and they grow back. I cannot get you...

619
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
You have to.

620
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,910
Or I put this on Facebook tonight.

621
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,500
Gecko,

622
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,000
former teen star
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

623
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,540
working as an S&M hooker...

624
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,630
as a side hustle?

625
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,390
I'm sure enquiring minds will wanna know.

626
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,470
Annie?

627
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,100
- I thought that we were friends.
- I'm sorry.

628
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,640
But...

629
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,770
we're not anything.

630
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,240
Hi.

631
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,870
You know who we are.

632
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,120
But let's meet another hero.

633
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,910
This is Lance Corporal Dan Miller.

634
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,630
Dan and the other brave marines
of Second Battalion

635
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,380
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

636
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,710
We're proud to fly alongside them.

637
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,380
And now we could use your support.

638
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,390
That's right, Maeve,
with our new campaign, Saving America.

639
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,930
Here I go, you guys! Wish me luck.

640
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,600
FYI, not a real base.

641
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,060
As if Homelander
and Maeve are gonna eat MREs

642
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,190
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

643
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:03,150
Yeah, hi, we're filming right now.
Excuse me?

644
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,650
You might recognise Army Boy
as Hotel Clerk 2

645
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,900
- from "The Devil's Breath"...
- Hello, excuse... Okay.

646
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,950
...episode
of Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.

647
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,490
Well, hello!

648
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,410
My God, hi!

649
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,160
My nana's your biggest fan.
I'm Stormfront.

650
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,500
- Great.
- Right, yeah. From Seattle, right?

651
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,710
Portland, actually, Your, Highness.

652
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,180
Holy shit! Your eyes
are really fucking blue up close.

653
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,970
You are fun.

654
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,140
It's been a hoot, but we got work to do,
so let's get back to it.

655
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,400
Totally.
They just wanted me to meet you.

656
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,860
Who?

657
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,110
The boys on 82.

658
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,440
- I'm the new girl.
- —Wait.

659
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,740
What are you talking about?

660
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,780
Hi. I'm in The Seven.

661
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,490
Replacing Translucent.

662
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,160
God bless his soul.

663
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,080
Ink's barely dry
but, yeah, reporting for duty.

664
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,290
Fuck, yeah!

665
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,550
No, I don't think that this is...
It's not true.

666
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,090
I don't know anything about this.

667
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,430
Wow. Well, Stormfront?

668
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,010
Who delivered the good news?

669
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,730
Mr. Edgar, the big guy?

670
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,850
All right, back to one.

671
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,020
Wonderful.

672
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,610
Great.

673
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
All right!

674
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,030
Great!

675
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,320
- Going again, people.
- Stand by.

676
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,450
Well, I think this is going great.

677
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,750
You know, you ain't John Cusack, man.

678
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,210
You ain't got no motherfucking boom box.

679
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,460
- Sorry?
- You want to get back with Starlight.

680
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,760
- No. No, I don't.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

681
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,720
But this ain't the way to do it, Hughie.

682
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,720
You can't keep pulling this shit, man.
Calling her, texting her.

683
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,390
- Are you crazy?
- You sound like Butcher.

684
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,350
- She's on our side.
- I know.

685
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,860
I'm saying this for her, kid.
You're putting her in danger.

686
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,070
Homelander finds out
that she's been talking to you?

687
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,240
She's fucked.

688
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,410
The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

689
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,870
the deeper in the meat grinder she goes.

690
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,450
How are you guys doing?

691
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,500
We're hanging in there.

692
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,920
- Has Butcher contacted you?
- Nope.

693
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,550
He's completely ghosted.

694
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,380
- Do you think he killed Madelyn Stillwell?
- I'd like to think that he didn't.

695
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,600
But... I don't know.

696
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,640
Deputy director, I know this might not be
the best time to ask, but do you ever...?

697
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,100
Hear about your family?

698
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,270
Your daughter is starting soccer, I think.

699
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,490
Soccer?

700
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
Ma'am.

701
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,490
Can See them?

702
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,290
You know what?
Let's see if this checks out.

703
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,290
And I will see what I can do.

704
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,580
Thank you, ma'am.

705
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,840
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

706
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,720
All right, about 510", 165,

707
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,590
black hair,
wearing knockoff jeans and sneakers,

708
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,760
probably from Taiwan, maybe India.

709
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,140
You got all that from the video?

710
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,140
So the other shoe drops
and it just crushes us all.

711
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,980
Meaning?

712
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,980
Meaning, I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

713
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,490
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

714
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,910
- And I think you just handed it to me.
- Okay, so then what's the whole picture?

715
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,820
The whole picture? It's Vought.

716
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:45,160
- It's a fucking coup from the inside.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

717
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,830
Ma'am, your nose.

718
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,880
- Fuck! Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Holy shit!

719
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,300
- Holy shit!
- Come on! Get in! Go, go, go!

720
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,520
- Must be a Supe out there.
- Are our heads gonna explode?

721
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,480
Frenchie, who do you know
who could do that?

722
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,770
- No one!
- Are our heads gonna explode?

723
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,440
Look, I have a daughter.

724
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,440
I'm worried about Super Terrorists too.

725
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,240
But that does not mean

726
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,700
that Vought can use that fear
to control us.

727
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,180
- Morning.
- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry...

728
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,790
- That's all right, Samantha.
- Busy day.

729
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,080
Morning, Homelander.

730
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,580
To what do I owe the pleasure?

731
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,920
Well, you never come up to 99,
so figured I'd pay you a visit.

732
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,090
- What a lovely idea.
- Right?

733
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,260
After all, you run a superhero company

734
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,430
and you never check in
with your superheroes, do you?

735
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,600
Like, I don't know,

736
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,100
around the hiring of that girl,
for example.

737
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,640
You wished to be consulted on Stormfront?

738
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:51,940
Well, why not?

739
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,570
I signed off on all the rest.

740
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,860
I'm the leader of The Seven.

741
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,200
- For which you have my undying respect.
- See, I don't think I do.

742
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
No.

743
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,240
Not even Madelyn would've dared
to try and pull this kind of shit.

744
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:10,370
Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

745
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,080
No, no. Stan.

746
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,040
I am Vought.

747
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,590
You show my photo
to some illiterate fucking camel jockey

748
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,880
in the middle of the Sahara,

749
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,880
he's gonna turn around
and say, "Homelander,"

750
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,260
in perfect American.

751
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,430
You know what?

752
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,930
My contract's up, end of this year.

753
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,360
Maybe it's time I move on.

754
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,070
How do you think
your shareholders would feel about that?

755
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,340
What do you know about Frederick Vought?

756
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Excuse me?

757
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,130
Frederick. Vought.

758
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,140
Our esteemed founder.

759
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,810
Well, I don't know, not a lot, probably.
I only read his autobiography...

760
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,020
- [five times?
{chuckles softly]

761
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,820
Not the self-serving bullshit

762
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,360
that we peddle to the shareholders,
the real story.

763
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,820
- Enlighten me.
- Got his doctorate from Munich.

764
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,070
Ahead of his time in genetics.

765
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,580
Such the rising young star that in '39,

766
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,210
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

767
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,330
where he enjoyed
a ready supply of human subjects

768
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,130
on which to test
his earliest iterations of Compound V.

769
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,380
For which we condemn
in the strongest of possible terms.

770
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,090
Early in '44, he felt the winds change,

771
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,390
got spirited away to the Allies.

772
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,510
When Oppenheimer was flailing
with the bomb,

773
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,230
Dr. Vought already had
practical applications of Compound V

774
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,560
tested in the field.

775
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,360
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

776
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,360
killing Germans by the dozen.

777
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,990
So Roosevelt pardoned him,

778
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,700
and he became
as Wonder Bread American

779
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,780
as Disney and Edison.

780
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,290
Well, this is a truly fascinating,

781
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,830
if not slightly condescending lecture,
but...

782
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,250
I don't think I see the point, Stan.

783
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,540
The point is...

784
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,420
that you are under a misconception
that we are a superhero company.

785
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,510
We are not.

786
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,430
What we are, really,
is a pharmaceutical company.

787
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,930
And you are not our most valuable asset.

788
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,640
That would be our confidential formula
for Compound V.

789
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,190
Which you, man-child that you are,
released into the wild.

790
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,200
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Let me remind you.

791
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,740
You slipped Compound V
to terrorists all over the globe

792
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,410
to get you and your cronies
into national defense.

793
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,200
But maybe at the cost of destroying
the whole company.

794
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,170
I don't think I appreciate your tone, sir.

795
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:00,750
Not much at all.

796
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,010
And I don't appreciate
that the FDA now knows about Compound V

797
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:09,260
or that it's only a matter of time
before the public finds out.

798
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,890
While you're preening
at the Golden Globes,

799
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:17,310
we're busy, running around like maniacs,
trying to clean up the mess you made.

800
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:25,440
I don't have to consult you
about Stormfront or anything else.

801
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:33,740
Now, I believe you have a premiere
of Tek Knight Lives to go to?

802
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,370
What are you doing here?

803
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,250
I've come to see my son.

804
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,730
Fuck, Hughie. So glad you...

805
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,980
got us into this shit.

806
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,860
She had a husband.

807
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,900
Right?

808
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,530
A kid?

809
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,660
Two kids.

810
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,410
And I got her killed.

811
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,710
You didn't get her killed.

812
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,580
That wasn't meant for us.

813
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,050
How do you know?

814
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,920
Because our brains aren't
all over the dash, that's how.

815
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,800
Someone was watching her.

816
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,090
And the minute she said something she
wasn't supposed to...

817
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,510
Somebody from Vought?

818
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:25,100
So we're saying
that Vought may have just assassinated

819
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,980
the deputy director of the CIA.

820
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,900
And now we're in the middle of that too.
Happy now, motherfucker?

821
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Hello?

822
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,750
It's me.

823
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,800
- Jesus, you shouldn't be calling.
- I'm on a burner phone, it's fine.

824
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,590
Yeah, but somebody could be listening.

825
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,590
Hughie, we did it.

826
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,640
He's getting me the Compound V
in, like, a day or two.

827
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,890
What do you think? New York Times?

828
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,270
I mean, I was thinking CNN or MSNBC, but——

829
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,190
Wait, just hold on a second.

830
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,940
Come on, this is
what we've been waiting for.

831
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,240
Let's burn those fuckers down.

832
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,110
Just take a beat,
let's figure out the best way to do this.

833
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,740
- Why? What happened?
- Nothing.

834
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,280
Vought's just dangerous, that's all.

835
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:24,000
You gotta be careful.
I don't want you getting hurt.

836
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
I'm not gonna get...

837
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,880
If something happened,
you know you can trust me.

838
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,170
We're in this together.

839
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,090
No, I do trust you. It's just...

840
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,010
I just want to take our time.
Do this right. That's all.

841
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:43,470
I know when you're not
telling me the truth, Hughie.

842
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,100
I kind of lived with it every single day.

843
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,980
Don't lie to me.

844
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,730
Not again.

845
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,490
I'm not.

846
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:03,370
Swear to God.

847
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,380
Whatever. I... I gotta go.

848
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,540
All right, easy does it, lads.
Easy does it.

849
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,580
I tried to tell this cunt...

850
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:50,960
I'm with that lot.

851
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
Yeah?

852
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,880
What the fuck are you wearing?

853
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,510
That is a good question.

854
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,970
You called him?

855
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,350
I'm sorry, Petit Hughie.
It's not a game now.

856
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,640
We need a real captain.

857
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,350
Frenchie's right.

858
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,690
This is a fucking mess, son.

859
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:15,150
We got a Supe terrorist,
Raynor's blown her canister,

860
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,610
and we're the most wanted cunts
in the country.

861
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,570
But don't you worry.

862
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,370
Daddy's home.
