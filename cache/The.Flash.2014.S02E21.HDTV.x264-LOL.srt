1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:03,077
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,829
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:09,697
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:12,515
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,826
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,311
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:21,411
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:24,781
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:27,167
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:29,719
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,888
Barry, what you're seeing
is the Speed Force...

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,390
Your past, your present, your future.

13
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:36,860
Say, Iris, you look amazing.

14
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,061
Thanks, Tony.

15
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:40,864
His skin changed. It turned to metal.

16
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:44,067
Tony might have been a bully,
but he didn't deserve to die.

17
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,619
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

18
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,656
I can't help but wonder... Maybe
we were meant to be together.

19
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:50,874
You lost your powers?

20
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,692
I gave them up to save Wally.

21
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:56,412
I can re-create the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

22
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:58,498
Let's set up the particle accelerator.

23
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,724
Barry... he's gone.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,510
This wasn't su...

25
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,011
I didn't...

26
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:14,481
I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:16,850
We lost him.

28
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:18,268
No, no, no, no, he...

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,103
He could've got knocked somewhere

30
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:21,821
or maybe even run there.

31
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:26,442
Nothing on the GPS.

32
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:28,027
There were strikes
all over the building.

33
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,779
Jesse, come down here, please.

34
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:34,951
Jesse?

35
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,003
Wally?

36
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:43,710
Oh, God, Wally!

37
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,545
No, no!

38
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:47,263
Wally! Wally, wake up!

39
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,536
- No!
- Can you hear me?

40
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,133
- Wally!
- Jesse, Jesse!

41
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,601
- Jesse!
- Wally!

42
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:52,969
Jesse!

43
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:56,856
Stop yelling, please.

44
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:58,141
Her heart stopped.

45
00:01:58,143 --> 00:01:59,726
Her heart stopped!

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,613
Jesse...

47
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:04,990
Are you okay?

48
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,152
Jesse!

49
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,254
Oh...

50
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,485
It's beating. Her heart's beating.

51
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,546
Henry's a doctor. He should see her.

52
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:22,749
I'm so glad you're okay.

53
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,918
Hey, what's with him?

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,220
It's Barry.

55
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,589
Barry's gone.

56
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,090
Are you good, Wally?

57
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,009
Okay, we should get you
home, get some rest, okay?

58
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,846
- I don't understand.
- No, it's okay. Let's go.

59
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,232
Jesse.

60
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,736
Henry, Wells' daughter is upstairs.

61
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,355
The energy hit her too.

62
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,826
Her heart stopped beating.

63
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:52,245
Henry!

64
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:53,663
All right.

65
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,100
I saw him!

66
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:15,935
I saw Barry.

67
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,849
He's alive.

68
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,298

69
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:34,047
Joe?

70
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,466
Good to see you, Barry.

71
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,721
But I'm not Joe.

72
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,361
- You're not?
- No.

73
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,444
And all of this?

74
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,649
It's not real?

75
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,084
How do you feel, being back here?

76
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:59,528
I feel awful.

77
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:06,329
We thought you'd be more comfortable

78
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,715
talking to someone who looked familiar

79
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:10,500
and in a place you knew.

80
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:13,302
"We"?

81
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:16,139
Who's "we," exactly?

82
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,558
That's a little hard to explain.

83
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,438
Sit, Barry.

84
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:27,016
Sit.

85
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,112
How much do you know
about the Speed Force?

86
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:42,698
It's the source of my power.
It's what makes me a speedster.

87
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,534
Yes...

88
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,536
and no.

89
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,871
When the first subatomic particle

90
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:51,124
sprang forth from the Big Bang

91
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:54,594
to form reality as you know it,

92
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,262
we were there.

93
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,633
When the last proton
decays, stops vibrating,

94
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:04,887
and plunges the
universe into heat death,

95
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,390
we'll be there too.

96
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:10,526
I'm talking to the Speed Force?

97
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,950
Isn't that like saying I'm having a
conversation with gravity or light or...

98
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,543
You need a minute.

99
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:30,413
It's okay if you do.

100
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:32,582
It's a lot to take in.

101
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,968
So you're saying I'm... I'm
talking to the source of my power,

102
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,972
which just so happens to look like...

103
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:43,342
my adoptive dad?

104
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,761
That's trippy.

105
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:48,681
We pretty much invented trippy here.

106
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,684
Look, I'm... I'm not sure
why you brought me here,

107
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,435
but you need to send me back.

108
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,771
My friends are in danger from Zoom.

109
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,827
Did you see that?

110
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:06,249
You're not going back.

111
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,583
Not until...

112
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,700
Till what?

113
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,678
Until you catch that.

114
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:38,814
Cisco says Barry's still alive.

115
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,616
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

116
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,202
Harry, I vibed him in
the center of a storm.

117
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,581
It was, like, in, like,
a vortex or something.

118
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,791
He's in...

119
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,626
He's in the Speed Force.

120
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,161
- Get him out, damn it.
- I...

121
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:54,191
- You can get him out, can't you?
- I don't know if I can.

122
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:56,582
Henry, come here.

123
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:06,392
Listen, you are the only
one that can help Jesse.

124
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,594
Let me sit on Wells

125
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,013
till he figures out what
the hell he did to Barry.

126
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,644
I think we can get him back.

127
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,351
Joe, I know you love Barry, okay?

128
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:19,355
But you have Iris, and you have Wally.

129
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,574
Barry's all I have left.

130
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,359
I promise.

131
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,945
We'll find him.

132
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,288
Thank God you're here.

133
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,874
Caitlin's usually the
one doing this, but...

134
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,543
Heart rate's normal.

135
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,712
Reflexes and breathing are fine.

136
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,430
She should be waking up.

137
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,049
She's just not.

138
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,185
It was the same with Barry.

139
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:51,687
Um, after the first accident,

140
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,109
he was in a coma that
no one could explain.

141
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:55,391
What did you do with him?

142
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,944
So they brought him here...
Well, Wells brought him here.

143
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,228
The other Wells.

144
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,697
Right, the Wells who
was actually Thawne.

145
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,065
- Eobard, not Eddie.
- Right.

146
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,650
It's... it's complicated.

147
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,119
Anyway, we took care
of Barry while Wells...

148
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,405
Thawne... treated him.

149
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,157
Are there any records of that treatment?

150
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,459
We might find clues how to help Jesse.

151
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,245
Uh, yeah, they'd be
downstairs in the storage room,

152
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,580
in the morgue.

153
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,498
Ew, you guys have a morgue?

154
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,417
Well, it's not like a morgue morgue.

155
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,974
It's not... it's like a poor
man's morgue, really. Morgue-ish.

156
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,011
Would one of you go get them, please?

157
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,842
Okay, well, I'm not going alone.

158
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,624
Thank you.

159
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:37,850
Okay, so it's a morgue morgue.

160
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:42,021
But, you know, we had to keep
the dead meta-humans somewhere.

161
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:45,941
Yeah, looks like you did a
lot more than just store them.

162
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:49,612
Fake Wells might've done a few
dissections for study purposes.

163
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:52,748
And this didn't tip any of you
off that he might be secretly evil?

164
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,200
It was a crazy time, okay?

165
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,951
We had a lot going on.

166
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,453
I'll tell you what...

167
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,455
It's a good thing
Thawne was so organized.

168
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,626
Would you stop knocking stuff over?

169
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,594
You stop. I didn't touch anything.

170
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,179
Okay, whatever you say.

171
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:10,383
Okay, this is it. This
is Barry's ex-file.

172
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,642
A zombie?

173
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,277
For real?

174
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,380
Tony?

175
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,832
Nope, not Tony... Not anymore.

176
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,051
- Get behind me.
- You get behind me.

177
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,674
Tony!

178
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,492
- Ooh!
- Oh.

179
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,368
- Didn't see that one coming.
- No.

180
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,447
Zombie Girder. This...

181
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,556
Iris.

182
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,308
We're glad you made it, Barry.

183
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,862
Not Iris.

184
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,230
It's just you again.

185
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,403
Sit, Barry. Sit.

186
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,155
You're always on your feet.

187
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,998
You remember this place,

188
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,000
where we first kissed?

189
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,137
Yeah, of course, except that wasn't you.

190
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:08,689
We thought you'd find this place
and our appearance less upsetting.

191
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:13,648
Yet you seem upset.

192
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,235
My friends, my city...

193
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,271
my whole world is in danger.

194
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,241
Zoom is on a rampage with the
power that he stole from me,

195
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,943
and you are keeping me here.

196
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,246
You were given a rare and precious gift,

197
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,165
and you rejected it.

198
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,200
No, I did not reject it.

199
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,869
I gave up my powers to
save someone's life...

200
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,204
To be a hero.

201
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,840
I nearly killed myself
trying to get them back,

202
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,111
when you brought me
here, wherever here is.

203
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,797
- That's not what we meant.
- Okay.

204
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,550
If you would rather
have given these powers

205
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,185
to somebody else,

206
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,353
why did you give them to me?

207
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,857
Because you're The Flash, Barry.

208
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,112
We got a new problem.

209
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,982
Our accelerator experiment
seems to have reanimated

210
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,900
one of the dead metas in our morgue.

211
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,236
"Reanimated," like brought back to life?

212
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,988
Life-ish. You ever
seen "The Walking Dead"?

213
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,239
It's "The Walking Dead,"

214
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:14,659
but without higher brain function
and with major rage issues.

215
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,294
Still unsure if our brains
are on the menu, though.

216
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,163
- Which one?
- Tony Woodward.

217
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,666
The bully from school who
turned into the metal man?

218
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,334
That's not good, Cisco.

219
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,336
History repeats itself.

220
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,589
First as tragedy

221
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,674
and then as farce.

222
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,513
Wells, as a parent, believe me,

223
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,233
I have nothing but sympathy
for what you're going through.

224
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,518
Listen to me closely when I say to you,

225
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,770
we got a lot of fires
burning at the same time,

226
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,189
and if we all work together,

227
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:47,025
we just might be able to put them out.

228
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,527
Let Henry take care of your daughter.

229
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,696
Me and Iris will handle
this Girder situation,

230
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,082
but you and Cisco are the scientists.

231
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,867
You're the only one
who can bring Barry back

232
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,809
from wherever the hell he is right now.

233
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,922
Ramon...

234
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,457
give those medical records to Henry,

235
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,510
and meet me in the Breach
Room in five minutes.

236
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,763
We've got work to do.

237
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,882
Now we just need to find Tony.

238
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,518
Yeah, hopefully before he kills someone.

239
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,802
Come on.

240
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,620
Big Belly Burger in
Starling City is way better.

241
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,072
This place sucks.

242
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,581
Oh, my God. Is that your car?

243
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,739
Oh, yeah.

244
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,759
That's my mom's car!

245
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,931
So how do we know this is safe?

246
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,432
Well, define "safe."

247
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,832
Safe, as in my brain's not gonna melt.

248
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,988
No. It's a simple feedback
loop, Ramon, all right?

249
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,158
When you vibe on Barry, your brain
waves send me the necessary data

250
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,776
to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket

251
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,945
or corner of the universe
that Barry is stuck in.

252
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:17,415
And then we electrically stimulate

253
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,784
your prefrontal cortex
while opening a breach,

254
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,586
which gives you physical access to Barry

255
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,956
and lets you be the
beacon to guide him home.

256
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,208
Simple feedback loop.

257
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,128
I'm sorry. Did you say
electrically stimulate?

258
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,598
Ramon, do you want to
bring Barry back or not?

259
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,387
Okay.

260
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,982
And we have a lock.

261
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,820
I don't understand.

262
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:59,907
If I'm The Flash, then why
are you doing this to me?

263
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:02,293
Why do I have to catch
this... this thing

264
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,162
before you let me go back?

265
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,581
Please, look, I will
do whatever you want.

266
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,917
Just let me go back right
now, so I can help my friends.

267
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:14,672
Barry!

268
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,479
Barry, turn around!

269
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,515
Barry!

270
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,945
What is that?

271
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:30,686
What is that?

272
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,077
Those are your friends.

273
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,099
They want you to come back.

274
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,582
Can I?

275
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,202
Of course.

276
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,113
But if you do,

277
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:48,278
it'll be without your powers.

278
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,763
Take my hand!

279
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,468
Do it. Take my hand.

280
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,703
The choice is yours, Barry.

281
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,492
Barry!

282
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,973
What is going on in here?

283
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,591
Just hang on a little longer, Ramon...

284
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,976
A little longer.

285
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,312
Hey, you're killing him!

286
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:50,518
Cisco!

287
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,020
Hey, Cisco, can you hear me?

288
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,784
I saw him.

289
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,159
Barry... he turned to me.

290
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,362
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,331
I lost him.

292
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,704
No.

293
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:19,261
Whoa, Cisco's meta-human
alert app is going crazy.

294
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,799
Oh, Tony just trashed
the hell out of Jitters.

295
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,051
Now, that is strange.

296
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,420
He knocks over a hydrant
on 4th and Stevenson,

297
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,139
doesn't go in the building,

298
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,641
then smashes a Humvee in
front of the Big Belly Burger,

299
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,226
but doesn't go in the building.

300
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,261
Gets to CC Jitters...
He actually goes in.

301
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:40,065
Yeah, it's like Jitters
was his target, but why?

302
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,686
When I was in Iron
Heights awaiting trial,

303
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,939
I had a cellmate who always
swore he was gonna break out.

304
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,108
At a pre-trial hearing,
he stole a deputy's gun

305
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,993
and escaped in a police cruiser.

306
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,778
There's a point to this, Joe, I promise.

307
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,997
Now, the poor, dumb bastard
could have gone anywhere, right?

308
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,367
But he was apprehended two
hours later. Do you know why?

309
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:01,420
'Cause he went to his old
girlfriend's house looking for her.

310
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:02,871
So you think that's what Tony's doing,

311
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,456
even in the state he's in now?

312
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,291
I think people are creatures of habit,

313
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:08,961
sometimes at a level stronger
than conscious thought.

314
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,629
No, I don't think that
Tony had a girlfriend.

315
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:14,349
I mean, not the way that he
was hitting on me when he...

316
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,635
He came into Jitters.

317
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,221
He's after me again.

318
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:22,391
So, when he was after
you the first time,

319
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:25,978
where'd you see him next, after Jitters?

320
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Home.

321
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:29,648
He came to our house when he took you.

322
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,150
Wally's there now.

323
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:32,651
No, no, Dad, this is good.

324
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,653
We know where he is, and
we know what he wants.

325
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:36,488
That means we know how to beat him.

326
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,157
How do you propose we do that?

327
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,293
We use me as bait to lure
him back to S.T.A.R. Labs,

328
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:44,163
where Cisco and Wells can kill him...

329
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,882
again.

330
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:50,169
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

331
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,988
Who are you pretending to be now?

332
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,242
I don't have time for this.

333
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,244
Yes, you do, Barry.

334
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:18,747
You have all the time in the universe...

335
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,244
- literally.
- No, I don't.

336
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,753
And how can you stand there in judgment
and accuse me of rejecting my gift?

337
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:28,390
Do you have any idea how much I've done
since I was first struck by lightning,

338
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,644
how many people I've helped with
the power that you gave me...

339
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,063
what I've sacrificed?

340
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,348
Of course we do.

341
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,684
You've saved countless lives.

342
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:43,355
And now you're the only thing

343
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:48,562
standing in between your
world and unspeakable evil.

344
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:51,747
And yet, for all of that,

345
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,667
you've never been here.

346
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:03,617
_

347
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,882
I can't believe he's coming here.

348
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,052
Wally. Thank you.

349
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,054
Don't mention it.

350
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,807
Wait.

351
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,894
I've been meaning to ask you. Uh...

352
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,779
How are you feeling?

353
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,231
Tired, but fine, I guess.

354
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:30,736
So you don't notice anything different?

355
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,789
Uh, no.

356
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,576
I mean, I want you to know you can come
and talk to me if you're scared or...

357
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:42,831
you have questions about
how your body's changing.

358
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,833
Oh.

359
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,970
I think you're a little late
for the puberty talk, Dad.

360
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,471
I've seen the Internet.

361
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:55,010
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

362
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,600
Are you okay?

363
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:08,157
Wally, go upstairs.

364
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,693
Please, go upstairs, now.

365
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,246
Dad, do you really think
that he's a meta-human?

366
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:16,081
Well, he got zapped by
the particle accelerator,

367
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,700
and he was unconscious.
It was worth a shot.

368
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,668
I gave you that mug.

369
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,836
He's coming.

370
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,843
- You sure about this?
- You know what?

371
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,878
Two minutes ago, I would've
said yes, absolutely.

372
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,797
But now...

373
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,549
what the hell?

374
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:42,524
Tony! Hey!

375
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:45,944
Come on, over here.

376
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,858
You getting towards S.T.A.R. Labs?

377
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,995
- On my way.
- I'll meet you there.

378
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:02,294
Wally, stay here! I'll be right back!

379
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,884
Why did you bring me here?

380
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:11,503
Your mother's death
happened to you, Barry.

381
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:14,556
It made who you are,
but have you accepted it,

382
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,093
really accepted losing her?

383
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:22,681
Maybe that's why you
couldn't come here...

384
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:25,901
'cause that would make it real.

385
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:28,687
I know it's real.

386
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:31,940
Every day I know it.

387
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:34,860
I had a chance to save her.

388
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:37,946
You saw what I chose.

389
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:40,949
And you're at peace with that decision?

390
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,419
"At peace""

391
00:23:47,174 --> 00:23:48,841
How could someone ever be at peace

392
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:51,043
with letting his mother die...

393
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,100
Deciding that his life was
more valuable than hers?

394
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:10,779
Do you really think your mother
would've wanted you to die for her?

395
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,533
And out of all the
people the Flash saved

396
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:16,785
as a result of that decision,

397
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:18,585
what about them?

398
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:22,958
Do their lives have value too?

399
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,084
I don't have to listen to this.

400
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:34,586
I have to get home.

401
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,109
Cisco!

402
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,610
Is that zombie still behind you?

403
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,231
Good news is we lured
Tony back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

404
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,983
Bad news is we lured Tony
back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

405
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:56,885
No, no. This is good. Okay, sidenote...

406
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:58,737
You both might want to be
on this side of the room,

407
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:01,490
especially if you're wearing any jewelry
or you have any metal plates in your body.

408
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:02,874
- Huh?
- Excuse me?

409
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,710
The stray energy from the accelerator

410
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,912
reactivated Girder's brain...
Well, parts of it, anyway.

411
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:10,165
So I disassembled our MRI
machine to set up these...

412
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,864
Electromagnets. So, when
Girder walks through that door

413
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,920
and gets caught in the
field that they generate,

414
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:17,756
it should disrupt the energy
wave that turned him Abby Normal.

415
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,174
Like wiping a hard drive.

417
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,651
so I can't actually turn this
on until he's in the room.

418
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,958
There he is. Hi!

419
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,921
Why don't it look like it's working?

420
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,340
Because it's not. Uh,
let's get out of here.

421
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:59,498
This is the safest
place for her for now.

422
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:02,835
Not safe enough.

423
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:05,004
Plans A through G did not work.

424
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,225
Do we have anything in
here that can stop him?

425
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,144
Barry could stop him if
we could bring him back.

426
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:13,623
We tried that already, Dr. Allen.

427
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,442
We need to try it again.

428
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:20,073
Somebody needs to try something.
That door's not gonna hold.

429
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,357
Mom.

430
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,109
Hi, Barry.

431
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:08,367
You're not my mother.

432
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,572
Why are you doing this to me?

433
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:17,826
We're not doing anything
to you, sweetheart.

434
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:20,712
You're just so tired.

435
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:23,465
Sit, Barry. Sit.

436
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,430
You were right all along.

437
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:40,482
I haven't accepted it...

438
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,435
not for a second.

439
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:46,105
I don't think I ever will.

440
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,611
My beautiful boy...

441
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:56,999
You have to find a way.

442
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,584
How?

443
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,202
I don't know.

444
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,538
But I know this.

445
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,458
What you've become... It's wonderful...

446
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,210
a miracle even,

447
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:12,798
but it won't make bad
things stop happening to you.

448
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,967
Even the Flash can't
outrun the tragedies

449
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:17,970
the universe is gonna
keep sending your way.

450
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,305
You have to accept that.

451
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,105
And then you can truly run free.

452
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,863
I know.

453
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,948
I just miss her.

454
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:34,903
I miss you so much.

455
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:39,825
What if I told you
that she's proud of you?

456
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:43,829
And of the man that you've become?

457
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:46,632
Who's telling me that...

458
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,835
the Speed Force or my mother?

459
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:51,587
Both.

460
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,800
Is there any other way out of here?

461
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:15,136
No, the Breach Room was
designed to be sealed off.

462
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:17,805
All right, look, if
it's me that he wants,

463
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,640
- I'll just lead him away.
- No, you won't.

464
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:21,192
You'll never even
make it past that door.

465
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:22,810
If he came back from the
dead and still wants you,

466
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:24,562
what makes you think
he's gonna let you go now?

467
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:26,147
Wait.

468
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,718
I saw Barry. He had this look.

469
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,353
What if we couldn't get
him out of the Speed Force

470
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,855
because he didn't want to come back?

471
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,307
Do you remember this book?

472
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,960
It was always your favorite.

473
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,281
"Once there was a little
dinosaur called a Maiasaur,

474
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,632
"who lived with his mother.

475
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,617
"One day, he told his mother,

476
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,570
"'I wish I were special
like the other dinosaurs.

477
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:53,741
If I were a T. rex, I could
chomp with my ferocious teeth!"

478
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:57,078
"'But if you were a T.
rex, ' said his mother,

479
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,747
'how would you hug me with
your tiny little arms?'"

480
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:07,254
"'I wish I were an Apatosaurus,
' said the little dinosaur,

481
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:11,475
"'so with my long neck I could
see high above the treetops.'

482
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,262
"'But if you were an
Apatosaurus, ' said his mother,

483
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:17,014
"'how would you hear me in the treetops

484
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:20,601
"'when I told you I love you?

485
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:24,355
"What makes you so
special, little Maiasaur?'

486
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,157
"said his mother.

487
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,612
"'Is it your ferocious teeth
or long neck or pointy beak?

488
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:34,498
"'What makes you special is out of all

489
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,919
"'of the different dinosaurs
in the big, wide world,

490
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:43,541
"'you have the mother
who is just right for you

491
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:45,042
and who will always'"...

492
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,962
"'Love you.'"

493
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,966
You're ready.

494
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:27,301
Turn it on.

495
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,170
We got to try again.

496
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:30,504
Any of you got a better idea?

497
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:32,556
When you look into the Speed Force,

498
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,842
can someone else see into it too?

499
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:36,927
Well, as long as you're
in physical contact

500
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:40,231
with Ramon while he's vibing, then...

501
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,849
yes.

502
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:43,317
Let me do that.

503
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,569
I can get Barry to come back.

504
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,988
No.

505
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,440
Let me do it.

506
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,192
Please.

507
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:01,035
Iris...

508
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,033
Barry.

509
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:44,245
Barry, come home to me.

510
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:53,587
Run, Barry. Run.

511
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:31,430
Barry!

512
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:33,781
Barry!

513
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,680
Ha ha!

514
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,802
I'm so glad you're back,
'cause we're about to die.

515
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:42,887
Wait. What?

516
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,023
- So...
- Girder.

517
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,557
Girder came back to life, and
he's all Young Frankenstein now,

518
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:50,978
and he only recognizes Iris,
and she lured him to my workshop

519
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,314
so we could demagnetize him,
but the machine shorted out,

520
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:54,698
so he's about to come through that door

521
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,812
and smush us all into chunky salsa
and possibly eat our brains out.

522
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:58,721
- I don't know. Jury's still out on that.
- All right, I got it.

523
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:00,151
I-I will lure him to your workshop,

524
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:02,130
and we figure out a way to
turn the power back on, okay?

525
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:05,492
Plan H.

526
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:26,263
Hey, Tony!

527
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,315
He's taking him the long way. Come on!

528
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:37,740
I hope you're ready. He's almost here.

529
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,859
Nope, not ready.

530
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:40,361
Power needs at least
two electromagnets...

531
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:42,029
Too much for this wiring to handle.

532
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,114
We're gonna need a
really big extension cord!

533
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,867
All right, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.

534
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,686
Ugh!

535
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,104
Barry!

536
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,361
Tony, Tony...

537
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:17,114
look, you were never my favorite person,

538
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,816
but let's end this...

539
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:21,285
so you can finally rest.

540
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,965
He's using spin to charge the magnets.

541
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,468
Like an electric turbine.

542
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,603
Sorry... I got lost.

543
00:35:56,605 --> 00:36:00,441
It's okay. We found you.

544
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,742
Barry.

545
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:15,445
You should rest. You
don't need to be here.

546
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:18,615
No, that's just it. I think I do.

547
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:34,214
Hi.

548
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,190
How did I get here?

549
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:56,653
How did you do that?

550
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:59,572
Are you, like, magic now?

551
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:02,575
Did you know that was gonna happen?

552
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:06,162
Maybe. It's hard to explain. It's...

553
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:08,498
It's the Speed Force.

554
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:20,093
It's been quite a day, huh?

555
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:22,562
Not so much "one damn
thing after another"

556
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:25,500
as "every damn thing all at once".

557
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,767
It all worked out okay in the end.

558
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:31,771
No, you worked it out okay in the end.

559
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:35,275
It's funny. I never really understood

560
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,694
where you were coming
from with your whole "fate"

561
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:40,864
and "everything happens
for a reason" point of view.

562
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:43,116
But now...

563
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:46,586
I think that maybe I was wrong.

564
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:51,124
Everything that's happened to us...

565
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,343
Good and bad...

566
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,795
It made us who we are.

567
00:37:55,797 --> 00:38:00,074
And I don't think that I would
change it even if I could.

568
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,136
Does that make any sense?

569
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,188
Perfect sense.

570
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:08,975
And since we're on the subject

571
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:13,313
of changing our minds
about important things,

572
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:15,692
you know that part where I told
you I was gonna leave Central City

573
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:19,329
so that you could be the Flash without
being concerned about me all the time?

574
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:23,740
Forget all of that.
You're stuck with me.

575
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:25,492
I'm not going anywhere.

576
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:43,893
Joe offered to take me so many times.

577
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:47,013
I always found an excuse to say no.

578
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:56,406
My mom and I read
this when I was little.

579
00:38:58,527 --> 00:38:59,909
Do you know it?

580
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:03,913
Yeah. I-I never really liked that book.

581
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:05,498
Why?

582
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,700
Because it was about a
mother who was always there

583
00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:09,285
for her child, no matter what,

584
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:12,922
and that wasn't my mom...

585
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:15,124
or yours.

586
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:20,129
We never had anyone who
was "just right" for us.

587
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:28,054
Didn't we?

588
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:32,725
I'm seeing things a lot differently now.

589
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:35,395
I wasted so much time being angry

590
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:38,615
about what I'd lost,
when I had so much...

591
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:43,653
My dad, Joe, and you.

592
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,907
The truth is, Iris, I
don't know what this is

593
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:50,910
between us or where we go from here.

594
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:53,963
All I know is you're everything to me,

595
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:56,382
and you always have been.

596
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:59,969
And the sound of your voice
will always bring me home.

597
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:13,983
Cait, please.

598
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:16,352
I asked you not to call me that.

599
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:17,820
Caitlin...

600
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:21,107
we've been through this again and
again, and we've gotten nowhere.

601
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,444
Now, I need to know... Are you
with me, or are you against me?

602
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:27,614
Don't answer that yet.

603
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,451
I'm gonna go out there,

604
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,586
spend a moment speaking to my friends,

605
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:36,089
and when I come back,
you'll give me your answer.

606
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:39,626
If you're still here, I'll know
you've chosen to stay with me.

607
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:42,962
But if you're not here...

608
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:46,633
I'll know you've chosen
your friends instead.

609
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:50,136
And I will show you
exactly as much mercy

610
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:55,141
as I will show them when
we next see each other.

611
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:57,694
So there you have it.

612
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:06,786
I need to go.

613
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:19,999
My brothers and sisters...

614
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:23,169
my friends...

615
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:26,506
I've brought us to this new world

616
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:28,841
which lay before us,

617
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:33,680
defenseless, ours for the taking.

618
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:37,100
The humans think that this planet

619
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:40,069
belongs to them.

620
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,021
Whose world is this?

621
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:44,691
Our world! Our world!

622
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,624
Our world! Our world!

623
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:49,021
Our world! Our world!

624
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:51,301
Our world! Our world!

625
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:53,659
Our world! Our world!

626
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,833
Our world! Our world!

627
00:41:56,941 --> 00:42:01,622
