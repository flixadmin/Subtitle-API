1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,120
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,800
It's you. It's really you.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,880
Oh, no.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,960
Somebody help!

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,000
Penguin. He killed the librarian.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,280
I don't want to kill him.
I want to destroy him.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,280
and you promised them Jerome.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,920
They want to see his face.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Behold the Prophet!

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,520
We are Jerome!

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,960
You get the message?
We don't work for you no more.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,400
I will gut you!

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,280
- Then Nygma dies.
- They have Ed.

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,240
When I was last, you know, alive,
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,880
Well, where is my face?

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,240
- What?
<i>- Oswald.</i>

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
- Where are you?
<i>- Kane Chemicals.</i>

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,840
<i>Oswald, hurry. Please?</i>

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,040
<i>Tonight, Gotham, there are no rules.</i>

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,800
<i>And when morning comes,
you, too, shall be...</i>

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
<i>reborn.</i>

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
He's at the power plant
across the river.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
Get those freaks in the cages!

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,200
We need to find Jerome.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Hey, watch him!

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let go of me!

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Grab him!

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,480
What about you, huh?

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,200
Do you know where Jerome is?
Where is he?

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,400
Where is he? Look around!

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,840
He's everywhere!

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,520
Incoming!

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Get down!

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Here.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,760
Tonight, Gotham is awakened!

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,160
{\an5}Remember, Ed's safety
is all that matters.

37
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,720
{\an5}Whoever took him will pay,
but only once Ed is back.

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
{\an5}Ed!

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
Edward!

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
{\an5}Ed.

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
{\an5}Are you all right?
Tell me you are all right.

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
{\an5}I'm fine, Oswald.

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
{\an5}Of course you are.

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,480
{\an5}Where are they?

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,160
{\an5}Who dared to think they could lay
their hands on you!

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
{\an5}I'm alone.

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,080
{\an5}You escaped.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,320
You did. Didn't you, you rascal?

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,160
{\an5}Did you bring anyone else?

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,760
What? Why? No...

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,600
{\an5}Just wondering
if I was gonna have to reload.

52
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
{\an5}I don't understand.

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
{\an5}I know.

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
{\an5}That's been half the fun.

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
{\an5}I'm sorry. I, I...

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
{\an5}What is happening? I...

57
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
{\an5}You weren't kidnapped?

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
{\an5}Not unless you count
kidnapping yourself.

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Recognize it?

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
{\an5}But why should you?
I doubt you did the deed yourself.

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,280
{\an5}That car belonged to Isabella.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,080
{\an5}Ed, whatever you've heard...

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,440
{\an5}I know it was you, Oswald.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,960
{\an5}Isabella was my everything,
and you took her from me.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,720
{\an5}And now I've taken everything
from you.

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,440
{\an5}Well, almost everything.

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,840
{\an5}You still have your life.

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,640
{\an5}But that ends tonight.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
<i>Attention, all residents,
stay off the streets.</i>

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,080
<i>A curfew is in effect in Gotham City
until further notice.</i>

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,880
Seems like judgment came to Gotham
earlier than expected.

72
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,440
If the situation worsens,
we may be forced to step in.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
The city will bend long
before it breaks.

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
Give the G.C.P.D. a chance.

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
Your faith in him is touching.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
And possibly dangerous.

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,000
We're getting reports
of a riot growing on the west side,

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,320
as well as widespread looting uptown.

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,880
Mobs of cult members
have taken over Anders Parks,

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
Gotham Cathedral, the zoo.

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,120
All right, concentrate units
on the west side.

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,080
Make sure they're issued riot gear.

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,240
- Any word on Jerome Valeska?
- Nothing yet.

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,680
Let me know as soon as he's spotted.

85
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Right. Got it.

86
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,080
Lights aren't coming back tonight.
Tomorrow, if we're lucky.

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
This thing just keeps
getting bigger.

88
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,920
It's not just the cult anymore.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,880
Ordinary citizens are taking
Jerome's cue.

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Meanwhile, Cobblepot's MIA.

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,000
You call down to city hall,
and literally no one's in charge.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,000
Although that might
actually be good news.

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
We need to find Jerome.
He's the symbol.

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,800
If we can take him out

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
maybe we can limit this
to a single bad night.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,360
How the hell are we supposed
to find him out there?

97
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,360
The city's one giant Dumpster fire.

98
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,600
Jerome said he wanted
to plunge the city into darkness

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
so people could do
what they want, right?

100
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,440
He's not one to miss out
on the fun, so what does he want?

101
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,360
A puppy? How the hell should I know?
I didn't talk to him.

102
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
No, but Lee did.

103
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,120
Yes!

104
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,160
But my father appeared to me.

105
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I saw him.

106
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
No.

107
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,720
You saw a man
that I met in Indian Hill

108
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,960
that does killer impersonations.

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,360
You see, Oswald...

110
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,320
How do I put this?

111
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,880
Ghosts aren't real!

112
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,960
But my father's remains?

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,960
- You stole them from his grave?
- Yup.

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't worry. He's at peace now.

115
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
I gently placed his remains

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,360
inside a Dumpster
behind a Chinese restaurant.

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
You were angry. I understand.

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,880
I even forgive you,
but, but killing me is not the way.

119
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,760
So you admit you killed Isabella?

120
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,840
- Fine. Is that what you want?
- Yes!

121
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
I confess.

122
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
I had her killed.

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
But guess what?

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640
You should thank me

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,000
because we both know
what would have happened if I hadn't.

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Yes!

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
I could have lived a life
with the woman I loved.

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,760
I could have been happy.

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
No, Ed.

130
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
You would have killed her.

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,600
Just like you did the other one!

132
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,160
You couldn't have helped it!

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,000
And afterward,
you would have hated yourself!

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Well...

135
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,440
we'll never know, will we?

136
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
I did it for love.

137
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
What?

138
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,680
I did it because I love you.

139
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
- You should know that.
- Shut up!

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,200
Love is about sacrifice.

141
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,000
It's about putting someone else's
needs and happiness before your own.

142
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,360
- Ed, please...
- 'Cause the truth is, Oswald,

143
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,760
you would sacrifice anyone
to save your own neck.

144
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Even me.

145
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Now, if you'll look above us

146
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
you will see a cauldron
of highly corrosive acid

147
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,880
which is currently being
held in place by this chain.

148
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,120
When the ice melts,
the chain comes loose

149
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,440
the vat of acid tips.

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
You get the idea.

151
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,440
Ed. Please. No, please.

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,800
I can change.

153
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,800
Say you're right.
Say you're right. I...

154
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,000
The fact that I love you
proves that I can change.

155
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Just give me a chance.

156
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,720
You know as well as I
that a man facing death

157
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
will say anything to save his skin.

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,760
And you won't change...

159
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
because you can't.

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Now...

161
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,320
I was going to have you
say hello to Isabella.

162
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,120
But...

163
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,880
I think you are going
to a very different place.

164
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,360
Goodbye, Oswald.

165
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Ed!

166
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,640
Ed! Ed!

167
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Okay, I think that's about all
I can do.

168
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,000
Thanks.

169
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,320
How's triage going?

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,320
We have a lot of overflow
from Gotham General.

171
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
What do you want?

172
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
When Jerome woke up,
did he say anything?

173
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,600
Just that he wanted his face back.

174
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,040
No. I mean, anything
that might indicate

175
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,640
where he was going,
what he was planning.

176
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
We were just playing catch-up.

177
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,400
You know, about coming
back to life, the cult.

178
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
He asked if you and I
were still together.

179
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
I mentioned you killed
my husband on our wedding night,

180
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
and he thought that was hilarious,

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
so that's something the two of you
can bond over when you find him.

182
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,600
He didn't tell me his plan.

183
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,040
He talked about Galavan,
the night he died,

184
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
and then he mentioned...

185
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,880
- What?
- Bruce.

186
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,120
He said the last thing he remembers

187
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
is that he was gonna
kill Bruce Wayne.

188
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,240
Call Alfred, tell him I'm on my way.

189
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,680
I'll light these candles. Good lad.

190
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
I'll nip downstairs
and see if there's any life left

191
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,600
in that old generator.

192
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Who's calling at this hour?

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Alfred?

194
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
My, my.

195
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,400
Look how big you've gotten.

196
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Are you okay?

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll be fine, Master Bruce.

198
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I'll be fine.

199
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Nice place you got here.

200
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,400
You rent?

201
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
What do you want?

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Attitude.

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,240
Teenagers. Am I right?

204
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,680
Oh, I remember those days.

205
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,360
So many exciting new emotions
floating through you.

206
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
Wanting to kill everyone you saw.

207
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,440
You. Give me.

208
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,680
You know, I will never
understand rich people's tastes.

209
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
It's worthless.

210
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,560
My father found it at a flea market.

211
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
I keep it for sentimental reasons.

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
Nice try.

213
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,040
Oh, it's got some heft to it.

214
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,520
Expensive, I'm guessing.

215
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,040
- Be such a shame if I...
- No, don't.

216
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Tougher than I figured.

217
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Anyway.

218
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Bloody hell!

219
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,840
I asked you what you want.

220
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
Right. Sorry.

221
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,360
The old noodle's
still a little al dente post-thaw.

222
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
The reason I'm here
is I'm gonna kill you.

223
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,760
- Why?
- Well,

224
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
it's the last thing
I remember wanting to do.

225
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
It's been nagging at me
since I woke up.

226
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,560
The idea of slitting that pretty,
pink throat of yours.

227
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,680
Figure that'd clear the decks.

228
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,240
What do you think, huh?

229
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Don't you...

230
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
I remember that night.

231
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,720
When you took over the benefit.

232
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,000
- You were quite the showman.
- Thank you.

233
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,440
Always nice to be appreciated.

234
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,760
And you're just going to kill me
here?

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
That's kind of disappointing.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,080
What do you mean?

237
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
After all the buildup

238
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,440
you coming back to life,
turning off the lights in Gotham,

239
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,840
killing me here just
doesn't show a lot of...

240
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
Flair? Hmm? Style?

241
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,120
Panache? Hmm?

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,680
Go on, boy. Spit it out.
I can take it.

243
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm Bruce Wayne.

244
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
- I'm aware.
- I am the ruling elite.

245
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,760
My company is the machine that
keeps the cogs of Gotham running.

246
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Wow.

247
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
Killing me should mean something!

248
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,720
And you're telling me
no one's going to see it?

249
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,840
You're saying I need an audience?

250
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,120
Look, I know you're just trying
to buy time so you can escape

251
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
but your point is still valid.

252
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
Saddle up, boys!
We're taking this show on the road!

253
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,760
And I know just the spot.

254
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Come on.

255
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Not you, old chap.

256
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,840
The prince of Gotham
deserves a public death.

257
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,760
His butler, not so much. Kill him.

258
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,120
- No!
- Bruce!

259
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,120
This is what you've been
training for.

260
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
You're gonna be all right
on your own.

261
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,520
I will see you again.

262
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,640
You carry on, son. You carry on.

263
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
Strangely intimate.

264
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Come on.

265
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Try not to get any blood
on the couch.

266
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,160
I might come back for that.

267
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Help!

268
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,480
Somebody help me! Help!

269
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
- Help!
- Hello?

270
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Over here!

271
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,760
Oh, thank God.

272
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
There's not much time.
Cut me loose! Hurry!

273
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,320
What's that car doing in here?

274
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,960
It doesn't matter. Cut me loose.

275
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,760
You, you look familiar.

276
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,720
Yes. I'm, I happen
to be the mayor of Gotham.

277
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,080
So free me, and I promise
there will be a handsome reward.

278
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
Oh, it, it really is you,
the mayor of Gotham in the flesh.

279
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,040
Yes! Now stop standing there
and get me out of here.

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,440
I don't... I don't know.
What did you do?

281
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,600
What?

282
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
I'm gonna die here
listening to this moron.

283
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,520
- Just cut the ropes!
- Okay, okay! Okay.

284
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Oh, God.

285
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Hurry!

286
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,200
Fine! Come on then.
What are you waiting for?

287
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
You in a rush to die, old man?

288
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Who's gonna kill him?

289
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,640
- Who's gonna do it?
- I'll do it.

290
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,600
What? What, you three?

291
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,520
You three left here to take out
the rubbish, were you?

292
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
You, Mr. Machine Gun,
by the suit of armor

293
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,320
what, you're gonna shoot me
in the grill, are you?

294
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,120
What about you with the crowbar,
by the sofa?

295
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,720
Gonna cave in my skull?

296
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
And how 'bout you, Mr. Machete?

297
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,800
Come on in, sunshine. Don't be shy.

298
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,440
Your mother wasn't. Chop-chop.

299
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,840
- Who are you talking to, old man?
- Me!

300
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Where's Bruce?

301
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
That lunatic Jerome took him.

302
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
No, please. No.

303
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Dance!

304
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,840
Get him! Squash her!

305
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,920
Get the old lady. Come on. That guy.

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Put your back into it.

307
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,160
Well, we're off to a good start.

308
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,080
What do you say, Bruce?

309
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,720
Want to have some fun
before the main event?

310
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
Bullock's pulling messages
from the tip line.

311
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,880
You said Bruce was able
to convince Jerome

312
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,080
to kill him in front of an audience?

313
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,920
Yeah, he was trying to buy himself
some more time.

314
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
And I'd be proud
if I wasn't so bloody terrified.

315
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,040
I see it's given way to bedlam again.

316
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,360
Jerome's acolytes have occupied
places all over town.

317
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,120
So, finding an audience
won't be the issue.

318
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Question is where.

319
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,600
We got 'em.

320
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,600
They're in Anders Park,
the cathedral, the zoo.

321
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,520
They've taken
over the Hillside Conservatory,

322
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,920
the courthouse,
and the Boardwalk Circus.

323
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,240
Jerome was raised in a circus.

324
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
Have a strike force and all
available units meet us there.

325
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,320
I'll put out the call on the way.
Let's roll.

326
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Got to be honest, Bruce

327
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,040
you don't make
the world's funniest clown.

328
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
But...

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We can fix that.

330
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,640
Shut up, you big baby.

331
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,240
Let's turn that frown

332
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,400
upside-down.

333
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Gabe! We have to find Ed Nygma
and kill him!

334
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Gabe, where...

335
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
Your monkey's cleared out.

336
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,240
And what's that you
were saying about Nygma?

337
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,360
Looks like we're not the
only ones trying to kill that guy.

338
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Now, where is he?

339
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm sorry, what? Speak up.

340
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,120
What are you doing in my house?

341
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Whatever we want.

342
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,360
You're finished, Oswald.

343
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,000
- Now, where's Nygma?
- I don't know.

344
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Think.

345
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,920
- What?
- I said think.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,560
Oh, I heard you. I'm just surprised
you knew the word.

347
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,680
Speaking of words, any last ones?

348
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,440
Babs said not to kill him
until we have Nygma.

349
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,880
I don't work for Barbara Kean.

350
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Stop pretending
that you are anything but muscle!

351
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,040
Yes, you used to be someone
in Gotham

352
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,840
but those days are past!

353
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,040
Remember when I put a knife
in your mom's back?

354
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,360
That was awful, wasn't it?

355
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,760
Her crying, bleeding out.

356
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,520
You just holding her as she died.

357
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,520
You never did anything about it.

358
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Yet.

359
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Nah.

360
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,760
You had your chance to kill me.

361
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,480
Stop turning us against each other.

362
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,280
We're taking him with us.

363
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,200
Oh, if you think I am going
anywhere with you...

364
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
You realize
you have to carry him now.

365
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,520
Son of a bitch.

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,360
Oh, I missed.

367
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,160
Is there a plan
for all of this madness?

368
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,400
These people don't want a plan.
They want an excuse.

369
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,440
The mother who dreams
of strangling her child.

370
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,480
The husband
who wants to stab his wife.

371
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,120
All they want
is someone to tell them...

372
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
"Do it.

373
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
Kill them. It doesn't matter."

374
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
It doesn't.

375
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh, I love this game!

376
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,920
- One, please.
- You, sir.

377
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
No, no, no, no.

378
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,000
Please, no, no.

379
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
No, no.

380
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
You won't get away with it.

381
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
I already did. Now shush.

382
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
I need to concentrate.

383
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,240
A few dozen brainwashed maniacs
can't keep the city hostage forever.

384
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,640
Well, duh.

385
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
So what's the point?

386
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
The point

387
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,960
is that all these people out here,
looting, robbing, killing...

388
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,440
they're the people
who wash your car,

389
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,560
who pour your coffee,
who take out your trash.

390
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,480
And what happened
the moment the lights went out?

391
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,000
They showed their true faces.

392
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,240
They showed how quickly
they want to open up

393
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,720
your rich boy veins
and bathe in your blue blood.

394
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,680
That is the point.

395
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
That's not true.

396
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,640
There are good people in Gotham.

397
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
Like who?

398
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,280
The sheep who lock their doors
and crawl under their beds?

399
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Face it, kid,

400
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,480
Gotham has no heroes.

401
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,840
- No, no, no.
- Hey.

402
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Foul!

403
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,480
He pushed me. Did you see that?

404
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,440
You want to kill someone,
let's get on with it. Come on!

405
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,320
You're so boring, Bruce.

406
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
No!

407
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Sorry.

408
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Yo.

409
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Did that hurt?

410
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Not much.

411
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
You try.

412
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Stop.

413
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Stop.

414
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,360
All right.

415
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,640
Enough dilly-dally.

416
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
To the main event.

417
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,960
Where the hell is our backup?

418
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,120
Still two minutes out.

419
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,520
Most were waylaid
by another riot on the west side.

420
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah, but we can't wait, mate.

421
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,640
All right, so, we go in,

422
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,000
find Bruce, get him to safety,
then we go after Jerome.

423
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,160
- Ready?
- Not really.

424
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
Yeah, we all know why we're here!

425
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
Here comes Jerome, everybody!

426
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,360
Hear ye, hear ye, gather round.

427
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,840
The show is about to begin!

428
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Let me hear.

429
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Come on, now.

430
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,880
Shut up!

431
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
That's better.

432
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,280
Well, I think we can all agree
tonight was a rousing success.

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,360
We brought this miserable city
to its knees.

434
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,160
So, how to thank
the best darn cult of fanatics

435
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,480
a messiah like myself
could ever hope for?

436
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,640
I give you...

437
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,480
Cue!

438
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,040
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yes, yes sir.

439
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,880
I give you the climax
of our festivities.

440
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,360
The billionaire prince of Gotham,

441
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,000
Bruce

442
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,200
Wayne!

443
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,400
Well, so what do you say, Bruce?

444
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,920
Shall we end the night with a bang?

445
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,960
Or better yet...

446
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
a boom?

447
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,720
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...

448
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,320
All right.

449
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
What's next?

450
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,480
Death by a thousand cuts,
very poetic.

451
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I like that.

452
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Slice!

453
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Nailed it.

454
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,000
All right, folks.
This is very important.

455
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,560
Whatever you do,
please, definitely try this at home.

456
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,120
Preferably on a family member.

457
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Giddyup.

458
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Doggie!

459
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,760
- You ready, partner?
- Oh, good Lord.

460
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,320
Strike force just arrived.
They're coming in.

461
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,680
Detective Gordon, you're just
in time for the big finish.

462
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Nobody move!

463
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,840
Find him. I'll find Jerome.

464
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
So...

465
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
here we are.

466
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,840
I suppose I underestimated you,
Barbara.

467
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,320
It's the curse of great beauty.

468
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
How did it go?

469
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,640
You put together what happened
to Ed's librarian,

470
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,400
turned him against me.

471
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,640
Honestly, wasn't too hard.

472
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,160
And then, together,
you hatched a plan

473
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,400
to destroy everything I made
and kill me?

474
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Pretty much.

475
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,480
And brother,
did you ever take the bait.

476
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,560
Well, I hope you're happy
at the head of the table.

477
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,280
You know, the table
is more or less littered

478
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,240
with dead old dudes,
but, hey, it's a place to grow.

479
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,880
And now you got what you want,
you don't need Ed anymore.

480
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,520
My, my, it didn't take you long
to turn on each other.

481
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,280
You know, I think of it as a limited
partnership that needs dissolving.

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
So...

483
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,640
I help you find Ed,
things go better for me?

484
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,280
I don't, you kill me?

485
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
That about it?

486
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Yeah.

487
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,640
Oh, Bruce?

488
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,000
Where are you, boy?

489
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
Come on out, boy.

490
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,880
I won't hurt ya.

491
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,960
Bruce, darling.

492
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,320
Oh, Brucie...

493
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
You ruined my show, Bruce.

494
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,440
Hiding is just gonna make
things worse.

495
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,720
I didn't come here to hide.

496
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,680
I wanted you to follow me.

497
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
You're going to pay
for what you've done.

498
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,960
You're going to call Ed,
tell him you're alive, tell him...

499
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,120
Oh, I don't care.

500
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,560
But find out where he is.

501
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,560
- Why don't you call him?
- Because he's not stupid.

502
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,760
He knows that now you're no longer

503
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,520
the head of the underworld
or anything else

504
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,080
we don't need him anymore.

505
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,680
It is our time to rule.

506
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,360
You understand
if I feel compelled to refuse?

507
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Give me five minutes.

508
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,000
- He won't refuse.
- I'd do it in three.

509
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,120
- Why you got to do that?
- What?

510
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,520
Cut me down like that
in front of people.

511
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,760
- I'm just saying...
- Will the two of you shut up?

512
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
Give up Nygma, save your own ass.

513
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,160
Live to love another day. Hey?

514
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Wow.

515
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,520
What's going on?

516
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,000
You have a weird look on your face.

517
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,160
Like, weirder than normal.

518
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
You're right.

519
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I should want him dead.

520
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
"Should"?

521
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Oswald...

522
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,800
you loved him,
and he betrayed you.

523
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,160
Actually, I don't know that I did.

524
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Love him.

525
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
- Not really.
- What?

526
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Ed was right.

527
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,800
I thought I loved him...

528
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,280
because he saw me
as no one had since my mother.

529
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,200
But I killed Isabelle...

530
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm pretty sure her name is Isabella,
but go on.

531
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Because I wouldn't share him.

532
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Ed said love is sacrifice.

533
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,040
I should have been able
to sacrifice my happiness for his.

534
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
I couldn't.

535
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
But I'm ready now.

536
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,560
I won't call Ed.

537
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
I won't let you hurt him!

538
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,480
So you'd rather die than give up
the man who tried to kill you?

539
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
I would!

540
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,480
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yes.

541
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
It is.

542
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,200
Guess you're not as smart
as you thought you were.

543
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
He didn't give you up after all.

544
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,480
You're in this together.

545
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
But why?

546
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,320
Because I didn't want to just take
what you had.

547
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,280
I wanted to take what you believed.

548
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,000
I wanted you to die

549
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,840
knowing that you were incapable
of loving another person.

550
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
But I can.

551
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,720
I just proved that, right?

552
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,720
Now does that mean I passed?

553
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
- Ed?
- I...

554
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,840
don't know what it means.

555
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,200
I have to tell you,

556
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,640
this is way more fun
than I was expecting.

557
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,880
We make a good team, you and me.

558
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,240
You killed Alfred.

559
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,160
Is that what this is about?

560
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Are all rich kids this close
with their butlers?

561
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,560
This is about doing what's right.

562
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,960
You want to be a hero!

563
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,080
Tell you what, buddy...

564
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,240
I'll give you a fighting chance.

565
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,240
Let's do this <i>mano y mano</i>,

566
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,360
my little <i>conquistador</i>.

567
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Come on.

568
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,440
What kind of hero tackles
someone from behind?

569
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Let it out!

570
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
That's it.

571
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
That's it.

572
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
That's it.

573
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Let it out.

574
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Do it.

575
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,000
Do it.

576
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,720
Alfred!

577
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Bruce!

578
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,000
I thought you were dead.

579
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,600
Can't get rid of me that easily,
can you, mate?

580
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Oh, come here.

581
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Behind you!

582
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,120
Word of Jerome's arrest
is spreading quick.

583
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,480
Streets are already quieter.

584
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,000
Soon as the docs reattach his face,
he's off to Arkham.

585
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,160
You wish I would've shot him?

586
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
He'd probably just come back
from the dead again.

587
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Probably.

588
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
At least you get to say you punched
a man's face off.

589
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
That's something, right?

590
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,880
Jim?

591
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Sorry, what?

592
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,720
Come on. Let me buy you breakfast.

593
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,640
W

594
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,960
Well, got to say...

595
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,320
the clown makeup
was way more terrifying

596
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,240
than the damage underneath,
Master Bruce.

597
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,280
Did I ever tell you
that I don't like clowns?

598
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Well...

599
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,000
in a couple of days...

600
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,880
you'll be back to your old self.
I guarantee it.

601
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,400
You ready to tell me what happened?

602
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,840
When Jerome took me away...

603
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,880
I thought they were going
to kill you.

604
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,200
Shall I tell you what I thought?

605
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,600
I thought how proud I was of you.

606
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,080
Of the man that you've become.

607
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,640
I almost killed him, Alfred.

608
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,160
But you didn't, now, did you?

609
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,880
You controlled your anger.

610
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It wasn't just anger.

611
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,400
After everything Jerome had done,

612
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,320
after all the pain he caused,

613
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,200
the idea of killing him felt

614
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
It felt right.

615
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Yes.

616
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,680
It felt like justice.

617
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,600
There's a very fine line,
Master Bruce, between justice...

618
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,400
- and vengeance.
- I know.

619
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,760
But that doesn't mean
there isn't one.

620
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,640
No, it doesn't.

621
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
I knew where the line was tonight,
Alfred.

622
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
I didn't cross it.

623
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,400
Well, that's the first rule.

624
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
What do you mean?

625
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,080
Well, I started training you
so you could defend yourself.

626
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,040
Well, we're well past that,
aren't we?

627
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
But what's all this training for?

628
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,320
What are you gonna do with it?

629
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,200
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.

630
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,000
But if you keep going...

631
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,120
you're gonna need rules.

632
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,760
Rules that you cannot
and you will not break,

633
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
never mind what the reason,

634
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,560
never mind what the circumstance.

635
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,480
I will not kill.

636
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Say it again.

637
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,040
I will not kill.

638
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,120
Then let's get to work.

639
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,400
Tonight was close.

640
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,200
We could have lost Gotham for good.

641
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,600
Soon, we will act...

642
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,520
and you will be called upon.

643
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,920
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

644
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,720
- Are you prepared?
- Yes.

645
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,480
But I still don't understand
how I can help save Gotham.

646
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Never fear.

647
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,520
You are only part of the plan.

648
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,840
Are you sure about this?

649
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,960
You know what must happen
if he refuses.

650
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I know.

651
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,920
No one refuses the Court.

652
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,600
- Uncle Frank?
- Hello, Jim.

653
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
It's been a long time.

654
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Ed...

655
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
I love you.

656
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,240
I know you believe that now.

657
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,920
So you need to listen to me
when I tell you

658
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,920
by doing this, it will change you.

659
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,880
I've killed before, Oswald.

660
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Not like this.

661
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,920
This won't be a crime of passion
or self-preservation.

662
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,600
This will be the cold-blooded murder
of someone you love.

663
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,480
I don't love you.

664
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,520
You need me, Edward Nygma.

665
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
Just as I need you.

666
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,680
You cannot have one
without the other.

667
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,080
You killed Isabella.

668
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,600
- The point is...
- That is the point!

669
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,080
You can't talk your way
out of this, Oswald.

670
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,960
I have wanted you to suffer
as I've suffered.

671
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,280
You killed her,

672
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,520
so you die.

673
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
When I met you

674
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,480
you were a nervous, jittery loser.

675
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,120
You were nothing.

676
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,520
I created Edward Nygma.

677
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,440
And I am the only one in the world
who truly sees you as you are.

678
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
Who you can still become.

679
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,400
You can't do this.

680
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,760
Ed, are you listening to me?

681
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
I'm listening.

682
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,920
Say something.

683
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,600
I loved her, Oswald.

684
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,120
And you killed her.
