1
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:10,509
And now that I'm finally
rid of that pestilent
lizard shendu,

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,212
the dark hand
will rise agai--

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,480
uh, valmont?

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,216
Your pancakes
are gettin' cold.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,086
Mmhh. Mmm. Mmhh.

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,721
Speaking
of temperature,

7
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,691
we shall need to acquire
some serious heat

8
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,761
if we're to embark
on our epic crime spree.

9
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,629
Now you're talkin',
big v.

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,897
So, what's the plan?

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,567
You three will break
into section 13

12
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,903
and steal the talismans.

13
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,172
Whoa!
Again?!

14
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,142
Uh, bustin'
into section 13's
kinda risky.

15
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:47,012
Besides, v,
we don't do
flunky work anymore.

16
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,815
Not unless
we're gettin' paid.

17
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,350
Uh...True...

18
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:55,788
This demon nonsense
has depleted
dark hand finances...

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,357
But you know
I'm good for it.

20
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,796
Ok, but you gotta
make us partners.

21
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,799
Call yourselves
vice presidents
if you wish.

22
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,168
Just bring me
those talismans!

23
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,141
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

24
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,210
What?
I didn't eat.

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,547
(Thunder)

26
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,067
Darkness shall begin
its reign.

27
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,071
(Snoring)
Huh?

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,507
Huh? Huh? What? Hmm?

29
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,910
Uh...Sensei. What is it?

30
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:01,713
Uncle has the willies.

31
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,916
(Beeping)

32
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,223
(Sighs) Some herbal tea
to lull me to sleep.

33
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,458
Hey, Jackie!
Uhh!

34
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,160
Oh! Jade!

35
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,361
You should be
asleep.

36
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,463
So should you. And
I know just the thing

37
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,898
to help you unwind.

38
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,266
First we strap on
rollerblades

39
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,734
and set up
trash-can goalposts.

40
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,970
Then we slip
a few talismans
out of the vault.

41
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,272
Just because
I can't sleep

42
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,575
doesn't mean
you don't have to.

43
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,386
I am near.

44
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,357
How did you
get in here?

45
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,126
Freeze!

46
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,001
Whoa!
Mmhh!
Mmph!

47
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,712
Daolon:
The talismans of shendu...

48
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:10,549
So close I can feel
the 12 powers

49
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,584
of the Chinese zodiac.

50
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,725
(Thud)

51
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:20,826
Shh!

52
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,235
Sweet. No guards
in sight.

53
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,403
Shh!
Shh!

54
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,341
Man, security
here stinks!

55
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,442
Shh!
Shh!

56
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,114
I told you
- security here stinks.

57
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,316
5...6...

58
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,417
7...

59
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,452
Guards must be
on coffee break.

60
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,958
And monkey makes 12.

61
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,359
Oomp!

62
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,694
<i>We'll</i> take those!

63
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,429
Who are you,
anyway?

64
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,730
Ooh, ooh, I know.

65
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,799
He's the drummer
from kiss.

66
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,367
All: Whoa!

67
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,969
Who are you?

68
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,037
(Gasps)

69
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,105
The dark hand!
Daolon wong!

70
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,410
Uh, daolon wong,
the dark hand.

71
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:12,978
Jackie!

72
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,179
Aah!

73
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,480
Jade?

74
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,418
They have
the talismans!

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,552
Who?

76
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,254
Score.

77
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,824
You gotta be kidding me.

78
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,094
Gan! Ren! Chui!

79
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,867
Where'd they
come from?

80
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,522
Be cool. Be cool.

81
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,625
All: Chan!

82
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,661
Retrieve
the talismans.

83
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,895
What he said.

84
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,535
Jackie!

85
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,724
All: Whoo!

86
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,861
Ooh, daddy like.

87
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,236
The child!

88
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,507
All: Huh?

89
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,744
(Chanting)

90
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,913
Tohru! Now!

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,457
Go, uncle!

92
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,792
My warriors...

93
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,293
Imprisoned?

94
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,363
How did you locate
the lost urn of wei Cheng?

95
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:15,100
I know a thing
or 2 about antiques.

96
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,669
Keep the warriors.
Aiyaa!

97
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,139
Both: Uncle!

98
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,275
I will take the talismans.

99
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,479
Ready, aim...

100
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,282
Vaporize.

101
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,150
Waa!
Whoop!

102
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,956
She's got 'em!

103
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,360
Both:
Ooh! Unh!

104
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,595
Jade: Jackie!

105
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,798
Jackie!

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,969
You must not let daolon wong
have the talismans!

107
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,572
Ok. No one
will have them.

108
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,688
Ratso: They're gonna blow!

109
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,024
Uh-oh.

110
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,213
Oh, well.

111
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,383
Ah.

112
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,055
Jackie,
you blew 'em up.

113
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,426
(Sighs)
It is finally over.

114
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,528
Ow!

115
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,129
Not over.

116
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,398
It is just
beginning.

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,699
It is?

118
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,102
Talismans
- can be destroyed,

119
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,437
but the powers
they contain cannot.

120
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,706
The magic has been
set free,

121
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,875
scattered
to the winds.

122
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,013
Which means daolon wong
will try to find them.

123
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,449
You mean,
Jackie just started
the talisman hunt

124
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,819
all over again? Cool.

125
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,123
Unh! But where
did the magic go?

126
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,559
With no vessels
to contain them,

127
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,495
the powers will return
to their owners,

128
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:27,132
the 12 animals
of the Chinese zodiac.

129
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,368
Hello. The Chinese zodiac
is way ancient.

130
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,137
Those animals are history.

131
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,372
As such,
the talisman magic

132
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,075
will be drawn
to noble animals:

133
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:41,146
Those most worthy
- of their regal ancestors.

134
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,082
12 living creatures

135
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:48,019
each about to receive
an extraordinary gift.

136
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,656
What have I done?!

137
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,893
Do not just stand there!
Get cracking!

138
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,895
Uncle: You must
locate each animal

139
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,196
before its power
can be claimed

140
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,031
by the forces
of darkness.

141
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,099
Jackie.

142
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,500
What's going on?

143
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,804
More than you can
possibly imagine.

144
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,074
Well?!

145
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,241
Uh...

146
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,110
That thing about
making us partners?

147
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,411
don't worry
about it.

148
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,982
If I were employing you,
I would <i> fire</i> you!

149
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,617
You three...

150
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,186
I require
your assistance.

151
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,656
So...What's the gig pay?

152
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,996
(Chanting)

153
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:36,234
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

154
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,288
You're orange.

155
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,990
You're bald.

156
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,759
Freaky.

157
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:04,763
Bow before me,
dark chi warriors.

158
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,865
Finn don't bow
to no--

159
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,166
uh...Ow!

160
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,402
Whoa!
Hey!

161
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,671
You are no longer
mortal men,

162
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:17,208
but powerful servants
enslaved to do
my bidding.

163
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,710
Now, see here!

164
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,546
Finn,
ratso, and chow
are <i> my</i> servants,

165
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,615
and I will thank
you not to--

166
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,418
aaah! Hey!

167
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,656
Ahh, it would seem
good fortune is mine,

168
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:35,193
for one
- of the talisman's powers
remains near.

169
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,128
Come, my warriors!

170
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,099
Are we supposed to--

171
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,167
wait!

172
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,968
You can't
just leave me here!

173
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,271
Release me at once!

174
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,345
(Chanting)

175
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,982
Any sign of daolon,
uncle?

176
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,884
I thought we were
looking for animals.

177
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,620
Sensei says
each animal requires

178
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,290
a different locator spell
to lead us to it,

179
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,692
but we do not have time
to research them all,

180
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,294
with daolon on the loose.

181
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:12,430
Oh, we are
getting something.

182
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,599
It's...A woman.

183
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,935
She's got soap.

184
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:22,474
My mastery of spells
is no match for daolon's.

185
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,442
Wait! There's more.

186
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,182
Jackie: It looks like
daolon is going to...

187
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,154
A dog show?!
A dog show?!

188
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:40,125
Daolon has located
the power of immortality.

189
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,672
(Arf)

190
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,376
Oh! That stray
is harassing
my Jasper-wasper.

191
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,911
Security!

192
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,264
Which is the beast
that I seek?

193
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:24,202
If I destroy all of them,
one would remain standing...

194
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,104
The one which holds

195
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,541
the power of immortality.

196
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,352
Jackie, the power
of immortality resides

197
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,321
in one of the dogs!

198
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,224
But which one?

199
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,859
Oh! Jackie!

200
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,461
Huh?

201
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,835
Hyah!

202
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,975
Quickly! We must take the dog
where daolon's magic
cannot reach!

203
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,944
But <i> which</i> dog, uncle?

204
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,612
Were you not listening?!

205
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,380
The most noble one!

206
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,783
But--oh!

207
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:15,587
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

208
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,656
Giddyup!
Get along, little doggies.

209
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,491
(Arf)

210
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,063
Gan! Ren! Chui!

211
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,733
Whoa.

212
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,437
There is something
different about them.

213
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,439
They got
- a dark chi makeover.

214
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,708
Warriors, get them!

215
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,347
Get along,
little doggies!

216
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,354
You can trap
the dark hand guys
in another urn, right?

217
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,656
There is only one
urn of wei Cheng,

218
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,659
and it is already
occupied!

219
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,298
I am so buff!

220
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,069
Hey, we can fly!

221
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,838
Groovy!

222
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,475
Run!

223
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,110
Tohru.
Whoa.

224
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,745
Hey, buddy.

225
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,317
Whoa.

226
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,485
Sweet.

227
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,487
Score!

228
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,922
Attack!

229
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,959
(Roar)

230
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,072
Good dogs. <i> Good</i> dogs.

231
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,442
Whoa! Bad dogs!

232
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,145
Bad dogs! Bad dogs!
Bad dogs! Bad dogs!

233
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,281
Whoa!

234
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,349
Aah!

235
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,525
Stay.

236
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,201
Face it, tohru.

237
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,737
You're no match
for...Uh...

238
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,672
Whatever we are!

239
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,709
No.

240
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:21,579
No.

241
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,682
Hiya, scruffy.

242
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,986
Good boy. Good boy.

243
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,723
Uncle, walk the dogs.

244
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,363
Whoa! Aah!

245
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,667
Scruffy!

246
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,638
Mongrel, be gone!

247
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,041
(Gasps)

248
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,019
The immortal.

249
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,255
That is the noble dog
we have been
looking for?

250
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,101
Jade, shoo.

251
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,469
Aww!

252
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,442
Scruffy!

253
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,611
Surrender your power
to the forces of--

254
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,679
(arf!)

255
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,880
Aah!

256
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,016
Scruffy! Here, boy!

257
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,751
Aw, cute.

258
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,554
Too bad you gotta
hand him over.

259
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,264
Jackie!

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Hey!

261
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,502
Chan!

262
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,775
My hammer!

263
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,944
Hunh!

264
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,780
Huh?

265
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,415
No way.

266
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,750
Guys! Check it out!

267
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,891
Remote control.

268
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,793
Rock 'n' roll.

269
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,263
Bwaah!

270
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,034
(Chuckling)

271
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,470
It's like playin'
a video game.

272
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,691
(Uncle chanting)

273
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,301
I may be an old dog,

274
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,637
but I have new tricks.

275
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,439
Whoa, down, boy.

276
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,710
Can we keep him, Jackie,
please?!

277
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,112
Uh...

278
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,381
Of course we keep him.

279
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,749
Yay!

280
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,053
Go get it, boy.

281
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,526
Until uncle
can transfer the power
into a new vessel,

282
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,162
the dog is
a living talisman.

283
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:03,134
The little fella
really should stay
where it's safe, Jackie.

284
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,136
But section 13
isn't safe.

285
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,039
Daolon already
penetrated security
once.

286
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,174
Magic defeats magic.

287
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:14,178
A good chi spell will keep
daolon and his warriors out.

288
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,546
One more thing.
Ow!

289
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,215
Get cracking!

290
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,151
You have 11 more animals
to locate.

291
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,327
Jade: Hey, Jackie...

292
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,394
Yes?

293
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,630
What do you do to
stay in shape?

294
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,632
Basically training
with my stunt guy,

295
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,767
with my students,
3 hours a day.

296
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,969
Also boxing--
the rhythm--

297
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,070
bam bam bam bam.

298
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,339
Lift weights,
badminton school,

299
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,840
jogging, ping-pong.

300
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,542
Move your whole body.

301
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,613
Training is
very important. Yes.
