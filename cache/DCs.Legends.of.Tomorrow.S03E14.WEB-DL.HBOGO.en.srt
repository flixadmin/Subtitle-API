<i>Previously,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,000
Good job out there.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,280
Are you sticking around?

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,720
Wally, ready to leave?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm actually gonna stay.

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
The hunt for the six totems
has begun.

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,720
- No.
<i>- We'll fix this.</i>

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,840
<i>We'll get your totem back.</i>

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,520
Nora was possessed by Mallus.

10
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,280
He seemed scared of my totem.

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,320
You're one of the six.

12
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,360
The good news
is we already have the air,

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,720
earth and fire.

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,600
And Kuasa has the water totem.

15
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,440
Which leaves us with the final totem,
which is still a complete mystery.

16
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,400
Good point. Way to go, Ray.

<i>Memphis 1950</i>

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Hello, sir.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,840
I, I've been saving up
for a while now

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,080
and I think it's time.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,400
I'm here to buy a guitar.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,200
Now, I know it ain't much.

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,920
But what do you think
I can get for what I got?

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,960
Well, I'm sure we could
find you something.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,680
You know, a boy picking
his first guitar is a sacred moment.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,400
In fact,
some say the instrument chooses you.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
<i>Don't waste your
hard earned money any more.</i>

<i>Used Guitars Buy & Sell</i>

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'll take that one.

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,320
You don't want that guitar.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,160
What happened to the instrument
choosing me, sir?

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,520
I was just building a moment.

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,360
Besides, you can't afford it.

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,240
Well, I'll get the money.
I'll come back.

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,720
Look, I gotta tell you the truth.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Before that guitar found
its way here,

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,160
it belonged to a one Robert Johnson.

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,640
You mean, the Robert Johnson?

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,560
Legend said he sold his soul

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,880
to the devil to play
as good as he did.

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,440
Legend also says that guitar
is cursed because of it.

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,480
I ain't afraid of no guitar, sir.

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,280
You gotta let me try it, at least.

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,680
They must be messing
with the power lines outside.

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
Sound like that,
how could it be cursed?

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
You know what?

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
The guitar's yours.

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,880
You just take it away from here.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,360
Thank you, sir. Much, much obliged.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,840
An instrument as good as this,

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,480
I promise, one day, you'll hear
my name on that radio.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Hey.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,960
What is your name, son?

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,840
Presley, sir.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
Elvis Presley.

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,480
Which brings us to the kitchen.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,320
We divvy up cleaning duties
by Ray's chore wheel,

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,480
which uses a complex system
I pretend to not understand

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
until he eventually
does my chores for me.

60
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,360
<i>Wipe down food fabricator.</i>

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,240
Bet you thought time travel would
be seeing Woodstock,

62
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,040
saving Shakespeare
and having ethical debates

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,600
while standing over baby Hitler.

64
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
Trust me,
it takes time to get used to life...

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,520
Cool, so what's next?

66
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,400
{\an5}It's gonna get time for me to get
used to life with a speedster.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,120
This is my room.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,680
Guess you and me are bunkmates

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
while we help move you
into Stein's quarters.

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,800
{\an5}You just moved yourself in,
didn't you?

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,640
{\an5}I figured, why bother anyone else?

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,440
You know, I was gonna invite you
to be my player two,

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,600
but you're officially not
my problem anymore.

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,800
Wait, who beat all my high scores?

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,440
{\an5}Well, you see, the thing
with Ms. PacMan

76
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,840
{\an5}is you gotta just ignore the fruit.

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,600
{\an5}All the points come
from taking down the ghosts.

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, I know that,

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
but nobody could beat
these scores without...

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,000
{\an5}Without lightning fast fingers.

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,920
You better not have messed
with Guitar Hero.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
<i>Trombone Hero</i>

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
What's <i>Trombone Hero?</i>

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
{\an5}Hold on, Axl. Sammy's coming.

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,000
Just gotta find the damn mayo.

86
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
Come on, Mick.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,680
{\an5}What did I say about having him
in the kitchen?

88
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
- Not to.
- Yes.

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Would you toss me the walnuts,
please?

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you.

91
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,000
{\an5}I'm gonna need some brain food
if I'm gonna fix the fire totem.

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,200
{\an5}You know,
Nora thought using cold fusion

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
{\an5}to reboot it was a crazy idea,

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
- but...
- Don't care.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,560
Where's the mayo!

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
The new kid.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,040
The new kid.

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,280
{\an5}I saw him speed moving in
to Marty's old quarters.

99
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,680
Too much change on this damn ship.

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,440
That's what I love about old Axl.

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Doesn't change.

Who the hell is Josh Groban?

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,360
{\an5}And who the hell changed
the name of my rat?

106
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,960
All right, kids,
it's anachronism o'clock.

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
- What you got?
- How about this one?

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,240
{\an5}It's a category two during
the Belle Epoque in Paris.

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
Sounds romantic.

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Or this category three,

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,280
{\an5}which is the launch
of the Spirit of St. Louis.

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,680
I always wanted to join
the mile high club.

113
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
It's when two people on a plane...

114
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,240
Hey, really cute that you guys
are crazy in love,

115
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,520

is going to have to wait.

{\an5}- What? What is it?
- I...

122
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,200
{\an5}What happened
to my trademark volume and sheen?

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
{\an5}Who changed my rat's name?

124
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
Yo, who switched my game?

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Gideon?

{\an5}after a mysterious
bout of mass hysteria in July, 1954.

130

That's what caused the changes.

131

then rock doesn't hit the mainstream,

no Little Richard.

<i>The boy never missed a service.</i>

160
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
You heard the lady.

161
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
What?

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Why are you staring at me?

163
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,360
I dunno, waiting for you

164
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,200
- to the thing you do.
- What thing?

165
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
You know,
you usually send us into the field

166
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
with a little more pizzazz.

167
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,280
{\an5}All right, Legends,
put on your Sunday best,

168
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,080
because we are going to church.

169
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,960
That was pretty good.

170
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Amen.

171
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,640
<i>Jesus loves me</i>

172
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,080
<i>He will stay</i>

173
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,400
<i>Close beside me all the way</i>

174
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,720
<i>Thou hast bled and died for me</i>

175
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,960
<i>- I will henceforth live for Thee</i>
- Well, this is uncomfortable

176
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
and I'm not just talking
about my dress.

177
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah, I guess these people

178
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
didn't get the whole
"love thy neighbor" talk.

179
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
Shush yourself, lady.

180
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Have you heard your singing voice?

181
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,840
Just keep Mick away
from the collection tray.

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
And the communion wafers.

183
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,360
That's not bread.

184
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,320
There's a sickness
coming over this town.

185
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
I see it in the school yard
as I pass in the morning.

186
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,040
And to my horror,

187
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,840
I see it in this very church
on Sundays.

188
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,880
It infects the mind.

189
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
It drives people crazy.

190
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,880
Maybe the righteous reverend
is on to something.

191
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,520
They call it rock and roll.

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,880
I call it the devil's music.

193
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Nevermind, he has no idea
what he's talking about.

194
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Now.

195
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,080
I would like to invite my nephew,
Elvis,

196
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,880
to play for us and encourage you all

197
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,320
to attend our first annual
Heavenly Night of Hymns.

198
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Elvis?

199
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,520
Remember what we talked about, son.

200
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
Keep it godly.

201
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,360
Can you believe this?

203
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,960
The first show we see together
is Elvis live.

204
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
You're not the only one
who's excited.

205
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,680
This one's called...

206
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,880
<i>Onward, Christian Soldiers.</i>

207
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Okay.

208
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,840
<i>Onward Christian soldiers</i>

209
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,080
<i>Marching as to war</i>

210
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
So, this is rock and roll?

211
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,480
<i>With the cross</i>

212
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,400
I mean, it's no Benny Goodman, but...

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,960
No, we did not come all this way

214
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,600
to listen to Elvis
play grandma songs.

215
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
<i>Christ the royal master</i>

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,200
That's it, Elvis.
Put a little sauce on it.

217
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
- Yeah, swivel.
<i>- Leads against the foe</i>

218
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,960
He's so cute.

219
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,720
<i>Forward into battle</i>

220
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,520
Satan's got ahold of her.

221
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,800
What the hell is going on?

222
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
My totem. It's reacting to something.

223
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,640
Be gone, Satan.

224
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,360
Well, I think she's talking to us.

225
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,840
- Come on.
- Behold

226
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,880
what you have seen
with your very eyes.

227
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,160
Witnessed...

228
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,840
in this house of God.

229
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
That is the act of Satan.

230
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Yes, it is.

231
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
The Elvis sandwich.

232
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,080
I guess Elvis
is the king of rock and roll.

233
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,720
One hip shake and Z loses it.

234
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

235
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
I didn't lose control
because of Elvis hips.

236
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,400
Yeah, me, either.

237
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,960
My totem was glowing
and so was Elvis' guitar.

238
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,320
- But that means that Elvis is...
- Yep.

239
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,360
Elvis is a totem bearer.

240
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,040
So Elvis is the bearer
of the long lost sixth totem.

241
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,040
Consider me all shook up.

242
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,680
So, he has to join the team, right?

243
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,320
- No.
- I mean, we can't defeat Mallus

244
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
unless we have a full set.

245
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,280
I mean,
we could get Gideon to fabricate him

246
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,080
a spangly jumpsuit
and he'll fit right in.

247
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,680
What totem would choose
a guitar-toting choir boy

248
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,480
- as its bearer?
- Isn't it obvious?

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,600
It's Elvis we're talking about.

250
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,200
- It's gotta be...
- A sandwich totem.

251
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
I was gonna say music.

252
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,880
Just imagine what the music totem
would do for my upper register.

253
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,920
I could finally give
local theater a shot.

254
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,080
That is,
after we use it to destroy Mallus.

255
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,480
So we're gonna vanquish a time demon
with our killer harmonies.

256
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,120
- It's gonna go great.
- Every totem is growing stronger

257
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,520
in response to Mallus' threat.

258
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
What if the preacher was right
and Elvis' music literally

259
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,800
drives Memphis insane?

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,800
Then we have to get it
before that happens.

261
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,960
I got it. Elvis' guitar totem.

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
So, I'm not the only one
who finds that annoying, right?

263
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,520
- So annoying.
- Yeah.

264
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
Okay, come on.
We're good to go, right?

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,360
Are we? Because Elvis hasn't
recorded his first single yet.

266
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
And without that guitar,
he may never record it.

267
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
Which means rock
and roll history is...

268
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,720
Josh Groban.

269
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,200
What if we have Gideon
fabricate a ringer guitar

270
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
and drop it off to the future King?

271
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,680
Great idea. I call A-mission.
Amaya, come with me.

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
I will teach you
what rock and roll is all about.

273
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
Until then, everyone, shake,
rattle and roll.

274
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,040
Beale Street was the heart
of the music scene in Memphis

275
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,640
in the 1950s.

276
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,240
Brothels, churches, juke joints,

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,840
all next to each other,
all black owned.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,120
This, this was the spirit
of rock and roll.

279
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,880
There he is.

280
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,320
It was right here.

281
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Hey, kid.

282
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,720
I don't think you wanna keep
this lying around.

283
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,840
Something tells me it's special.

284
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,520
- You have no idea.
- Yeah.

285
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,160
There's no way I'd ever be able
to thank you for this.

286
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
Well, if you wanna
write a song about me,

287
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,560
there are several words
that rhyme with Nate.

288
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,880
Just knock them dead.

289
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,360
I can't wait for you
to see Elvis live.

290
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,280
It's going to change your life.

291
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,520
You really believe that my life
can be changed by one song?

292
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
Of course. Music is so much more
than just songs.

293
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,400
Music is about identity.

294
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,640
It's, it's hearing a track
for the first time

295
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
and you think to yourself,

296
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
"Wow, this is who I am."

297
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,960
I don't care how long it takes,

298
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
we're gonna find your music,
whether it be rock and roll or

299
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,800
God forbid, ska.

300
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,080
<i>Debuting tonight, y'all,
give it up for Elvis Presley.</i>

301
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,280
I guess it's time
to have my life changed.

302
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Yeah.

303
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,360
How you folks doing tonight?

304
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,680
If it's all right with you all,

305
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm gonna play a little song
for my mama.

306
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,480
Sometime tonight.

307
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Now, you...

308
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Wait, don't go.

309
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,240
Why, you all wanna make fun
of my playing like everybody else?

310
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,000
No, actually. We're...

311
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,120
We're music managers.

312
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
And we think you're very talented.

313
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,720
So, what happened up there?

314
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,120
It's this doggone guitar.

315
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,480
It ain't working
how it's supposed to.

316
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,120
Y'all gonna think I'm crazy,
but my guitar,

317
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,560
it's more than just a guitar.

318
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,440
Now it ain't working right, I just...

319
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,400
You don't feel like yourself anymore.

320
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,520
And I'll tell you why, usually,
when I play...

322
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,480
I got my twin brother, Jesse,
up there to back me up.

323
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,280
You have a twin brother?

324
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,840
Well, he ain't with us no more.

325
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
Passed when he was a baby.

326
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,880
But this guitar of mine used
to connect me to him.

327
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
I told you y'all would think
I'm crazy.

328
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,000
No, not at all.

329
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,560
I've always believed
that objects can connect us

330
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
to our ancestors.

331
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah, I guess we call it a spirit,
like.

332
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,920
On stage,
on stage just now for the first time,

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,160
Jesse wasn't with me.

334
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,000
I mean, he's gone.

335
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,120
All of a sudden,
I just don't know where he is.

336
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,840
Whoa. That was weird.

337
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Yeah.

338
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,080
You feel that?

339
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,920
Yeah, it's freezing.

340
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,720
<i>I am detecting an EMF reading
of six milligaus</i>

341
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,920
<i>that is disturbing
the ship's electrical servers.</i>

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,120
- EM what?
- Electromagnetic field.

343
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,080
It's a scientific term
that's been wrapped up

344
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,920
in a bunch of paranormal nonsense.

345
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,280
Paranormal, as in...

346
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Ghosts.

347
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
Whoever you are,
just put the guitar down.

348
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,320
Doesn't look like
he's taking requests.

349
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,320
Maybe the preacher was right
about rock and roll.

350
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,280
You know, what never hurt anyone?

351
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,440
A nice show tune.

352
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
I got it.

353
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,600
Okay, Axl.

354
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,520
Time to break the seal.

355
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,760
- Axl, come back.
- What the hell is going on?

356
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,640
Guitar hit me in the head.

357
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,800
Oh, that explains nothing.

358
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,560
- I got you.
- The guitar.

359
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,320
- It's haunted.
- We know.

360
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,120
But by who?

361
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,560
That's what's so strange
about my brother.

362
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,680
I ain't never met Jesse,
but somehow I missed him all my life.

363
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,440
Until you bought your first guitar.

364
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,280
Yeah, the store said it was cursed.

365
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,520
He was only half right.
It was also a blessing, too.

366
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,440
Well, if my brother's out there
somewhere without me,

367
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,120
I can't imagine he's too happy.

368
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Excuse me.

369
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
Guys, Elvis guitar's haunted.

370
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
- We know.
- We know.

371
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
Yeah and I'm guessing it's gonna do

372
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
whatever it takes
to get back to Elvis.

373
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,600
Good guess.

374
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,600
- Where's Axl?
- About that ghost.

375
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,080
It's Elvis' dead twin, Jesse.

376
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,720
Jesse, stop! We know your brother.

377
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,120
Now, I know this all sounds
like hogwash.

378
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,480
Magical guitars,
the ghosts of gone family members,

379
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
but I, I can't play without him.

380
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,080
I got a session to record
at Sun Studios tomorrow.

381
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
I saved up to buy it.

382
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
It's your first recording session.

383
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,560
You're gonna keep that appointment.

384
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
And we're gonna get you Jesse back.

385
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
You will?

386
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,840
We will?

387
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
All right, so,

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I talked to Constantine
about our totem.

389
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,240
He compared it with his notes
and this is what he found.

390
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,600
Death Totem? Pass.

391
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,400
Yeah, whoever wields it
has domain over the dead.

392
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,840
Which is why we need
to keep this totem with us

393
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,160
and safe at all times.

394
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,720
Elvis needs his totem back.

395
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,280
You have no idea
what we are dealing with.

396
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,240
The Death Totem?

397
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,040
The most volatile of all
of the totems lost

398
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,640
for eons along
with the sixth tribe of Zambezi.

399
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Maybe they suffered the same fate
that's about to befall Memphis.

400
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,880
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

401
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,240
We are talking about a Death Totem

402
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,040
and it could turn this whole place
into a ghost town.

403
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,840
Elvis has a session at Sun Studios.

404
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,320
That's where he cuts his first demo.

405
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,600
That's how he gets discovered, okay?

406
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,200
We do not have the time
for Elvis to get his groove back.

407
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
Jesse has to be there.

408
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
Nathaniel, I understand
how important this is to you,

409
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,640
but we can't give Elvis
a totem just to save his music.

410
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,960
It's not about the music, okay?

411
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,640
Rock has inspired
many historic milestones.

412
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,320
Protests, revolutions,
me losing my virginity.

413
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
Elvis doesn't need a totem forever.

414
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Just one song that changes the world.

415
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Please.

416
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Fine.

417
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
You take it to him,
you let him record with it

418
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,320
and you stay with it at all times.

419
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,200
At all times.

420
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,440
At all times.

421
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
<i>Recording</i>

422
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,200
All right, son. Are you ready to lay
this down on wax, or what?

423
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh, I've been waiting all my life,
sir.

424
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,440
<i>You said that you loved me</i>

425
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,520
<i>It was a long, long time ago</i>

426
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,400
<i>And now the way that you've
been acting, babe</i>

427
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,520
<i>I know that it's not so</i>

428
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,480
<i>So I'm gone</i>

429
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Now, that's rock and roll.

430
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
What do you think?

431
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,640
<i>I'm gone, gone mama</i>

432
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,880
It's okay.

433
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,240
I just don't see
how it's worth risking

434
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,120
the most volatile of totems for.

435
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,640
I thought that was gonna be
our music moment.

436
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,120
Our music moment?

437
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,480
One of those times
where the right song comes on

438
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,800
and ties everything together
so perfectly that it becomes...

439
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,960
It becomes a story.

440
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,280
We already have plenty of stories.

441
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,880
We saved the world together.

442
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,600
- Yeah.
- We saw dinosaurs.

443
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
There was that time
that I discovered Netflix

444
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,040
and we watched every episode
of Friends in one week.

445
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,040
All stunning accomplishments, yes.

446
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,120
But a music moment's different.

447
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
You'll see.

448
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,680
<i>Oh, babe</i>

449
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,680
<i>So long, baby</i>

450
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
<i>Baby, bye-bye</i>

451
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
How was that?

452
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,320
Boy, now that's a record.

453
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
We gotta get this straight down
to WHBQ.

454
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,760
You're gonna be on the radio.

455
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,200
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

456
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Uncle Lucious,
what are you doing here?

457
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,920
Well, well, well.

458
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
You missed choir practice.

459
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,240
Then I hear because you're down
at Sun Studios.

460
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,360
Well, no kin of mine
is gonna record the devil's music.

461
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,280
Not after what we saw in church.

462
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,640
Look, I got, I got talent.
My manager says so.

463
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,800
You got my nephew into this?

464
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

465
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,480
Hey, that ain't yours to take, now.

466
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,080
Give me that back.
I knew you'd put up a fight.

467
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,200
Sheriff.

468
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,960
Get him out of here.

469
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,720
Let's see if a night in the jailhouse
rocks some sense into you.

470
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
That record's gotta make it on

471
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,280
- the radio tonight.
- Get him outta here, too.

472
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,520
You're making a huge mistake.

473
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
Get behind me, Satan.

474
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,920
White Stripes. Great album.
At least, it was.

475
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
Your mama's
been too easy on you, boy.

476
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,440
Look at the sort
you got mixed up with.

477
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,880
These are the types
that go on down to Beale Street

478
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,600
and dance the hoochiekoo
like heathens.

479
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,160
You keep on preaching hate.

480
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,120
I'm only trying
to bring folks together.

481
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,520
As the Lord destroyed the wicked,
I must do the same with this record.

482
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,320
I'll make an example of you
at the Heavenly Nights of Hymns.

483
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,440
That ought to teach them
young folks a lesson.

484
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,120
Reverend, you don't know
what you're messing with.

485
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,320
The music your nephew makes...

486
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,480
Has turned Memphis
into Sodom and Gomorrah.

487
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,240
I will not allow it
to be the ruination

488
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,000
of that boy's soul, too.

489
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,040
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of here.

490
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,120
All I ever wanted to do
was make my mama proud.

491
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,720
Now, she ain't never gonna hear
my song on the radio.

492
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,160
At least I still got you, Jesse.

493
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,680
Guys, we have a bit of a setback.

494
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,040
- We're listening. What's up?
<i>- Long story, funny ending.</i>

495
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Amaya, Elvis,
and I were thrown in the slammer.

496
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,840
So just steel up and break out.

497
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,200
Yeah, I know, I can, but I'm afraid
my work here isn't done.

498
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,320
- What do you need?
<i>- I need you</i>

499
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
<i>to go back to the church,</i>

500
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,680
<i>get the record from the reverend</i>

501
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,720
and bring it to WHBQ
and make sure it debuts tonight.

502
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
On it.

503
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,120
Despite everything you've seen,

504
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,080
I really think my powers
could come in handy right now

505
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,280
because I could just go grab
that record and then I...

506
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay, if this were
a Central City bank robbery, sure.

507
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,680
You could just speed in,
save the day,

508
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,120
the mayor would give you
a key to the city.

509
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
That actually happened, you know.
See, Barry and I, we saw this...

510
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,280
History is different.

511
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,920
You can't be a chainsaw.
You need to be a scalpel.

512
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,160
You, you need to get in there,
talk to people,

513
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,560
find out what they really need.

514
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,320
Now, let's go talk to the preacher
like human beings.

515
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Okay, Axl.

516
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
I know how to draw you out.

517
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,640
With a nice little snack.

518
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,480
Mick? Mick, don't panic.

519
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,960
You just forgot to chew again.

520
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,200
Axl.

521
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,800
Is this one of your
stupid science experiments?

522
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,040
- Looks like Josh Groban...
- Axl.

523
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,840
Found something even more lethal
than your Elvis sandwich.

524
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
I'm sorry, buddy.

525
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
Look, the life expectancy of a rat

526
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,480
is one and a half to two
and a half years.

527
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,640
So, you know,
the little guy really beat the odds.

528
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
And you know what?

529
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,920
We can pick you up another one
in the next time period we stop in.

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,880
Because what's one more
change on this ship?

531
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,760
<i>Jailhouse blues</i>

532
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,840
<i>Jailhouse party</i>

533
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,960
You're getting warmer.

534
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,000
There's gotta be a song
in here somewhere, Jesse.

535
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,920
Okay, songwriting time out.

536
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Listen...

537
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,440
There's no easy way to say this,
but when we get out of here,

538
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,080
you're gonna have
to give us that guitar.

539
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,840
It has power and it can be dangerous.

540
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,520
No. I, I mean,
I can't play without Jesse.

541
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,720
I mean, before he came along,
sure, there was songs, but,

542
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,040
there wasn't ever any music.

543
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,040
Look, even after he's gone,
you're gonna have the music.

544
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,720
I mean, that's why you play, right?

545
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,680
The real reason music matters

546
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,600
is because it keeps things alive
long after they're gone.

547
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
Any idea why Ray needs us?

548
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,120
No clue.

549
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
Whatever this is, I don't like it.

550
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,240
Wait, what is that?

551
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,600
We're gathered here in remembrance
of our dear friend Axl.

552
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,800
Right. I'm outta here.

553
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,560
- I'm with him.
- Wait, you need this.

554
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,120
We... we all need this.

555
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
Fine, but when I mourn, I drink.

556
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Fair enough.

557
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,960
Charles Dickens once wrote,

558
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,360
"Life is made of ever
so many partings,

559
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,000
welded together."

560
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,600
Axl is one such parting.

561
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,960
And while we may lose some,
they are never really gone.

562
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,240
And they certainly can't be replaced.

563
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,080
They'll live on in the memories
we shared with them

564
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200
and the lessons they taught us.

565
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,160
And it is because of that,
that we can embrace the change.

566
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,320
I still remember
the first time I met Axl.

567
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
It was in the vents.

568
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,280
I was tiny Atom. He was a big rat.

569
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,720
And he tried to eat me.

570
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,360
I knew we'd laugh about it
one day together.

571
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,760
Sara, I believe it's customary
for the captain to share a few words.

572
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,160
Oh, no, you you're doing a great job.

573
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Thank you.

574
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,760
Well, then, please join me in a
chorus of Sweet Child of Mine.

575
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,640
All right, I'll say something.

576
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Axl was a friend.

577
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,280
Our friend.

578
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,520
Some might say he was the best of us.

579
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,120
<i>A Heavenly Night Of Hymns</i>

580
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,920
Can we have a word?

581
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,480
And not the good word.
We just wanna talk.

582
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,520
What could you possibly
wanna talk about?

583
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,360
We need to talk to you
about your nephew and his record.

584
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,880
You can't destroy it.

585
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
People need to hear it.
That includes you.

586
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,880
How would you all know
what I need to hear?

587
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,120
- Actually...
- I... I might

588
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,680
actually know
what you're going through.

589
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,920
You see, my dad,
he came into my life pretty late.

590
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,360
We couldn't always
figure each other out.

591
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,080
We didn't always know how to fit
into each other's lives

592
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,320
until I knew that I just had to go
and set out on my own.

593
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,880
Truly sorry to hear that, son.

594
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,600
I think that you might be afraid
that you're losing your nephew.

595
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,320
But if you both could just try
to understand each other,

596
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,440
you might actually find something
new between you two, you might,

597
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
you might even find something
really special.

598
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,160
Now, I know someone
that would love to play that record,

599
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,640
if you're ready to give it a chance.

600
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,360
And a lot of young souls
would be moved

601
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,960
by your nephew's voice.

602
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,120
Mysterious ways, indeed.

603
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,320
Okay, so, we walked real far
and it took a long time

604
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,640
- and then we got thrown around...
- History's at stake.

605
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,800
You better run fast.

606
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,480
<i>Hoowee, Daddy-O-Dewey here
with a new record</i>

607
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,000

611
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,280
My nephew is on the radio.

612
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,640
My nephew is on the radio.

613
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,480
<i>It was a long long time ago</i>

614

616
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,800
<i>Babe, I know that it's not so</i>

617
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,280
<i>So, so, I'm gone</i>

618
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,560
<i>Yeah, I'm gone</i>

619
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,960
<i>I'm gone, gone mama</i>

620

<i>It would seem that Ms. Tomaz

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560

<i>I'm gonna get me a big pink Cadillac</i>

624
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,200
Been ages since I've seen
so much life in this place.

625
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,640
Maybe you ain't
so ungodly as I thought.

626
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,440
You know, you and I might
have different names for God,

627
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
but I'm guessing
we have a lot in common, too.

628
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,480
<i>Yeah I'm gone</i>

629
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,040
- What took you so long?
- Seriously?

630
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,920
<i>I'm gone gone mama</i>

631
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,080
Hey, what does dancing look like
in the future?

632
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,040
Oh, pretty much the same.

633
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,240
Oh, no...

634
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,320
Great, well, we'd love
to stick around for Hymn Night,

635
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,480
but we should head back to the...

636
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,880
On second thought,
how about those hymns?

637
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,760
That music, it summoned the dead.

638
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,440
This time he actually might be right.

639
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,680
Don't tell me you're converting.

640
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,240
No, Elvis recorded that song
with the Death Totem.

641
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,280
It must have given his music
the power to literally raise spirits.

642
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,720
- You're kidding.
- This must have been

643
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,920
what drives everyone out of Memphis.

644
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,600
Right,
ghosts can go through anything.

645
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,440
It's kind of their thing.

646
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,120
Okay, Mick.

647
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,120
Time to send him off.

648
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
What?

649
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,080
Axl lives.

650
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,280
You just had to throw
a rodent funeral, didn't you?

651
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,600
Wh... where's he going?

652
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,880
Remember, the real points come
from taking out the ghosts.

653
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,040
Let's make Ms. PacMan proud.

654
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,440
How's that for a high score?

655
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,120
Impressive. But I think it's gonna
be game over soon.

656
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,280
<i>I'm gonna get me a big straw hat</i>

657
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,680
Well, at least you got to hear
yourself on the radio.

658
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,400
Don't go quoting this
to my uncle now,

659
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
but I sound pretty damn good,
don't I?

660
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,520
Hey, what's going on out there?

661
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,120
The whole town's been
overrun by ghosts.

662
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,160
- Well, let us out.
- Let me in.

663
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,760
- Death Totem.
- Death Totem.

664
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,440
Well, I'll be.

665
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,840
It worked.

666
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,760
You can command spirits.

667
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,520
Well, if you can raise them,
maybe you can also lead them away.

668
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Lead them where?

669
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,520
How about back
where they came from?

670
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,600
The cemetery outside
your uncle's church.

671
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,040
You were right.

672
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,400
His music really does have power.

673
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,400
Could have stood
to be wrong on this one.

674
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,960
Well, we need
to get past them somehow.

675
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,000
Don't be scared.

676
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,360
Dead don't want nothing
but to be acknowledged.

677
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,040
I mean,
is there anything this guy can't do?

678
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,040
I knew I should have
smashed that record

679
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,200
when I had a chance.

680
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,160
Now, your song has gone
and let the devil into my church.

681
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,920
This ain't the devil's doing.

682
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,080
You were right. Music has a power.

683
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,000
Brings life to the lifeless,
soothes the souls of the restless.

684
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
But it ain't just rock and roll,
either.

685
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,760
I would like to prove it.

686
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,640
Put an end to all this,
while I'm at it.

687
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
All right.

688
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,160
Get on up there, boy.

689
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,360
Now, I know you all can hear me.

690
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,400
Come on in.

691
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,720
All are welcome here.

692
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,920
<i>Amazing grace</i>

693
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,520
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

694
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,320
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

695
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,960
<i>Like me</i>

696
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,080
Should we take them out?

697
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,800
No, it's okay.

698
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,560
I think I understand what they need.

699
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,000
<i>I once was lost</i>

700
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,680
<i>But now I'm found</i>

701
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,520
<i>Was blind but now</i>

702
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,440
<i>I see</i>

703
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,800
<i>'Twas grace that taught</i>

704
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,840
<i>My heart to feel</i>

705
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
<i>And grace</i>

706
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,760
I actually know this one.

707
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,080
<i>My fears relieved</i>

708
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,360
- Care to dance?
<i>- How precious did</i>

709
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,040
<i>That grace appear</i>

710
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,760
<i>The hour I first</i>

711
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,640
<i>Believed</i>

712
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Axl.

713
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm sorry, your corpse,
it started to stink. I.

714
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,160
I didn't think you'd mind.

715
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,320
I...

716
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Saved you a sammy.

717
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,000
Axl, what's... what's wrong?

718
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,240
<i>Yea when this flesh</i>

719
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,600
<i>And heart shall fail</i>

720
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,600
<i>And mortal life</i>

721
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,880
<i>Shall cease</i>

722
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
I think it's time, brother.

723
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,440
I've got a feeling this goodbye
ain't gonna be forever.

724
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,120
Thank you, Jesse.

725
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,720
Thank you very much.

726
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,640
<i>Within the veil</i>

727
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,880
<i>A life of joy</i>

728
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,080
<i>And peace</i>

729
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,360
<i>When we've been there</i>

730
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,880
<i>Ten thousand years</i>

731
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,680
<i>Bright shining as</i>

732
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,640
<i>The sun</i>

733
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,760
I think we just found our moment.

734
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,480
<i>Less days</i>

735
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,320
<i>To sing God's praise</i>

736
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,800
<i>Than when we'd first</i>

737
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
<i>Begun</i>

738
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,720
Well, better make yourself
comfortable.

739
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,000
Something tells me you'll be
spending a lot more time in here,

740
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,480
especially after that show
you just put on.

741
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,600
Yeah, something came over me,
I guess.

742
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,280
I was up there looking
at those ghosts,

743
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,200
I realized one day this is
all gonna be over for all of us.

744
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,360
Might as well get the most
out of life that we can.

745
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
You know what?

746
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,440
I think you just discovered
the spirit of rock and roll.

747
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,280
I think that this...

748
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Is probably gonna be safer with you.

749
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,480
That was fun and all, but.

750
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,800
I don't soon wanna be raising
the dead again.

751
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,240
Promise me you'll keep playing,
even without your brother.

752
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Jesse ain't really gone.

753
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,640
The things he taught me,

754
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,560
the love that we had...

755
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,480
it's gonna live on in my music.

756
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,400
Now, can I ask you a question?

757
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,960
You ain't really a music manager,
are you?

758
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Busted.

759
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,600
But something tells me
you're gonna be just fine.

760
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,240
Even without this.

761
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,440
Thanks to you.

762
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,320
Think I'm just about ready.

763
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Go get them.

764
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
All right, gentlemen.
How you all doing?

765
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,800
I say we start it off with something
a little bit fast tempo.

766
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,840
Okay, fellas, get your fingers going.

767
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,720
You rang, Captain?

768
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,600
Hello, gorgeous.

769
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,120
- Look at that volume.
- Don't touch it.

770
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
- How do you...
- I'm serious, don't touch it.

771
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Well, well, well.

772
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,440
- Look who got his swagger back.
- Me?

773
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,880
Just because I saved rock and roll

774
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,160
and reinstated the King
to his proper throne doesn't...

775
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,760
Doesn't give you an excuse
to hog our one bathroom.

776
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
- Some of us need to...
- Celebrate the fact

777
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,720
that we beat the
Darhks to the Death Totem.

778
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,480
Although I don't imagine
our acquisition will stay off

779
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,680
the radar for long.

780
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,160
Well, think of it like this.

781
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,680
We're four totems up
in the fourth quarter.

782
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,880
Time's running out for those idiots.

783
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,800
Yep, even though
they still have mine.

784
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,640
Well, they'll be Time Stoning back
two whatever hell

785
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,280
they came from once
we get your totem back.

786
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,880
Yeah, and in the meantime,
we need to make sure

787
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,040
we keep that Death Totem on lock.

788
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Box.

789
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,480
Lock boxes. I... I got it covered.

790
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,480
I made encrypted lock boxes
for each one of the totems.

791
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,360
Well, good.

792
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,280
The Death Totem's powers
are not to be taken lightly.

793
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,360
<i>Perhaps you need some
assistance, Ms. Jiwe.</i>

794
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
Just give me a moment,
Gideon, please.

795
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,840
I've sabotaged access tanks.

796
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,840
I am sure I can figure out
a stupid playlist.

797
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Hey.

798
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,440
Gideon said you wanted to see me.

799
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,440
I wanted to say thank you.

800
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Oh, you don't...

801
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Check you out.

802
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,680
You got a playlist going?

803
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,480
As soon as I'm done uploading all
the Smiths music,

804
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,440
we'll do a deep dive
into the Morrissey solo stuff that...

805
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,760
Actually, I thought it was time
for me to teach you about my music.

806
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,160
Okay.

807
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,480
Like some big band stuff?

808
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,920
I think I'm at a point where I can
appreciate a trumpet solo.

809
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,800
No, this is the music of Zambesi.

810
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,840
Gideon helped me locate some
supposedly lost tracks.

811
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
You like it?

812
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,760
Yeah, it's, I like, I love it.

813
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,040
So good.

814
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Now, you know how
I feel about rock and roll.

815
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
What's that?

816
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,480
I said you're almost
at the good part.

817
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
You mean this isn't the good part?

818
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,120
I love you, Nathaniel.

819
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
What?

820
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,080
I said there's a lot more
where that came from.

821
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,560
It's a good thing we got time.

822
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,240
