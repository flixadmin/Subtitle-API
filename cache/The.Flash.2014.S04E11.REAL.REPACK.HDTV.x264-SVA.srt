1
00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:01,793
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:04,242
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:05,390
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:07,410
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:08,828
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,344
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,383
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:13,584
like me.

9
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:15,319
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:17,088
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,123
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,559
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:24,061
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:26,664
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,100
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:31,202
I didn't kill Clifford DeVoe.

17
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:32,436
Tricked ya!

18
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:33,738
Barry, they took a hostage.

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,072
- Well, who'd he take?
- Your dad.

20
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:36,507
I'm ready for my supersuit.

21
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,943
This tarp is your supersuit.

22
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,804
What is this, a puppy's raincoat?

23
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:43,968
Nice job, rookie.

24
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:45,934
I won't be a fugitive. If I'm convicted,

25
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:46,917
I'm not going to run.

26
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,786
We find the defendant guilty.

27
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,707
We're losing control of the place,

28
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:10,708
drop grenades.

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,177
Deploy smoke grenades!

30
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,147
Backup, we need backup!

31
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:32,929
They're back in. Lock it down.

32
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:39,236
Let's move. Move out.

33
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:59,357

34
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,364
Fine, just tell us what you want.

35
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:09,900
I want you to back off, or
I will detonate this thing.

36
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:12,436
Okay, calm down, nobody
needs to get hurt today.

37
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,210
You just follow instructions,

38
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:17,012
and everybody here gets to live
to see the sunshine tomorrow.

39
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:18,046
Right?

40
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,444
And I'd better not
see The Flash, either.

41
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:23,848
All right, first, I want a car.

42
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,218
Something eco-friendly, like a Prius.

43
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,387
Okay, we can do that.

44
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:34,925
Good. Uh, right. Now second.

45
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:39,117
Uh, I want a plane,
okay? A private plane.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,667
Okay, and a salad, all
right? I'm counting calories.

47
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,989
Okay, it's going to take
us an hour to arrange that.

48
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,371
You better hurry up,

49
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,940
because these hostages
don't have much time.

50
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:01,179
Should have gone with a steak, pal.

51
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,292
'Cause it's the last
decent meal you're getting

52
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,554
for the next five to ten years.

53
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:09,718
Who the hell are you?

54
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,196
Your friendly neighborhood superhero.

55
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:14,832
You can call me...

56
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:18,469
Mr...

57
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,037
One second.

58
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,006
Guys, this is a huge moment for me.

59
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:25,609
What's my name?

60
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:28,546
I was wondering where
you were going with that.

61
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:31,348
Hey, hey, where are my hostages?

62
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,683
Uh, bathroom break.

63
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,218
They just couldn't hold it anymore.

64
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,020
Don't worry, though,
they're totally safe.

65
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:37,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Get back, freak.

66
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:42,693
Freak, oh, sticks and stones
may break my bones, buddy.

67
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:44,692
Well, they used to. Not anymore.

68
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:46,330
I'll blow this whole city block.

69
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:49,433
Uh, you do realize you're
a part of that block, right?

70
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:51,168
Come on, man, it's a weekday.

71
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,503
People just want to get off work,

72
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,242
go home, and watch the boob tube.

73
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,539
So why don't you take
off that vest and...

74
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,974
No, don't touch me!

75
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:11,889
Ralph, are you okay?

76
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,059
Yeah.

77
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:18,554
Yeah, just, uh, wicked heartburn.

78
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:24,075
Let this be a lesson to all of you

79
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:25,636
would-be criminals out there.

80
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:31,075
Catching you won't be
too much of a stretch.

81
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:33,811
And so, our streets are safe again,

82
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:36,614
thanks to Central City's
funniest new hero,

83
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:38,883
The Stretchy Man.

84
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:40,384
Okay.

85
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,886
Embarrassing.

86
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,988
Cisco, next time you're going with him.

87
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,322
Iris, a chicken needs

88
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:46,757
to leave its roost sooner or later,

89
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,058
especially when that chicken

90
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,727
insists on doing his own solo mission.

91
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,996
- This is bad.
- This is really bad.

92
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,687
Stretchy Man, that's a terrible name.

93
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,933
Also, now that I'm going
to be on TV all the time,

94
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,695
this grey suit, got to go.

95
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,570
Hey, easy, chickadee.

96
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,705
No, Ralph, I meant you, okay?

97
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,307
That bomb could have torn you to shreds.

98
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,543
Or Joe, or any of the police outside.

99
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:10,014
Relax, ladies, my cells
are completely polygamized.

100
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,216
- Polymerized?
- Yeah, that.

101
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,786
Which means they can stretch
and take a bomb blast.

102
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,756
- Oh, my God.
- Dibny is in-dib-structable.

103
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:20,724
Okay, Ralph, you are missing the point.

104
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,359
You need to be more cautious.

105
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,161
No, no, no, you are missing the point.

106
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:27,031
What I really need, guys,
is a new superhero name.

107
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,399
Ramon, you've had all this time.

108
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,800
You can't come up with anything?

109
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,036
Patience, okay? I'm getting to you.

110
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:33,437
I've just been a little preoccupied,

111
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,473
what with Barry being in prison and all.

112
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:43,948
You find anything that might prove

113
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,750
DeVoe framed Barry yet?

114
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:49,254
My dad and Cecile are meeting
with Judge Hankerson tomorrow

115
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:50,265
to go over his appeal.

116
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:54,003
We've been pouring through the
evidence piece by piece, but...

117
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:57,027
Don't worry, Iris, we're
going to get him out.

118
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,507
Hey, has Barry joined a gang yet?

119
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,911
I've got some friends on the inside.

120
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:02,166
I can make some calls.

121
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,218
Shut up, Ralph.

122
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,872
Okay.

123
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:11,875
I will stop helping now.

124
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,155
You can watch the clock all you want,

125
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,191
but it won't go any faster.

126
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:30,218
You're Barry Allen,
right? Henry Allen's kid?

127
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,963
- I'm...
- Axel Walker.

128
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,898
You and your dad kidnapped my dad once.

129
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,368
Yeah, right.

130
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,169
Pudding?

131
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:41,505
Lunch lady gave me extra. I
think she has a crush on me.

132
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:43,226
No.

133
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,877
Hey, word on the block is,
you carved up some professor.

134
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,747
He give you a bad grade or something?

135
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,515
I didn't kill anybody.

136
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:54,652
Yeah, sure. Everyone's innocent in here.

137
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:59,023
Especially that guy. Yeah, Big Sir.

138
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:02,226
He's really innocent.

139
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:05,262
This is grosser than
usual. Does pudding go bad?

140
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,336
Axel, what do you want from me?

141
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:12,036
To be murder buds.

142
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:14,338
You know, we could share trade secrets.

143
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,141
I'd love to hear how you
carved up that college quack.

144
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:19,777
I don't need any friends in here.

145
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,745
Oh, man, I do not feel good.

146
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,630
Get him up.

147
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:41,131
You got mud on my bright whites.

148
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,695
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

149
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,062
Sorry's right.

150
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,143
The first week in Iron Heights

151
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,351
is often the hardest, Mr. Allen.

152
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,614
You've already seen what
happens when a few inmates

153
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,149
try to revolt.

154
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,351
Acclimating to your
new life will take time.

155
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:04,988
Always does. In the meantime,

156
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,426
do your best to stay clean in here.

157
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:14,231
Oh, and Mr. Allen, your
1:30 is waiting for you.

158
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:32,449
- Hey, I'm so glad to see you.
- Me too.

159
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,752
How's it going?

160
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,781
It's not as bad as I
thought it would be.

161
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,555
And hey, you're talking
to the newest member

162
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,090
of the Iron Heights janitorial staff.

163
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,358
I'm the fastest mop alive.

164
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:48,046
Well, we've been
surveilling the DeVoes 24/7.

165
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,334
I mean, they must have made
a mistake somewhere, right?

166
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:53,101
And I've been pouring over
all of the evidence with Dad.

167
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,872
We are going to get
you out of there, Barry.

168
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,740
I know you will.

169
00:08:56,742 --> 00:09:00,310
How's the rest of the
team? I saw Ralph on TV.

170
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:04,015
Ralph is getting a little cocky.

171
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:07,818
Yeah, I was when I
started too... it happens.

172
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,020
Yeah.

173
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:13,757
Iris, it's okay.

174
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,046
I just can't believe this
is our new normal, Barry.

175
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,631
I don't want this to be our lives.

176
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,533
You're going to find something.

177
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:23,700
I know it.

178
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,903
Closing time!

179
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:28,372
Wrap them up!

180
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:33,177
I just wish I could
touch your hand again.

181
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:39,683
You will.

182
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:42,419
I promise.

183
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,854
I'll see you tomorrow?

184
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:45,923
Every tomorrow.

185
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,847
Walker here spewed
all over his cellmate.

186
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,415
Says he's got cramps.

187
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,319
Who are you? Where's Nurse Hill?

188
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,889
Out sick. Looks like he ate the pudding.

189
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:21,558
Yeah, how do you know that?

190
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,799
Because I'm the one who sent it.

191
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:32,062
Come on, Axel, let's go.

192
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,398
Mom?

193
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:42,102
Walker and the nurse used tranquilizers

194
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,619
on two more guards on the way out.

195
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:44,871
And nothing tipped you off

196
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:46,373
that this nurse might be a criminal?

197
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,874
Her background check was clean.

198
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,376
She said her name was Lindsay Fineheart.

199
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:51,078
She was sent over by
our staffing company.

200
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,280
Well, I'm going to need the hard drive

201
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:54,637
of the surveillance footage

202
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,850
from the security
cameras in the infirmary.

203
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:59,186
Well, unfortunately, we're
still analog here in Gen Pop.

204
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,721
It will take a while to dub the tapes.

205
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,656
In the meantime, I'm
having Fineheart's file

206
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,239
brought down for you.

207
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,477
How's Barry doing?

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,833
Model inmate, just like his dad.

209
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,864
- Do you mind if I...?
- Let me check on that file.

210
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,278
Bare.

211
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:24,778
Joe, hey.

212
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:29,216
- What are you doing here?
- Axel Walker escaped.

213
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:31,284
Some new nurse helped him get out.

214
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:34,259
He was in here because of the pudding.

215
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:35,439
How do you know that?

216
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,302
He was complaining about the taste.

217
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,056
Hey, let me help with this, all right?

218
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,260
- Barry...
- No.

219
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,861
Has Cisco having any luck figuring out

220
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,096
how to bypass the system?

221
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:44,564
Because once he does that,
I could phase out of here.

222
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,832
I can help to track them.

223
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,428
Barry, you need to stay put for now.

224
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,561
Trickster is just a messed-up kid.

225
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:51,404
- We can handle him.
- No, I know, of course.

226
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:55,041
I just... I'm already tired
of feeling useless, you know?

227
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:56,593
The only thing you
should focus on in here

228
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:59,446
is watching your back.

229
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,849
Pretty sure cops can't touch inmates.

230
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:05,852
Otherwise, I'd give you a hug.

231
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:08,188
- Stay strong, Bare.
- Mmhmm.

232
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,124
- Detective?
- Sir.

233
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,736
Well, this is her.

234
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:18,198
This woman's name
isn't Lindsay Fineheart.

235
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,534
Her name is Zoey Clark.

236
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:22,068
James Jesse had a girlfriend?

237
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,204
Yeah, she called herself Prank.

238
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:28,008
Back in the day, she was
Bonnie to Jesse's Clyde.

239
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,647
No matter what, whether
it was attempted murder,

240
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,747
arson, robbery, she
was always by his side.

241
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:38,218
Man, what were people wearing back then?

242
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,814
Zoe Clark was the beneficiary
to Clark Toys empire.

243
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:43,218
Not much of an empire. All those stores

244
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,424
closed 20 years ago.

245
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:45,659
Looks like she has Bachelor's degrees

246
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:46,960
in arts and applied sciences,

247
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,923
as well as a Master's in chemistry.

248
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:50,997
Trickster and Prank were
responsible for a series

249
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,766
of terrorist attacks
across Central City,

250
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:54,801
including the destruction of

251
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,537
the Gadzooka Bubblegum company.

252
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,039
Huh, I always wondered why

253
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,069
my favorite gum suddenly
disappeared in the 90's

254
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,242
We have it on my Earth.

255
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:04,647
- You do not.
- I just said we did.

256
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,979
- You do not.
- We do.

257
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:07,542
Anyway, after Jesse was arrested,

258
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,515
she disappeared.

259
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:09,972
She's been a fugitive ever since.

260
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:11,017
Looks like Axel was born

261
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,586
nine months after Zoey was last seen.

262
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,373
I bet she left to help
to take care of her son.

263
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,881
And she came back to
bust him out of prison,

264
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,249
and pick up where she left off.

265
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:18,825
Well, I'm digging into CCPD files

266
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,980
to see if she had any
other known associates.

267
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,714
I'll set the satellite
to do a search grid.

268
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:24,130
- Ramon?
- Hey, how about you hook me up

269
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:25,181
with some of that gum?

270
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,587
Why don't you breach yourself?

271
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,491
- That sounds like an insult.
- Kind of was.

272
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:31,071
Hey, Ralph, do you want
to go to your usual spots,

273
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,045
see if any of your
contacts have seen her?

274
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:35,308
Sure, I need a chaperone.
Caitlin, you're up.

275
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,010
It's happy hour, you're buying.

276
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:38,278
Come on, use Killer Frost's credit card.

277
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,546
No way, Jose.

278
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:41,781
You think Ralphie's made of money?

279
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:46,725
Where are you two hiding?

280
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,558
Wow.

281
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,360
What is this place?

282
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:55,829
It's all that remains of Clarx Toys.

283
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:58,241
Oh, it's cold in here.

284
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:03,836
Oh, awesome!

285
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,551
- I made the news, ha!
- Not awesome.

286
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,621
Now the police are looking for you.

287
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:11,244
As soon as night falls,
we're out of Central City.

288
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:14,014
And then we'll go meet
up with Dad, right?

289
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,348
That's why you broke me out.

290
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,850
Because Dad wanted to see me, right?

291
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:18,752
Not exactly.

292
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,754
Axel, I wanted you back in my life.

293
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:23,957
Right, but what about Dad?

294
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,625
Well, he broke out a year ago,

295
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:27,136
and he hasn't come looking for you.

296
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,663
He doesn't care.

297
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:32,465
Of course he does.

298
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,167
Axel, your dad's a deadbeat.

299
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,902
He doesn't want to be
a part of this family,

300
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:37,837
and he never did.

301
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:43,476
Don't talk about him like that.

302
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:45,979
Honey, I'm sorry, it's just that

303
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:49,983
you just don't know him like I do.

304
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,484
Do you know what it was like for me

305
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:53,653
when you were growing up?

306
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:57,090
While you were idolizing your dad?

307
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,826
I was the one making your dinner.

308
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:03,797
While you were watching him
terrorize the city on TV,

309
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,966
I was the one driving you to school.

310
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,668
I was the one making sure
you got your homework done.

311
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,792
I was the one packing the
lunches in the morning.

312
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,340
- I was there for you.
- I know, I know, Mom!

313
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,075
Okay, now we can get him back.

314
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:17,210
I don't want him back.

315
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:22,048
I want us to go be free together.

316
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,851
I never wanted you to
end up like your father.

317
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,454
Well, it's too late for that, Mom.

318
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,295
I just need to get Dad's attention.

319
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,127
I'll show him that
someone in this family

320
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,562
still has a funny bone.

321
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:38,932
Mom.

322
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:47,308
Everyone walks away
safe, and so Central City

323
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:50,347
has a new, sexier model of superhero.

324
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,730
Me... it's... I'm sexy.

325
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,383
And I know just how I'm going to do it.

326
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:59,019
Sexy one. Anyone want an autograph?

327
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:01,254
Autograph, anyone?

328
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:03,523
No, Axel.

329
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,059
Axel!

330
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,866
Heard you had a
little one-on-one time

331
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:14,367
with a badge this morning.

332
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:18,471
Oh, God.

333
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:22,709
First, you dirty up my shoes.

334
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:25,445
Now, you're snitching to the cops?

335
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,647
You've had quite the
first week, haven't you?

336
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:29,186
I don't want any trouble.

337
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,355
Too late.

338
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:48,256
This isn't over.

339
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,092
Thanks.

340
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,647
Hey, how's the search coming?

341
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,916
Harry and I already
set all the parameters,

342
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:06,152
it's just got 300 square
miles to comb through, so.

343
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:11,175
- That's not good.
- Hello, Central City!

344
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:14,928
It's been far, far too
long since my beautiful face

345
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,864
graced your screens.

346
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,100
Whoo, this kid's got a face for radio.

347
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:22,168
Trickster's hijacking the
city's broadcasting signals.

348
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,003
Today, we're going to play a little game

349
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:28,374
I like to call "what Does This Do?"

350
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,844
Looks like a regular old bouncy ball.

351
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:32,278
But what does this do?

352
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,080
- Cisco.
- Tracing.

353
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:37,920
Let's find out if and when
you throw it hard enough...

354
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:54,334
Kaboom!

355
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,456
He's downtown, corner
of DeMeo and Bilson.

356
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,304
Bring me the Stretchy Man,

357
00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:00,440
or else you're going to go "boom-boom."

358
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,510
My first supervillain
thunderdome challenge.

359
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:05,139
This is awesome.

360
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,761
Ralph, you do not know this guy.

361
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:07,714
He's dangerous.

362
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,082
He's throwing bouncy balls

363
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:11,084
and wearing a bedazzled pea coat.

364
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,820
I got this.

365
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:15,455
Hmm.

366
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,290
You still haven't taken that off, huh?

367
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,826
Oh, I sleep in this.

368
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:23,129
You mind breaching me
there? It's a lot faster.

369
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,767
Where are you, Stretchy Man?

370
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:30,336
I've got plenty more
where that came from.

371
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,805
Nice suit, Fall Out Boy.

372
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:36,042
Yuck, yours could use some work.

373
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,611
Ooh, look at that cutting wit.

374
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,446
You wanted me, here I am.

375
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:44,553
Great, do you want to play, uh, catch?

376
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,326
You're really blowing
this supervillain fight.

377
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,061
Well, it's my Central City return party.

378
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:57,764
And your death will make me a star.

379
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:04,370
Child's play.

380
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:07,407
Okay, all right, this is what I call

381
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,075
the Hurty-Squirty Gun.

382
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:18,184
Tricked ya!

383
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:21,433
It's acid, with a little ingredient X.

384
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,714
I call it "axid."

385
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,026
He's panicking, his heart
rate is off the charts.

386
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:28,161
Ralph, are you okay?

387
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,797
Help!

388
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,634
Burn, Stretchy Man, burn!

389
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:40,739
Oof.

390
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,702
Not today, Satan.

391
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:49,315
What the hell did he do to me?

392
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,076
What the hell was that stuff?

393
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,881
Looks like Axel created
some sort of super acid.

394
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,549
It's got a ph level in the negative 50s,

395
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,466
and all it did was
burn through your skin?

396
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,699
God, if it were anybody
else, it would melt

397
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:09,175
right through them like xenomorph blood.

398
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:10,260
- Like in...
- "Alien."

399
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,318
"Aliens."

400
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:12,816
But you said my cells were polymerized.

401
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:13,752
I know...

402
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,194
You said nothing could hurt them.

403
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:17,697
Dibny, I didn't say that. I
said your cells were bonded

404
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,832
unlike anything I've ever seen.
I've never seen acid like this,

405
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,591
and so, cannot be responsible
for things I have never seen.

406
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:24,432
- It definitely hurts.
- Mm-hmm, of course.

407
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,773
Well, now we know what
your kryptonite is.

408
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,107
What the hell is kryptonite?

409
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:29,427
- What?
- Oh, come on.

410
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,562
Think I'm gonna heal?

411
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:31,998
- Probably.
- Eventually.

412
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,735
- Probably?
- Well, you know.

413
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,424
I thought I was indestructible.

414
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:38,951
So did we.

415
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:41,004
Get out.

416
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,989
Okay, well, Caitlin,
you can treat the wound

417
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,857
- and manage the pain, right?
- As needed.

418
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,259
Okay, well, the most important thing

419
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,593
is that you're safe.

420
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:48,761
Ralph, oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

421
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:50,797
Um, Axel is still out there.

422
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,967
We should track him
down. Um, oh, my God.

423
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,309
This might sting a little.

424
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:12,084
Excuse me, my wife
was supposed to be here

425
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:15,129
a half hour ago. Could you see if...

426
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,848
Cool.

427
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,809
Hey.

428
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:30,436
I was just wondering why you helped me.

429
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,863
Because your dad helped me.

430
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:52,058
- Oh, are you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm not.

431
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,659
Stretchy Man's still alive.

432
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:55,394
All Dad's going to see is that I failed.

433
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:58,498
He won't want to see me.

434
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,566
Who am I kidding?
I'll never be like him.

435
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,403
I think you can be even better than him.

436
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:07,573
You don't see it, but I do.

437
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:10,943
You're the real Trickster, boo-boo.

438
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:13,079
What's gotten into you?

439
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,714
Okay, I didn't take my meds.

440
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:17,535
Mom, you did that for me?

441
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,407
I would do anything for you, boo-boo!

442
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:23,890
- Would you kill with me?
- It's like riding a tricycle.

443
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:26,855
You never forget. Let's
paint the town red.

444
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,861
I know whose blood we should use.

445
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:32,407
We just need a new trick to
strong-arm Stretch Armstrong.

446
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,833
- No.
- No?

447
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,369
What we need is something better.

448
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,271
Because if there's one
thing I've realized,

449
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,738
it's behind every great trick...

450
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,941
is an even better Prank.

451
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:49,871
Hey, guys. Any luck finding Trickster?

452
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:51,741
Joe, geo-tracking is an art form.

453
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:54,886
It takes precision, it takes
finesse, it takes grace...

454
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,556
It requires none of those things.

455
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:57,957
It's simply the fact that
he's not a meta-human.

456
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,692
Regular humans are harder to track.

457
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:01,827
Is there anything you
can't suck the fun out of?

458
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,462
Leaf peeping.

459
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,632
Trickster.

460
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:09,969
Hello again, Central City.

461
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,239
It's time for the
exciting new game show,

462
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,041
"Wheel of Misfortune."

463
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:18,678
With prizes so amazing,
you'll think you died.

464
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,714
And if you play your cards
right, you just might.

465
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:24,650
Here's your host, the
murderous matriarch,

466
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:26,652
Prank!

467
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:32,725
What do we have in store for tonight?

468
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:37,163
Well, we have chills,
thrills, and plenty of kills.

469
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,707
These guys are absolutely nuts.

470
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,935
So, why don't we meet
our first contestants?

471
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:45,271
- Ta-da!
- Tada!

472
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:47,907
They've got hostages.

473
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,511
Shocking prizes are in store.

474
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:54,413
Oh, Prank, what about the grand prize?

475
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:56,849
Oh, I'm so glad you asked.

476
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,621
Because we have an axid shower.

477
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:09,095
Oh, no!

478
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:10,949
Sorry, Mr. Beebo.

479
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:12,819
Oh-ho.

480
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:15,901
Beebo loves getting clean.

481
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,894
Beebo has an owie.

482
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:32,433
- Cisco.
- Triangulating their signal.

483
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:38,457
We need a special VIP to come
down for our special show.

484
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,027
So, if you're watching, Stretchy Man,

485
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,488
why don't you come on
down and spin the wheel?

486
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:47,366
You have one hour, or
these nice people die.

487
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,869
There you are.

488
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:52,540
They're at the old Clarx Toys factory

489
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:53,706
in Lawrence Hills.

490
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,542
Tick-tock, Stretchy
Man. Time's a-wasting.

491
00:24:56,544 --> 00:25:00,946
So, let's spin that wheel!

492
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:07,486
I'm going to have
CCPD create a perimeter

493
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:09,055
a few blocks away, so they can't escape.

494
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,489
Harry, how are you coming with a solvent

495
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,321
- for Trickster's axid?
- Well, slowly.

496
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,227
Very difficult to neutralize
a solvent that hasn't existed

497
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:17,329
until today.

498
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:19,765
- You've got 59 minutes.
- All I need is 58.

499
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,934
Ralph, suit up.

500
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,539
Well, you wanted a new suit, didn't you?

501
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,871
I even made it pocket-sized.

502
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,707
Is it axid-proof?

503
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,832
I can't do it, guys.

504
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:39,049
These people need our help.

505
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,619
Yeah, sorry, but me getting melted?

506
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:42,102
That is a deal-breaker.

507
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:43,255
Were you only doing this

508
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:44,838
because you thought
you couldn't get hurt?

509
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,226
Yeah, why the hell else would I do this?

510
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:50,463
Ralph, last year, I thought
I was going to die, too.

511
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,531
But that didn't stop me.

512
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:55,868
Okay, well, that's the
difference between us then.

513
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,551
I'm not that strong
in the face of danger.

514
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:00,152
I'm out.

515
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:23,062
Psst, Barry!

516
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,833
Ralph, what are you doing here?

517
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,519
I'm breaking you out.

518
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,607
- I mean...
- Come on, you're a hero.

519
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,536
Slap on some tights, go be heroic.

520
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,177
Ralph, there are
cameras everywhere, okay?

521
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,770
They would know within
minutes that I vanished.

522
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:47,148
So? A minute to us is like hours to you.

523
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:49,986
Just vibrate through the
walls, go slap Trickster around,

524
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:52,389
and you'll be back before
whatever passes for dinner

525
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:54,224
- in this place.
- Trickster attacked again?

526
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,526
Yeah, he and his mommy
want to tussle with me,

527
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,193
but I have a rule against
fighting terrorists

528
00:26:58,195 --> 00:26:59,996
with an Oedipus complex, so.

529
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:03,100
This looks like a job for the F-L-A-S-H.

530
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:05,135
I'm sorry, why is this different?

531
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:08,336
You've done a good job
handling bad guys so far.

532
00:27:15,214 --> 00:27:17,481
I got hurt.

533
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:22,419
Axel created some kind of
acid that, we're guessing,

534
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:25,021
can probably kill me.

535
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,957
I'm not ready to die.

536
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:34,297
Look, this job,

537
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,534
it has a way of making
you feel invincible.

538
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:39,369
But every once in a while,

539
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:43,740
a little mortality check shows up.

540
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:49,446
I've been trying so hard to
ignore this feeling, but...

541
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:51,848
I'm not fearless like you are.

542
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,284
Ralph, I'm not fearless.

543
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,601
I mean, I wake up
every day in this cell,

544
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:58,934
and feel like there's nothing
I can do to help anyone.

545
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:01,057
And, I mean, that terrifies me.

546
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:02,859
I used to be somebody who saved,

547
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,594
and now I'm just Barry Allen.

548
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:07,364
Inmate number 3562.

549
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:10,000
- So let me spring you.
- That's not my point.

550
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:14,638
Having the ability to help
someone, but do nothing.

551
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,356
That is a far worse death

552
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:19,509
than anything that
Trickster has for you.

553
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,913
But rising above that fear
and saving those lives,

554
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,081
that's a greater life.

555
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,350
All right, so rise up.

556
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,920
I don't think it's a stretch for you.

557
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,257
You really believe I can do it?

558
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:37,219
Yes, you just need to
believe in yourself.

559
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,170
Hey, you know your
way out of here, right?

560
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,687
Yeah.

561
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,708
You got one hour!

562
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:04,286
Scans are reading some kind
of container on the roof.

563
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:05,516
It looks new.

564
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,123
Galvanized steel.

565
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,458
That's where they're keeping the axid.

566
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,164
All right, I will neutralize it.

567
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,963
And you two guys, you
get the hostages out.

568
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:15,398
Oh, we're gonna need the ice queen.

569
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,122
Oh, that's not how it
works, I can't just...

570
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,669
Lexi La Roche!

571
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,461
It was her childhood bully.

572
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,273
There's a lot of
repressed anger in there.

573
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,375
Let's go!

574
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,115
Oh, boy, here we go.

575
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:35,819
Thank you. Big Sir.

576
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:38,188
My dad saved your life
in here, didn't he?

577
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,156
That's why you helped me out.

578
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:41,725
How?

579
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:51,333
I had stomach pains for days.

580
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:55,572
Your dad found me, figured my
appendix was about to burst.

581
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:57,274
Prison doctors were gone for the night.

582
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:00,310
There's no way they could
have made it back in time.

583
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:03,473
But Doc Henry convinced Warden Wolfe

584
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:06,716
to do the surgery.

585
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:09,085
He operated and saved my life.

586
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,754
And that's why you owed him.

587
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:13,123
Now, we're even.

588
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:29,706
Big Sir.

589
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:41,618
Okay.

590
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,989
Remember, anything in here that
looks fun is probably lethal.

591
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:48,325
- Just like me.
- Nice.

592
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:51,861
Okay, let's deliver these
delivery people to safety.

593
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:55,765
Or we could just leave them
and kill Trickster and Prank.

594
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,367
Remember that talk about

595
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,868
murdering your way out of problems?

596
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,438
- Yeah, we don't do that.
- Yet.

597
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,741
We're going to get you out of here.

598
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:07,577
Ooh, Beebo hungry.

599
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:12,415
Beebo likes to play.

600
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,031
Beebo...

601
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:26,196
Tricked ya!

602
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:28,932
I'm guessing the plan didn't work?

603
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:31,167
Help!

604
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,070
Harry, it's a trap. They've
got Caitlin and Cisco.

605
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,726
- I'm on my way.
- No, you're not.

606
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,430
I am.

607
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:42,367
Then you're going to need this.

608
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,875
Groovy.

609
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:07,163
Hey!

610
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,967
Leave him alone.

611
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:20,209
I told you you'd be sorry.

612
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:41,697
You won't get lucky twice.

613
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:58,104
Like father, like son, eh?

614
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:05,588
Harry, are you on the roof yet?

615
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,656
Yes, and so is the axid.

616
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,558
All right.

617
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,458
You need to neutralize the axid.

618
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,644
We're running out of time.

619
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:16,699
Yep, thank you, I'm aware of that.

620
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,904
Uhoh.

621
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:24,644
Now, we asked for one hero.

622
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:28,346
- But now, we've got two!
- Oh!

623
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:30,312
It's time for our Showcase Showdown,

624
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:32,948
so let's spin that wheel,
and see what fun prize

625
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,884
awaits our new friends.

626
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:40,289
Harry, tell me you've got it.

627
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:44,293
Don't got it.

628
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:47,706
Hurry up, I haven't
killed anyone in years.

629
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,109
Oh, a tie.

630
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,203
Hmm, I guess they die together.

631
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:15,324
Nice outfit.

632
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,426
Thanks, I've got a great tailor.

633
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:18,994
Now let everyone go, pranksters,

634
00:34:18,996 --> 00:34:20,394
and no one gets hurt.

635
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:22,598
We thought you chickened
out, Stretchy Man.

636
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,253
Actually, I did.

637
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:26,202
See, I thought I was
pretty much invincible

638
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:28,137
until you and your
oversized water pistol

639
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,605
put the fear of God in me.

640
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:30,698
You're welcome.

641
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,740
And I was ready to throw in the towel.

642
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:34,643
But then I visited a friend of mine.

643
00:34:34,645 --> 00:34:37,713
And he helped me remember
that no one is fearless.

644
00:34:37,715 --> 00:34:41,317
But real heroes, they find
a way to rise above that fear

645
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:42,952
and make a difference anyway.

646
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:45,588
Even if it kills them in the process.

647
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,958
So, this is me, rising up.

648
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,428
Hopefully without the dying part.

649
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,931
Now let my friends go.

650
00:34:58,302 --> 00:35:00,948
First of all, great speech.

651
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:04,073
So inspired, it melted my heart.

652
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:06,075
Oh, thank you, I worked
on it on the way over.

653
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:08,464
Now let's melt yours.

654
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,246
Shoot him, boo-boo!

655
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:26,128
Oh, boo-boo!

656
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,698
I'd give up if I were you.

657
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,067
How about I melt your friends instead?

658
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:35,940
- Harry, now.
- I don't got it.

659
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,542
Harry?

660
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,945
No!

661
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:49,136
Say good-bye to your little friends!

662
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:52,755
Harry!

663
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:02,788
It doesn't hurt.

664
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,620
It doesn't hurt!

665
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:08,224
I'm not dying!

666
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:11,112
Why am I not dying?

667
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:13,616
Because I got it.

668
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,917
Yes, nice work, guys!

669
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:20,983
I'm going to live, whoo!

670
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:23,245
Oh, don't even think about running.

671
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:27,623
- Any time.
- Okay, uh...

672
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,331
you got scissors anywhere?

673
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,535
You know what they say, detective?

674
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,973
The family that slays
together stays together.

675
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,417
- Yeah, in prison.
- Hey, come on.

676
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,176
You can't keep a Trickster
behind bars for long.

677
00:36:39,178 --> 00:36:40,402
Oh, we'll see about that.

678
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:42,312
You were amazing. Can we do it again

679
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:44,441
- in 10 to 15 years?
- Booboo.

680
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:46,116
I'm going to break
us out of here in two.

681
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:48,986
Get in the damn car.

682
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:56,633
Is it true that you took
down Trickster and Prank

683
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:57,761
single-handedly?

684
00:36:57,763 --> 00:36:59,296
How long have you been a superhero?

685
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,631
Are you single?

686
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,834
Yes, about an hour, oh, hell yes.

687
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:06,370
- Do you like shrimp?
- No.

688
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,705
But I'm sure the people of Central City

689
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:10,711
would love to thank you, Stretchy Man.

690
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:12,576
That's not my name.

691
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:15,512
Then what should we call
you? I mean, you do stretch.

692
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:19,583
No, I don't stretch, I contort.

693
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:24,652
I elasticize, I elongate, man.

694
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:29,793
The Elongated Man?

695
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:31,695
It was just an expression.

696
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,764
- It has a certain...
- I don't know.

697
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:36,266
- "Je ne sais quoi" to it.
- I like it, too.

698
00:37:36,268 --> 00:37:37,949
Well, I hate it.

699
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,078
Well, maybe you should
have let me do the naming.

700
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:40,925
Exactly.

701
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,572
Oh, don't worry, you'll get your chance.

702
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,433
There's no way this is going to stick.

703
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,209
Probably gonna stick.

704
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:50,113
The Elongated Man?
Please, it's so literal.

705
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:51,395
You think Prince would have settled

706
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:52,563
for "Shorty Guitar Man"?

707
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:53,785
- Hey.
- No way.

708
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:56,086
And like The Purple
One, I too need something

709
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:58,955
that hints at the true
depth of my sexy nature.

710
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:01,091
- Like The Flash.
- Exactly.

711
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:03,694
He's a fast operator, gets
the job done in seconds.

712
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:05,136
Or Killer Frost.

713
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,130
What can I say? When
you got it, you got it.

714
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:08,598
You got it.

715
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
Eh.

716
00:38:10,402 --> 00:38:13,103
- Hey, Joe.
- Mmm?

717
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:16,006
What should I do?

718
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:21,111
Man, do whatever it takes
to keep the city safe.

719
00:38:21,113 --> 00:38:23,035
Just like the rest of us.

720
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:28,585
I could live with that.

721
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:31,822
Guess I'll be looking
out for you a bit longer.

722
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:33,824
I didn't get involved
because I wanted a favor,

723
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:35,300
I just wanted to help.

724
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:40,364
Piece of advice, you
want to survive in here,

725
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:41,698
find a friend.

726
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:45,936
Your father would be very proud of you.

727
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:48,238
Thanks.

728
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,607
Did my dad call you Big Sir?

729
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:52,909
No, he called me Dave.

730
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:55,496
Allen, you've got a visitor.

731
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:00,517
Well, whatever you said
to Ralph must have landed.

732
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,422
He risked his life to
save Caitlin and Cisco,

733
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,720
thanks to you.

734
00:39:03,722 --> 00:39:05,722
I just brought out what
was already inside of him.

735
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:09,059
You seem to have that
effect on a lot of people.

736
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:12,896
What?

737
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,631
Just turns out being in here

738
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,900
isn't so different from being out there.

739
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:22,272
Except we're not together.

740
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:25,475
And I can't touch you anymore.

741
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,649
Coffee, that's all I
get for being a hero?

742
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:07,784
What do you want, a cookie?

743
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:10,320
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

744
00:40:10,322 --> 00:40:13,723
Come on, man.

745
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,158
The thing about wearing a mask

746
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,694
is no one even knows you're a good guy.

747
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:19,529
Them's the breaks, kid.

748
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:22,999
Ah, yes, there's that delicious nectar.

749
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:25,133
Hey, thanks for getting
this coffee, by the way.

750
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:27,571
Who, me? I'm broke.

751
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:29,573
I didn't even bring my wallet with me.

752
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:32,476
- I don't even own a wallet.
- Are you serious?

753
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:35,245
- Allen always pays.
- Oh, my God.

754
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:38,014
No worries.

755
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:40,784
Uh, always pay it forward.

756
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,691
That's my motto, you know?

757
00:40:42,694 --> 00:40:44,187
Because at any given moment,

758
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,056
one of us could need a helping hand.

759
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:48,725
Like now, you two total strangers,

760
00:40:48,728 --> 00:40:50,930
you know, were short on
cash, and then someone just

761
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,996
steps out of the blue and helps
out in a totally random way,

762
00:40:52,998 --> 00:40:55,565
- am I right?
- Uhhuh.

763
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:58,435
And you know, it's more than just karma.

764
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:00,604
It's the principle of
infinite consequence

765
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:02,308
at work in our lives.

766
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:05,145
And it's always expanding.

767
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:08,678
Creating positive sums
on an infinite basis.

768
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,648
Isn't that amazing?

769
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,818
- Yes?
- You know what's amazing?

770
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,219
That shirt's pretty amazing.

771
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:18,722
Yeah, thanks, yeah, it's a classic.

772
00:41:18,724 --> 00:41:20,323
"Oregon Trail," I love this game.

773
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:22,826
Have a great day.

774
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,795
Okay.

775
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,464
A nice, beautiful girl, and Ralph Dibny

776
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,833
doesn't offer her a
delicious crustacean buffet?

777
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,102
Mmm, I think she's too smart for me.

778
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:33,970
Self awareness from Ralph Dibny?

779
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:35,338
I think there's hope for you yet.

780
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,574
That's a stretch.

781
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,075
Is that where we freeze frame?

782
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:50,984
