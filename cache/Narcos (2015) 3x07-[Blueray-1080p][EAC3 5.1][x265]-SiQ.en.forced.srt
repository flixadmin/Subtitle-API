1
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:34,831
On the road from Galilee,

2
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:38,335
Christ came upon a beggar
who had thrice been denied alms.

3
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,926
Christ asked him if he'd taken before
that which wasn't his.

4
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,723
"Yes," the man said.

5
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,893
He'd taken what he felt hadn't been given.

6
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,984
Christ asked him...

7
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:08,031
Christ asked him where had it left him...

8
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:30,220
Give him some.

9
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,954
Boss, I think I know whose car this is.

10
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,983
My name is Pacho Herrera.

11
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:29,237
I want Gerda Salazar and her fucking sons
delivered to me.

12
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,534
Until that happens,
nobody in the North Valley is safe.

13
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,328
Is that clear?

14
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,624
Make sure Orlando Henao gets the message.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,001
And now...

16
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:45,003
pray.

17
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:47,714
Pray.

18
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,076
<i>...that war is bad for business.</i>

19
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:47,871
Unless it's won.

20
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:51,166
Buenaventura is in Henao's territory.

21
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,295
We have to get the port back so we can
maintain our delivery schedules.

22
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:58,423
You think that...

23
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:01,635
Can it be done?

24
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:09,392
Negotiating with the government,
and the fucking surrender...

25
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,147
it all means one thing.

26
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:18,985
Our allies and enemies think we're weak.

27
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:24,157
My brother Gilberto
is responsible for that.

28
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,082
How's Alvaro?

29
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:34,084
What do you want me to say, Miguel?

30
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,712
The doctors still don't know if his cock
will ever work again.

31
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:40,882
He's 22 years old.

32
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:45,929
I swear to you, Pacho,
the Salazars will pay for that shit.

33
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:14,053
MONASTERY OF EL CARMEN

34
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:32,697
Agent Peña, nice to meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

35
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,765
{\an8}ANTI-NARCOTIC POLICE

36
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:49,399
<i>I will put in maximum effort,
with all my soul,</i>

37
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:52,527
into fighting corruption.

38
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:55,446
Because when there is corruption...

39
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:59,242
there is no procedure,
there is no peace of mind.

40
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:13,631
This informant of yours,
is he close to Miguel Rodriguez?

41
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:15,967
He's provided us with Miguel's location.

42
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,803
That's why it's urgent we move now.

43
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,931
May take a miracle
to get this close again.

44
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,891
Only God creates miracles.

45
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:27,228
It's for us to use the tools he's bestowed
to resolve these matters.

46
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,193
Any chance God's bestowed the right men
to pull off this operation?

47
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:38,323
God has many soldiers.

48
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:41,659
Mine are honest men
who answer to higher powers than you or I.

49
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:47,790
I'm not concerned about them.
But I'm worried about other issues.

50
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:51,085
Gilberto Rodriguez's arrest
has led to new stipulations.

51
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:53,588
From now on, any warrant I sign

52
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:56,883
has to be filed
with the local <i>fiscale</i> office in Cali.

53
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:59,010
Which the cartel will know about.

54
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,596
Possibly.

55
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:05,016
Truth is, your tactics
won't be allowed a second run.

56
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,936
Just have to find new ones, General.

57
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:12,648
Your men, General, where are they now?

58
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,817
Awaiting their orders.

59
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,653
The target is Miguel Rodriguez.

60
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:20,114
Our operation will succeed

61
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:23,659
because you fulfil your duty to your God

62
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:26,329
and to your country. Understood?

63
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,914
Yes, sir!

64
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:31,167
The operation from a strategic
point of view is a nightmare.

65
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,669
There's a security perimeter.

66
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:36,839
As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,
the target knows we're inside.

67
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,302
Agent Feistl and I will be
right behind you, arriving by helicopter.

68
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,474
We'll land on the roof
and come in from above.

69
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,060
-We're going to box them in.
-Yes.

70
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,645
We have an inside man.

71
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:54,774
He'll be posted right here,
giving us our best way in.

72
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,450
Which one do you want?

73
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,411
-This one!
-Okay. Perfect.

74
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,746
Girls, please get ready.

75
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,627
Paola... you can't do this.

76
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:17,922
-I'm taking the girls to my parents'.
-Paola, you can't do this.

77
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,632
Especially with what's going on
with the cartel.

78
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,467
What? What are you saying?

79
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:25,596
Are you telling me I can't protect
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?

80
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:28,766
No. What I'm saying is that we need
to act normal, like everything is fine.

81
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:33,521
Everything isn't fine, Jorge.
Everything isn't fine.

82
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,565
They could be watching you, me, the girls.

83
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,109
Miguel's become paranoid.
Do you understand?

84
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:43,739
I'll call you in a few days.
The girls will want to hear from you.

85
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,243
Paola. Please.

86
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:51,789
The Americans are going to try
to arrest Miguel.

87
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,709
I'm going to make sure they succeed.

88
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:57,712
Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.
You, me, the girls.

89
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,213
We're leaving Colombia.

90
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,674
Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?

91
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,553
Who told you our girls want to leave
the only home they've ever known?

92
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,639
So we need to disappear.
Is that your plan?

93
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,224
Explain to me again
because I don't get it.

94
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,686
What happens if the Americans fail?

95
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:23,029
Paola, please. Please... wait.

96
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,753
Don't leave.

97
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,548
We weren't poor, Jorge.

98
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,553
We always had choices.

99
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,725
This was your choice.

100
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:05,863
What about the warrant?

101
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,533
You still haven't filed the paperwork,

102
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:12,995
We're bringing the <i>fiscale</i> with us.

103
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,916
Until we're on-site,
no one else knows the real target.

104
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,417
Arrest him quickly.

105
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,212
Because if word of this gets out,

106
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,631
they'll try to stop us
with everything they've got.

107
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:25,883
General...

108
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:27,677
General...

109
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,179
one more thing.

110
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,975
I'd like to ask you to remain in Bogota'.

111
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,896
Those are my men.
That's my signature on the warrant.

112
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:42,024
Which puts your name on the line, sir.

113
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,443
If anything goes wrong,
and we look like...

114
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,487
Like what? Like idiots?

115
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:49,657
It wouldn't be the first time,
as I understand it.

116
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:52,827
You don't trust me.

117
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,955
But you can't do this without me.

118
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:59,875
That's true,
but I know the system we're up against.

119
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,546
With your name on the warrant...

120
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,049
there's no doubt
the cartel's watching you.

121
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,144
As soon as you make the arrest,

122
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:21,314
I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodriguez
into custody when the press arrive.

123
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:27,778
I'll stay here praying for your success,
because there's no doubt...

124
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:29,780
it's your reputation now on the line.

125
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:14,909
Hi, boss. What's going on?
Getting a little late for you, huh?

126
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,371
Just checking in.

127
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:21,040
You run those taps over in El Lido

128
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:22,750
-like I asked?
-Yes, sir.

129
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,877
-Perfect.
-All right. Well done.

130
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:33,260
Enrique, why don't you take off
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?

131
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,680
Is this some kind of test?

132
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,684
Someone offers me a day off, I say yes.

133
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,360
My wife's been hounding me.

134
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,240
I could use a night away
from all of her questions, Enrique.

135
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,410
I'm glad I'm not married yet.

136
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,537
Don't make that mistake.

137
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:03,999
Thank you, boss.

138
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:13,718
It's Miguel.

139
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:17,221
Don't worry, boss.
I'll hang out until you get back.

140
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,309
Good.

141
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:09,523
Miguel's just finishing his call.
Come on in.

142
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,861
We can discuss that later.

143
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,907
He's here now.

144
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:22,536
Yes, you've said.

145
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,873
Bye.

146
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:30,085
My son.

147
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:33,047
You know how he is. A little...

148
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:35,174
complicated.

149
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:37,384
He is your son.

150
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:11,460
Good things are coming, Jorge.
You'll be part of it.

151
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:15,256
I'm glad, sir. Is there anything else?

152
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:17,967
Take a seat.

153
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,182
You know that my brother...

154
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:28,519
he doesn't like this war thing.

155
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:31,689
He thinks it's a mistake,
being at war with the North Valley.

156
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:35,192
He said this brings too much tension,

157
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,987
with the violence and everything.

158
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:42,116
He's getting counsel from men
I don't trust at all.

159
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,203
Those phones that you...

160
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,498
how do you call it? Wiretaps?

161
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:52,918
Wiretap.

162
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:55,421
Do you think...

163
00:22:56,797 --> 00:23:00,009
you could put one on my brother's phone
in prison?

164
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:10,311
You want me to tap Gilberto's phone
in prison?

165
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:16,525
For his own good.

166
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,530
Only if it became necessary.

167
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:24,241
So... for him.

168
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:27,995
Of course, sir. Anything you need.

169
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,539
Good.

170
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:32,917
This stays here.

171
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:35,002
Of course, sir.

172
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,636
Well, I should get back downstairs.
I'm posted outside tonight.

173
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:46,972
You? Nonsense. You're too old for that!

174
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,642
I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.

175
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,978
No. No way.
Have one of the young guys do it.

176
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:57,024
You know, I'm eating late.
Fercho was about to make something.

177
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,192
You'll join us.

178
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,903
You'll join us, Jorge.

179
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,281
Fercho! We will be two. Come.

180
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,444
Do you like fillets, Jorge?

181
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,238
Yes, very much.

182
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:48,200
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you...

183
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,538
the building guys,
they've been idling in front of the house.

184
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,000
Blocking our exit.

185
00:24:56,834 --> 00:25:00,129
You see that?
Feels good when one's been taken care.

186
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:03,716
Yes. Keep your walkie charged.

187
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:06,343
And the exits clear.

188
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,761
Like you said.

189
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,389
You want one?

190
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,808
Yes, thanks.

191
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:21,734
Look, I have a bottle of white wine
that is...

192
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,696
Excuse me, boss, if it's not
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.

193
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:29,241
Okay. It's a shame, but... okay.

194
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,912
But I have a really nice bottle
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.

195
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:49,178
<i>You're in for a treat tonight.</i>

196
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:52,347
Miguel has me cooking
with these Japanese bread crumbs.

197
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:57,394
Sounds crazy,
but it's actually more tasty.

198
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,271
That's very interesting.

199
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,983
Hey, Fercho, looks like the oil's ready.

200
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:04,860
Yes.

201
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:21,210
Boss!

202
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:25,255
We have cars heading towards the building.
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...

203
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:54,076
Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.
This is a residence...

204
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,164
A residence?

205
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,425
Did you hear that?

206
00:27:16,431 --> 00:27:18,517
Enrique! What the fuck is going on?

207
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,185
How come you didn't inform us
there's a helicopter?

208
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:22,813
-How the fuck did they find us?!
-Sir, calm down.

209
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,691
We need to get you out of here now.
There's no time to discuss this.

210
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:27,985
-Miguel, what's happening?
-You need to hide.

211
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:30,779
Is there somewhere we can take you?
A <i>caleta</i> in the apartment?

212
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:34,449
Stop. Get to the lobby.
Get to the lobby and stop them.

213
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:37,077
It's better if he goes.
Every second counts.

214
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:40,080
-Get to the lobby! Stop them.
-Maria.

215
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:40,432
What the fuck is this?

216
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:11,922
-Are you Fernando Castillo?
-What's all this?

217
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:15,717
We're here to arrest Miguel Rodriguez.

218
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:17,511
Miguel isn't here.

219
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:33,902
There's nothing.

220
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,112
Look above.

221
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:36,863
Take that off!

222
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:38,991
Cabinets!

223
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:40,575
There's nothing here.

224
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:42,869
Try the ones below.

225
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:57,884
Who's in charge here?

226
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:01,138
I asked you a question.

227
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:04,391
I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorized
to let anyone inside.

228
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,893
You see this fucking badge?

229
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:14,192
Your superiors failed to report
this operation with the local bureau.

230
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,236
I'd like to know
who'll be answering for that.

231
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,280
These are direct orders
from my superiors, sir.

232
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:19,531
Step out of my way.

233
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:25,954
Peinados, stay here.

234
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:26,872
Let's go!

235
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,831
Move!

236
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:32,002
Sergeant, you copy?
The local police are heading up.

237
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:39,634
Go to the back, please.
You can sit on the couch.

238
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:43,013
How long is this going to take?

239
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:51,521
What are you doing?

240
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:56,485
Hey, kid. Where is he?
Was Miguel Rodriguez here?

241
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:58,028
Don't speak to my son.

242
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,574
Can he please go to his room?
He's just a child.

243
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,826
-Is the room clear?
-Clear.

244
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,621
Okay, leave. Go ahead.

245
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:11,500
Flores.

246
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:16,213
-Who's in charge here?
-DEA.

247
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,258
I assume with Colombian support.

248
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:24,513
I don't see a ranking officer.

249
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,349
Guess that puts me in charge.

250
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:29,851
There's an exit over there
that leads to the street.

251
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:32,938
Do you have anyone posted there?
Of course.

252
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:36,024
If you'd properly notified my unit,
we could have blocked that exit

253
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,735
-and prevented this escape.
-There's no evidence he got out.

254
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:41,530
That's why you're looking
through the kitchen cabinets?

255
00:31:56,211 --> 00:31:58,380
Wake up, man! We have to go.

256
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,258
Let go of her already.

257
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:03,468
Come on, man!

258
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,884
Just don't say a word, brother.

259
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,969
We need to put them each
in separate rooms.

260
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,388
Fercho. Let's go.

261
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:54,227
To the right.

262
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,907
This is messed up, man.

263
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,245
-If your dad's still inside...
-Just drive the fucking car.

264
00:33:57,082 --> 00:34:00,961
<i>What we do know is that agents of the DEA
burst into the building this morning,</i>

265
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:03,004
<i>just before dawn...</i>

266
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:06,132
Hey, what did Salcedo say?

267
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:09,094
Salcedo! What did he say?

268
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:12,347
Sir, the thing is...
no one's heard from him.

269
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:14,266
Motherfucker!

270
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:17,310
Do me a favour.

271
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,939
Go to his house and check
what the fuck he's doing

272
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,483
that's more important than this. Please.

273
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,903
Bye.

274
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:32,784
<i>There's a surreal atmosphere
outside the San Jardin building.</i>

275
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:36,288
<i>While curiosity is growing
about the operation</i>

276
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:38,206
<i>and this has grabbed the attention
of the city,</i>

277
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:42,252
<i>it isn't clear who the target
of the operation is.</i>

278
00:34:57,892 --> 00:35:01,146
Good morning, ma'am.
We need to get into your apartment.

279
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:03,607
Help me.

280
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,109
-Lift.
-Hold on.

281
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,404
Okay. One, two...

282
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,544
Sir, listen to this.

283
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:34,179
635.

284
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,100
486.

285
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:49,444
480.

286
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:46,000
-That's it. Try to control the wrist.
-Okay, let's go.

287
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,961
The motherfucker's practicing
his backhand.

288
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:49,754
That's it. Try to control it. Come on.

289
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,841
-Hey! You bastard!
-Hey, fellas. Where are you going?

290
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:55,260
-We're in the middle...
-Who are you talking to, motherfucker?

291
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:57,053
We're in the middle of a lesson here.

292
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,388
Who are you talking to?

293
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:00,515
Why the fuck is there a raid going on
at my dad's house,

294
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:02,642
while you're here having tennis lessons?

295
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:05,979
David, I don't know what you're
talking about. I don't understand.

296
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:09,482
You're going to go and help
my fucking dad. Now! Understood?

297
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:10,525
-Yes.
-Let's go.

298
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:13,361
Go on. Quickly. What were you saying?

299
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:15,280
It's fine.

300
00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:17,282
Pussy.

301
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,298
Can you set me up?

302
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:34,966
-Got the perfect shot.
-Pan towards the top.

303
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:52,108
You guys can't tear down that wall.
You don't have authorization.

304
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:54,194
What are you going to do to stop us?

305
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,347
Stop what you're doing.

306
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,768
As Head of the Attorney General's office
in Cali,

307
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:54,439
I have to insist you put down that hammer
right now.

308
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:56,733
You're currently in violation
of Article 22 of the...

309
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:09,287
As the legal authority in this room...

310
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:13,124
I demand that you cease and desist
your search of the premises immediately.

311
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:26,971
Yes, and I'll need your documentation
from the embassy. Your passports.

312
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:42,445
I'm filing an official complaint
against each of you.

313
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:50,244
<i>It has now been confirmed
that the search</i>

314
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:52,246
<i>of the San Jardin building
has been abandoned.</i>

315
00:40:52,413 --> 00:40:55,500
<i>Agents from the DEA
along with the Colombian special forces,</i>

316
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,126
<i>have been seen leaving the building.</i>

317
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:59,545
<i>We can now confirm that the target
of this investigation</i>

318
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:01,965
<i>was in fact cartel godfather
Miguel Rodriguez.</i>

319
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:05,176
<i>With the search now over
and no arrest made,</i>

320
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:08,638
<i>questions regarding the actions of the DEA
and the credibility of their sources</i>

321
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:09,847
<i>will surely arise.</i>

322
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:13,393
<i>It's been a frenetic morning here</i>

323
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:17,146
<i>as a great number of police officers
exited the building.</i>

324
00:41:17,313 --> 00:41:20,149
<i>The official word from the National Police
is that the search has now been abandoned.</i>

325
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:23,319
<i>Now the question is, what evidence
did the DEA have to run this operation?</i>

326
00:41:26,322 --> 00:41:30,159
<i>The U. S. Embassy
hasn't released a statement yet.</i>

327
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:03,943
It's all good.

328
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:06,738
He's in front of me.
I'm about to tell him.

329
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:10,783
Hey, I just talked to Manny.
They've left the apartment.

330
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:16,706
Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.

331
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,085
-Right.
-Just make sure. You hear me?

332
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:22,211
Sounds good.

333
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:08,484
<i>Hello?</i>

334
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:12,655
They almost had you today, brother.

335
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:17,118
-They didn't, Gilberto.
<i>-Thank God.</i>

336
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,328
<i>It's a miracle you got away.</i>

337
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,415
<i>You need to revise your security network.</i>

338
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,670
Bring this to an end, brother.

339
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:32,508
<i>You have to embrace
that this is the reality we've built.</i>

340
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:34,510
<i>It's what's best for all.</i>

341
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:36,971
<i>Accept it, before it's too late.</i>

342
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:38,681
You, Gilberto.

343
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:42,393
The reality you built.

344
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,271
<i>And where the fuck has it gotten you?</i>

345
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:48,482
You're upset, brother. I get it.

346
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:52,278
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty fucking pissed.</i>

347
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:55,448
Then listen to me. Embrace it.

348
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:00,244
Look, everything we have,
everything we've ever built,

349
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:03,039
is because of the decisions I've made.

350
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,791
<i>Our best strategy is non-violence.</i>

351
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:09,045
The best option we have is surrender.

352
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,757
I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.

353
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,722
That was just a dream
you fell in love with.

354
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:23,434
It isn't mine.

355
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:28,606
Miguel.

356
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:09,814
It takes balls, I'll give him that.

357
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:12,900
Balls I wasn't sure he had.

358
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:18,489
You can appreciate
needing to show them off.

359
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:22,785
You again with those trucks?

360
00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:23,995
I have orders to follow.

361
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,913
And I have new orders.

362
00:46:32,712 --> 00:46:35,089
I don't like it,
this disagreement between them.

363
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:37,049
Doesn't feel right.

364
00:46:39,218 --> 00:46:40,469
It isn't us.

365
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:45,683
Maybe.

366
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:49,729
But times are changing.

367
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,815
Let's go!

368
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:54,817
Follow me!

369
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:12,418
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

370
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:16,213
-Don't you worry.
-I'm not worried.

371
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:22,928
Makes you wish you were out there.

372
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:05,596
Yes, I know she doesn't want to talk
to me, that's why she's not fucking home.

373
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:09,475
But it's important I talk to her.
Understood?

374
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:12,645
<i>Look, I don't know what's going on
between you guys, but she's upset.</i>

375
00:48:15,314 --> 00:48:17,566
Pass her the fucking phone now!

376
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:20,569
<i>No, Jorge. Give her some space.</i>

377
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:22,655
<i>She'll call you when she's ready.</i>
