1
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,970
Hey, Jimenez...

2
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,140
Do you think
the Special Forces guys killed him?

3
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,190
If he can even be killed, that is.

4
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,860
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

5
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,160
I don't know.

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,700
I heard they shot him 20 times.

7
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,580
They pumped him full of lead.

8
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,000
Then they burned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellín.

9
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,920
They say that he rose from the ashes,

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,130
and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had shot him,

11
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,090
and he killed them as they slept.

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,390
Bullshit.

13
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,350
Quiet! Someone's coming.

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,810
We're soldiers from the National Army!

15
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,140
Stop and identify yourselves!

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,560
We're well armed!

17
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,410
Mr. Escobar.

18
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,210
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

19
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,710
We have to take you into custody.

20
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,810
Son, I'm sorry to say...

21
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,060
unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

22
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,410
Excuse me.

23
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,050
You don't speak a word of this to anyone,
understood?

24
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,550
This...

25
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,790
is an enormous embarrassment
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

26
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,350
So...

27
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,270
- how will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

28
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,660
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

29
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,330
and we can't allow him and his sicarios
to move freely.

30
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,870
So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellín.

31
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,630
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

32
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,420
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

33
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,260
Pressure him until he appears,
Mr. President.

34
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,340
And who would conduct such an operation?

35
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,470
Colonel Pinzón, sir.

36
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,470
- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, Mr. President.

37
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,400
- Are you injured?
- No, I'm not hurt.

38
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,940
You know I couldn't talk to him.

39
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,530
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

40
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,450
- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

41
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,570
I sensed something was off.

42
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,450
Ariza said his orders were
to secure the perimeter, that's all.

43
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,750
Well, he lied. I gave the order myself.

44
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,460
Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.

45
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,750
You know you're the only person
I can trust.

46
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,970
Yes, sir.

47
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,600
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doña Hermilda.

48
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,810
Boss.

49
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,960
- It's good to see you.
- It's great to have you back home.

50
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,570
Very good to see you.

51
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,780
He's here. It's him.

52
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,620
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.
- How are you, brother?

53
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Pablo!

54
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Thank God.

55
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,420
- Oh, my son!
- How are you?

56
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,860
- I'm all right.
- You're all right?

57
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,260
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

58
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,930
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

59
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,270
- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

60
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,610
I know.

61
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,650
I am very proud.

62
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,740
I love you very much.

63
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,000
It's Dad.

64
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,460
...you and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

65
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,050
Thank you very much.

66
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,180
You're great boys.

67
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,890
- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

68
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,190
And don't bother me unless it's necessary.

69
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,900
As you wish, boss.

70
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,570
Very good.

71
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,280
Very good, gentlemen.

72
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,530
Very good.

73
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,640
Please take the things out of the car
and organize them over there.

74
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,480
I felt I'd lost you.

75
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,480
You're never going to lose me.

76
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,820
And what now, Pablo?

77
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,700
What will we do now?

78
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,500
I did what I had to do, Tata.

79
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,670
I'll take care of it.

80
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,010
We'll be fine, and content,

81
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,050
and happy, and together, and united.

82
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,340
But--

83
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,760
Always.

84
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,940
Always.

85
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,530
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

86
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,870
Promise.

87
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,950
I promise.

88
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,920
I promise, my love.

89
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,900
Yes, I understand you're from the DEA,
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzón first.

90
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,030
Wait one moment.

91
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,210
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

92
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
We'll let you in once the area is secured,
understood?

93
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,260
We're going to have to move everything.

94
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,390
- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

95
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,610
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

96
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,690
Boss, even the labs?

97
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,650
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

98
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,910
Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

99
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,580
The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

100
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,790
Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.

101
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,830
Who are you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch?

102
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,840
We're... moving... everything.

103
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,300
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,010
Yes, Don Pablo.

105
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,470
We're also going to need more men.

106
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,890
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

107
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,020
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

108
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,610
And one last thing.

109
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,860
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

110
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,660
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

111
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,910
- Done, boss.
- Boss, I'm sorry,

112
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,500
but you can't risk yourself like that.

113
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,050
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

114
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,590
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

115
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,680
Because we...

116
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,270
are the Medellín cartel, motherfucker!

117
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,850
Pablo, no!

118
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,070
You believe whatever the fuck you
want to believe, you son of a bitch!

119
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:19,680
- This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.
- Relax? What do you want me to do?

120
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,810
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

121
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,020
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you, too.

122
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,660
- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right?

123
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,650
Jaime, what country do you live in?

124
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,610
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

125
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,120
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

126
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,740
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

127
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,750
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

128
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,790
Pablo can't move.

129
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,800
Then we have to find and kill the bastard
before the police find him.

130
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,380
Judy, listen.

131
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,470
Listen to me! Listen!

132
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,970
Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

133
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,600
Jaime.

134
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,270
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's capable of?

135
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,270
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

136
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,280
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

137
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,530
And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

138
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,240
Pablo will always have friends.

139
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,660
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

140
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,130
It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

141
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,380
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

142
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,670
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

143
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,050
Judy...

144
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,310
what do we do with the labs?

145
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,730
What do you suggest?

146
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,520
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

147
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,860
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

148
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,160
That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense.

149
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,950
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

150
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,120
Let's join forces with them.

151
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,420
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

152
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,130
I'll talk to him.

153
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,050
Jaime, be very careful with those people.

154
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,970
- Hello?
- Okay?

155
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,970
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

156
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,270
Ricardo?

157
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,610
Don Pablo.

158
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,570
Of course. There was no decision to make.

159
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,700
You know that you can always count on us.

160
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,540
Sweetie!

161
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,550
Hey!

162
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,720
Fag!

163
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,300
What's going on, Limón?

164
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,560
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

165
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,560
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

166
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,650
What are you doing here? Are you going in?

167
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,860
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

168
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,650
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

169
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,370
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

170
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,370
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

171
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,210
Listen, Limón,
don't you want to make good money?

172
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,540
Doing what?

173
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,710
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

174
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,630
Pablo Escobar, brother.

175
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,720
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limón, I'm serious, brother.

176
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,850
The boss asked us to find someone...

177
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,270
someone clean, who the police don't know.

178
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,020
He would go in the trunk.

179
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,450
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

180
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,280
What do you think, brother?

181
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,750
There's cops everywhere.

182
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,790
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

183
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,800
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

184
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,300
Then who, brother?

185
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,840
- No!
- No?

186
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,510
- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

187
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,850
- No.
- What's wrong with it? Nothing.

188
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,270
- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

189
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,150
Yes?

190
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,650
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

191
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,530
- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

192
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,400
Maritza... I need you to do it.

193
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,450
It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

194
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,330
You can quit your second job, understand?

195
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,170
You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

196
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,670
Haven't I always done right by you? I've
always helped you and your family, right?

197
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,670
So? Right?

198
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,510
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

199
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,930
So what?

200
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,740
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

201
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,080
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

202
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,670
Let's go.

203
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,680
Take care, skinny!

204
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,970
- All good?
- All good, brother.

205
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,390
I'll follow you, brother.

206
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,060
- Who's that bitch?
- Close your fucking legs, Rosa.

207
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,890
You'll kill all the flowers.

208
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,940
You shit-eating bastard.
This pussy smells great.

209
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,900
Now you're going to the market
to buy your whores, you bastard?

210
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,650
Don't get pissy.

211
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,700
If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

212
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,370
you'll get to fuck me.

213
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,160
Fucking Quica.

214
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,250
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

215
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,530
Ready? Close your eyes.

216
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,950
That's right.

217
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,750
It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

218
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,330
Boss?

219
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,270
Look, Don Pablo...

220
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,940
this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limón.

221
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,320
He's Guarazapo's cousin.

222
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,450
Limón! Come here, brother. Come on!

223
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,580
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

224
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,540
Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

225
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,760
Besides, he's never had any run-ins
with police. He's clean.

226
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,550
And where are you from, son?

227
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,220
I was born in Envigado, sir.

228
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,260
My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

229
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,270
I'm very glad.

230
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,190
- What about the girl?
- She...

231
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,020
She's a friend, boss.

232
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,770
We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her very well

233
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,780
and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

234
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,450
Listen, Limón...

235
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,500
Do you know what it means to work for me?

236
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,000
It's an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.

237
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,920
You've done so much
for the poor in Medellín...

238
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,630
if I have to lose my life for you...

239
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,840
I will, boss.

240
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,270
All right.

241
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,190
Open the trunk.

242
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,660
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

243
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,480
All yours.

244
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,950
Where are we?

245
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,170
- What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon?
- Get down and hide.

246
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,420
- Jhon, I don't--
- Shit, Maritza,

247
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,220
I don't have time to give you
explanations. Just do it, all right?

248
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,750
Don Pablo.

249
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,300
- Hello.
- Welcome.

250
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,510
Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.

251
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,630
- How are you?
- Very well.

252
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,260
Great, I'm very glad.

253
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,220
- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

254
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,680
- Sir.
- How have you been?

255
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,330
Well, sir. How are you?
I wasn't expecting you.

256
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,400
- I'm well. Very well.
- Guys, please.

257
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,980
Yes, sir.

258
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,070
- Don Pablo.
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?

259
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,170
- A coffee?
- No, thank you.

260
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,610
- Can I get you anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

261
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,490
- How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

262
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,660
- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

263
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,330
Good, brother.

264
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,830
What's going on with the deposits?

265
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,100
They're looking a little light.

266
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,130
Well, after everything
that happened with...

267
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:12,640
with Mr. Galeano and Mr. Moncada, well...
people are nervous, you understand?

268
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,430
This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been talking to people.

269
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,480
Not everyone wants to pay.

270
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,190
- So that's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

271
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,280
- I told them to tell you--
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

272
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,540
We'll fix that problem soon.

273
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,830
Yes, sir.

274
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,210
In the meantime...

275
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,840
I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

276
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,340
It's no longer safe here.

277
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,140
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

278
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,550
And fill this up, please.

279
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,030
Don Pablo!

280
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,030
- Sir, how are--
- Is that you?

281
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,240
- How are you, sir?
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

282
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,700
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

283
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,160
Don Pablo?

284
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,040
- Don Pablo!
- Hello Ma'am. How are you?

285
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,540
- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

286
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,830
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

287
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,250
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

288
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,800
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

289
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,470
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

290
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,970
It's him.

291
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,550
In the flesh?

292
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,060
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

293
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,850
Let them see me. Let them see me.

294
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,810
I never thought I'd meet you in person.

295
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,650
I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?

296
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:49,110
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

297
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,320
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

298
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,360
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

299
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,740
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

300
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,040
For you, Ma'am.

301
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,910
For you too, sir.

302
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,990
There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

303
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,180
- What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

304
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,640
- DEA Agent Peña.
- Pay attention.

305
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,650
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

306
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,020
Oh, yeah? Which one?

307
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,110
There's a reward, right?

308
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Yes, there's a reward.

309
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,030
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

310
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,450
La Quica.

311
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,620
La Quica?

312
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,790
You know La Quica?

313
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,460
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

314
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,220
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

315
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,970
Do you work there?

316
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,600
Yes.

317
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,770
How long ago was this?

318
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,350
A couple of hours ago.

319
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,150
All right, we'll look into it.

320
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,030
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

321
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,280
We're not asking for a lot.

322
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,880
Did you close the lab?

323
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,760
Jesus Christ.

324
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,180
No, Berna, and I won't
because it's not necessary.

325
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,850
- Listen to me, Jaime--
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.

326
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,230
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

327
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,730
He's with us. He supports us.

328
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,340
Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

329
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,660
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

330
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,860
Pay attention to me.

331
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,580
First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?

332
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,330
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

333
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,040
means a bullet in the head, brother.

334
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,460
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security--

335
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,840
What?

336
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,170
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

337
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,050
Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?

338
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,300
Jaime, listen to me.

339
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,600
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

340
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,060
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia, brother!

341
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,690
Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!

342
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,690
- Come here now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

343
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,530
Jaime! Jaime!

344
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,610
Get out now!

345
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,370
What's going on, Ricardo?

346
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,290
You're fucking up, man.

347
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,460
Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

348
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,000
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

349
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,050
You know this.

350
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,470
The city's filled with cops.

351
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,850
Pablo can't move, brother.

352
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,600
Ricardo, put the gun down.

353
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,150
Hello, Jaime.

354
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,490
Jaime.

355
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,820
- Berna, how have you been?
- Who's this?

356
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,790
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

357
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,370
Berna, help me, man.

358
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,290
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

359
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,750
Pablo, no! Wait!

360
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,810
And now, you fat son of a bitch...

361
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,350
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

362
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,690
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

363
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,480
Tell the others...

364
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Who is it?

365
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,320
...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

366
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,030
you son of a bitch.

367
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,710
That son of a bitch!
His entire family, do you understand?

368
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,880
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

369
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,260
That fat fuck!

370
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,220
Son of a bitch!

371
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,680
Listen, Judy...

372
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,350
I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very
sorry about all of these deaths.

373
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,980
We have to accept that we lost this time.

374
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,820
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

375
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,110
And if you want to go ahead on
against Pablo, just say so.

376
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,990
We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

377
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,410
Yes.

378
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,840
You're right.

379
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,930
Yes.

380
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,180
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

381
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,560
The truth of the matter, just as it is.

382
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,060
And this is the truth, Berna:

383
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,900
I know of someone who's very powerful.

384
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,240
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

385
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,090
- You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

386
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,650
Hello, Fernando.

387
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,910
You did very well, sister.

388
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,750
Look... you don't just get two,
you get three.

389
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:13,300
You have a special talent, and that's why
you get three instead of two green ones.

390
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,890
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

391
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,350
We could have fun.

392
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,770
I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

393
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,990
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

394
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,990
I'm going to fuck one of them.

395
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,500
Sweetie...

396
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,080
Thank you, Maritza.

397
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,050
Bastard.

398
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,580
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

399
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,820
Right here, to the right.
It's the next right.

400
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,320
Know the area well, don't you, Peña?

401
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

402
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,700
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

403
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,330
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

404
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,170
Calm down! Calm down!

405
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,510
Okay, let's go.

406
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,140
All right. Wait for me here.

407
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,080
- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

408
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,830
Move! Move! Move!

409
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,830
Move! Move! Move!

410
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,300
Brother!

411
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,380
God damn it. What?

412
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,590
- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem, brother?

413
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,510
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

414
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,190
Brother! Hurry, Quica!

415
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,260
They're cops, brother! Run!

416
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,060
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

417
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,700
The situation is that...

418
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:02,500
your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

419
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,380
If I hadn't escaped,
they would have killed me, Fernando.

420
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,460
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

421
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:16,430
- You will tell Gaviria--
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

422
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,970
I don't think it's a good time.

423
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,940
You will tell Gaviria...

424
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,570
I am willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

425
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,200
As you wish.

426
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,290
- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogotá.
- No, no, no, brother.

427
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:51,420
We can't... leave for tomorrow
what we can do today.

428
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Right?

429
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,230
Mr. President,
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.

430
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,730
- I don't have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

431
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,780
Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.

432
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,910
Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important
message from Mr. Escobar.

433
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:26,870
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

434
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,130
Turn on the television.

435
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,100
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

436
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,120
Good evening, compatriots.

437
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,630
In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...

438
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,050
for over a decade.

439
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,050
Now we can go to work,

440
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,800
drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...

441
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,930
without the threat of violence
looming around every corner.

442
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,020
This peace is now threatened
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.

443
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:39,240
Escobar has been named the bloodiest
narcoterrorist of all time.

444
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,580
This history... changes today.

445
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,620
But I need your help.

446
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,670
We must come together as a people,
as a country,

447
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,130
so his reign of terror comes to an end
here and now.

448
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,840
This is why I'm before you now...

449
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,600
offering a reward of 1.4 million dollars

450
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,350
for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.

451
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,150
It is my hope that through this reward...

452
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,410
the day will finally come when our country
is free of Pablo's grip...

453
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:28,200
and will cease to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...

454
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,160
and murder.

455
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,580
I want to make it very clear...

456
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,670
that under no circumstances...

457
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,510
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.
