-Well, um…

166
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,000
-Getting the gold out, for example.
-Little grains.

167
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,083
We're going to turn
90 tons of gold into rice.

168
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,791
And after that, propel it like a jet.

169
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah. We'll eject all of it
using a pressure pump.

170
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,500
-Using a pump?
-[laughing] Yeah.

171
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,750
-Through the pipelines?
-Mm-hmm.

172
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,333
Inside the Bank of Spain
is there a pressure pump?

173
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
-No, of course not.
-Of course not!

174
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,500
We had to go all the way up to Norway
to get it off an oil platform.

175
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,041
What do you think about that?

176
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,125
[laughing] I mean,
there was another one in Saudi Arabia.

177
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,250
-But I was too lazy to go so far away.
-Of course.

178
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,791
What matters, Sergio,

179
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,208
is that we're going to have a geyser
of golden light flowing through the pipes.

180
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
There's no margin of error.

181
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,416
Andrés, the whole plan, everything
you're saying is a margin of error.

182
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,750
How old are those pipes?
Fifty? Seventy years old?

183
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,250
How old are they?

184
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,416
[sighs]

185
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,291
A hundred.

186
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,833
And do you think
that they were built 100 years ago

187
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,291
to withstand pressurized gold?

188
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
No, but they're gonna hold!

189
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,750
Very well. Where does the gold arrive?
In a sewer?

190
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,666
No!

191
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,416
[laughing] I just love this.

192
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,291
In the biggest stormwater tank in Europe.

193
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
In a stormwater tank?
What happens if it rains?

194
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,583
What if it starts pouring rain that day?
It would collapse, right?

195
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,500
And then bye-bye plan,
bye-bye your whole life,

196
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,458
because of a simple fact
that it started raining.

197
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,875
Andrés, no, it's not science, it's…
It's voluntarism--

198
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,583
It's scientific optimism!

199
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,166
What are you talking about?

200
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,541
-It's hopeful science.
-Who's talking here?

201
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,083
The mind of someone planning a heist
or the mind of a child? Come on.

202
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,250
The mind of a child.

203
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,166
And proudly so.

204
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,541
-I'm just like Peter Pan.
-Yeah.

205
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,500
No one can take away my enthusiasm,
not you, nobody.

206
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,916
Because only then,

207
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,750
only when you're willfully immature,

208
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,583
can you achieve great things.

209
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,541
The sort-- The sort of things that, uh,

210
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,666
uh, mature people, serious people,
could never achieve. No.

211
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,708
No, they can't even imagine it
because they're all too sensible!

212
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:42,208
And for those of us
who have to think about what we do,

213
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,583
is there anything solid?

214
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,375
Anything?

215
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,625
Because I'd love to--
I'd love to examine it.

216
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,458
Look, Martín has
all that stuff completely…

217
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,875
He's crossed every T. Every detail.

218
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,916
And he'd be delighted
to share it with you.

219
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,375
[Benjamín] Guys, come on!

220
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,458
-[vehicle beeping]
-The waterwheel goes last. Come on!

221
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,208
The waterwheel goes last.

222
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,458
Benjamín, are you still there?

223
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,708
Yes. Go ahead, Miss Lisbon.

224
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,500
The Professor has disappeared.

225
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
[Denver] Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

226
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,000
What do you mean
"The Professor has disappeared"?

227
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
Is he in the fucking
Bermuda Triangle or what?

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,208
How should I know? I don't know.

229
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:36,958
Oh, for fuck's sake…

230
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,416
What matters right now
is that we make a decision.

231
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,083
What are we doing with the gold?

232
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,458
I'm sorry, my dear, were you
planning on having a referendum here?

233
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,333
Because I don't give a shit
about democracy, okay?

234
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,666
The gold is getting out.

235
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,791
There is nothing to debate.

236
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,750
If you let this group debate anything,
they all pull out guns.

237
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,083
So I'm drawing mine first.
No bullshit, okay?

238
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,041
And what if the cops are already
at the stormwater tank right now?

239
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,041
[Palermo] The police are not
at the stormwater tank.

240
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,541
The plan is still on course, understand?

241
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,083
But if that were the case, this would be
the stupidest robbery in history.

242
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,833
Melting down 90 tons of gold
to hand it over to the police.

243
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,625
I said the police are not
at the stormwater tank,

244
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,208
and the gold is worth nothing to us here.
Do you get it or not, my love?

245
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,083
The gold is our hostage.

246
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,208
[sarcastically] That's great.

247
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,208
We take the hostage,
offer it to Tamayo, and negotiate?

248
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,875
Is that your master plan?
You're a real fucking genius.

249
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yeah, muchacho, I'm a fucking genius.

250
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,000
And there's a big machine down there
that'll prove it, so take it easy.

251
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,708
[Stockholm] Is that all you care about?

252
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,000
Proving that your wonderful plan
is gonna work?

253
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,083
It's also about saving your lives.

254
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,000
And to do that,
we have to get the gold out of here.

255
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,500
Palermo is right.

256
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,916
There are only two people out there

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,125
who can tell them how to get the gold out.

258
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,458
The Professor, who won't do it,

259
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,416
and Alicia Sierra.

260
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,875
She's gonna try to use the information
to negotiate and clear her name.

261
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,875
And I assure you

262
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,041
negotiating with the State will be tough.

263
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,666
It's gonna take hours.

264
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,458
In the meantime, we can get the gold out.
And that's exactly what we'll do.

265
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,125
This lady has sex appeal and cojones.

266
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,708
[shouting] We're gonna get
the fucking gold outta here!

267
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,291
We're gonna get the gold out.

268
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,000
[Tokyo] At that moment,
Palermo regained his passion.

269
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,000
The last time he'd had
that sparkle in his eyes

270
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,583
was five years earlier,

271
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,083
right after he was woken up
in the middle of the night.

272
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,500
I told him about the plan.

273
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,000
What did he say?

274
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,625
Let's just say he thought it was…

275
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
so truly marvelous.

276
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,958
No, I'll be more precise.

277
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,541
He said it's the most beautiful thing
he's ever heard.

278
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,958
[laughing]

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,083
Stop fucking around.
Are you serious or not?

280
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,041
Martín.

281
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,750
Of course I only told him the basics.

282
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,500
Now he wants you to explain
all the technical details.

283
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,916
So, it's your turn.

284
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,541
-I can't believe it!
-[laughing]

285
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,583
Oh my God, I can't believe you.

286
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,416
Let's see.

287
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,708
Houndstooth? Scottish tartan?
Something that exudes intellectualism.

288
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,125
I'd say that's a little sophisticated
for three in the morning.

289
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,750
A touch of genius, sure,
but, uh, maybe something more casual.

290
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,125
-[cackling]
-[Berlin laughing]

291
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,083
[Tokyo] "Maturity" meant the same
to Palermo as it did to Berlin,

292
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,500
the end of a life of passion

293
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,250
and the beginning of a life
filled with bitterness.

294
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,708
At the end of the day,
maturing, as well as growing old,

295
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,750
consists of gradually
throwing away dreams.

296
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,083
[Palermo] Bogotá!

297
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,166
Bogotá, the water!

298
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,625
-[shouting] Bogotá!
-What?

299
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,166
[Palermo] Get in the water!

300
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,958
You didn't have to
get him out of bed at this hour.

301
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,041
It would've been fine
to do this tomorrow morning.

302
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
Please, Sergio.
It's an enormous privilege to be here.

303
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,833
Now what exactly does your curiosity
and sharp intellect demand?

304
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:25,958
Tell me.

305
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,250
Okay. Let's say we've turned
the 90 tons into gravel.

306
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,625
-Yeah?
-Now what?

307
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,083
Now we put the diver back in the water,
but this time, he'll have two hoses.

308
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,666
After we completely ransack that vault
like the tomb of Tutankhamun,

309
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
the diver will make the key connection.

310
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,041
Connection that will allow us
to move the gold.

311
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
-How so?
-We have the vault right here, right?

312
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,458
120,000 liters of water.
That will be our driving force.

313
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,291
The water goes into this pump,
through this black hose,

314
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,083
where it'll be mixed with the gold.

315
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,500
And through this red hose,

316
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,916
the 90 tons of gravel will flow smoothly,

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,416
towards the drainage system.

318
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,583
-What caliber is the hose?
-Five inches.

319
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,125
A five-inch hose couldn't possibly handle
the pressure you need to get the gold out.

320
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,125
Exactly.

321
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,291
Because, for now,
the gold will stay in the sanitation ducts

322
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,000
sleeping peacefully.

323
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,333
The real pressure…

324
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,208
that comes just a bit later.

325
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,166
[soldier on megaphone] This is a message
to all residents on the block.

326
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,500
We will forcefully enter
any house that doesn't cooperate.

327
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,416
Go, go, go, go!

328
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Keep in mind that we're doing this
for the safety of our country.

329
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,375
What are you doing?

330
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,041
We're going to hide.

331
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:45,583

Go get the manager.

347
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,083
[soldiers yelling] Open the door!

348
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,000
Open the door!

349
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,833
-Come on, now!
-Open the door!

350
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,875
What's going on?

351
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,791
-No one's there. They're on vacation.
-Well, open it anyway.

352
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,416
[soldier 2] Everyone get ready.

355
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
-This isn't it, it's 2A. Give me a moment.
-Make it quick.

356
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,208
These things take time.
It's not that easy.

357
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,041
Let's go.

what key it is?

-[whispering] Get down.
-[loud thud]

Shh-shh-shh.

00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,541
[soldier 4] Bravo Unit,
first floor checked and clear.

369
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,333
[police radio continues chirping]

372
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,208
[soldier 1] Delta Unit,
send the manager to the third floor.

373
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,208
[clicks fingers] Psst.

374
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,500
[soldier 5] Bedroom clear. We're leaving.

375
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,916
[Victoria crying]

376
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,958

It's all clear. Come on.

380
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,416
[door slams]

381
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,125
[whispering] They're gone.

[both panting]

383
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,583
They're gone.

384
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,708
Gentlemen! Today we make our mark
on the universal history of larceny!

385
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,833
Come on, muchachos!
Let's make history together, goddammit!

386
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,458
-Let's go!
-[Palermo] Come on!

387
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,375
[Bogotá] Let's go!

388
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,208
[Palermo] Then the next stage
of the plan begins,

389
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,250
which enables us to move the gold
that was resting in the drainpipes.

390
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,583
Well, that would cause
a massive clog in the pipelines.

391
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,791
[chuckling] That's why
we have a second pump, huh?

392
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,208
The one we stole in Norway.

393
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,458
Now! Connect the pump!

394
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,250
Let's go, muchachos! Let's go!

395
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,541
Isn't she precious? I'm in love.

396
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,791
It's a technical marvel,
5,300 kilowatts of power.

397
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,791
[drill whirring]

398
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,541
Do you realize what that means, Sergio?

399
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,166
We're gonna move the gold
3.25 meters per second. It's absurd!

400
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,625
There's one problem with that.

401
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,458
Now he's wondering what about--?

402
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,791
What about the loss of pressure
due to friction?

403
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,208
The Darcy-Weisbach equation.
We got it down to the millimeter.

404
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,041
-The only problem we might have--
-Is using too much pressure.

405
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,166
Okay, open the valves!

406
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,875
There's a pressure regulator on the pump.
We'll control it ourselves.

407
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,208
I'll activate the pump.

408
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,875
The pump will then start pushing the gold.

409
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,458
And 91 minutes and 37 seconds later…

410

[whirring]

411
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:07,583
…our loot will have traveled
across the 17,874 meters of pipe

412
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,333
between the gold vault and point B,

413
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,833
the space we commonly refer to
as the "stormwater tank."

414
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,333
[laughing] And then, right in that place,

415
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,958
there will be manna
raining down from heaven.

416
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,333
Sergio, am I crazy? Or do you see it too?

417
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,208

Four thousand!

That's it, precious. That's it.

424
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,708
Let's go, faster! Come on!

425
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,458
[Bogotá] Forty-five hundred!

Relax, don't get anxious.

[Palermo] No, no…

No, no, no.

I'm telling you, nothing here.

Maybe there was a miscalculation.

It's not just the gold.

The joy, the euphoria we felt
when we finally came up with the solution.

Those are the most
beautiful memories of my life.

I'm begging you, for the love of God,

don't let this be a mistake.

Don't let it be an illusion.
I'm begging you, for God's sake.

00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:28,125
Let's go! Let's start making ingots!

481
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,791
[all shouting indistinctly]

482
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,166
-We did it, Tokyo.
-[music ends]

483
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,666
[sighs quietly]

484
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,166
We did it.

485
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,708
A flow of 55,200 liters
of water and gold per minute, brother.

486
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
It's poetry. It's pure poetry.

487
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,916
-Huh? Right?
-[chuckling]

488
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:08,791
How was your shower?

489
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,583
-[Victoria gurgling]
-Hey.

490
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,833
Too bad there's no men's clothing here,
right, Victoria?

491
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,000
When was the last time you ate?

492
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,375
What day is it today?

493
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,291
I'm gonna go try to make something warm.

494
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,958
[narrator] This is the Harris Hawk,
a bird of prey, an expert hunter.

495
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,500
The moment it detects a potential prey,

496
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,916
it swoops down at full speed.

497
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,458
Eat this. It'll be good for you.

498
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,583
I don't think I can remember
the last time someone took care of me.

499
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,458
Actually, I can.

500
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,708
My husband.

501
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,291
I didn't shed a single tear
at his funeral.

502
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,375
I tortured Aníbal Cortés.

503
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,083
And I felt nothing.

504
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,583
Nothing.

505
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,375
They ruined my career. Still nothing.

506
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,958
[reflective piano music playing]

507
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,708
The only thing I've done since then…

508
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,083
was chase after you.

509
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,041
Without feeling the nausea.

510
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:14,875
Or the exhaustion.

511
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,833
Because I…

512
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:23,416
[sighs] I thought if I ran fast enough…

513
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,125
the sadness wouldn't catch up with me.

514
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,666
And now, look.

515
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,708
Here we are.

516
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,708
[breathing shakily]

517
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,875
Here we are.

518
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,875
[crying softly]

519
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,166
[sighs]

520
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,708
Can we pretend…

521
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,000
that you're a friend who came over
to cook and see the baby?

522
00:31:56,083 --> 00:32:00,208
Because maybe this is the last normal day
we'll have for the next 25 years.

523
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:01,166
[sniffles]

524
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,375
Let's imagine there's no cops out there.

525
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,125
And we'll eat,
and you can ask me stupid things,

526
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:12,000
things about the baby,
until she falls asleep,

527
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,083
while we watch TV.

528
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,250
What do you think?

529
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,708
Mmm.

530
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,208
[Professor] Yeah, of course.

531
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,083
Don't get me wrong.

532
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,916
I'm not your friend.

533
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,000
And I never will be.

534
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,125
[choking up] I'll never be your friend.

535
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,583
[sobbing quietly]

536
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,583
To me, this is a marriage of convenience.

537
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,083
No? Don't you agree?

538
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,000
Eat. Go on.

539
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,291
[sniffling] It's good. Thanks.

540
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,083
Say something.

541
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,791
Over the last few hours…

542
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,666
I've lost two more people…

543
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,791
who were very important.

544
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,875
Not for the plan, no.
Not for the heist, no.

545
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,500
They were important to me.

546
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,416
To my personal life.

547
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,500
And I'm not going to let…

548
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,958
anyone else down

549
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:37,916
during this heist.

550
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,250
I'm not gonna let you down.

551
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,208
Okay.

552
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,083
So, uh,

553
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:03,875
you'd better start
getting used to this kind of situation.

554
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,000
Because I'm not going to allow

555
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,416
Victoria to grow up
in a prison maternity ward.

556
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,750
[Alicia chuckles]

557
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,958
Okay, I guess I won't arrest you then.

558
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,583
Sounds good to me.

559
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,625
[sighs]

560
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,291
[Alicia groans softly]

561
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,625
[sniffles]

562
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,041
-[narrator] Like a velociraptor…
-[meows]

563
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,458
-…it chases its prey on the ground.
-Sergio…

564
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,666
Mm-hmm?

565
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,875
We need to get you some new shoes.

566
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,625
[narrator] The kangaroo rat
makes a run for it, but the little rodent…

567
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:06,166
We need to rebuild the bone
and anchor it to a titanium plate.

568
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,000
I have to put him
under general anesthesia.

569
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:08,958
[Helsinki] What?

570
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,583
[tsking] No, no, no, no.
I'm not going to sleep.

571
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:18,166
No. From the waist up, I'm a watchdog.

572
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,791
From the waist down, I'm a patient.

573
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:26,833
Doctor, you do your job, I can take it.

574
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,541
Use an epidural.

575
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,041
[grunts]

576
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,750
He's gonna be a cripple.

577
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,833
Well, scars scare the shit out of people,

578
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,958
and if we're going to jail,
scaring people isn't all that bad.

579
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:50,041
To be honest, I-- I can't even
really imagine what prison is like.

580
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,958
Being in a cell?
It's an awful experience. It's horrible.

581
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:55,916
Horrible.

582
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:00,208
But I think that the worst part
isn't losing your freedom.

583
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,125
It's losing all affection.

584
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,791
I don't know.
The lack of physical contact,

585
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,666
wanting to hug your daughter,

586
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,208
wanting your mother to hug you,

587
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,250
but they're not there.

588
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,083
And then there's Sergio.

589
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,958
I mean, now that
I've finally found a good guy…

590
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,375
My God. Twenty-five years in jail
would completely erase all that.

591
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:30,958
Because no relationship
can handle that solitude.

592
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:37,291
Either that, or, uh,
maybe you spend 25 years

593
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,000
thinking that everything
will be the same and suddenly,

594
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,958
when you finally have a chance
to be with that person and kiss them,

595
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:44,958
shit, you realize

596
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,916
that too much time has passed, right?

597
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,208
And that at the end of the day,

598
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,166
you've spent years and years
romanticizing something that's not…

599
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,125
That's not there, that doesn't exist.

600
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,833
I want you to know that I kissed Denver.

601
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,750
I'm telling you because, I swear,
because it really was nothing.

602
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,708
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I just couldn't help it.

603
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,750
I was obsessed with him for years.

604
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,958
And I realized today
there's nothing there.

605
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:21,250
Hey.

606
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,375
Do you have anything for stress, Doctor?

607
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,625
An antipsychotic maybe.

608
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,125
I just passed the service corridors.
I'm at the junction.

609
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,291
Okay, now take a left.

610
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,291
In about 20 meters to your left,
you'll find a vent grate and you're there.

611
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:44,000
[tense music playing]

612
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,375
[breathing heavily]

613
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,458
[Benjamín] Don't waste
a single ounce of gold.

614
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,833
-Any problems with the smelting?
-No!

615
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,166
Oh man! This is fun, huh?

616
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Look at all this gold! Yeah!

617
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,208
[upbeat rock music playing]

618
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,666
[man] Here we go! Let's go, guys!

619
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,375
-Go, go, go, go!
-Good job, guys!

620
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,583
We already have the first batch of ingots.

621
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,041
Perfect, Benjamín.
There's not much left here.

622
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,750
Let's go, guys! Keep it moving.

623
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,083
Hey…

624
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,166
-Is Lisbon single?
-What?

625
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,750
Lisbon. Is she seeing anyone?

626
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,916
Where the fuck did that come from?

627
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,583
It's just that I saw her
beating up on Rio, and…

628
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,916
Okay?

629
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,625
Chicks with that much cojones
get me hotter than a fucking furnace.

630
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,791
Hmm. Well, she went through
a really fucked-up relationship.

631
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,875
She needs someone
to restore her faith in men.

632
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,083
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Bogotá] Mm-hmm.

633
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,333
You just really gotta go for it. Okay?

634
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,250
She's got standards,
so you've gotta go all the way.

635
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,208
Don't just ask her for, like,
a walk in the park.

636
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:11,458
-That's right.
-[Rio] Get it?

637
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,541
Exactly. Don't be too polite, okay?

638
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,791
Don't half-ass it,
knife between the teeth.

A few seconds later, I made out
with Stockholm in the same room.

You're looking at it wrong, okay?

Next time, don't think with your dick.

You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

naked in bed with the other woman.

[Tokyo] Deep down, Berlin
and the Professor were very similar.

715
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,875
They both devised their plans
based upon a single powerful feeling…

716

[officer] Stop.

718
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,166
[Tokyo] The Professor's "thrill"
was to disguise the extraordinary

719
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,291
as something completely mundane.

720
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,750
Like a garbage truck.

721
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:02,541
Berlin's "thrill" was to believe
that the impossible was possible.

722
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,666
The Professor was like
his brother in that sense,
