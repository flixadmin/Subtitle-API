00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,192

00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,207
(wind whooshing)

4
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,558
Kinda lonesome back here.

5
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,185
-(mumbling)
-(grunts) Yeah, little help.

6
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,940
Okay, um, just, I have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

7
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,609
(continues grunting)

8
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,485
Excuse me. Whoo!

9
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,613
(chuckles) Ah, Dopinder.

10
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,781
Pool. Dead.

11
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,409
Hmm, nice.

12
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,578
DOPINDER: Smells good, no?

13
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,663
Not the Daffodil Daydream.
The girl.

14
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,707
Ah, yes. Gita.

15
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,209
-Hmm.
-She is quite lovely.

16
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,045
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

17
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,296
But, um...

18
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,550
Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

19
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,679
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

20
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,807
Dopinder,
I'm starting to think

21
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,643
there's a reason
I'm in this cab today.

22
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,311
Yeah, sir, you called for it,
remember?

23
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,233
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

24
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,817
When you find it,
the whole world

25
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,152
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

26
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,278
(Dopinder grunts)

27
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,155
So you gotta hold onto love...

28
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,865
-...tight!
-Ah.

29
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,367
And never let go.

30
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,826
Don't make
the same mistakes I did.

31
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,119
-Got it?
-Yeah.

32
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,790
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

33
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,584
(stutters) Sir, what does
Miss Mama June taste like?

34
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,461
Like two hobos fucking
in a shoe filled with piss.

35
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,587
Okay, enough.

36
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,507
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

37
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,425
Hmm, it's bad.

38
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,512
Uh, why the fancy red suit,
Mr. Pool?

39
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,555
Oh, that's because
it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

40
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,100
And I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

41
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,726
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks...

42
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,687
six days and, oh...

43
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,189
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

44
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,026
And what did he
do to you, Mr. Pool?

45
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,528
This shit...

46
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
Boo!

47
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,950
(chopper blades whirring)

48
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,675
(sighs)

49
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,802
They won't disappoint.

50
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,138
They'd better not.

51
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,598
And what about
next month's shipment?

52
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,350
There won't be one.

53
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,060
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

54
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
That won't do.

55
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,193
See, we've had
this small disruption

56
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,528
to our supply chain...

57
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,155
(choking)

58
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,576
We'd appreciate your patience.

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,121
(grunts) Okay.

60
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,124
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

61
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,126
(gasping)

62
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,670
Pleasure doing
business with you.

63
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,343
Fucking mutant.

64
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,346
(engines roaring)

65
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,771
Oh, shit!

66
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,397
I forgot my ammo bag.

67
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,941
-Shall we turn back?
-No, no time.

68
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,818
Fuck it. I got this.

69
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,197
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets,
or bust.

70
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,365
-Right here!
-(grunts)

71
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,116
(tires screeching)

72
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,827
That's, uh, $27.50.

73
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,579
I... I never carry a wallet
when I'm working.

74
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,164
Ruins the lines of my suit.

75
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,582
-Oh.
-But, uh,

76
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,084
how about a crisp high five?

77
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,251
Okay.

78
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,586
Merry Christmas.

79
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,924
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, Pool!

dangerous, and wearing...

137

I've given Deadpool

act like a child.

A heavily-armed child.

144
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,001
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

145
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,044
Which benefits?
The matching unitards?

146
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,130
The house that blows up
every few years?

Please.

(gun firing)

165
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,699
Fine!
I only have 12 bullets...

166
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,409
so you're gonna have to share!

167
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,370
Let's count them down.

168
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,330
(gun firing)

169
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,086
(groaning)

170
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
(firing continues)

171
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,802
(groans)

172
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,970
(tires screeching)

173
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,807
Shit.

174
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,603
Motherfucker!

175
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,189
10! Shit!

176
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,649
Nine. Fuck.

177
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,067
Eight.

178
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,235
Shit-fuck!

179
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,319
(grunts)

180
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,198
Bad Deadpool.

181
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,827
Seven. Good Deadpool.

182
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,953
(bullets ricocheting)

183
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,589
(gun cocks)

184
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,674
Oh!

185
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,013
(grunts)

186
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,140
(gun clicking)

187
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,643
-Someone's not counting. Six.
-(groans)

188
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,654
(gun firing)

189
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,407
(exploding)

190
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,746
(speaking Spanish)

191

-(machine gun firing)
-Oh!

192
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,421
(groans) Four...

193
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,131
-(gun fires)
-(groans)

194
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,841
Gotcha.

195
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,176
(grunts)

196
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,844
Right up main street.

197
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,891
Three, two!

198
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,934
Stupid! Worth it.

199
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,770
(gunfire continues)

200
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,616

201
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,367
(all groaning)

202
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,077
(clinks)

203
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,833
(sniffing)

204
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,084
Ah!

205
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,254
I'm touching myself tonight.

206
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,298
Francis!

207
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,841
Francis...

208
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,929
What the shit-biscuit!

209
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,806
Where you at, Francis?

210
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,599
(groaning)

211
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,478
(groaning loudly)

212
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,816
You're not Francis.

213
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,284
Really?
Rolling up the sleeves?

214
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,749
(groans)

215
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,046
WADE: <i>You're</i>
<i>probably thinking,</i>

216
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,840
<i>"My boyfriend said</i>
<i>this was a superhero movie...</i>

217
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,550

218
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,885
<i>"that other guy</i>
<i>into a fucking kabab!"</i>

219
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,431
<i>Well, I may be super,</i>
<i>but I'm no hero.</i>

220
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,809
<i>And yeah, technically,</i>
<i>this is a murder.</i>

221
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,144
<i>But some of the best love</i>
<i>stories start with a murder.</i>

222
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,231
<i>And that's exactly</i>
<i>what this is, a love story.</i>

223
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,691
<i>And to tell it right...</i>

224
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,026
<i>I gotta take you back</i>
<i>to long before</i>

225
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,654
<i>I squeezed this ass</i>
<i>into red spandex.</i>

226
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,199
MERCHANT: Look, would it help
if I slow it down for you?

227
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,618
I didn't order the pizza.

228
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,414
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
Are you Mr. Merchant?

229
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,709
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who
didn't order the fucking pie!

230
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,210
Then who placed the call?

231
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,129
WADE: I did!

232
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,547
(toilet flushing)

233
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,841
Pineapple and olive?

234
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,177
Sweet and salty.

235
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,470
The fuck are you?

236
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,347
The fuck you doing
in my crib...

237
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,515
Is it burnt crust?

238
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,601
I... God, I hope not. Um...

239
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,436
Whoa... Man, look, if this is
about that poker game.

240
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,771
I told Howie,
I told him that...

241
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,775
Okay, uh, look,
just take whatever you want.

242
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,027
Thanks.

243
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,279
Sir, before you do
anything to him,

244
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,572
do you mind
if I get a big tip?

245
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,867
(chuckles) Uh, Jeremy, is it?

246
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,493
-Umm-hmm.
-Wade. Wade Wilson.

247
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,456
That is a no go
on the tiperoo, Jer.

248
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,082
I'm not here for him.

249
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,043
I'm here for you.

250
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,461
Oh. (chuckles)

251
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,463
Okay, wow, dodged a big-time
bullet on that one.

252
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,548
-Not out of the woods yet.
-(groans)

253
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

254
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,386
They're jeans,
not a chandelier.

255
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,722
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

256
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,557
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

257
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,018
I will shoot your fucking cat!

258
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,937
I don't really know
what that means.

259
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,229
I don't have a cat.

260
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,315
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

261
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,488
Anyhoo, tell me something...

262
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,283
what situation
isn't improved by pizza?

263
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,661
Do you happen to know
a Meghan Orflosky?

264
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,329
Getting that right? Orflosky?

265
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,790
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

266
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,209
Because she knows you.

267
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,586
Jeremy, I belong
to a group of guys

268
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,672
who take a dime
to beat a fella down.

269
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,215
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

270
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,633
but lucky for her...

271
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,093
I got a soft spot.

272
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,637
-But I'm a...
-A stalker.

273
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,597
Threats hurt, Jer.

274
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,101
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

275
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,312
So keep away from Meghan.

276
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,397
Cool?

277
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,606
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,774
Then we're done.

279
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,026
Wait. (chuckles slowly)
We are?

280
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,861
Yeah. We're totally done.
(laughs)

281
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,905
You should've seen your face.

282
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,323
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

283
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,700
Soft spot, remember?

284
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,867
(whimpers)

285
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,161
You even look in her
general direction again...

286
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,871
and you will learn
in the worst of ways

287
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,040
that I have
some hard spots too.

288
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,419
That came out wrong.

289
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,754
Or did it?

290
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,548
(whimpering)

291
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,174
(indistinct conversations)

292
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,801
(rock music playing)

293
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,469
(woman laughing)

294
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,935
Mmm... Meghan?

295
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,398
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

296
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,276
No friggin' way.

297
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,198
Should've brought
my roller blades.

298
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,700
Show these kids how it's done.

299
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,162
Oh. And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

300
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,122
Hey, think you could fuck up
my step-dad?

301
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,832
I give a guy
a pavement facial,

302
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,958
it's because he's earned it.

303
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,877
Hey, wait!

304
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,504
You're my hero.

305
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,215
No-no-no-no. That I ain't!

306
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,386
WADE: <i>Nope. Never will be.</i>

307
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,305
Oh. Fuck you, Wade.

308
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,100
<i>I'm just a bad guy who gets</i>
<i>paid to fuck up worse guys.</i>

309
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,228
<i>Welcome to Sister Margaret's.</i>

310
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,522
<i>It's like a job fair</i>
<i>for mercenaries.</i>

311
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,150
<i>Think of us as really</i>
<i>fucked up tooth fairies...</i>

312
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,861
<i>except we knock out the teeth</i>
<i>and take the cash.</i>

313
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,947
<i>You'd best hope we never see</i>
<i>your name on a gold card.</i>

314
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,949
Buck! Liefeld...

315
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,326
BUCK: Hey, Wade!

316
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,869
Wade Wilson,
patron saint of the pitiful.

317
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,245
What can I do for you?

318
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,039
I'd love a Blow Job.

319
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,415
Oh, God, me too.

320
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,667
The drink, moose knuckle.
But first...

321
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,213
Hey, and I ain't taking any
babysitting money, all right?

322
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,006
Make sure
that gets back to Ms...

323
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,132
Orlovsky.

324
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,217
Yeah, her.

325
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,551
-You sure?
-Hmm.

326
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,137
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

327
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,098
I bet you let
the kid off easy, too.

328
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,058
Oh, he's not a bad kid, Weas.

329
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,476
Just a little light stalking.

330
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,019
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

331
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,938
I was traveling
to exotic places...

332
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,607
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

333
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,109
meeting new and exciting
people. And then, uh...

334
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,444
Killing them. Yeah,
I've seen your Instagram.

335
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,072
So what was Special Forces
doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

336
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,698
That's classified.

337
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,951
(whispers) They have
a wonderful TGI Fridays.

338
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,370
All right,
Kahlua, Baileys and...

339
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,704
whipped cream.

340
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,915
I give you a Blow Job.

341
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,708
Why do you make me make that?

342
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,544
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

343
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,087
Take that over to Buck please,

344
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,005
and tell him it's from Boothe.
Little foreplay.

345
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,341
Remind me what good
will come of this?

346
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,426
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

347
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,845
-BUCK: Boothe!
-Oh!

348
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,054
-Easy, man.
-Hold up! Hold up!

349
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,222
What you want?

350
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,640
-(grunts)
-(all exclaiming)

351
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,310
-Cheers. To your health.
-WEASEL: Fuck you.

352
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,855
BOOTHE: Come here,
you fat fuck!

353
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,481
That's a new stool.

354
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,858
(all clamoring)

355
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,821
BUCK: Stay the fuck down.

356
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,239
(groans)

357
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,075
MAN: Whoa! Took his ass out!

358
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,994
WEASEL: All right, move.
Move, move, move.

359
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,245
Buck, go rest.

360
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,831
MAN: Boothe got hit
then went down.

361
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,296
Yeah, he's still breathing.

362
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,505
(all exclaiming)

363
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,425
Nobody wins today.

364
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,093
Nice try, Wade.

365
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,262
You got me. I picked Boothe
in the dead pool.

366
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,722
Who did you pick?

367
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,849
Yeah, Wade, about that, um...

368
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,350
No.

369
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,394
You did not bet on me to die.

370
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,399
You bet on me to die. Wow!

371
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,817
Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

372
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,403
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

373
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,655
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

374
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,617
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

375
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,951
I never win anything.

376
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,161
Whatever.

377
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,829
Soldiers of fortune,
drinks on me!

378
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,040
(all cheering)

379
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,167
Domestic, nothing imported.

380
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,129
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

381
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,133
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

382
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,386
Uh... Tight.

383
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,015
-Vanessa.
-Wade.

384
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,517
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

385
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,145
I'd hit that.

386
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,232
Buck, you best
apologize before...

387
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,609
-(gasps)
-Yeah, that.

388
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,361
Say the magic words,
Fat Gandalf.

389
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,279
-I'm sorry.
-Breathe through the nose.

390
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,490
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

391
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,575
Let go. Okay.
Hey, oh, oh, oh...

392
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,994
-Hakuna his tatas. He's sorry.
-I'm working on it.

393
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,163
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

394
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,166
Hey. Hands off
the merchandise.

395
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,002
Merchandise? Huh...

396
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,588
So you, uh...

397
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,048
bump fuzzies for money?

398
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,133
-Yep.
-Rough childhood?

399
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,301
Rougher than yours.

400
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,970
Daddy left before I was born.

401
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,138
Daddy left before
I was conceived.

402
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,683
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

403
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,268
Where else do you put one out?

404
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,602
I was molested.

405
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,354
Me too. Uncle.

406
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,815
Uncles. They took turns.

407
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,441
I watched my own
birthday party

408
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,609
through the keyhole
of a locked closet...

409
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,027
which also happens to be my...

410
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,030
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

411
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,157
(gasps) You had a dishwasher.

412
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,659
I didn't even know sleep.

413
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,577
It was pretty much
24/7 ball gags,

414
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,079
brownie mix and clown porn.

415
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,497
(laughs)

416
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,376
Who would do such a thing?

417
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,506
Hopefully you, later tonight?

418
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:47,264
Hey, what can I get for,
uh, $275 and a...

419
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,058
a Yogurtland rewards card?

420
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,853
Baby, about 48 minutes
of whatever the fuck you want.

421
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,064
And a low-fat dessert.

422
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,324
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

423
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,660
It's time to put
balls in holes.

424
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,204
You said whatever I want.

425
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,914
I get it.

426
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,750
You love skee ball.

427
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,085
Apparently more than
you love vagina.

428
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,546
That's a tough call. (scoffs)

429
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,757
(stutters) I just wanna get to
know the real you, you know.

430
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,759
Not the short-shorted,
two-dimensional

431
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,761
sex object
peddled by Hollywood.

432
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,887
VANESSA: Balls in holes.

433
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,013
(hip-hop music playing)

434
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,056
Balls in holes.

435
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,557
Prepare to lose tragically.

436
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,725
Bring it, big man.

437
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,893
Okay.

438
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,396
(mocking Scooby-Doo) Uh-oh.

439
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,023
Uh-oh.

440
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,609
The limited edition

441
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,612
Voltron: Defender of
the Universe ring, <i>por favor.</i>

442
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,573
Okay. Here we go.

443
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,534
Had my eye
on this sucker for a while.

444
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,411
And I will take
the pencil eraser.

445
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,871
BOY: Okay.

446
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,707
You are now the protector
of the planet Arus.

447
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,709
And you can erase stuff...

448
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,211
written in pencil.

449
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,879
M'lady?

450
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,255
Well, I hate to
break it to you...

451
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,257
but your 48 minutes are up.

452
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,427
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

453
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,097
FYI, five mini lion-bots
come together

454
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,099
to form one super-bot, so...

455
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,435
Five mini lion-bots?
Three minutes.

456
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,561
Deal.

457
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,646
What do we do
with the remaining

458
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,897
two minutes, 37 seconds?

459
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,774
Cuddle?

460
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,776
(moaning)

461
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,569
(pop music playing)

462
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,613
How long can you keep this up?

463
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,906
All year?

464
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,282
(chuckles)

465
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,119
(continues moaning)

466
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,460
Happy Valentine's Day.

467
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,594
Happy Chinese New Year.

468
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,096
Year of the Dog.

469
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
(exhales)

470
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,477
Relax.

471
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,147
And Happy
International Women's Day.

472
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,316
(whip cracks)

473
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,821
(groans) No. No. No.

474
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,324
Happy Lent.

475
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,953
(moaning)

476
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,496
Ow, ow.

477
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,706
-Wade?
-Sorry.

478
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,207
Happy Halloween.

479
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,500
Happy Halloween.

480
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,543
(laughs)

481
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,546
(continues moaning)

482
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,970
Happy Thanksgiving.

483
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,182
I love you.

484
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,896
If your left leg
is Thanksgiving...

485
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,731
and your right leg
is Christmas...

486
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,567
can I visit you
between the holidays?

487
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,486
-(chuckles)
-Oh!

488
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,362
That sweater is terrible.

489
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,907
-(laughs)
-But red looks good on you.

490
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,074
Red's your color.

491
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,035
Brings out the bloodshot
in your eyes.

492
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,995
Listen, I've been thinking...

493
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,038
Really?

494
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,540
...about why we're
so good together.

495
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,042
Why's that?

496
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,546
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Big time.

497
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,215
Hmm. (chuckles)

498
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,383
And, uh, we're like
two jigsaw pieces,

499
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,676
you know,
the weird curvy edges...

500
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,429
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

501
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,348
Right.

502
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,058
Wade...

503
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,186
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

504
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,855
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

505
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,025
Will you, uh...

506
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,111
-stick it in my...
-Marry me?

507
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,115
Uh... Jinx?

508
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,242
Huh.

509
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,077
Where were you hiding that?

510
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,245
Nowhere.

511
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,872
They say one month's salary.
So, uh...

512
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,040
You mean?

513
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,083
I do.

514
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,251
That's my line.

515
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,214
I love you, Wade Wilson.

516
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,258
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

517
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,926
-Yes!
-Whoo!

518
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,761
Yes!

519
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,804
(laughs)

520
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,306
I feel just like
a little girl.

521
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,433
-(chuckles)
-(sighs)

522
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,897
What if I just held on
and never let go?

523
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,608
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

524
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,111
Oh, <i>Star Wars</i> jokes.

525
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,779
<i>Empire.</i>

526
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,448
Jesus Christ.

527
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,450
It's like I made you
in a computer.

528
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,244
(music playing on radio)

529
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,287
Mmm.

530
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,789
Hey.

531
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,250
-Perfect.
-(camera clicks)

532
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,422
-Let's see.
-All right, wee break.

533
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,840
Shake it, yeah.

534
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,637
(sighs)

535
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,264
WADE: <i>Here's the thing.</i>

536
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,474
<i>Life is an endless series</i>
<i>of train-wrecks...</i>

537
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,642
<i>with only brief,</i>

538
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,145

539
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,815
<i>This had been the ultimate</i>
<i>commercial break.</i>

540
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,025
-(toilet flushing)
-(sighs)

541
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,611
<i>Which meant</i>
<i>it was time to return</i>

542
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,362

<i>scheduled program.</i>

543
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,323
-What the...
-(thuds)

544
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,532
Oh, my God. Wade?

545
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,123
You're clowning.

546
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,000
You're not clowning?

547
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,376
I sense clowns.

548
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,172
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

549
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,799
There are certainly
options we can look into.

550
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,885
New drugs are being
developed every day.

551
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,557
So what do we do?

552
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,393
Surely there is something
we can do.

553
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,064
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer...

554
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,398
and there were all these new

555
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,691
experimental drugs
from Germany.

556
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,319
WADE: <i>Vanessa's already</i>
<i>working on Plan A, B,</i>

557
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,071
<i>all the way through Z.</i>

558
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,908
<i>Me? I'm memorizing</i>
<i>the details of her face.</i>

559
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,994
<i>Like it's the first time</i>
<i>I'm seeing it.</i>

560
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,037
<i>Or the last.</i>

561
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,580
DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson...

562
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,207
Mr. Wilson?

563
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,876
Take your time
to process this.

564
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,879
<i>It's important not to</i>
<i>do anything rash.</i>

565
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,261
(wade grunts)

566
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,349
(sighs loudly)

567
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,060
Now, if I were
a 200-pound sack

568
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,688
of assholes named Francis,
where would I hide?

569
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,690
(motorbike revving)

570
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,567
Oh.

571
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,406
(engine roaring)

572
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,408
(gun firing)

573
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,707
(Francis grunts)

574
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,923
WADE: A hush
falls over the crowd

575
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,384
as rookie sensation
Wade W. Wilson...

576
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,054
out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

577
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,391
His form looks good.

578
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,435
Oh!

579
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:52,272
And that's why
Regina rhymes with fun.

580
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,108
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

581
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,485
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

582
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,988
Oh! Giving him the business.

583
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,489
Incoming!

584
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:06,411
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

585
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,454
(Francis groans)

586
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,626
Looking good, Francis.
Well rested.

587
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,420
Like you've been pitching,
not catching.

588
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,964
Ringing any bells? No?

589
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,137
How about now?

590
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,432
(chuckles slowly)

591
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,310
Wade fucking Wilson.

592
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,980
FRANCIS: Well,
hello, gorgeous.

593
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,025
WADE: Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

594
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,278
Yeah. And whose fault is that,
huh, Francis?

595
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,322
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butterface.

596
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,157
Please, you should thank me.

597
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,492
Apparently,
I made you immortal.

598
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,327
I'm actually quite jealous.

599
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,788
Yeah, but this ain't
a life worth living, is it?

600
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,541
Now, I'm about to do to you

601
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,002
what Limp Bizkit did
to music in the late 90s.

602
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,128
(metal clanks)

603
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,172
Dad?

604
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,303
WADE: <i>I think we can all agree</i>
<i>that shit just went sideways</i>

605
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,180
<i>in the most colossal way.</i>

606
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>Well, maybe not the most.</i>

607
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,479
WADE: Uh... This is my most
prized possession.

608
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,022
VANESSA: Wham?

609
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,982
No, no, no. Wham!

610
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,485
<i>Make It Big</i> is the album
that George and Andy

611
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,986
earned the exclamation point.

612
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,531
So, am I supposed
to just smile

613
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,824
and wave you out the door?

614
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,408
Think of it like
spring cleaning.

615
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,743
Only if spring was death.

616
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,329
God, if I had a nickel
for every time

617
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,872
I spanked it to
Bernadette Peters.

618
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,375
-Sounds like you do.
-(coins jingling)

619
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,044
Bernadette is not
going anywhere,

620
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,046
because you're not
going anywhere.

621
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,089
Drink.

622
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,674
You're right.
Cancer is only in my liver,

623
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,050
lungs, prostate, and brain.

624
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,343
All things I can live without.

625
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,554
Ha.

626
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,556
You belong here at home.

627
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,182
Surrounded by your Voltron

628
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,351
and your Bernadette,
and your me.

629
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,106
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

630
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,110
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-
opening-for-the

631
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,238
Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-
State-Fair shit-show.

632
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:11,369
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

633
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,372
I want you to remember me.

634
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,584
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

635
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,586
Well, I wanna remember us.

636
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,588
I swear to God, I will
find you in the next life...

637
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,298
and I'm gonna boom-box
<i>Careless Whisper</i>

638
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,757
outside your window.

639
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,384
Wham!

640
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,765
No one is boom-boxing shit.
Okay?

641
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,728
We can fight this.

642
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,066
Besides,
I just realized something.

643
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,278
You win.
Your life is officially

644
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,989
way more fucked up than mine.

645
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,451
(Wade chuckles)

646
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,453
I love you.

647
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,292
(music playing)

648
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,257
Wade.

649
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,510
Weas.

650
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,138
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

651
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,307
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

652
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,975
How about three shots
of Patrón?

653
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,812
Or how about
<i>Triticum aestivum,</i> wheatgrass.

654
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,189
Excellent for
the immune system.

655
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,316
Jesus Christ.
You sound like Vanessa.

656
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,525
Here, check it out.

657
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,985
She's sending away
for all these

658
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,029
colorful clinic brochures.

659
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,989
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

660
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,284
Chechnya. Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

661
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,162
You got China
and Central Mexico.

662
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,790
You know how they
say "cancer" in Spanish?

663
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,999
No.

664
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,210
<i>-El Cáncer.</i>
-Oh.

665
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,212
I could have guessed that.

666
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,005
Look how happy you look here.

667
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,715
Mind if I keep this?
Put it up,

668
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,176
so I can remember
when you looked alive.

669
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,512
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

670
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,306
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

671
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,850
-I got it, Weas. Thanks.
-Oh.

672
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,355
And, uh, that guy over there
came in looking for you.

673
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,316
Real Grim Reaper type.

674
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,402
I don't know.
Might further the plot.

675
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,407
Boothe.

676
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,658
Wade.

677
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,413
(Wade sighs)

678
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,914
Mr. Wilson.

679
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,499
How can I help you?

680
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,210
Besides luring children
into a panel van.

681
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,753
I understand you've recently

682
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,922
been diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

683
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,090
Stalker alert.

684
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,426
It's my job. Recruitment.

685
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,595
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

686
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,890
But you're a fighter.
Special Forces.

687
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,393
41 confirmed kills.

688
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,228
One every seven weeks.

689
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,731
Same rate most folks
get a haircut. Hmm...

690
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,733
It's to wash the taste out.

691
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,069
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

692
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,238
And now you spend your days

693
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,240
sticking up
for the little people...

694
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,908
People change.
What do you want?

695
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,370
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

696
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,959
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

697
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,045
And what's more, give you

698
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,714
abilities most men
only dream of?

699
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,219
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

700
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,305
but not a good one,
like Slap Chop.

701
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,973
More Shake Weight-y.

702
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,060
The world needs
extraordinary soldiers.

703
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,270
We won't just make you better.

704
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,398
We will make you
better than better.

705
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,650
A superhero.

706
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,820
Look, Agent Smith,

707
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,989
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

708
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,117
But if I ever hit "fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

709
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,994
Oh, um...

710
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,080
Shit. We're within 500 yards
of a school,

711
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,331
so you may wanna...

712
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,587
His drink's on him.

713
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,969
WEASEL: What did he say?

714
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,304
(thunderclap)

715
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,641
(siren wailing in distance)

716
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,981
(sniffles)

717
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,202
VANESSA: Hey, what's going on?

718
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,704
(sniffles) Hey. Sorry.

719
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,166
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

720
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,544
I dreamt I kidnapped
his daughter

721
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,212
and he just wasn't having it.

722
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,182
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

723
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,560
At some point
you have to wonder

724
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,353
if he's just a bad parent.

725
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,396
VANESSA: Hmm.

726
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,244
WADE: <i>The worst part</i>

You know, I can hear you.

00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,421
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

Stay right here.

745
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,759
COLOSSUS: You've been
warned before, Deadpool.

746
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,596
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

747
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,806
You will both
be coming with us.

748
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,767
WADE: Look, Colossus,
I don't have time for

749
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,769
the goody two-shoes
bullshit right now!

750
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,771
And you are?

751
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,107
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

752
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,611
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

753
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,571
That's the coolest name ever!

754
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,617
So, what, you're like, uh,
his sidekick?

755
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,118
No. Trainee.

756
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,620
Let me guess.

757
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,164
X-Men left you behind on what?
Shit detail?

758
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,332
What does that make you?

759
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,793
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

760
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,253
Can we trade names?

-Can we go?

762
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,173
WADE: Look!
I'm a teenage girl.

763
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,467
I'd rather be
anywhere than here.

764
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,678
I'm all about
long sullen silences...

765
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,306
followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

766
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,977
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

767
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,688
or mean comment? Go on.

768
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,191
-You got me in a box here.
-Aha!

769
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,151
We can't allow this, Deadpool.

770
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,653
Please, come quietly.

771
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,989
You big chrome cock-gobbler!

772

COLOSSUS: That's not nice.

You're really gonna
fuck this up for me?

WADE: Listen!

784
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,520
The day I decide to become

00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,855
a crime-fighting

786

791
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,200
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

792
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,703
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

793
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,539
Either that or
slap the bitch outta you!

800
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,092

That does it!

802

-(metal clanks)
-Oh!

803

(groans) Canada!

804
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,773
That's not good.

805
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,024
COLOSSUS: Wade, please.

806

807
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,570
Oh, your poor wife.

808
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,572
You really should stop.

809

00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,251
WADE: I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

814
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,586
-This is embarrassing.
-(groans)

815
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,130
Please, stay down.

816
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,383
WADE: You ever hear of
the one-legged man

817
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,592
in the ass-kicking contest?

818
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,094
Do you have off switch?

819
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,595
Yeah, it's right next
to the prostate.

820
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,930
Or is that the on switch?

821
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,932
-Enough!
-(glass shatters)

822
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,767
(laughs)

823
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,394
(groaning)

824
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,609
COLOSSUS: Let us go talk
to the Professor.

825
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,778
McAvoy or Stewart?

826
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,114
These timelines
are so confusing.

827
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,992
"Dead or alive,
you're coming with me!"

828
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,744
COLOSSUS: You will
recover, Wade.

829
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,621
You always do.

830
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,587
You ever see <i>127 Hours?</i>
Spoiler alert.

831
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,965
(squishing noise)

832
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,342
Oh, my God.

833
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,593
Nasty.

834
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,931
WADE: Oh, there's
the money shot, baby.

835
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,141
(retching)

836
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,184
<i>Are You There God?</i>
<i>It's Me, Margaret.</i>

837
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,774
(truck horn honks)

838
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,573
WADE: <i>Rock, meet bottom.</i>

839
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>And when life ends up</i>
<i>breathtakingly fucked...</i>

840
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,411
<i>you can generally</i>
<i>trace it back</i>

841
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,497
<i>to one big, bad decision.</i>

842
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,750
<i>The one that sent you</i>
<i>down the road to Shitsburgh.</i>

843
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,962
<i>This? Well, this was mine.</i>

844
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,964
AGENT SMITH: Mr. Wilson.

845
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,426
Nothing warms my heart more

846
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,761
than a change
of someone else's.

847
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,638
You finally hit "fuck it."

848
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,808
Just promise
you'll do right by me.

849
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,394
So I can do right
by someone else.

850
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,729
Of course.

851
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,231
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

852
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,026
Or animated.

853
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,280
(man choking)

854
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,577
-MAN: Move it! Keep moving.
-(patient screaming)

855
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,298
This place seems sanitary.

856
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,301
My first request
is warmer hands.

857
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,138
Oh! And, Jesus,
a warmer table.

858
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,600
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

859
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,769
I'm thinking "pork and beans."

860
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,274
(groans) Easy.

861
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,570
Aren't you a little strong
for a lady?

862
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,739
I'm calling wang.

863
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,783
(breathing heavily)

864
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,827
What's up with the matches?

865
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,830
Oral fixation
or just a big Stallone fan?

866
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,040
(muffled groan)

867
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,667
Patience, Angel.

868
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,211
All in good time.

869
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,296
Are you here for
the turndown service, or what?

870
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,007
We have another talker.

871
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,926
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

872
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,220
Shut the fuck up.

873
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,517
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

874
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,562
I manage this workshop.

875
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,816
Ah, my welcome speech used to
be full of euphemisms like...

876
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,442
"This may hurt a little."

877
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,486
"This may cause you
some discomfort."

878
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,822
But I've grown blunt.

879
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,491
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

880
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,118
It's a private institution
that turns

881
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,203
reclamation projects
like yourself...

882
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,707
into men of
extraordinary abilities.

883
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,710
But if you think
super-human powers

884
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,628
are acquired painlessly...

885
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,880
-Wrong.
-(groans)

886
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,882
I'm injecting you with
a serum that activates

887
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,135
any mutant genes
lurking in your DNA.

888
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,678
For it to work

889
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,306
we need to subject you
to extreme stress.

890
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,852
(Wade groaning)

891
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,812
You've heard that whole

892
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,023
"make an omelet,
break some eggs" bit, right?

893
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,191
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

894
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,903
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

895
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,990
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

896
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,118
It made Angel
inhumanly strong.

897
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:45,497
In my case,
it enhanced my reflexes.

898
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,249
Also scorched
my nerve endings,

899
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,917
so I no longer feel pain.

900
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,506
And, in fact,
I no longer feel anything.

901
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,468
(mumbling)

902
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,768
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

903
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,853
You have something
in your teeth.

904
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,814
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

905
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,901
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

906
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,235
(sighs)

907
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,364
It's been bothering me
for a long time.

908
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,698
(laughs)

909
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,866
Ah, made you look.

910
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,743
Hey, is Ajax your actual name?

911
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,453
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

912
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,621
What is it, really?

913
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,082
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

914
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,875
Mitch? The Rickster?

915
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,044
(in British accent)
Is it Basil Fawlty?

916
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,837
Oh, joke away.

917
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,631
One thing that never
survives this place

918
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,216
is a sense of humor.

919
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,842
We'll see about that.

920
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,386
I suppose we will.

921
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,138
He's all yours.

922
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,556
Oh, come on.

923
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,433
You're gonna
leave me all alone here

924
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,143
with less-angry
Rosie O'Donnell?

925
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,728
(groans)

926
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,483
FRANCIS: <i>This is how</i>
<i>it's going to work.</i>

927
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,653
<i>Adrenaline acts as a catalyst</i>
<i>for the serum...</i>

928
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,781
<i>so we're going</i>
<i>to have to make you suffer.</i>

929
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,493
FRANCIS: <i>If you're lucky,</i>
<i>the mutant genes will activate</i>

930
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,371
<i>and manifest in</i>
<i>a spectacular fashion.</i>

931
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,456
(gasps)

932
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,503
FRANCIS: <i>If not, well, we'll</i>
<i>have to keep on hurting you...</i>

933
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,255
(Wade shivering)

934
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,548
<i>in new and different ways,</i>

935
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,049
<i>each more painful</i>
<i>than the last...</i>

936
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,096
until you finally mutate.

937
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,932
Or die.

938
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,274
CUNNINGHAM: You mean
a bucket list?

939
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,568
WADE: Like a fuck-it list.

940
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,986
I'd really like
to light a spliff

941
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,404
off the Olympic torch.

942
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,781
CUNNINGHAM: Pass it to me
right after.

943
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:46,326
Let's not forget naked
tandem base-jumping

944
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,871
with the WNBA's
Sacramento Monarchs.

945
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:53,041
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

946
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,462
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

947
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,840
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

948
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,759
(laughs)

949
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,973
Making banana pancakes
for my kids.

950
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,437
Vanessa.

951
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,193
WADE: <i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>

952
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,652
FRANCIS: You're lovely.

953
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:24,114
I don't know about anyone
else, but I'm touched.

954
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,282
We were just joking.

955
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,743
No, no. It's okay.

956
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,496
I encourage distractions.

957
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,499
Wouldn't want you giving up
on us, now would we?

958
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,501
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

959
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,712
How tough can he be...

960
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,799
with a name like Francis?

961
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,509
Francis?

962
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,219
WADE: That's his legal name.

963
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,306
(chuckling) He got "Ajax"
from the dish soap.

964
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,937
F, R, A, N, C, I...

965
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,814
Oops!

966
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,443
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

967
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,656
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

968
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,115
You are so
relentlessly annoying.

969
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,283
Thanks.

970
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,493
Never heard that before.

971
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,788
Why don't you do us all
a favor and shut the fuck up?

972
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,957
Or I'll sew
your pretty mouth shut.

973
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,667
Oh...

974
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,377
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

975
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,837
See, here's the problem

976
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,672
with round-the-clock
torture...

977
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,800
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

978
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,763
Is that what you think?

979
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,563
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

980
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,690
nothing will.

981
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,358
Now, what we're going to do is

982
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,985
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

983
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,779
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

984
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,322
If your brainwaves slow,

985
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,241
meaning you're
about to pass out...

986
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,034
then we'll turn up the O2.

987
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,370
If your heart rate slows...

988
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,123
meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

989
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,666
we'll turn it back down.

990
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,835
And that's where
we'll leave you.

991
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,962
Right there.

992
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,506
Oh, and I thought
you guys were dicks before.

993
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,092
FRANCIS: You know
the funniest part of this?

994
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,220
You still think we're making
you a superhero.

995
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,516
You. A dishonorable discharge.

996
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,311
Hip-deep in hookers.

997
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,646
You're nothing.

998
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,065
Little secret, Wade.

999
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,735
This workshop
doesn't make superheroes,

1000
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,987
we make super-slaves.

1001
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,781
We're gonna fit you
with a control collar

1002
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,825
and auction you off
to the highest bidder.

1003
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,994
Who knows what
they'll have you doing?

1004
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,290
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

1005
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,295
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

1006
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,256
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1007
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,222
You're never going home
after this.

1008
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,600
Now there's a brave face.

1009
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,186
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

1010
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,442
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

1011
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,737
Enjoy your weekend.

1012
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,697
"Weekend"? Back up.

1013
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,074
Weekend?

1014
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,576
(machine hissing)

1015
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,956
(gasping)

1016
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,707
(choking)

1017
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,842
(EKG beeping)

1018
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,055
-(choking)
-(EKG beeping rapidly)

1019
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,742
WADE: <i>Did I say</i>
<i>this was a love story?</i>

1020
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,370
<i>No, it's a horror movie.</i>

1021
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,580
(screaming)

1022
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,093
(gasping)

1023
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,888
FRANCIS: Fucking hell.

1024
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,183
Looks like someone lost his
shot at Homecoming King.

1025
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,310
What have you done to me?

1026
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,854
I've merely raised
your stress levels

1027
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,689
high enough
to trigger a mutation.

1028
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,025
You sadistic fuck!

1029
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,235
I've cured you, Wade.

1030
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,696
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

1031
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,575
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

1032
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,412
Yeah, I've seen similar
side-effects before.

1033
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,748
I could cure them...

1034
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,003
but where's the fun in that?

1035
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,883
Now, I'm gonna
shut you in again, Wade.

1036
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,636
Not because I need to.

1037
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,309
Because I want to.

1038
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,146
(breathing heavily)

1039
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,866
Oh, well.

1040
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,242
Go ahead.

1041
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,289
Oh, you smell like shit.

1042
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,459
-(grunts)
-Whoa! (laughs)

1043
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,627
ANGEL DUST: Motherfucker.

1044
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,463
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right,
it's all right.

1045
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,341
I think we owe him
that one, yeah?

1046
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,927
You take off. Go on.

1047
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,054
Off you go.

1048
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,691
Quick question.

1049
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,987
What's my name?

1050
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,078
Didn't think so.

1051
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,707
WADE: <i>Sorry, Francis.</i>
<i>My lips are sealed.</i>

1052
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,251
(groaning)

1053
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,892
(breathing heavily)

1054
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,883
(exploding)

1055
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,187
(men screaming
in the distance)

1056
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:16,026
-(indistinct shouting)
-(man coughing)

1057
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:30,999
(both grunting)

1058
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,970
(groans)

1059
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,058
(grunting)

1060
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,945
(groaning)

1061
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,450
You don't want to kill me.

1062
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,911
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

1063
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,371
(grunting)

1064
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,589
(laughs)

1065
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,299
(grunting)

1066
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,428
(groaning)

1067
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,115
(grunts loudly)

1068
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,742
(retching)

1069
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,662
(grunts and laughs)

1070
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,625
(grunting)

1071
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,380
(Wade breathing heavily)

1072
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,177
What's my name?

1073
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,518
CUNNINGHAM: Wade.

1074
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,579
(groans)

1075
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,922
WADE: <i>I didn't just get</i>
<i>the cure to</i> el cáncer...

1076
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,093
<i>I got the cure</i>
<i>to</i> el <i>everything.</i>

1077
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,890
<i>But there was</i>
<i>only one thing...</i>

1078
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,683
<i>that really mattered.</i>

1079
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,272
(indistinct conversations)

1080
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,905
(thunder rumbling)

1081
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,290
(indistinct conversations)

1082
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,751
(infant crying)

1083
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,131
WOMAN: Come on, let's go.

1084
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,264
WOMAN: Oh, that must hurt.

1085
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,724
Thank you so much.

1086
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,561
(indistinct
conversations continue)

1087
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,822
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

1088
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,240
WOMAN: Look at his face.

1089
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,659
MAN: Oh, my God. Poor guy.

1090
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,827
FEMALE PEDESTRIAN:
Honey, don't stare.

1091
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,162
MALE PEDESTRIAN: Freak.

1092
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,329
(indistinct conversations)

1093
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,664
(breathing heavily)

1094
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,852
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

1095
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,521
Come on, Wade,
it can't be that bad.

1096
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,939
Ah, bullshit!

1097
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:08,193
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

1098
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,987
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

1099
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,447
Oh! Oh.

1100
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,698
Do you like what you see?

1101
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,116
No.

1102
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,160
You look like an avocado

1103
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,537
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

1104
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,705
Yeah.

1105
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,790
Not gently.
Like it was hate-fucking.

1106
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,709
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

1107
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,711
and that was
the only catharsis

1108
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,379
that they could find
without violence.

1109
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,049
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

1110
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,801
is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

1111
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,720
And he's gone. Poof!

1112
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,514
Yeah, well you gotta do
something to remedy this...

1113
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,806
because as of now,

1114
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,558
you only have
one course of action.

1115
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,893
Damn straight.

1116
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,811
-Find Francis.
-Star in horror films.

1117
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,896
What?

1118
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,065
Star in your own horror films.

1119
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,525
Because you look
like Freddy Krueger

1120
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,069
face-fucked
a topographical map of Utah.

1121
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,530
Here's what
I'm actually gonna do.

1122
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,739
I'm gonna work
through his crew

1123
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,241
until somebody
gives up Francis...

1124
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,660
force him to fix this, then
put a bullet in his skull...

1125
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,370
and fuck the brain hole.

1126
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,540
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

1127
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,500
But the douchebag does
thinks you're dead, right?

1128
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,584
Yeah.

1129
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,545
That's good.
You should keep it that way.

1130
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,171
What, like, wear a mask?

1131
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,258
Yes. A very thick mask.
All the time.

1132
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,926
I am sorry...

1133
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,595
you are haunting.

1134
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,556
Your face is
the stuff of nightmares.

1135
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,932
Like a testicle with teeth.

1136
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,767
You will die alone.

1137
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,561
I mean, if you could die.

1138
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,021
Ideally, for others' sake.

1139
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,439
That'll do.

1140
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,400
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

1141
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,443
like Wade the Wisecracker...

1142
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,947
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.

1143
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,865
Oh, shit.

1144
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,534
What?

1145
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,245
I put all my money
on you and now...

1146
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,871
I just realized
I'm never gonna win the, uh...

1147
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,956
Dead pool.

1148
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,212
Captain Deadpool...

1149
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,090
No, just...

1150
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,800
-Just Deadpool, yeah.
-Just Deadpool.

1151
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,969
To you, Mr. Pool.

1152
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,304
Deadpool.

1153
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,805
That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

1154
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:01,889
(glasses clink)

1155
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,488
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it.

1156
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,574
-(man groans)
-Where's Francis?

1157
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,951
(grunting)

1158
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,956
-(gun firing)
-(groaning)

1159
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
(sighs)

1160
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,506
WADE: Where's Francis?

1161
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,600
AL: Seltzer water
and lemon for blood.

1162
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,854
Or wear red. Dumbass.

1163
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,028
(all cheering)

1164
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,326
(clamoring)

1165
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,163
(groaning)

1166
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,456
-(gun firing)
-(people screaming)

1167
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,041
WADE: Don't make me ask twice.

1168
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,669
Where...

1169
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,962
is Francis?

1170
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,131
He made me ask twice.

1171
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,300
Is the mask muffling my voice?

1172
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,556
Where's Francis?

1173
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,558
(gun firing)

1174
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,019
Where the fuck is Francis?

1175
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,646
(groaning)

1176
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,150
(groaning)

1177
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,652
(Wade laughing)

1178
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,906
You're about to be killed
by a Zamboni.

1179
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,324
Where's Francis?

1180
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,575
(woman whimpers)

1181
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:45,868
No! Please!

1182
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,206
-Oh, God! I'm so sorry!
-(woman screams)

1183
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,084
Oh! You little spider monkey!

1184
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,585
(toilet flushing)

1185
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,841
Where... is... Francis?

1186
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:01,926
This is confusing.

1187
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,428
Is it sexist to hit you?

1188
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,929
Is it more sexist
to not hit you?

1189
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,432
I mean, the line
gets real... blurry.

1190
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,726
Where is Francis?

1191
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,271
Tell me where
your fucking boss is

1192
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,605
or you're gonna die!

1193
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,774
In five minutes!

1194
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,703
(whispers)
Don't hesitate to call me.

1195
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,471
Nice to see you, Jared.

1196
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,140
I'll take the footlong...

1197
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,475
Fully loaded.

1198
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,894
-(grunting)
-(guns firing)

1199
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,983
(panting)

1200
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,445
-(grunts)
-(glass shatters)

1201
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,990
(groans) Whoa, whoa!

1202
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,575
41 confirmed kills.

1203
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,119
Now it's 89. About to be 90.

1204
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,997
-Mr. Wilson?
-Ding-ding.

1205
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,167
You're looking very alive.

1206
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,002
Ha! Only on the outside!

1207
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,171
This is not going to
end well for me, is it?

1208
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,506
This is not gonna
end well for you, no.

1209
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,673
Where's your boss?

1210
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,425
I can tell you exactly...

1211
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,843
(shushing mockingly)

1212
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,095
Oh, you'll tell me.
But first...

1213
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,848
You might wanna
look away for this.

1214
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,266
Now this little piggy
went to...

1215
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,476
(Agent Smith screams)

1216
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,646
WADE: Thank you, Agent Smith.

1217
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,275
Taxi!

1218
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,029
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1219
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,864
(Hindi song playing on radio)

1220
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,366
WADE: And we all know
how this turned out.

1221
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,538
<i>Whoops!</i>
<i>You weren't meant to see that.</i>

1222
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,339
There. All caught up.

1223
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,216
(jazz music playing)

1224
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,224
We're here.

1225
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,228
(groans) Sorry about bleeding
in all your garbage.

1226
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,232
(grunts)

1227
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,528
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

1228
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:26,988
Whoo!

1229
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,157
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed...

1230
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,410
like the kind where
your year-long plan

1231
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,371
ends with the wrong guy
getting dismembered!

1232
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,875
That said, when it comes time
to licking wounds,

1233
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,585
there's no place like home.

1234
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,254
Ah, and I share that home
with someone you've met,

1235
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,673
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, Al.

1236
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,592
God, I miss cocaine.

1237
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:48,926
Her.

1238
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:52,680
(gasps) Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

1239
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,433
That's like 16 walls.

1240
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,560
She's like Robin to my Batman,

1241
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:01,272
except she's old,
and black, and blind.

1242
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,107
And I think
she's in love with me.

1243
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,944
WADE: <i>Wait, pretty sure</i>
<i>Robin loves Batman, too.</i>

1244
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,237
(knocking on door)

1245
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,868
(knocking on door)

1246
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,621
(Al groans)

1247
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:17,955
WADE: Al?

1248
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,626
Morning, sleepyhead.

1249
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:22,877
(grunts)

1250
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,296
It smells like
old lady pants in here.

1251
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,256
Yes, I'm old. I wear pants.

1252
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,050
But you're no lady.

1253
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,886
Oh! So comfy.

1254
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,556
Upside of being blind:
I've never seen you in Crocs.

1255
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,099
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

1256
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,225
AL: Yes, I know.

1257
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,312
Downside of being blind...

1258
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,648
I hear everything
in this duplex.

1259
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,941
(groans)

1260
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,068
Sit on a stick.

1261
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,277
Bactin?

1262
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,406
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

1263
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,284
How's that Kullen
coming along?

1264
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,328
IKEA doesn't assemble itself,
you know.

1265
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,331
You're telling me.
I don't mind the Kullen.

1266
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,333
It's an improvement
on the Hurdal.

1267
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,503
Please. Anything's an
improvement over the Hurdal.

1268
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,173
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

1269
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,593
Oh, no, I didn't get excited
till I saw the Kullen.

1270
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:13,678
Screw, please.

1271
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,137
Here? Now? Just kidding.

1272
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,347
I know it's been decades.

1273
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,682
You'd be surprised.

1274
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,475
Pretty grossed out.

1275
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,854
(groans) Ta... Da.

1276
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,780
I wish I never heard
of Craigslist.

1277
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,490
And I quote,
"Looking for roommate,

1278
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,700
"blind to
life's imperfections.

1279
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:36,867
"Must be good with hands."

1280
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:39,203
Or would you rather I build
the IKEA, and you pay rent?

1281
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,205
Why such a douche
this morning?

1282
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:42,999
Let's recap.

1283
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,376
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak...

1284
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,169
slipped through
my arms today...

1285
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,047
Arm.

1286
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,549
Catching him was
my only chance

1287
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,509
to be hot again,
get my super sexy ex back...

1288
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,845
and prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

1289
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,972
So, yeah,
today was about as much fun

1290
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,724
as a sandpaper dildo.

1291
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,559
(Wade farts)

1292
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,227
#driveby.

1293
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,663
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

1294
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,917
Fucking Wade Wilson.

1295
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,212
I suppose I'd wear a mask too
if I had a face like that.

1296
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,423
I only wish I healed the same.

1297
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,055
Still, we'll put him
out of our misery.

1298
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,431
On our terms.

1299
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,600
Right. And when he heals?

1300
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,602
He can't.

1301
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,271
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1302
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:51,358
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

1303
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,195
I like a challenge.

1304
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,615
But he's bad for business.

1305
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,450
Now let's go find him.

1306
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,368
Oh.

1307
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,871
(Wade grunts slowly)

1308
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,247
Tylenol PM?

1309
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,958
You can stick that
where you stuck the Bactin.

1310
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,586
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

1311
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:14,799
and I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

1312
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:16,926
(sighs)

1313
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,637
But I appreciate the gesture.

1314
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:24,892
Am I crazy,
or is your hand really small?

1315
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,811
About the size of a KFC spork.

1316
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,145
Ugh.

1317
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,107
I get why you're so pissy...

1318
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,900
but your mood's
never gonna brighten

1319
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,151
till you find this woman...

1320
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,569
and tell her how you feel.

1321
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,321
What do I keep telling you,
Mrs. Magoo?

1322
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:38,989
She wouldn't have me.

1323
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,783
If you could see me,
you'd understand.

1324
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:41,951
Looks aren't everything.

1325
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,119
Looks are everything.

1326
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,246
You ever heard
David Beckham speak?

1327
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,456
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

1328
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,166
You think Ryan Reynolds
got this far

1329
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,001
on his superior acting method?

1330
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,419
Love is blind, Wade.

1331
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,504
No.

1332
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:55,840
You're blind.

1333
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,343
So, you're just gonna lie
there and whimper?

1334
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,428
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty...

1335
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:02,596
and then I'm gonna
come up with

1336
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,681
a whole new
Christmas Day plan.

1337
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,808
In the meantime,

1338
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,184
you might wanna
leave the room.

1339
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,271
I bet it feels huge
in this hand.

1340
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,358
Go, go, go.

1341
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,527
WEASEL: So, the doctor says,
"The bad news is

1342
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,695
"you don't have
that long to live."

1343
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,363
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

1344
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,282
The doctor says, "Five."

1345
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:22,950
The guy says, "Five what?"

1346
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,328
And the doctor says,
"Four, three, two..."

1347
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,538
(all laughing)

1348
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,713
Can I help you ladies?

1349
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,466
Oh, I do hope so.

1350
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,181
I heard you might be
able to point me

1351
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,808
in the direction
of a, um, friend of mine.

1352
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,393
Name of Wade Wilson.

1353
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:51,896
Sorry.

1354
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:53,647
I don't know the name.

1355
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,324
Hey, you're not supposed to be
behind the bar.

1356
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,829
I've seen this girl.

1357
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,247
FRANCIS:
Ah, this must be Vanessa.

1358
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,540
I've heard so much about you.

1359
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,167
(groaning)

1360
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,005
Um, sweetheart,
you might wanna look around.

1361
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,217
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1362
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,261
Easy, Angel.

1363
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:25,763
Put the little man down.

1364
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:29,099
We have everything
we need now.

1365
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:30,601
You sure?

1366
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:34,271
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1367
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:37,107
Have fun at your midnight
showing of <i>Blade II.</i>

1368
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,027
Whoo.

1369
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,446
Thanks for
having my back, guys.

1370
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,870
Wade, we have
a fucking problem.

1371
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,789
And by "we," I mean "you."

1372
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,291
Ah, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1373
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,544
Is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

1374
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,755
Yeah, "afrangry", I guess.

1375
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,590
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1376
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:02,758
Fuck me!

1377
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,969
Uh, maybe not start with that.

1378
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,804
(trap music playing)

1379
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:14,061
Hey, coming onto
our stage right now...

1380
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:16,438
give it up for Chastity!

1381
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,815
(all cheering)

1382
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,486
Or as I like
to call her, Irony.

1383
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,655
Better find her fast
before numbnuts does.

1384
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,156
How do you know she's in here?

1385
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:29,493
Because I'm constantly
stalking that fox.

1386
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:47,261
(music fades out)

1387
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,980
WADE: <i>Every time I see her,</i>
<i>it's like the first time...</i>

1388
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,983
<i>Especially from this angle.</i>

1389
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,211
(music fades in)

1390
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,546
(men cheering)

1391
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,716
ANNOUNCER: You can't buy love,

1392
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,510
but you can rent it
for three minutes.

1393
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,721
(exhales)

1394
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:34,224
Ah, you weak motherfucker!

1395
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:35,976
Come on!

1396
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,479
Come on, get it together.

1397
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,522
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

1398
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,986
Here we go.

1399
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:50,199
Maximum effort.

1400
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,828
Vanessa.

1401
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,249
Someone out back
asking for you.

1402
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,502
Something about, uh,
an old boyfriend.

1403
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:29,947
I knew it was you.

1404
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,742
The weird, curvy edges.

1405
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,121
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1406
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,091
You have Wade Wilson
to thank for this.

1407
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:52,803
(Vanessa groans)

1408
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,643
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1409
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,645
Uh, I saw her
head to the back.

1410
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,147
Go get her, tiger.

1411
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,422
(softly) Fuck. Fuck!

1412
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,759
Motherfucker!

1413
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:35,095
-Wait, wait. Let's... Just...
-Cock juggling...

1414
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,180
We can talk about
what we're gonna...

1415
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,264
Jiminy! Fuck face!

1416
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,515
Okay, or you can hit that.

1417
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,350
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Fuck! Fuck!

1418
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:43,187
-No, no. All right. Hey!
-Fuck! Fuck!

1419
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,688
-Fuck!
-Hey, um...

1420
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,691
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Relax. Relax. Okay.

1421
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,026
Okay. I think
that's a good start.

1422
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,195
Oh, I'm gonna
rip his motherfucking...

1423
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,321
-(cell phone ringing)
-Wait.

1424
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:53,780
-Find it! Find it.
-What?

1425
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:55,365
-I'm gonna get angry.
-Okay. All right.

1426
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:57,451
All right. Okay. All right.

1427
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:58,827
Here. This is Vanessa.

1428
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,871
-What?
-No, wait. It's Francis.

1429
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,122
He wants you to come to him.

1430
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,375
-What is that?
-That's the shit emoji.

1431
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,544
You know, it's the turd with
the smiling face and the eyes?

1432
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,047
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

1433
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:11,840
I need guns.

1434
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,008
Okay, which ones?

1435
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,218
I need all the guns!

1436
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:15,552
All right. Okay.

1437
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,221
(heavy metal playing)

1438
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,741
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1439
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,744
We all know
what I can do with 12.

1440
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,247
Hey, hey, careful
with that, Ronnie Milsap!

1441
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:44,498
We're downrange.

1442
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,417
I was gonna spend the night

1443
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,503
assembling the Börje, but
this is holding my interest.

1444
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,382
I told you, we're going with
the Urvaj, not the Börje.

1445
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,425
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1446
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:58,220
Shit. That's all the pieces
in the house.

1447
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,180
Nah, nah... Come on.
Let's go. Cough it up.

1448
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,057
Up, up, up.

1449
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,434
Oh. Down, down, down.

1450
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,602
Fuck you.

1451
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:10,232
.45 cal. I like it.

1452
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,610
Wade...

1453
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:17,531
I'd go with you,
but I don't want to.

1454
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:21,743
Uh...

1455
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,245
Listen, Al...

1456
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,790
if I never see you again,

1457
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:29,459
I want you to know that
I love you very much.

1458
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,214
And also, uh, there's
about 116 kilos of cocaine

1459
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:35,424
buried somewhere
in the apartment...

1460
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,385
right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

1461
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,142
You wanna get fucked up?

1462
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,977
(seagulls screeching)

1463
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,649
(man speaking
indistinctly over p.a.)

1464
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,152
(mumbling)

1465
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,778
Put her down over here.

1466
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,489
(whimpers)

1467
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,785
(mumbling continues)

1468
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,165
Go on then.

1469
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,170
Thanks, dickless.
And I mean you.

1470
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,840
Wow. You're a talker too.
You and Wade.

1471
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,759
I've been trying
to tell you assholes,

1472
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,177
you've got the wrong girl.

1473
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,762
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1474
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:25,349
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1475
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:26,850
Like a cockroach...

1476
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,310
but uglier.

1477
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,814
Now, I may not feel,
but he does.

1478
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:35,776
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1479
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,286
Ripley, from <i>Alien 3!</i>

1480
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,747
Fuck, you're old.

1481
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,248
(cackles)

1482
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,709
Fake laugh. Hiding real pain.

1483
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,211
Go get Silver Balls.

1484
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,463
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

1485
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,881
Oh, like there's
something wrong

1486
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,132
with eating before sundown
or saving money.

1487
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:02,886
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

1488
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:05,305
He's got my girl.

1489
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,890
You're gonna
help me get her back.

1490
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,975
COLOSSUS: Wade, is that you?

1491
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,602
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,

1492
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:13,563
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

1493
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,317
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1494
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:18,402
It's a big house.

1495
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,569
It's funny that
I only ever see two of you.

1496
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,906
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1497
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,828
WADE: And that is why,
in my opinion...

1498
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:31,164
the movie <i>Cocoon</i>
is pure pornography.

1499
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,333
Who brought this twinkly man?

1500
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,460
Twinkly, but deadly.

1501
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,004
My chrome-penised
friend back there

1502
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,673
has agreed
to do me this solid.

1503
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,134
In exchange,
I said that I would

1504
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,136
consider joining his boy band.

1505
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:45,470
It's not boy band.

1506
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:46,680
Sure it's not.

1507
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,683
(sighs loudly) So,
any luck winning Gita back?

1508
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,811
I tried to hold on tight,
Mr. Pool...

1509
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:56,606
but Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1510
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,984
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

1511
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,279
(man screams)

1512
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,447
(Punjabi music
playing on radio)

1513
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,450
-Dopinder.
-Hmm?

1514
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:08,827
What was that?

1515
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:10,787
Uh...

1516
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:16,460
That was Bandhu in the trunk.

1517
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,336
Ban who?

1518
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,173
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1519
01:19:21,339 --> 01:19:22,883
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1520
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:24,968
I plan to gut him
like a tandoori fish,

1521
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,845
then dump his carcass
on Gita's doorstep.

1522
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:29,723
I did not tell him to do that.

1523
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,476
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1524
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:35,729
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1525
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,897
(whispers)
I'm so proud of you.

1526
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:39,149
Drop Bandhu off,
safe and gentle-like.

1527
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:40,233
(whispers) Kill him.

1528
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,319
And then, win Gita back...

1529
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,197
the old fashioned way:
with your boyish charm.

1530
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,698
(whispers) Kidnap her.

1531
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:49,409
He's super dead.

1532
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,911
Whoa!

1533
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,374
I presume a crisp high five?

1534
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,834
For you? 10.

1535
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,005
Okay, guys, let's get out
there and make a difference.

1536
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,090
(whispers)
You know what to do.

1537
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,677
Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!

1538
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,847
Time to make
the chimi-fuckin'-changas.

God damn it!

1554

I'm gonna do this

on your knees.

I'm saving myself for Francis.

1613
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,142
Teabag!

1614
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:11,648
Bob?

1615
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,650
Wade?

1616
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:14,901
Oh, my God,
I haven't seen you since...

1617
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,362
-Jacksonville. Fridays.
-Since TGI Fridays.

1618
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,906
Well, what the hell!

1619
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,991
God, come here, you.

1620
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:23,409
(grunts)

1621
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,079
How are the kids? Good?

1622
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,414
And Gail, she still fixing
that tuna casserole?

1623
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,166
So good.
But bad for the waistline,

1624
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,376
if you know what
I'm talking about.

1625
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,048
Oh! (clears throat)

1626
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:41,344
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1627
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,512
That is so sweet.

1628
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:43,847
Uh...

1629
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:45,014
Thanks.

1630
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:46,432
(grunts)

1631
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:51,354
(groans)

1632
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:53,648
WADE: Yoo-hoo!

1633
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:58,736
FRANCIS: Does he
write you notes too?

1634
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,697
He's such a romantic.

1635
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,532
WADE: Don't worry, baby.
I'm comin'.

1636
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:04,868
Fire!

1637
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:06,536
(guns firing)

1638
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,960
NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD:
Hey!

1639
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:15,211
Climb on!

1640
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,965
(dramatic music playing)

1641
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:27,473
(screaming)

1642
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:34,981
(groaning)

1643
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,833
Motherfucking...

1644
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:07,680
Motherfucker should have worn
his brown pants.

1645
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:11,601
You were right, beautiful.

1646
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,270
Red really is my color.

1647
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,022
Wade?

1648
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,148
Don't worry, baby...

1649
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,484
I'mma get you out
of that shit-box.

1650
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:22,111
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours?

1651
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:24,030
Oh, you never left.

1652
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:26,199
But you did, asshole!

1653
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:27,825
Ah, deep breath, darling.

1654
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:30,495
Oh, wait.

1655
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,122
Wrong choice of words.

1656
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,291
(choking)

1657
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,127
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1658
01:27:38,294 --> 01:27:39,379
'Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1659
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,840
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

1660
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,342
When I'm finished...

1661
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:46,177
parts will have
to grow back you.

1662
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,470
Good one.

1663
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,139
Yep, that was a good one.

1664
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:51,307
Let's dance.

1665
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:53,810
And by dance, I mean...

1666
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,061
let's try to kill each other.

1667
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:56,813
-(grunting)
-(metal clanking)

1668
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,155
(gasping)

1669
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:07,699
(grunting)

1670
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,663
(groans)

1671
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,391
(Colossus groaning)

1672
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:38,521
(choking)

1673
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,951
Fine. Fists.

1674
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,078
Oh, sounds like
your last Saturday night.

1675
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,705
(grunting)

1676
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:22,148
(groaning)

1677
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:35,578
(grunting)

1678
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,585
(Vanessa groans)

1679
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:18,037
Asshole!

1680
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,461
(Francis grunts)

1681
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,547
(groans)

1682
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:37,348
(grunting)

1683
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:47,358
(exploding)

1684
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:58,870
(grunting)

1685
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:10,840
(screams)

1686
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:15,386
Hang in there, baby!

1687
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,847
-Wade!
-I gotcha!

1688
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:23,227
I got a plan.
You're not gonna like it.

1689
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:24,687
(grunting)

1690
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:35,031
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1691
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:38,701
(Vanessa screaming)

1692
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:43,456
Don't worry.
I'm totally on top of this.

1693
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:49,712
(panting)

1694
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,556
Ah! Damn it!

1695
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:04,393
Maximum effort!

1696
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,896
(Vanessa screams)

1697
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:25,373
(rumbling)

1698
01:32:43,182 --> 01:32:44,433
(grunts)

1699
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:47,645
Thanks.

1700
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,277
Just take it slow.

1701
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,368
WADE: Yoo-hoo!

1702
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,290
Oh, my God! That was so...

1703
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:08,499
(grunting)

1704
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:36,986
(exhaling heavily)

1705
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,237
(Francis laughs)

1706
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,905
There are no words!

1707
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,577
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

1708
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:46,329
What?

1709
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,331
(chuckles)

1710
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,584
You stupid fucking idiot.

1711
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:56,672
Did you really think
there was a cure... for that?

1712
01:33:58,507 --> 01:33:59,508
What?

1713
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:01,052
You heard me.

1714
01:34:02,845 --> 01:34:03,888
No.

1715
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,348
No!

1716
01:34:05,389 --> 01:34:07,683
-(breathing heavily)
-(laughing and coughing)

1717
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,524
So, you mean to say...

1718
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:20,529
after all this,
you can't fix me?

1719
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:23,115
It sounds even stupider
when you say it.

1720
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,076
Like the kind of stupid
who admits

1721
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:28,371
he can't do the one thing
I'm keeping him alive for?

1722
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,043
Any last words?

1723
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,046
What's my name?

1724
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:39,215
Who fucking cares?

1725
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:40,299
COLOSSUS: Wade!

1726
01:34:41,884 --> 01:34:44,261
Four or five moments.

1727
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,721
I'm sorry?

1728
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,265
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1729
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:49,892
To?

1730
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,395
Be a hero.

1731
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:53,896
(groans)

1732
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,982
Everyone thinks
it's a full-time job.

1733
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:59,485
Wake up a hero,
brush your teeth a hero,

1734
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:00,736
go to work a hero.

1735
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,239
Not true.

1736
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:06,283
Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

1737
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:08,577
that really matter.

1738
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:11,288
Moments when
you're offered a choice.

1739
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:14,083
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

1740
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:15,626
save a friend...

1741
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:19,088
spare an enemy.

1742
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:20,840
In these moments...

1743
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:24,510
everything else falls away.

1744
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,763
The way the world sees us.

1745
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,140
The way we...

1746
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,600
(retching)

1747
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:34,437
Why?

1748
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,606
You were droning on.

1749
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:40,651
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

1750
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:43,612
but at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1751
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:46,490
If wearing superhero tights...

1752
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:48,284
means sparing psychopaths...

1753
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:50,494
then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

1754
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:52,997
Not everyone monitors
a hall like you.

1755
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,206
Just promise...

1756
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:55,875
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be on the lookout

1757
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:58,002
for the next four moments.

1758
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,670
(whispers) Oh, shit.

1759
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:03,507
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just a boy,

1760
01:36:03,632 --> 01:36:05,676
about to stand
in front of a girl...

1761
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,052
and tell her...

1762
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:09,180
What the fuck
am I gonna tell her?

1763
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:12,641
Well, hmm,
you better figure it out.

1764
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:15,227
-I can't even tell you...
-(grunts)

1765
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:16,479
I deserved that. That, too.

1766
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:18,856
No, no, no,
maybe not the nethers.

1767
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,816
Start talking!

1768
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,487
I'm sorry.

1769
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,155
I'm so sorry.

1770
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:29,533
(stutters) For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1771
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,995
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1772
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:34,872
it's been rough
couple of years.

1773
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:35,998
Rough?

1774
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:45,591
I live in a crackhouse.

1775
01:36:46,842 --> 01:36:48,177
With a family of 12.

1776
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,347
Every night
we spoon for warmth.

1777
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:54,433
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1778
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,185
There's nothing
that we don't share.

1779
01:36:56,268 --> 01:37:00,439
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

1780
01:37:08,572 --> 01:37:10,741
So, you live in a house.

1781
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:22,545
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1782
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:25,381
But, baby,
the guy under this mask,

1783
01:37:25,422 --> 01:37:27,967
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1784
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:33,556
You mean this mask?

1785
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:55,286
And this one.

1786
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:58,581
In case the other fell off.

1787
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,669
All right. Yeah, just... Ow.

1788
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,421
Like a Band-Aid,
just give it a...

1789
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:07,673
Owdie 5,000.

1790
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,841
Wait, wait, wait...

1791
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:12,011
Are you sure?

1792
01:38:13,929 --> 01:38:14,930
I'm sure.

1793
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:26,275
Wow.

1794
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:28,777
Yeah.

1795
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,036
Hey.

1796
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,040
After a brief
adjustment period...

1797
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,500
and a bunch of drinks...

1798
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,879
it's a face...

1799
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,968
I'd be happy to sit on.

1800
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:03,896
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1801
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:04,980
No.

1802
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:07,316
Super-penis.

1803
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:09,401
COLOSSUS:
Come on, Wade. Language.

1804
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,028
Young one is present.

1805
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:13,822
What are you still doing?

1806
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:16,659
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

1807
01:39:16,825 --> 01:39:19,495
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1808
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:21,246
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1809
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:23,207
And you, chicken noodle...

1810
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,084
Nothing compares to you.

1811
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,211
Sinéad O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1812
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:30,089
That's all right. You're cool.

1813
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:31,340
(gasps)

1814
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,592
What in the ass?

1815
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:36,845
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

1816
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:40,265
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1817
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:41,684
For a second there,

1818
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,435
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

1819
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:45,854
coming together to form
one super robot.

1820
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:47,773
There's a stupid.

1821
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,024
Yeah.

1822
01:39:52,444 --> 01:39:56,865
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1823
01:40:00,577 --> 01:40:01,704
Come here.

1824
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:06,375
(pop music playing)

1825
01:40:09,753 --> 01:40:11,547
(laughing)

1826
01:40:11,588 --> 01:40:14,550
Wham! As promised.

1827
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:21,557
(man vocalizing)

1828
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:28,647
WADE: <i>See?</i>

1829
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:32,276
<i>You don't need to be</i>
<i>a superhero to get the girl.</i>

1830
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,237
<i>The right girl will bring out</i>
<i>the hero in you.</i>

1831
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,241
<i>Now, let's finish this</i>

1832
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:40,826

1833
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,077

1834
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,245

1835
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:46,665
<i>Who doesn't love</i>

1836
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:48,333

1839
01:40:53,088 --> 01:40:56,592
<i>♪ The way I danced with you ♪</i>

1840
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:08,130
You're still here?

1841
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:13,718
It's over. Go home.

1842
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:17,848
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for <i>Deadpool 2.</i>

1843
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:19,808
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1844
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,687
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1845
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:26,398
With an eye patch and a saucy
little leather number?

1846
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:28,191
Go. Go.

1847
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:34,406
Oh.

1848
01:47:34,489 --> 01:47:36,867
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1849
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:40,162
For the sequel,
we're gonna have Cable.

1850
01:47:40,328 --> 01:47:42,664
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1851
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:43,832
We have no idea
who we're gonna

1852
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,000
cast yet, but
it could be anybody.

1853
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:46,668
Just need a big guy
with a flat top.

1854
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,336
Could be Mel Gibson,
Dolph Lundgren...

1855
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:50,839
Keira Knightley.
She's got range. Who knows.

1856
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:52,340
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

1857
01:47:52,507 --> 01:47:54,426
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

1858
01:47:54,509 --> 01:47:56,928
It's a total dick move.

1859
01:47:57,888 --> 01:47:59,014
Go.

1860
01:48:01,057 --> 01:48:02,851
(vocalizes)
