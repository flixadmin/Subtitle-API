00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>Previously on</i>The Flash
<i>and</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,000
Thanks, man. We're good.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,600
I'm leaving Central City.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,960
Every hero has their own journey.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,040
If yours is taking you on a new path,
you owe it to yourself to go.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
I watched the men murder you.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,880
Mother ran with Mari.
She abandoned me.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,360
I'm sorry, Kuasa.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,280
When Nora was possessed by Mallus,
he seemed scared of my totem.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,600
You're one of the six.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,840
Maybe these totems are the keys
to stopping him.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,520
I only know about five totems.
Could there be more?

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,640
That woman clearly
has a crush on you.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,120
I thought that maybe if you'd like to
come to the ship...

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
There's no time.
Director Hunter has escaped.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,440
Wally West, I need your help.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,000
BAHAMAS 1717

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,920
This way, lads.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,560
<i>Fifteen men on a dead man's chest</i>

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,640
<i>Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum</i>

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
This be the spot.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,400
Get to digging.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,400
Surely you don't need
for these men to be known

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,160
where we buried our treasure.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,840
Our treasure, my love?

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,320
Ours and no one else's.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,440
Oh, no, no, don't concern
yourself over a few doubloons.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,080
I didn't show these sorry sea dogs

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,120
the most valuable trinket
in me possession.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
An emerald fit.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
For a pirate queen.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,360
How do I look?

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Anne?

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Edward!

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,840
Take it off.

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,160
I don't know what I'm looking at.

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,080
Looks like a hemorrhoid.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
What? No, it, it's Mallus.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Demon horns?

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,480
Anyway, the hunt
for the six totems has begun.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,400
There are only five tribes
in Zambesi.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,680
Each was gifted with a totem.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
And I checked,
there's no record of a sixth.

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,280
Well, the good news is that we have
the Air and the Spirit Totems.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
Kuasa has the Water Totem.

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,480
And since the final totem
is a complete mystery,

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,240
{\an5}that leaves us looking
for Earth and Fire.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,520
{\an5}Now, the Fire Totem,
which is currently smashed, BTW,

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,400
was last seen in
a Detroit museum in 2018.

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,000
Wait, how do you know that?

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,480
{\an5}Because it is with your
granddaughter Mari's,

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
{\an5}Or AKA the other Vixen's,
Boyfriend, Dr. Adam Macalester.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
{\an5}He's dedicated his life to the study
of the Zambesi totems.

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,160
Well, if Constantine is right

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,840
{\an5}and the only thing that
Mallus fears is the sixth,

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,760
{\an5}then we need to get our hands
on the Fire Totem.

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,440
Collect the set, win a prize.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,240
We need to tell Sara
we gotta get to Detroit.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,440
Nope, she's off to Star City.

60
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,960
{\an5}She's been texting some guy.
They're going on a date.

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,800
How do you know?
What, are you looking at her phone?

62
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,360
I look at everyone's phone.
Helps pass the time.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,200
Well, who's she going on a date with?

64
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Obviously it's Ava.

65
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,120
Oh, that's hot.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
What's hot?

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,400
The Fire Totem. Hot, hot.

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
Very hot and currently in Detroit,

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,120
{\an5}so what do you say
we motor off to the Motor City?

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Right now?

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,160
{\an5}I might sit this one out,
because I have to do...

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
business back home.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
I bet you do.

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,120
STAR CITY 2018

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Hi.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,600
You look...

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Weird.

78
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,800
I look weird, right?

79
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,840
I was gonna say beautiful, but...

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
Thank you. So do you. It's...

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Do you wanna...

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Right.

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,120
- Oh, you know what,
- Madam?

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
{\an5}I'll just have whatever
she's having, please.

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,680
Vodka Martini, extra dirty, stirred.

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
- Of course.
- Stirred, not shaken?

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,120
{\an5}Shaken's for lightweights
who like their booze watered down.

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,040
- And James Bond.
- James Bond never had

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,240
{\an5}to fight off a horde of Vikings
or help me escape a demon realm.

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
True.

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
How was work?

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
Work is...

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,040
this is awful.

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
You know what, I have an idea.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,760
Let's just try to be normal
for one night.

96
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,920
No Legends, no bureau.
What do you think?

97
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,200
- There you are.
- Thank you.

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,880
{\an5}I feel like relationships
are complicated enough

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,400
{\an5}without time-travel
and supervillains, don't you?

100
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Okay.

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
{\an5}Then here's to being
two regular women

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,960
on a completely normal first date.

103
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,800
Completely normal.

104
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,320
DETROIT 2018

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Hey...

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
you okay?

107
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,720
{\an5}My granddaughter,
the good one, she's out there.

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
I wanna see her more than anything.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,120
But you can't
without screwing up history.

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,160
Some days, I wish I had never heard
of time-travel.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah.

112
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Oh, I like what you've done
with your hair.

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Oh, really? I hate it.

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
- Good news.
- Bad news.

115
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,280
What's going on?

116
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,880
{\an5}- I know where their totem is.
- The Fire Totem's gone.

117
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,920
Ray-Ray, you go first.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,960
We tried to steal the Fire Totem
from your granddaughter's boyfriend,

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,320
but someone beat us to it.

120
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Damien Darhk.

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
<i>"Dear, Legends, now I have two."</i>

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,920
{\an5}You know, for a megalomaniac,
he has very lovely penmanship.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
{\an5}- I know, right? Oh, and by the way,
- Yeah.

124
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
don't worry, Macalester's fine.

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
Can I talk now, please?

126
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,680
Yeah. You said you had good news.

127
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,560
I know where the Earth Totem is,
or, more precisely...

128
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
when...

129
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,680
1717, Saint Lisette.

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
St. Lisette?

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,680
Sister ship of La Concorde?

132
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
Get to the point, pretty.

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,480
La Concorde was boarded by pirates,
and later named Queen Anne's Revenge.

134
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,920
It's Blackbeard the Pirate's ship.

135
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,640
So, Blackbeard has the Earth Totem.

136
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,040
Well, let's steal it.

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,840
No, guys, hold on, Sara's on a date.

138
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,040
We should probably avoid messing
with history

139
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
while she's still on appetizers?

140
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,360
But, think how happy she'd be
if we had the Earth Totem by dessert.

141
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,280
<i>At this juncture,
the responsible thing to do</i>

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,120
<i>would be to consult Captain Lance.</i>

143
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Who would tell us we can't risk
the Darhks getting another totem.

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,240
All those in favor
of setting a course to 1717...

145
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Aye.

146
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Aye.

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Aye.

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Aye.

149
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,480
BAHAMAS 1717

150
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,560
How are we supposed to find
Blackbeard in this rabble?

151
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560
Well, we could ask a pirate nicely.

152
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,160
Nicely? Wait, pirates are terrified
of Blackbeard.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,400
They're not gonna just
offer up some...

154
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,800
So, you're looking for Blackbeard?

155
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,040
How do I know you's not spies
for the Royal Navy?

156
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Because we wanna join
Blackbeard's crew, you germ.

157
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,560
{\an5}YUNNAN PROVINCE, CHINA 2018

158
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
It's...

159
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,480
it's rather a lovely place
you've traveled to, Mr. West.

160
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
How'd you find me?

161
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,480
By tracking the geolocation
of your MP3 player.

162
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,800
Your playlist consists
of a rather amazing

163
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
number of repetitions
of George Michael's

164
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
"Careless Whisper."

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,840
Jesse loved that song.

166
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,520
I assume that your recent heartbreak

167
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,920
is the reason
for your spiritual quest.

168
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,200
However, with the fate
of the world at stake,

169
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,960
I, I'm afraid that you
can no longer sit idly by.

170
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,280
Well, I, I'm sorry, my friend,

171
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
but my days
of "fwathooming" are over.

172
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,160
Right now, I'm living my life
one quarter-mile at a time.

173
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Was that a Buddhist koan?

174
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,040
Dom Toretto,
"The Fast and the Furious."

175
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,360
Aren't you BFFs with the Legends?

176
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm sure my boy, Nate,
can help you out.

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,440
It seems that my days
of Legending are over.

178
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,520
Alas, you're quite secure
in your decision to slow things down?

179
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I am.

180
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,920
Well, the last time
I was this far east

181
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,440
was in the Opium Wars.

182
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
It'd be a shame to waste a trip.

183
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Fancy a drink?

184
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,320
Another flagon of ale!

185
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,520
NASSAU 1717

186
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,560
So, this is where Blackbeard
hangs out.

187
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,600
- Classy.
- Yep.

188
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Line 'em up.

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
What's up?

190
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,800
Nothing.

191
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
I said what's up.

192
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,040
Fine, you're an unbiased listener.

193
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,680
I want to change
my granddaughter Kuasa's past,

194
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,120
and, well, improve her future.

195
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
So, do it.

196
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,200
It's not that simple.

197
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,400
What if I inadvertently change
my other granddaughter's destiny?

198
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,640
So, don't do it.

199
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,240
And then there's Nate.

200
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
I still have to go back
to 1942 and marry someone else,

201
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,000
so that Kuasa and Mari are even born.

202
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,200
We can never end up together.

203
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,840
I feel paralyzed.

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Every step I take,

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,080
it feels like it could just have
disastrous consequences.

206
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
Take a look around.

207
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Do you think these people give a damn
about consequences?

208
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,560
Take the night off.

209
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,040
A true pirate doesn't live
for tomorrow.

210
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
They only live for the moment.

211
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
Thanks, Mick...

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,480
but I don't know the first thing
about acting like a pirate.

213
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Well...

214
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
I do.

215
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,000
It was just Laurel and I.

216
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,440
{\an5}I was always the rebel,
and she was always the good one.

217
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,960
Why do you look like
you already know this?

218
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,760
What'd, you Google me?

219
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
No.

220
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
I may have read your file

221
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,480
back when you were a fugitive
from the bureau.

222
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,840
And, look,
I know that sounds stalkery,

223
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,280
but in my defense,
I did not see this coming.

224
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,480
Well, what do you wanna know?

225
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,720
Okay. You always seem
so composed and cool,

226
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,920
but you can't be
all cool all the time.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,480
What's the most embarrassed
you've ever been?

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,160
That's an easy one,

229
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
first time I ever had
a weapon in my hand.

230
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
- Lian Yu?
- Nope,

231
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,080
Starling City Elementary.

232
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,240
I was Peter Pan in the school play.

233
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,360
I got up on stage in the first scene,
and I just totally froze.

234
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,040
I couldn't remember any of my lines.
It was like my mind just went blank.

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
What'd you do?

236
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,040
Well, I broke out into
a tap dance, of course,

237
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,640
and then I ran off stage crying.

238
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,760
You can dance?

239
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
Go ahead. You can check it.

240
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,520
I... I'm sure it's nothing,
but just...

241
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,640
it's a voicemail. I'm just gonna...

242
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
- It's okay.
- listen.

243
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
<i>It wasn't my idea,</i>

244
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
<i>but the team has taken
the Waverider on a joyride</i>

245
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,080
<i>to the Bahamas 1717,</i>

246
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,680
<i>in a futile attempt to locate
the missing Earth Totem.</i>

247
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,240
<i>Just thought you should know.</i>

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Is everything okay?

249
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah, totally fine. Normal, in fact.

250
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,640
Captain wants to see you.

251
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
Man, Sara's here?

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,640
Not that one, you dumbass.

253
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,480
I'm talking about
the most fearsome pirate queen

254
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
to sail the Seven Seas.

255
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,120
The Dread Pirate Jiwe.

256
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
She needs to loosen up.

257
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Yeah.

258
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,160
I heard she once cut out
a man's tongue

259
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
for not obeying her orders.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Yeah, and she still carries it
to this day.

261
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
I never heard of no lady pirate.

262
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,240
That's because dead men
tell no tales.

263
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,360
They say she lost her ship
to a Kraken, and in retribution,

264
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,720
she hunted down
the monster's wee bairn

265
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,640
and ate the gupper raw.

266
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,360
I heard she was spat back in hell
by the devil himself.

267
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,880
I hear she be more bold
and fearless

268
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,120
than Captain Blackbeard.

269
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,360
Begging your pardon, Captain.

270
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
What was that you said?

271
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,840
I have it under good authority

272
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,360
we be in the company
of the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

273
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,440
Why is everyone staring at me?

274
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,760
If there's one thing pirates
love more than treasure,

275
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,360
it's a good story.

276
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Blackbeard. He's heading this way.

277
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,320
- Hit me.
- What?

278
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,720
The mission is yours.

279
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,480
Have fun getting Earth Totem back.

280
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Hit me.

281
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,360
Now get out of my sight
before I really lose my temper.

282
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
So, you're the...

283
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,880
Dread Pirate Jiwe?

284
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,360
Welcome to Nassau.

285
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Rory, Amaya, come in, over?

286
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,560
Some sort of interference
with the communications system.

287
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,120
Guys, answer me. Over?

288
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,920
Hey, calm down.
I'm sure they're okay.

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,000
<i>My apologies, but I'm experiencing
a Level 4 systems failure.</i>

290
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,640
Wasn't me. Nothing to do with it.

291
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,840
<i>I believe the fault lies
in our present coordinates.</i>

292
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,760
<i>You did park us in the middle
of the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

293
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
Sailors call it the Devil's Triangle.

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,120
No, the stories of ships disappearing
are grossly exaggerated.

295
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,320
You sure about that, Ray?

296
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,720
The scuttlebutt is...

297
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,480
you're wanting to join me crew.

298
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,760
The Dread Pirate Jiwe works
for no man.

299
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
What we seek is treasure.

300
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,600
As does every pirate worth his...

301
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
or her salt.

302
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
You know...

303
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,280
I believe that you have
this particular treasure

304
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,600
in your possession.

305
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
It's a necklace
with a very large emerald.

306
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,000
That description doesn't strike
a chord.

307
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,960
Let me jog your memory.

308
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
A couple of pirates

309
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,880
after me own cold black heart.

310
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,200
I'll tell you where the trinket is...

311
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,560
but at a price.

312
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm here for the pirate known
as Blackbeard.

313
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,520
I expect you'll be wanting to see
me letter of mark.

314
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
A forgery, no doubt.

315
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Your letter will win
no favor with me.

316
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,160
I wouldn't so much as breathe
if I were you.

317
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,880
Good evening, Ms. Jiwe.

318
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,640
They say the third time is a charm...

319
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,640
but this charm is the third.

320
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
No.

321
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,600
You know, I must commend you,
Lieutenant Maynard,

322
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
for leading us straight to Blackbeard
and his associates.

323
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
- You're most welcome, Admiral.
- Admiral?

324
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,000
I know, right? I look so handsome.

325
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,720
And I'll be made Commodore,
once Blackbeard's severed head

326
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
swings from my ship's bowspirit.

327
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,720
You know, the last Kingsman
o threatened me

328
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,160
ended up begging for his own life.

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,800
Gentlemen, please.

330
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,960
You may continue all threats
and counter-threats

331
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
as soon as I get what I need.

332
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,560
The Emerald Necklace.

333
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,880
Where is it?

334
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,640
That's Blackbeard you're talking to,

335
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,280
- and he ain't gonna say...
- I buried it on Grace Island.

336
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
Would you like me to draw you a map?

337
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,280
I can't promise to make it to scale,
but, I can do my damndest.

338
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
You heard the man.

339
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,760
Let's have another drink.

340
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,640
I appear to be empty.

341
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Give me some of that.

342
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,640
No, this, this is not for you.

343
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,520
Please, I drank Hemingway
and van Gogh under the table.

344
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,360
Cisco gave this to me
before I left Central City.

345
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,120
The only way a speedster
could get drunk

346
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,400
is off of this rocket fuel.

347
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,040
- Rocket fuel?
- Yeah.

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,120
Cisco's a bloody genius.

349
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,880
Yeah, he is.

350
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,320
So is Barry and Caitlin and Wells.

351
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,400
Wait, maybe that's
why I never fit on Team Flash.

352
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,880
And here I was, thinking you
were roaming the Chinese countryside,

353
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,360
because your girlfriend
needed more space.

354
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,800
Yeah, I can do one
better than that, mate.

355
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,760
Both of my favorite prodigies

356
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,680
conspired to have me put in prison.

357
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
What happened?

358
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,640
Well, I lied to Sara, in addition
to accidentally aiding

359
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
in the resurrection of the man
who killed her sister

360
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,400
And Ava is angry at me
for sending good agents...

361
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,480
to their deaths.

362
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,760
Sounds like you're a bit of a douche.

363
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,080
No, no offense.

364
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,560
No, none taken, no.

365
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,440
I intend to make it up
to both of them,

366
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,440
but first, I need the teenciest,
teenciest of favors.

367
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Hey, Agent McNeil,

368
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,160
{\an5}just calling to say congrats
on being named agent of the month.

369
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,240
The bureau's lucky to have you.

370
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm coming for you, McNeil.

371
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
Hello?

372
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Who's there?

373
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,880
Not again.

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,920
This is way more fun than meditating.

375
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know.

376
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,440
Wait, there is one item

377
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,200
we must procure
from the bureau's storage closet,

378
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
and one...

379
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,840
that is very near
and dear to my heart.

380
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,320
We're screwed.

381
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
The ship's electrical systems
are experiencing multiple

382
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,000
unexplained malfunctions.

383
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
- It's the Devil's Triangle.
- Look, that's just a myth.

384
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
Whatever it is,
we need to time-jump out of here.

385
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,960
What? And leave Mick
and Amaya stranded in pirate times?

386
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,920
It's a miracle
we're still in the air.

387
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,240
Well, I'm sure they're having
a whale of a time with Blackbeard.

388
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,000
What's so funny about
getting your head chopped off?

389
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,960
There are worse ends,

390
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,120
like the one I brought on that
fool admiral.

391
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
That necklace is cursed.

392
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,360
I saw its dastardly work
with me own eyes.

393
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,520
Get your hands off me, you blaggards.

394
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm so sorry, Mick.

395
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,480
If I really was
the Dread Pirate Jiwe,

396
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,600
I never would've let
Darhk steal my totem.

397
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,400
What the hell
are you apologizing for?

398
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,760
You're better than a story,

399
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,840
and a hell of a lot more fearsome
than some pirate queen,

400
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,080
with or without your totem.

401
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,080
This man, Edward Teach,

402
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,320
has been convicted of unlawful
piracy and plunder.

403
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,440
Therefore, it is my duty
as an instrument of the crown to...

404
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,040
Watch out.

405
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,680
You're in sore need
of a sword, pirate.

406
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
Gideon, maybe you could
help us settle an argument.

407
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,360
What are the chances of survival
if we stay in the Bermuda Triangle?

408
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,080
<i>Zero. There are multiple cannonballs</i>

409
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,280
<i>headed towards our starboard bow
as we speak.</i>

410
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,760
Sorry, cannonballs?

411
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,200
I thought we were cloaked.

412
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,400
<i>I tried to told you coming here
was a bad idea.</i>

413
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,720
Who the heck is firing at us?

414
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,480
I want that ship brought down.

415
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
Fire another volley.

416
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Aye, sir.

417
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,080
You wouldn't kill an unarmed man.

418
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,960
You're showing him mercy.

419
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,160
Shut up.
We just saved your hairy neck.

420
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,760
Try to keep up, boys.

421
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,000
Gideon, jump us out of here.

422
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,960
My heart is pounding,
my palms are sweating,

423
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,080
and I know that I only have
a few rounds left in my pocket.

424
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
So, what'd you do?

425
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,680
I grabbed a guy and used him
as a human shield.

426
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
And from that point on,

427
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,480
no one would ever play paintball
with me ever again.

428
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,080
Well, it sounds like a hell
of a 15th birthday party.

429
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,800
You okay?

430
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
Gonna run to the restroom
really quickly.

431
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,000
We're gonna need the check.

433
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,720
Please tell me that the Waverider
did not just crash into Star City.

434
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,960
Star City? Is that where we are?

435
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,160
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Well, the good news is

436
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
the cannonball didn't hit
the time-core.

437
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
And Nate made a beautiful landing.

438
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Yeah.

439
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,800
Thanks, big guy.

440
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,720
So, Sara, how's the date going?

441
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,720
It's over.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,240
Come here, come here.

443
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,520
What the hell are you doing here?

444
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,800
Please don't be mad.

445
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,400
You weren't answering your phone.

446
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,800
This better be a life
or death emergency, Gary.

447
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Worse.

448
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,280
A speedster stole my time courier,

449
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,640
- and then pantsed me.
- And then...

450
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,360
did you check if HQ is secure?

451
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,560
Snug as a bug.

452
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,320
Except one item,
was reported missing from storage,

453
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,560
a long brown coat that
used to belong to...

454
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,800
Rip Hunter.

455
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Yeah.

456
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,200
Okay.

457
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,960
You look great by the way.

458
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
- Shut up, Gary.
- Oh, yeah.

459
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,320
Remember when we talked
about personal space?

460
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah, okay.

461
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Come on.

462
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Ouch.

463
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
- You nee...
- Double ouch.

464
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,520
Do you want me to box it up?

465
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,320
No, Gary. Okay, we need to find Rip.

466
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
He's got a time courier,

467
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,560
which means he could be
anywhere any time,

468
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
causing a whole mess of problems.

469
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,400
<i>Time can never mend</i>

470
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,600
<i>The careless whisper</i>

471
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,440
<i>Of a good friend</i>

472
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,720
<i>To the heart and mind, mind</i>

473
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,560
<i>Ignorance is blind</i>

474
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,400
<i>There's no comfort in the truth</i>

475
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,920
<i>Pain is all you'll find</i>

476
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,200
<i>I'm never gonna dance again</i>

477
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,400
<i>Guilty feet ain't got no rhythm</i>

478
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
<i>Though it's easy to pretend</i>

479
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,960
<i>I know you're not a fool</i>

480
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,080
When I left,
you were headed to Detroit.

481
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,920
Yeah, it's a, it's, it's a really,
it's a really long story.

482
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,720
Mick and Amaya are marooned in 1717,
the Darhks have the Fire Totem,

483
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
and Blackbeard has the Earth Totem.

484
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,840
Yes, I just thought it was gonna be
a longer story.

485
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,680
Thank God you're back.
You look great.

486
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
The engine room's a disaster.
We're not going anywhere.

487
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,720
I don't know
who looks more ridiculous,

488
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
you guys in your pirate britches
or me in this...

489
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
stupid dress.

490
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,040
Definitely them.

491
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,160
Hey, I know it looks like a mess,

492
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
but we really wanted you
to have a nice night out.

493
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,240
Yeah, if you really like that
mean Time Bureau lady,

494
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,440
you shouldn't give up on her.

495
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
Look, I'm not giving up on anything,

496
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
other than maybe the idea that
I'll ever have a normal life.

497
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,760
Zari, get the ship back
in fighting shape,

498
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,040
because until then...

499
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,280
Rory and Amaya are on their own.

500
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,680
All right, listen up.

501
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
We can't let the Darhks beat us
to Grace Island

502
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,400
and to the Earth Totem,

503
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
so...

504
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,160
we're in need of a ship.

505
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,440
You want to sail
the Queen Anne's Revenge?

506
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
I told you, that necklace is cursed.

507
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
What?

508
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,120
You're gonna let a curse stop you
from taking the gold?

509
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,080
- Aye.
- Why did you become a pirate

510
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,680
in the first place, ey?

511
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,800
To let an admiral get
the best of you?

512
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,120
Or to claim your destiny
on the wide open sea?

513
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,880
I don't know what's waiting for us
on the other side of this journey,

514
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,280
but whatever it is,
it beats cowering in some alleyway,

515
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,920
waiting for your black beard
to turn gray.

516
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,560
I swore I'd never go back
to that island...

517
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
and I'm a man of me word.

518
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,480
Fair winds, me hearties.

519
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,920
Blackbeard's a coward.

520
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Come on.

521
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,880
We don't need Blackbeard.

522
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,680
We just need his ship.

523
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,040
Another drink?

524
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Listen up...

525
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,480
the Dread Pirate Jiwe is looking
for a crew.

526
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,000
Your old Captain Blackbeard...

527
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
buried his treasure on Grace Island.

528
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,480
So, you've heard the rumors then...

529
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,920
that the treasure is cursed?

530
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,560
But while old Blackbeard is afraid
of his own shadow,

531
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
you men...

532
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,520
you vile and despicable men,

533
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,120
are willing
to face Davy Jones himself

534
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,240
for a crack at gold and glory.

535
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,440
- Yeah.
- Who's willing to join me

536
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,120
as we take over Blackbeard's ship?

537
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
Yeah.

538
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
Mutiny.

539
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,720
Is that what this is, ey?

540
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,600
You'd rather follow
the Dread Pirate Jiwe

541
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,680
than your own captain?

542
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,520
Then I'm bloody joining you.

543
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,200
I'll dig up me chest
and share the spoils with ye men.

544
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,680
Hats off to the Pirate Queen!

545
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,320
- All hands on deck.
- Aye, sir.

546
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,840
Secure the backstays
and hoist the Jolly Roger high.

547
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,680
There's land ahead.

548
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,200
Sara.

549
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,600
Yeah, what now?

550
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,360
We have another anachronism in 1717.

551
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,000
The HMS Fortitude got into
a naval battle

552
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,680
with Blackbeard's ship off
the coast of Grace Island.

553
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,200
- So?
- So...

554
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,840
that is a portrait of their admiral.

555
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Damien Darhk.

556
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,040
I don't care if Zari has to duct-tape
the Waverider back together,

557
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,360
we have to get it in the air.

558
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,160
<i>Well, I wouldn't advise returning
to the Bermuda Triangle.</i>

559
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,440
It's the Devil's Triangle,
and Mick and Amaya are in danger.

560
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Ava. Hey.

561
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,600
Don't "hi, Ava" me.

562
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,800
You stood me up, jerk.

563
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Awkward.

564
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,680
Blackbeard draws one hell of a map.

565
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Dig.

566
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,240
Oh, blast.

567
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,160
I've... I've... I've left me compass
on the ship.

568
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,560
It's a family heirloom,

569
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,760
- so I should...
- Turn back and I'll kill you.

570
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,560
What aren't you telling us, ey?

571
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Well, in... in me haste,

572
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,320
I may have left out some

573
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,760
miniscule details about
the cursed necklace.

574
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:13,080
I gifted it to me love and queen,
the most devious,

575
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,440
and dastardly woman I've ever had
the pleasure of meeting...

576
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
apart from you, I mean.

577
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,960
But as soon as Anne put it on,

578
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,120
something dark
and unholy overtook her.

579
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,880
Totems draw on the life force
of their bearer.

580
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,040
So, if Anne was as wicked
as you suggest,

581
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,840
the totem would've only amplified
her worst impulses.

582
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,720
It turned her into a monster.

583
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,440
How did you live to tell the tale?

584
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,120
Well, I... I did the only
decent thing any man would do.

585
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
I put a musket ball in her head

586
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,760
and buried her along
with the treasure.

587
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,160
That cursed necklace
won't let her rest in peace.

588
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,120
Me Anne will rise again.

589
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Stiffen your backbones, men.

590
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,240
I gotta hand it to you, Ms. Lance,

591
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,600
you take the phrase "dine and dash"
to a whole new level.

592
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,400
Look, the Waverider fell out
of the sky.

593
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,640
My team needed help.

594
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,800
Why does not surprise me?

595
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,240
Should we interrupt?

596
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
No...

597
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,040
but Ava gave me an idea.

598
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,200
Her time courier.

599
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I'm coming with you.

600
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,840
First I have to get
the Nanite pistol.

601
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,160
No, Ray, do...

602
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,360
Steady.

603
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,040
Oh, hello, Annie.

604
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,640
Good to see you're...

605
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
You're looking so...

606
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,720
beautiful.

607
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,800
You know,
this was never gonna work out.

608
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,920
Really?
What, because I'm a mature person

609
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,320
who actually can communicate?

610
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,760
Oh, really? Such a communicator.

611
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Like when you said
you were going to the bathroom?

612
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,040
- What are you talking about?
- You think I didn't see Gary?

613
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,320
Oh, my Rip broke into
the Time Bureau.

614
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,920
I was coming back
to the table to tell you.

615
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,160
- You know, this is pointless.
- Yeah, it is.

616
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,440
We should have never tried
to be normal.

617
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm not normal, all right?
I'm never gonna be normal,

618
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,000
and I'm not gonna be normal
for anyone.

619
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,720
I don't want you to be normal.

620
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
You don't?

621
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Hell no.

622
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
What?

623
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,960
Oh, no, the kissing was great.

624
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
It's just...

625
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,720
We claim this ship
and ye two women...

626
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,160
as ours.

627
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,280
Come on.

628
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Hey.

629
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,360
Let's do this.

630
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,440
Come on, you namby-pamby.
They're mere lassies.

631
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,680
Listen to me...

632
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,960
that totem can burden
even one born to wear it.

633
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,960
I know it must feel like
a noose around your neck.

634
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,440
Let me help you break free
of this curse.

635
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,280
Thank you for distracting her.

636
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,160
Unfortunately,
now I have to kill you.

637
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Surprisingly powerful.

638
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,120
Well, that was fun,
but playtime is over.

639
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,600
Hey, you guys!

640
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,880
I want my totem back.

641
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,200
You fool.

642
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,480
We don't need swords to kill you.

643
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
No.

644
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,440
Good shot, haircut.

645
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,000
No, no.

646
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Stay with me.

647
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,560
Stay with me, sweetheart. Come on.

648
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,320
You're gonna be okay. Stay with me.

649
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Come on.

650
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,280
Let's go.

651
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,360
Don't let her come on.

652
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,600
That was too easy.

653
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,240
You two bonnie lasses
be the best fighters I've ever seen.

654
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,000
How would you like to join me crew?

655
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,440
The Waverider, ey?

656
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
She's...

657
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,400
an usual ship.

658
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,240
But I can think of no more
appropriate vessel

659
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,040
for the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

660
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,200
Thanks for saving me life

661
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,040
and for stopping your bonnie mates
from keelhauling me.

662
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,640
Well, thank you for leading me
to the accursed treasure.

663
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,240
And make sure you tell them that
Captain Jiwe spared you.

664
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
Absolutely. Of course, I...

665
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,560
Fair winds, Captain Jiwe.

666
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,120
Amaya, I am... I am so sorry.

667
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,000
If I didn't push everybody
to go after the Earth Totem,

668
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,480
you wouldn't have lost yours.

669
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,000
It's all right, Nathaniel.

670
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
We'll fix this.

671
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
We'll get your totem back.

672
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,600
My birthright, it's always dictated
the path I choose.

673
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,520
It's like a compass that
just points the way.

674
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,760
It must be so difficult
not to have it.

675
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,000
It's also freeing.

676
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,360
For the first time in my life,
I get to decide.

677
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,520
Amaya?

678
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,760
You know, I learned something
from hanging out with pirates.

679
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,120
They always focus
on the problem in front of them.

680
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,760
And what is that problem?

681
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,800
Do you yield, sir?

682
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,840
Aye, Captain.

683
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
Rum floats were a very good idea.

684
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,160
Only seemed fair
since we missed dessert.

685
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
What?

686
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,040
Sometimes, we screw things up
for the better.

687
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,680
I will drink to that.

688
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Cheers.

689
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,240
It's good.

690
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,200
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about bailing on you earlier.

691
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,120
I should have been honest with you

692
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,480
about what was going on
with my team...

693
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,880
No, no, no.

694
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,400
I never should've put
the kibosh on talking shop.

695
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,160
You're right, it's your fault.

696
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,960
You, oh, man.

697
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,680
Besides, I'd rather fight pirates
with you any day

698
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,440
than sit in some stupid restaurant.

699
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,160
Well, in that case,

700
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,280
I was thinking Genghis Khan
for our second date?

701
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
Done...

702
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,360
but only if I can call you Peter Pan.

703
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,720
- Don't. Don't.
- Ms. Ms.

704
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,360
Okay.

705
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,200
So, you got a room on this ship or...

706
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,840
Let's go find out.

707
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,640
Why do you look so chipper?

708
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,120
Oh, no, I had a terrible hangover.
It lasted three minutes.

709
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,200
The benefits of a speedster's
metabolism.

710
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,080
Here, take these.

711
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Thank you.

712
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,440
You know, last night was pretty fun.

713
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Yeah.

714
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,160
I had gotten a bit lonely here,
I think.

715
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah, I've been a bit lonely too.

716
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,240
Hey, your girlfriend dumped you,

717
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,560
your team treated you like
an outcast.

718
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
It's no wonder you went walk-about.

719
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,640
But the world needs Wallace West
to step in from the cold.

720
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,880
And I know a place
where outcasts fit right in.

721
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,320
In fact, some might say that
they become...

722
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,280
Legends.

723
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,720
Care to join me?

724
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Wha...

725
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,360
Is "Careless Whisper" not
the best karaoke song of all time?

726
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,360
It is the way we sing it, mate.

727
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,400
Haircut, you want a beer?

728
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,920
Everyone's off doing their own thing.

729
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,080
Just you and me.

730
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,400
Sure could use a beer,

731
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,760
even if I am your last choice
of companion.

732
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Oh, that?

733
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,600
I was just doing
a bit of light theorizing,

734
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,800
and then I had a breakthrough.

735
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,680
I am gonna develop a liquid
for the perfect dry erase marker.

736
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,080
Strong viscosity, clean lines.

737
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,600
You're a terrible liar.

738
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Yeah.

739
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,560
It's Nora.

740
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,520
The Nanite pistol is gonna kill her,

741
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,840
and that's what
it was supposed to do,

742
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,680
but now I feel...

743
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,920
Like a badass?

744
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
No.

745
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Guilty.

746
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
What?

747
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,000
- You saved Amaya.
- I know.

748
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,280
Doesn't really make sense,
except that I met her...

749
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
as a kid.

750
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,480
Well, now she's all grown up
and joined the demon's side.

751
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Yeah.

752
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,680
But you, you have changed

753
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,600
since I first met you,

754
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,640
and I hate to break it to you,
Mick, but...

755
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,040
you are a much better person.

756
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,320
And maybe Nora could have
become one too.

757
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,040
There was hope for her, anyway,
before I took it away.

758
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,840
BAHAMAS 1717

759
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,400
Come on, sweetheart, you gotta fight.

760
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,680
Stay with me. Come on.

761
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,560
Look, I... I know...

762
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm the last person you wanna see.

763
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,480
What did you do to my daughter?

764
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,160
Nothing that can't be undone.

765
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,640
I have a cure.

766
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,040
You and your great big heart.

767
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
You just couldn't handle
the guilt, could you?

768
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,200
I've come for a trade.

769
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,280
Amaya's totem, and I will save Nora.

770
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,040
I honestly thought that
would be harder.

771
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,720
My daughter is all that matters.

772
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Come on.

773
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Stay.

774
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
That's it.

775
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Ray?

776
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,200
You remember me?

777
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,240
Yes.

778
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Darling...

779
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
wait...

780
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,440
He may be of value.

781
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,840
Welcome back.
