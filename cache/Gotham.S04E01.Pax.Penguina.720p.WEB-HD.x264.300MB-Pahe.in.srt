<i>Previously on</i>
"Gotham"...

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:06,384
The infected are being
killed all over the city.

3
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:09,645
I'm the one you seek.

4
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:12,025
I am Ra's al Ghul.

5
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,657
This man is your past.

6
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:16,477
Now embrace your future.

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,378
Use the waters, Bruce.

8
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:29,356
You were the one time
I let love weaken me.

9
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:32,446
I want you around as
a constant reminder to never

10
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:34,001
make that mistake again.

11
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,656
I heard about Alfred.
Is he gonna be okay?

12
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:41,236
You don't give a damn
about Alfred,

13
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:42,789
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

14
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:44,023
I know you
better than that.

15
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,085
I thought you did.

16
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,984
Jonathan Crane's father
made a toxin

17
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,135
from the adrenal glands
of his victims

18
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:51,638

19
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:53,929
What do you want?
I'm tired of just surviving.

20
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,101
I want more.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,224
I'm sorry, Alfred.

22
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:02,692
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long.

23
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,263

00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,743
Jackpot!

55
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,115

00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,514
Ah.

57
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,193
Cheapskate, huh?

58
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,234
Come on.

59
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,145
Excuse me.

60
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:03,899
Hi.

61
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:20,176
That's Victor Zsasz.

62
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,178
I know who it is.

63
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:24,321
What do you want?

64
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,405
Oh, I was just passing by.

65
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,327
Heard the ruckus.

66
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,694
You know you can't commit
a crime in Gotham now

67
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,092
without a license
from Penguin, right?

68
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:36,247
Is that right?

69
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,928
Well, we just started it,
so word's still getting out.

70
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:44,819
We ain't kicking half our take
to that little creep.

71
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:49,983
Well... that's a problem.

72
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,319
Maybe you ain't noticed,
but there's, uh,

73
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,897
four of us,
and only one of you.

74
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:57,819
My finger!

75
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:01,811
No license.

76
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:03,655
No crime.

77
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,944
Now, drop the loot

78
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:08,995
and blow.

79
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:11,684
You tell Penguin

80
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:13,749
he hasn't heard
the last of this.

81
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,422
And stay out!

82
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,803
I can't thank you enough.

83
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,803
Don't bother.
Because you see those guys?

84
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:25,483
They do have a license.

85
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,043
Mazel tov.

86
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:30,349
Seriously?

87
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:36,434
Best wedding ever.

88
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,184
You know, we appreciate
all you've done.

89
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,590
Do you?

90
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,762
Three months ago, following
the Tetch incident,

91
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,804
this city was in flames.

92
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:57,152
I came to you and offered

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,731
to cut crime in half,

94
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,629
and I delivered.

95
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:03,950
Violent crime is down 57%.

96
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,247
But now
you want to, uh,

97
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:09,340
literally, unionize crime.

98
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,870
I mean,
but we can't possibly...

99
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:12,453
Quiet!

100
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:25,239
I remember when I sat there,
in the mayor's chair.

101
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,614
I do not envy you.

102
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,020
Nor you.

103
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:34,411
Commissioner of police in
a city notorious for crime.

104
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,271
That's why I want to help.

105
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:41,336
But, uh, we are fully aware
of all you've done.

106
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,585
Are you?

107
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:46,168
What do you think
really happened

108
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:49,184
to those hordes of criminals
who once prowled our streets?

109
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:50,504
I'll tell you.

110
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:51,699
- I hunted them down...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

111
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,559
I made Gotham safe.

112
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,945
Me.

113
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:03,012
But this is Gotham City;
there will always be crime.

114
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,311
What I am offering is crime
in the hands of professionals.

115
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,489
And held to
agreed-upon terms.

116
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:13,025
From which you'll profit.

117
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,442
God bless America.

118
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:18,840
You have a choice:

119
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,598
an era of calm
and prosperity...

120
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,247
or a return
to the good old days.

121
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,265
And they will return.

122
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,235
With a vengeance.

123
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,934
We deny everything to the press.

124
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,223
Hmm.

125
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:40,043
What you need to worry about
is the GCPD.

126
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:44,661
When one of your officers finds
someone committing a crime,

127
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:49,622
if that person has a license,
they walk away.

128
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,387
Three percent each.

129
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:53,865
Uh, from the take.

130
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,519
Two
to split between you.

131
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,848
- Two and a half.
- One!

132
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,950
- You...
- Yes. Fine. Done.

133
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,778
Excellent.

134
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,239
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

135
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,653
I have to go prepare for the
grand opening of my new club,

136
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,176
the Iceberg Lounge.

137
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,301
Good luck.

138
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,442
Smile, gentlemen.
It's a new day.

139
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,125
Hey, Frank.

140
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,827
Morning, Jim.

141
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,996
I'll get you coffee in a second.

142
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,098
Sure.

143
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,100
Morning.

144
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,868
Morning.

145
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:42,976
Everything okay, Frank?

146
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,515
Everything's
fine, copper.

147
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,409
I got a license.

148
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,615
Penguin approved.

149
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,094
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

150
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,434
I'll take that coffee to go.

151
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,961
Man, what the hell
are you doing?

152
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:12,265
- Look, I-I got a license!
- Yeah.

153
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:13,945
And unless you shut up,

154
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:16,818
you're also gonna
get a fat lip.

155
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:24,877
We got a problem?

156
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,987
Penguin guarantees
these numbers?

157
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,585
Mr. Cobblepot
has negotiated them

158
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,155
with the mayor
and commissioner.

159
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:36,484
These are damn
good numbers.

160
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,187
But I already heard
from the commissioner.

161
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:40,320
We have to play ball. What the
hell are you doing here?

162
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,399
Compliance with
the licenses is key.

163
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:45,083
Mr. Cobblepot worries

164
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:46,749
about Detective Gordon.

165
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,206
He has a history.

166
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,380
My men will honor the licenses.
You let me worry about Gordon.

167
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,363
Now, get the hell
out of my office.

168
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,261
Hmm.

169
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,124
Who was that?

170
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:05,670
A, uh, dung beetle.

171
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:07,490
What's up?

172
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,803
I pulled this off of some guy

173
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,385
robbing my corner bar.

174
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,295
You're a homicide detective.

175
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,900
Isn't, uh, a stickup
a little JV?

176
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,405
I'm a cop. I see
a crime, I stop it.

177
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,427
This is the second one of
these I've come across,

178
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:23,647
- and I'm not the only one.
- Yeah.

179
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:26,131
Harvey.

180
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,006
Harvey, we cannot
let this slide.

181
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,186
Word's come down
from the commissioner,

182
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:35,428
you find someone with
one of those, they walk.

183
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:37,146
And before you
get on your high horse,

184
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:39,770
three months ago,
this city was in a tailspin.

185
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,998
We survived because
Penguin took control

186
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,036
of the underworld.

187
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:44,848
I am not giving the city
over to Penguin.

188
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,115
I don't care
what the commissioner says.

189
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,279
What about
your fellow cops, huh?

190
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,031
The past month,
how many have been shot? None.

191
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,389
I know the stats.

192
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,178
Jim, we will bust Penguin
one day, I promise you.

193
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:55,725
But this city has to get
back on her feet.

194
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:56,864
Please?

195
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:58,241
Harvey, I get that.

196
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,146
But every day the citizens
of Gotham look to Penguin

197
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,302
and not the GCPD
to keep them safe,

198
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,106
the harder it's gonna be
to win them back.

199
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:07,067
You want people to trust cops,

200
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:08,732
there are better ways
of doing it

201
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:11,115
than spitting in Penguin's eyes.

202
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,232
You see one of these,

203
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,890
you walk.

204
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,037
Bloody Penguin.

205
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:33,217
There must be some way we
can turn this against him.

206
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:35,333
Oh, just-just stop.

207
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:36,803
Stop right there.

208
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,146
How does this fit in
to what we're doing?

209
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,248
What was the initial reason
that you popped on that mask

210
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,545
and you went out there?

211
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,137
We agreed that
I have to be ready

212
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,068
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

213
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:49,943
You yourself said
there's no substitute

214
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,006
for real-world encounters.

215
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:52,695
But my point is
if that is our mission,

216
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,162
we must hold to it.

217
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,998
My finger was on the button
that released the virus.

218
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:02,264
Oh, I see.
I know I didn't press it,

219
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,459
but I feel responsible
for what happened.

220
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:07,459
And more than that, I can make
a difference in Gotham, Alfred.

221
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:08,528
I know I can.

222
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:12,581
And that is what we call
"mission creep," Master Bruce.

223
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:16,459
You're trying to achieve
not one but two objectives.

224
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,154
So, go on, then.

225
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,356
Which one is
your priority?

226
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,545
It's messy, sir.

227
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:27,833
It's dangerous.

228
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,367
I hear you, Alfred.

229
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,764
But I can prepare myself
for Ra's

230
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:36,005
and make Gotham safer.

231
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:40,176
You have to trust me.

232
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:50,887
<i>All inmates,
last call... in five minutes,</i>

233
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,678
<i>make your way to the door
and the nearest...</i>

234
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,740
This way.

235
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,881
Hey, Warden Reed.

236
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,801
Warden Reed's
the boss here.

237
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,056
Where is he?

238
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,951
This way.

239
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,576
Back when I was
an orderly in here,

240
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,701
he'd always talk about his dad
and this formula he'd made.

241
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,421
Some sort of
scare juice.

242
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,428
Make you see your
greatest fear.

243
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,055
We get ahold of that,

244
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:47,443
we don't got to worry
about Zsasz or Penguin,

245
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,685
or nobody.

246
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,873
What's wrong
with him, anyway?

247
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:55,115
The toxin his father
injected him with

248
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:58,006
overloaded Jonathan's
fear response.

249
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,657
His mind created
a sort of boogieman figure.

250
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,584
Now it haunts him.

251
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:07,928
I find it very useful for...

252
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,399
controlling him.

253
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:17,865
Jonathan, you're going
with these men.

254
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,271
What? What? Wait.
Where are you taking me?

255
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,568
We just want to give
someone a little scare.

256
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,280
Excellent.

257
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:31,771
♪♪

258
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,907
Yeah.

259
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,396
That's all, that's
all my dad's stuff.

260
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,376
Look, I can't be here
after dark, please.

261
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,009
I real... I cannot
be here after...!

262
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,285
You were your daddy's
little assistant, weren't you?

263
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,153
You helped with
the experiments.

264
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:05,946
Some, but I don't
know everything!

265
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,923
Now, you're gonna take
your daddy's notebooks

266
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,798
and make as much of
that fear juice as I say.

267
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,493
And so you don't
get lonely,

268
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,630
the boys here
brought you a friend.

269
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,071
No.

270
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:17,837
No!

271
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,001
No, don't! Please, stop!

272
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,352
No, you don't understand!

273
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:35,384
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

274
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:38,048
May I have your
attention, please!

275
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,094
All the money, now!

276
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,493
Give it to me! All of it!

277
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:46,626
Hey.

278
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,384
You have a license?

279
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,218
Look at me.

280
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:07,983
Fiery demons. Demons.

281
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,789
Fiery demons.

282
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,101
- Demons.
- Demons. Yeah, yeah.

283
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,355
Yeah, we'll catch them.
Get him out of here.

284
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,490
- Go, go, go, go.
- Fiery demons.

285
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,915
Hey.

286
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,477
Did Penguin issue
a license for this?

287
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,587
Why you asking me?

288
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,368
Best of my
knowledge, no.

289
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,437
Then why do something so public?

290
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,273
Unless you're trying
to send Penguin a message.

291
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,804
I hope the message was "Please
send Victor Zsasz down here

292
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:34,219
to kill me," because that's
exactly what's gonna happen.

293
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,016
- Not if I find them first.
- Hey!

294
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:38,852
You asked me to stop busting
crooks with licenses.

295
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:40,516
This gang didn't
have a license.

296
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,259
And you're gonna
find them before Zsasz

297
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,296
just to prove
that GCPD still matters?

298
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,149
That's not thumbing
your nose at Penguin?

299
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:47,269
Fire me.

300
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,243
Hey, don't tempt me.

301
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,127
You got a lead?

302
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,836
The victims,
the way they're acting,

303
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,535
their terror reminds me
of Crane's formula.

304
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,604
You think someone's using
the fear juice?

305
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,688
It ain't him.
He's dead, remember?

306
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,430
Not that that matters much
in this town anymore.

307
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:09,445
He's dead. His son isn't.

308
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,751
Jonathan Crane's condition
is fragile.

309
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,251
I'm afraid he can't see anyone.

310
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,829
Certainly not the two men
who killed his father.

311
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,243
Yeah, so, uh, how many loonies
you got in this joint?

312
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,012
436 total.

313
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,829
We mustn't
call them "loonies."

314
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,265
Course not.

315
00:17:31,628 --> 00:17:34,649
How about staff
that had access to Crane?

316
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,813
Any of them
not show up for work?

317
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:39,884
All present and accounted for.

318
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,446
You don't want to check?

319
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,501
- I don't need to.
- See, that's impressive.

320
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,626
'Cause I run a precinct,
and if half my cops

321
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,024
didn't show up,
I'd be none the wiser.

322
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:49,289
It's true. He wouldn't.

323
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:52,688
Clearly we have different...
professional standards.

324
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,445
Jonathan Crane's father

325
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,780
created a toxin
that makes people see

326
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,830
their greatest fear.

327
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:04,400
This morning,
it was used to rob a bank.

328
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,016
How is that my problem?

329
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,868
Let me explain
it to you.

330
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,506
See, whoever
robbed the bank,

331
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,665
they challenged Penguin.

332
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,543
And all we have to do

333
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:16,727
is tell Penguin
that you're involved,

334
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,715
and he'll send Victor Zsasz
down here to talk to you.

335
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,493
Jim, how would you
describe Victor?

336
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,102
Victor Zsasz?

337
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:26,024
A homicidal maniac and sadist.

338
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,953
A homicidal maniac
and sadist

339
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,384
of the highest
professional standards.

340
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:34,243
So you can talk with us
here and now,

341
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,632
or you can
talk to Victor.

342
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,136
They threatened me;
I had no choice.

343
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,839
We want a name, putz.

344
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,094
I knew it rang a bell.

345
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:50,414
Grady Harris.

346
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,507
Ran a crew
a few years back.

347
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:53,849
Him and his
cousin Merton.

348
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,415
Couple of cowboys
from the sticks.

349
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,594
Grady!

350
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,634
GCPD!

351
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,373
GCPD!

352
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,203
Well, well.

353
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:20,930
Look at what we got here.

354
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:28,563
What's wrong with you pigs?
Harassing honest fellas like us,

355
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,634
when there's real criminals
out there.

356
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,523
You robbed a bank
in broad daylight.

357
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:33,827
That don't make you a criminal?

358
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,134
I'm an outlaw!

359
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,996
Outlaws have a code.

360
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,206
Criminals,

361
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:40,345
they'll take everything.

362
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:41,907
They'll take
a man's livelihood.

363
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,469
Like the Penguin.

364
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,259
And his licenses.

365
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:47,636
But we're gonna show him,
you'll see.

366
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,298
Penguin wouldn't give you
a license

367
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,476
if you begged him
till the cows came home,

368
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:54,711
you stupid hick!

369
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,079
You're lucky
I'm not the Penguin.

370
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:59,055
We would gut you right here.

371
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,837
We're better than them!

372
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,766
Take care, pigs.

373
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,555
They see him anyway.

374
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,391
Hey, check it out.

375
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,406
Ooh.

376
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,681
Looking for company?

377
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:32,634
She all by herself.

378
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,243
Just let me go, okay?

379
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:43,274
Not a chance.

380
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:47,016
Don't say I didn't warn you.

381
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,969
Don't turn your back on a guy
unless you're sure he's down.

382
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:17,204
Otherwise, not bad.

383
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,762
Does this mean we can get pizza?

384
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,066
I'm just saying,
you steal my pepperoni again,

385
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:33,203
I'll break your fingers.

386
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,899
So you're saying... do
steal your pepperoni again?

387
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:41,352
I come in peace.

388
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:46,087
You ladies were not
easy to track down.

389
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:50,726
Then again,
I can see why you don't advertise.

390
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:52,891
Didn't you used to be rich?

391
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:54,830
That was before
your boss stole my club.

392
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,673
Well, you murdered his mom

393
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:00,555
and tried to kill him.

394
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,321
So... call it even?

395
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,219
There a reason you're here?

396
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,946
You know about these?

397
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:15,032
The boss can't have you
operating on your own.

398
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,696
Now, he could just kill you,

399
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:22,958
but he figures it's time
to let bygones be bygones.

400
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:25,001
How big of him.

401
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:28,063
Tomorrow night's
the opening of his club.

402
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,233
Come by, kiss the ring,

403
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,202
get your license.

404
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,243
Is that pepperoni?

405
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:44,305
Goes without saying,
this is one of those...

406
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,049
"or else" kind of deals.

407
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,188
Later.

408
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,610
We got to find a new place.

409
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:57,485
Why? We join Penguin,
we can at least get work.

410
00:22:58,196 --> 00:23:00,266
I came to you because
I wanted to move up.

411
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,423
And look around.

412
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,751
We're barely making it.

413
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:07,664
I'm not working for him.

414
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:09,638
Now, pack.

415
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,184
Detective Gordon.

416
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,469
Bruce.

417
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:29,279
I didn't hear you.

418
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,665
What happened?

419
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:32,735
Uh, nothing.

420
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:34,524
Harvey and I
were tracking a gang.

421
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:36,087
We let ourselves get surprised.

422
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,399
What brings you
down here?

423
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:39,902
I found this
when I was in the city.

424
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:41,870
Wasn't sure what
to do with it.

425
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:43,772
One of
Penguin's licenses.

426
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,313
Apparently,
crime is legal now.

427
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:46,891
And you're going along
with that?

428
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,709
Not really.

429
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:52,715
There's a number on the license.

430
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,492
I was thinking
Penguin must have

431
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,204
some sort of
master list.

432
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:58,860
Connecting the crime and the
criminal to the license issued.

433
00:23:58,908 --> 00:23:59,931
List like that would tell you

434
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:02,447
not only who committed
that crime,

435
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:05,266
but crimes that haven't
even happened yet.

436
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:07,618
Unfortunately, the judges are

437
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,041
going along with
the licenses.

438
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:10,406
I'm trying to track down

439
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:12,801
who in Penguin's organization
keeps the list.

440
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:15,037
It would set off
too many alarms.

441
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:18,610
I see.

442
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,516
But you haven't
given up.

443
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:25,704
You just said
you were out tracking a gang.

444
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,869
That's different.

445
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,259
This gang isn't licensed.

446
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:30,750
But...

447
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,110
Penguin will come after them,
if he hasn't already.

448
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,696
And when he catches them,

449
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:38,680
it'll be more proof that Gotham
doesn't need the GCPD.

450
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:41,229
Sorry, it's been
a long day.

451
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:45,665
So why not use Penguin
to lead you to them?

452
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,368
If I could figure out
how to do that, I would.

453
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:52,259
It was good to see you,
Detective.

454
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:55,048
You should come by
the house for dinner.

455
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:57,290
Yes.

456
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,352
I'd like that.

457
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,868
How about we grab a bite...

458
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,667
tonight?

459
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:11,110
Exclusive, but welcoming.

460
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,371
Urbane and edgy.

461
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:17,032
Tonight's opening will establish
the Iceberg Lounge

462
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:20,618
as Gotham's newest place to see
and be seen.

463
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,923
And you say you acquired
the club from Barbara Kean?

464
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,641
Is that a question?

465
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:26,805
It's just, no one's
seen her for months, and...

466
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,251
Well, Barbara Kean's whereabouts

467
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,969
are not my concern.

468
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,848
This was The Sirens club.
It is now mine.

469
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,376
Mr. Cobblepot,

470
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:36,157
there's a rumor going around
about criminals

471
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,360
being given licenses.

472
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,141
The rumor is
you're issuing them.

473
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,032
Tell me, what is
the crime rate in Gotham?

474
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,719
We're at historic lows.

475
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:46,188
Historic lows.

476
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:50,211
You know, Augustus Caesar
once presided

477
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,368
over the longest period
of peace and prosperity

478
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:55,110
the world has ever known.

479
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:57,641
It was called the Pax Romana.

480
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,977
Perhaps one day,
this will be known as

481
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,532
the "Pax Penguina."

482
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:04,055
That's not a denial.

483
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,907
We're here to talk
about my club.

484
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,285
Your readers will
find this interesting. Ivy?

485
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:17,259
That's Edward Nygma.

486
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:20,368
Turns out Ed had
a very rare brain disease.

487
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:21,787
There was only
one option:

488
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:24,246
to freeze him and
wait for the cure.

489
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:28,188
In his final lucid moments,

490
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:32,751
he begged me,
"Oswald, do not hide me away.

491
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:35,149
Put me out with the people."

492
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:38,774
It was the least I could do.

I have affidavits

No, thanks.

Well, Jim,

498

I'm rather busy.

499
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,932
So whatever your business is...

500
00:26:56,985 --> 00:26:58,934
I came to tell you
you're a fraud.

501
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:01,087
The gang that has
Crane's fear toxin,

502
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,430
they're not afraid of you.

503
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,290
Others will find out.

504
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,016
That's how it begins.

505
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:09,930
You've had a nice run, Oswald,

506
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,477
but it's over.

507
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:13,759
Oh, Jim,

508
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:17,152
it's so hard to admit when
you've become irrelevant.

509
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:20,907
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

510
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:23,071
I'm going to find this gang,

511
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,837
and I'm going
to crush them.

512
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,540
And everyone will see
that it is Oswald Cobblepot,

513
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,266
the Penguin,
who keeps Gotham safe.

514
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,176
Always good to see you,
old friend!

515
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:40,188
As he prepares for the opening
of the Iceberg Lounge,

516
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:43,501
Oswald Cobblepot announced
that he would destroy the gang

517
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:47,353
that attacked Gotham
First National Bank yesterday.

518
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:50,250
He described them as cowards
and pond scum.

Yes.

522
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:02,998
Now, can you please,
can you please

523
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,487
get rid of that, please?

524
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:06,916
What, you and him
ain't getting along?

525
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:08,628
Please, just get rid of it!

526
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:11,409
Listen, I got to do
some things tonight,

527
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,815
but I think you guys should
spend some time together, huh?

528
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:15,081
No, please.

529

No more.

537

I have banished those feelings.

you would be agreeable

If crime had been licensed

00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:14,057
when you came
to visit Alfred.

657
00:35:14,383 --> 00:35:16,585
You were making a kind gesture.

658
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:23,471
You want to talk to me,
come up here.

659
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,823
My point is I'm sorry.

660
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,299
Yeah.

661
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,658
You were a jerk.

662
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:50,526
I saw you arrive
with Tabitha Galavan.

663
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:52,782
I'm not sure
I'd choose her

664
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,841
as a mentor.

665
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,792
Wow.

666
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:59,474
That means
absolutely nothing to me.

667
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,463
Selina...

668
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,127
Oh?

669
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:14,122
You... you want
to say something?

670
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,435
That's a lovely dress
you're wearing tonight.

671
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,370
Honestly, you two.

672
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:27,370
Why can't you just go to the
cinema like normal teenagers?

673
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:29,206
Uh, Master Bruce,
we got a bit of a...

674
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:31,377
bit of a situation downstairs.

675
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,369
What sort of situation?

676
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:38,182
Miss Kyle.

677
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:46,299
For the past three
months, I have given this city

678
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,377
a tranquility
it has never known.

679
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:52,846
Now I would like to ensure
that peace for the future.

680
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:54,315
In the weeks to come,

681
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:55,738
you will hear whispers

682
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:58,199
about what's happening
in the streets of Gotham.

683
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,101
All you need
to know is

684
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:01,745
without me...

685
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,923
this is what you get.

686
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:07,596
Men who want to bring fear
back to our city,

687
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:10,792
who promise a return
to the old days.

688
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:13,737
So... tell
your families,

689
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,417
tell your friends,

690
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:19,784
it is Oswald Cobblepot
who keeps them safe,

691
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:22,693
not the GCPD.

692
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:27,502
You're welcome!

693
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,267
I have my things in the car.

694
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:34,358
We can stop them
in the parking garage.

695
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:36,127
Absolutely not, Master Bruce.

696
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:38,558
Alfred, Penguin is gonna take
those men out and kill them.

697
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:41,088
Undoubtedly so...
But as you said before,

698
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,031
you can make a difference.

699
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:44,679
There is a time for masks,

700
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:47,018
and there is a time
for Bruce Wayne.

701
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:49,461
What's going
to be done to you...

702
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,456
Wait!

703
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:54,396
I want to know what you're
going to do with those men.

704
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:56,792
You need not concern yourself
with that.

705
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,713
Are those men going to be
turned over to the police?

706
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:08,214
Earlier tonight, you thanked me
for making the city safer.

707
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,753
Now, how do you think
that happened?

708
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:15,105
I do the dirty work
no one else will.

709
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:17,011
I understand.

710
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:18,683
But I'm asking you,

711
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,915
turn those men over
to the police.

712
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:23,851
You're young.

713
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:27,555
You have a good heart.

714
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:33,035
No.

715
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,752
Enjoy your party, Penguin.

716
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:40,269
You little twerp.

717
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,107
What's wrong?

718
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,421
You scared?!

719
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,679
Hey!

720
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:27,682
You're under arrest,

721
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,015
by order of the Gotham City
Police Department.

722
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,087
Cuff him.

723
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:39,523
Help me!

724
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,719
Help me! Help me!

725
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,968
Help me!

726
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:45,871
Help me!

727
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,499
Penguin ain't
gonna be too happy.

728
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:51,773
Screw him.

729
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,491
I'm just worried about
finding Jonathan Crane.

730
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,212
If he's out there, with access
to his father's formula...

731
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,046
Relax. We'll find him.

732
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:01,491
I wouldn't expect too much help
from these parts, though.

733
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:05,013
There's good cops out there.
They just need reminding.

734
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:24,304
You have a list

735
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:27,171
of all the licenses
you've given; I want it.

736
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:30,351
I... I can't.

737
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:33,991
Penguin, he'll...

738
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,780
♪♪

739
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:12,202
What about the alarm?

740
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,718
Forget it.
We got a license, remember?

741
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:20,261
Guys, come on.

742
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,866
Oh, no.

743
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:30,015
What the...?!

744
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:36,672
GCPD!

745
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:38,679
Gotham Police!

746
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:40,149
You're under arrest!

747
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:44,039
Crane! You got to make more
of that fear gas.

748
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,789
We got to get Merton
out of jail! Crane!

749
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,281
Crane?

750
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:59,590
Jonathan Crane
isn't here anymore.

751
00:42:04,631 --> 00:42:06,500
Just the Scarecrow.
