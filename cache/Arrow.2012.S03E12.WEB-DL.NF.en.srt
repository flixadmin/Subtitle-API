I seem to remember you being pretty good

Mastery of swords
is more than mastery of technique.

162

I told you I killed the person
who killed my Rebecca.

The guilty party is still alive.

from harm. But I couldn't.

For years,
I believed that justice had been done.

The Undertaking was for her.
I truly believed I could change the Glades...

from happening to anyone else.

that your mom's an angel now.

in Rebecca's...

to convict him...

197

Brick killed Malcolm's wife.
What does that have to do with anything?

198

It is just another reason
for them to share bunk beds in hell.

199

Not that I believe in hell,
but for them I'll make an exception.

as much trouble finding Brick as we've had.

204
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,930
Brick's men have been busy.
They're cutting down cell towers...

205
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,101
...and disconnecting traffic cams
and staying out of satellite line of sight.

206
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,520
Basically, every way I know
how to find somebody.

207
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,232
Well, if the cell towers were down,
how was Brick's crew communicating?

-At the diner. His men, they were...
-They were using walkies.

Do you think that you could, I don't know,
use those signals to locate Brick?

210
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,661
You haven't been down here much.
If they're communicating via radio...

211
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,457
...they'll be on the FRS somewhere
between 462 and 467 megahertz.

212
