1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,921
EOBARD: <i>My name is Eobard Thawne.</i>

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,089
<i>With the help
of Damien Darhk, Malcolm Merlyn,</i>

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,925
<i>Leonard Snart and Mick Rory,</i>

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,760
<i>I've obtained the Spear of Destiny,</i>

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,306
<i>an ancient artifact
with the power to rewrite reality itself.</i>

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,107
<i>And we have.</i>

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,233
<i>It's a brave new world.</i>

8
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,496
Whoops.

9
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,882
The Mayor would like a word.

10
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,017
Miss Smoak.

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,889
Then maybe he should've
come down here himself

12
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,895
instead of sending the bimbo brigade.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,727
Rude.

14
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,646
Well done, ladies.

15
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,528
Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.

16
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,530
Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,154
Yes, but you do it so well.
And with such style.

18
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:57,042
And you've done a bang-up job
dealing with my pest problem.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,205
Though that term might be giving
you vigilantes a little too much credit.

20
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,130
Even a cockroach knows when to pack up
and head out of Dodge.

21
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,132
Star City is my home.

22
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,054
I will never stop fighting.

23
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,681
Sure you will. Kill her.

24
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,018
Get rid of that. Oh!

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,812
But I will take this mask.

26
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,358
So I can add it to my collection.

27
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,159
No, I will not take a seat
and wait for him to have an opening.

28
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,082
He can make time for me now.

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,372
MALCOLM: <i>Can't you, Eobard?</i>
ASSISTANT: <i>I'm so sorry, Mr. Thawne.</i>

30
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,916
He insisted.

31
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,386
MALCOLM: <i>I see your friend is
still putting up a fight.</i>

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,220
He'll give up.
All caged animals do, eventually.

33
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,270
Now, tell me why you've
flown all the way out here again?

34
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,026
You keep ignoring
my requests for a meeting.

35
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,525
Because there's no reason for one.

36
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,908
Our partnership has ended.
You got what you wanted.

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,286
Your wife and your son
are both alive and in good spirits.

38
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,405
Your daughter, Thea, adores you.

39
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,709
Nyssa al Ghul is trapped in a miserable,
closeted life in the middle of Ohio.

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,083
And hey, you can even clap again.

41
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,956
What more could you possibly want?

42
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,083
How about the Spear of Destiny?

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,924
There are still some things in this world
that I would like to see change.

44
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,596
How many times
do I have to tell you this, Malcolm?

45
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,094
The Spear is safest in my hands.

46
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,892
Besides, I'm the only one
who knows how to use it.

47
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,809
That's because
you destroyed the Kalabros manuscript!

48
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,270
Well, it's not my fault
you don't retain information like I do.

49
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,727
Speedster brains are handy that way.

50
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,945
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

51
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,656
Send him in.

52
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,780
JAX: <i>Good morning, Mr. Thawne.</i>

53
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,744
Jefferson.

54
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,325
How are things down at the lab?

55
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,835
There was a minor setback,
but the situation is under control.

56
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,837
You promised me results.

57
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,002
And you will have them.

58
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,460
I just need to
motivate my employee a little more.

59
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,843
But another test
will be up and running this evening.

60
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,470
I hope so. For his sake.

61
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,927
And yours.

62
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,972
Yes.

63
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,105
I don't know why you and Damien insist
on toying with the Legends. It's sloppy.

64
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,065
They should be wiped from existence.

65
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
Well, I prefer this arrangement.

66
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,282
I believe it's called "poetic justice."

67
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,239
And what is this project
you're working on?

68
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,083
I'm a man of science, Malcolm.

69
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,167
I'm compelled to innovate,
invent, and inspire.

70
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,291
A genius brain needs a genius challenge.

71
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,794
Now, go. Enjoy your family.
Spend your wealth.

72
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,466
The world is as it should be.

73
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,431
Be satisfied with your spoils.

74
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,680
The others are having
the time of their lives.

75
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,142
SECURITY OFFICER: <i>Stop!
Hold it right there!</i>

76
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,445
Cool it, Mick.
We already got what we came for.

77
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,523
Just heating things up.

78
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,863
Don't move!
Both of you on the ground!

79
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,288
Mr. Snart! Sorry, sir.
We didn't realize it was you.

80
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,537
Carry on.

81
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,495
What the hell's going on?

82
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,292
No roasting pigs?

83
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,250
No need. We're home free, buddy.

84
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,835
It's good to be the king.

85
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,053
No getaway. No chase.

86
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,348
If you want a chase,
I can arrange a chase.

87
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,307
We could even
get us tossed in Iron Heights

88
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,393
and we could plan an escape
just like old times.

89
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,970
- How does that sound?
- Boring!

90
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,055
Well, we could
hit up the Central City Bank.

91
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,024
They've got a fancy new vault
I've been dying to crack.

92
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,986
What's the point?
You own the bank and half the city.

93
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,522
You mean we own half the city, Mick.

94
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,532
We're partners, remember?

95
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
Mmm.

96
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,786
Seems our next score will have to wait.

97
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,665
Thawne is summoning us.

98
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,500
Since when do we get summoned?

99
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,172
Since the man agreed not to erase
you and your friends from existence.

100
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
Gideon.

101
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,971
I've finally perfected my fondant bows.

102
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,768
What do you think?

103
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,985
GIDEON: <i>Your technique has vastly improved
over the last year, Captain.</i>

104
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,646
<i>These cakes are
so much more creative than your biscuits.</i>

105
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,606
Now, credit where credit is due, Gideon.

106
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,317
Your idea of adding
more gelatin to the mixture was pivotal.

107
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,662
GIDEON: <i>Well done. The best one yet,
in my humble opinion.</i>

108
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,744
It's a shame that
you're the only one here to appreciate it.

109
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,417
GIDEON: <i>I'm sure your team
would be just as impressed.</i>

110
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,919
Assuming that they're all still alive.

111
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,797
<i>Perhaps you should resume your efforts
to send a message out.</i>

112
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,420
What's the point, Gideon?

113
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,133
The Legion have the Spear of Destiny!
They are like gods now!

114
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,885
There's no point in fighting.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,841
Not anymore.

116
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,903
JAX: Stein!

117
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,611
Yes, Mr. Jackson?

118
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,572
What's this I hear
about you taking tomorrow off?

119
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,584
It's Saturday, sir,
and it's my daughter's birthday.

120
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,748
Oh, well, of course. Take the day off.

121
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,550
In fact, why don't you
take the whole week off.

122
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,543
Really?

123
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,212
Of course.

124
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:46,259
I mean, the project is ready
for Mr. Thawne to use, correct?

125
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,594
- Well, in fact...
- In fact, old man,

126
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,106
you will not be leaving this building
until Mr. Thawne sees results.

127
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,400
I've been working non-stop
for the past month.

128
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,610
I haven't seen
my wife and daughter in weeks.

129
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,772
You want to see your family?

130
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,450
Then you will get that reactor
working by tomorrow night.

131
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,070
It's impossible. There's too much data...

132
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,071
Get it working!

133
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,617
Or you will never
see that precious family of yours again.

134
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,164
Somebody clean this place up!
It's a damn mess!

135
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,427
I'm so sorry. May I help you with that?

136
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,396
Oh. No worries, man.
I got it.

137
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,143
Yes, Mr. President.
You know I'll be there.

138
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,228
You know I love receiving medals.

139
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,614
<i>And then golf on Sunday.</i>

140
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,613
And dinner at your hotel after?

141
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,747
All right. All right.
Best to Mel. Bye-bye.

142
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,829
I am so sorry. I had to take that.

143
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,703
There's only so many times you can tell
the President of the United States

144
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,954
that you'll call him back.

145
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,756
- You wanna get to the point?
- EOBARD: <i>Yes.</i>

146
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,386
I brought you here
to discuss a sensitive matter.

147
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,172
And it goes by the name of Malcolm Merlyn.

148
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,882
What about him?

149
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,475
I want you to keep an eye on him for me.

150
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,640
We're not your watchdogs.

151
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,972
What was that?

152
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,483
What he meant was we're not spies,
we're thieves.

153
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,148
Mr. Thawne! I need to speak with you!

154
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,197
I just need five minutes of your time.

155
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,150
Please! Reality is at stake!
The world isn't right!

156
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,829
Okay. Let him go. Let him go.
Let's see what he has to say.

157
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,367
It's okay.

158
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,163
He intentionally hit me in the ribs.

159
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,749
First of all, awesome office.

160
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,009
I guess it pays to be
the smartest man in the world,

161
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,512
which is why
I've come to you for help.

162
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,682
You were saying
that the world isn't right?

163
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,851
Yeah. This world we're in now is wrong.

164
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,272
Reality has changed somehow.

165
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,525
How do you know all this?

166
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,604
Um, well, there are signs everywhere,
if you know where to look.

167
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:09,201
There's subtle inconsistencies
in the fabric of reality.

168
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,527
I call them scars.

169
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,947
You know, like
after you've been operated on.

170
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,540
Well, reality has been operated on.

171
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,458
Truly fascinating.

172
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,706
- Yeah.
- I'm giddy with excitement.

173
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,383
What's that got to do with him?

174
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,052
Well, Mr. Thawne could help me fix it.

175
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,721
Look, all right. You're a genius.

176
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,558
You figured out cold fusion,
you saved the polar bears.

177
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,430
You fixed global warming.

178
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,096
I mean, you made desalination sustainable.

179
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,399
I mean, you solve problems like this,
like, every day.

180
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,480
If anyone, anyone,
can figure out why these scars exist

181
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:52,327
and how to put the world back
to the way it was, it's you, dude.

182
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,123
You know what?

183
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,122
I think you're on to something.

184
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,914
Something is definitely not right here.

185
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,669
Fix it.

186
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,838
- Take Mr...
- Heywood.

187
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,303
Mr. Heywood.
Take Mr. Heywood out for some fresh air.

188
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,597
And, uh, kill him.

189
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,426
Me?

190
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,266
Look, I don't understand.
If this is about my work,

191
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,770
nobody pays attention to it. My mom's
the only person that reads my blog!

192
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,150
Stop talking.

193
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,109
Guys. I am not a threat to anyone.

194
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,902
Unless I'm right.

195
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,615
Am I right?

196
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,160
Sounds like fitting final words to me.

197
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,002
Whatever science or magic altered reality

198
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,801
must have left small scars in my memory
that my subconscious picked up on.

199
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:54,089
So, if I'm not a conspiracy theorist
no one listens to, then...

200
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,597
- Who am I?
- Dead.

201
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,972
- Wait!
- What?

202
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,645
He said, "Wait." I heard him.
He said, "Wait."

203
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,312
You promised me
things were gonna be like old times.

204
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,984
It is like old times, only better.

205
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,441
Central City is ours! No more Flash!

206
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,740
Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

207
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,484
Leave Thawne to me. I always have a plan.

208
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,490
- You know this.
- Well, fill me in.

209
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,998
SNART: <i>When the time is right.</i>
RORY: <i>Ah, yes, we're partners.</i>

210
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,826
Except when you refuse to
tell me what's going on.

211
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,755
You son of a...

212
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,502
Sorry, buddy.

213
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,920
I owed you that.

214
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,932
You saved my life. Why?

215
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,018
Because I'm an idiot.

216
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,147
This could be one of my scars talking.

217
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,354
But I'm sensing
you're telling me the truth.

218
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,986
Let's move.

219
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,771
Okay.

220
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,825
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>This is crazier
than any of my crazy theories.</i>

221
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,203
You're trying to tell me
a group called "The Legion of Doom"

222
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,295
used something called
"The Spear of Destiny" to rewrite reality?

223
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,214
Who even names something
"Legion of Doom"?

224
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,296
- You did.
- Me?

225
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,720
Now, do you only remember the old reality

226
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,223
because you're part of the Legion?

227
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,387
I'm not a part of anything.

228
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,520
I just made a terrible mistake.

229
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,151
Die, you filthy aliens!

230
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,077
Come on. Wait a minute.

231
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,493
- This is the guy who's gonna fix reality?
- Uh-huh.

232
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
Uh...

233
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,498
Who are you guys
and what are you doing here?

234
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,745
We need your help.

235
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,372
What do you got?
A clogged toilet or something?

236
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,753
'Cause, you know, I'm off duty now.

237
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,094
- You're not a janitor.
- Yeah, I am. It says so on my name...

238
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,840
- On my nametag.
- You're a geek, a nerd.

239
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,926
A genius. It's why we're here.

240
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,350
Is this about the dipole magnets
that I borrowed from S.T.A.R. Labs?

241
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,893
'Cause I'm totally gonna return those.

242
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,901
Look, man. He said you're the one
that can fix this reality.

243
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,150
"Fix this reality"? What do you mean?

244
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,239
You guys think
there's something wrong, too?

245
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,941
RORY: Woah.

246
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,032
- That's private stuff, man.
- What is it?

247
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,742
I don't know exactly.

248
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,246
- I mean, I think I know, but I don't...
- Spit it out, Haircut.

249
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,790
Well, um...

250
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,129
I kinda built it on impulse.

251
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,670
You know, like on instinct.

252
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,921
I call it a Trans-reality Multiplexer.

253
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,676
No real reason.
I just thought it sounded cool.

254
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,932
Don't you get it, man?

255
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,725
Your "impulse" was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

256
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,271
"Reality scar."

257
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,937
So, what does this fun gun do?

258
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,021
Theoretically, it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus.

259
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,903
Acting like a Control-Z for memories.

260
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,448
- "Control-Z?"
- Like an "undo" command on a computer.

261
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,455
I was going to try the new version
on my latest test subject,

262
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,284
<i>but then I was
worried it might melt his brain.</i>

263
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,246
- Axel.
- No, it's Tesla, actually.

264
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,964
He looks more like an Indiana to me.

265
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,422
No. He's Axel.
You gave me that little guy for Christmas.

266
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,967
You haven't been
running any tests on him, have you?

267
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,172
What? No.

268
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,177
No! No!

269
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,854
All right. Actually, for it to work,
you have to shoot him in the head.

270
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,055
Why would you say that?

271
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,858
How many people
are gonna point guns at me today?

272
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,773
Oh, my God, you killed him!

273
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,534
You son of a bitch!

274
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,369
It works.

275
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,546
So, Mr. Rory is having second thoughts?

276
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,541
Mick's just a little confused.
I can control him.

277
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,128
- Obviously, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

278
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,386
I just need your help
getting him back on the reservation

279
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,101
before Thawne finds out.

280
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,806
We have bigger problems.

281
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,979
What if Heywood's only
the first of his old teammates

282
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,391
Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for.

283
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,442
I knew we should've killed them all.

284
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,234
It was a dangerous oversight
to keep them alive in any capacity.

285
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,823
Does that include Mick?

286
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,902
At the very least,
we should have wiped his brain.

287
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,737
MALCOLM: <i>Such as it is.</i>

288
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,364
You trusted your buddy a little too much.

289
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,869
Calm yourself, Malcolm.

290
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,043
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

291
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,748
Yes, boss?

292
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,007
DARHK: <i>Mick Rory's gotten himself lost.</i>

293
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,918
Find him, would you?

294
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,088
Where do you suggest we start our search?

295
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,345
You can track him with this.

296
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,389
I put a GPS in Mick.

297
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,763
I don't trust anyone.

298
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,315
Okay, on the count of three. One, two...

299
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,573
You!

300
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,657
I deserved that.

301
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,207
Damn straight you did.

302
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,458
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
you'd all be dead.

303
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,256
Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot. You trapped
each of us in our own personal hell.

304
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,547
Do you have any idea
how many toilets I've cleaned?

305
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,299
So many.

306
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,262
Amaya.

307
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,060
- Sara.
- Hey, dumbasses.

308
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,150
They have no clue who you are.

309
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,318
They work for Damien Darhk.

310
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,397
Oh!

311
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,898
Crap.

312
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,124
- I don't like the way she's looking at us.
- I like the way she's looking at us.

313
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,461
Love the suits.

314
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,725
Get off my friend!

315
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,846
All right, guys, time out!
Come on! Come on, look!

316
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,688
I know this may sound crazy,

317
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,025
but doesn't it seem like
there's something wrong with this world?

318
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,564
- Yeah, Rory sold out the boss...
- AMAYA: <i>To throw in with you losers.</i>

319
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,857
"Losers"? I'll have you know,
in my reality,

320
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,443
you and I had sex,
and we both liked it very much.

321
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,829
- RAY: <i>Nate, not helping.</i>
- Amaya, look at me.

322
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,865
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

323
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,499
Look, this isn't how it's supposed to be.

324
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,964
Okay, you're supposed to be heroes,
like us.

325
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:48,887
Okay. Allow me
to demonstrate my superpowers. Okay?

326
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,677
Knock it off, you idiot.
The Spear took away your powers.

327
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,229
But it's true.
Nate used to be able to steel-up

328
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,774
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

329
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,655
These guys are heroes.

330
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,191
That is so great.

331
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,989
We kill heroes.

332
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,013
One more person hits me,
I'm gonna punch back.

333
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,931
What the hell happened to me?

334
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,858
It appears that after the Legion
got the Spear and changed reality,

335
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,315
they kept us around as their pets.

336
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,778
Yeah, except for you.

337
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,365
You helped the Legion steal the Spear.

338
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,490
Speaking of, the Legion is
probably on their way here to kill us.

339
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,736
We need to get out of here.

340
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,203
Yeah, we got to find some place to hide.

341
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,454
RAY: <i>Your mom's basement?</i>

342
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,047
- Really?
- I pay rent.

343
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,383
So, legally, it's my basement. Kind of.

344
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,673
Mommy makes great sandwiches.

345
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,140
The best. It's the perfect amount of
mayo-meat-bread ratio that really gives...

346
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,557
Focus! We need to figure out
how we can rescue the rest of the team.

347
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,981
And get the Spear back so we can
undo everything the Legion has done.

348
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,476
Except, now they know we're trying
to get the band back together.

349
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,188
Except, they don't know
that you've gotten to me. Which means...

350
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,528
You can sneak into the Legion
and pretend to be Darhk's favorite chick.

351
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,827
It's our best shot at getting Amaya back.

352
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,204
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

353
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:44,248
Well, the Professor and Jax are working
on some secret project for Thawne.

354
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,003
I don't know where the Englishman is.

355
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,001
Neither do I.

356
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,093
I can only imagine
how those psychopaths are torturing Rip.

357
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,845
Gideon, I've discovered
the missing ingredient for my recipe.

358
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,225
Rum.

359
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,858
And speaking of which, I'm gonna need you
to fabricate me another bottle of it.

360
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,023
Ooh. And some nachos.

361
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,608
<i>- I will do nothing of the sort.</i>
- What?

362
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,366
You will do as I tell you, Gideon.
I'm your captain!

363
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,451
<i>Then it's time for you
to start acting like one!</i>

364
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,543
<i>Now sit up straight
and show your backbone, Captain Hunter.</i>

365
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,036
Gideon.

366
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,625
For the thousandth time, I've got no way
of getting the reserve power back online.

367
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:36,050
And I've got no way
of sending out any signal of any sort.

368
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,968
Which means...

369
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,387
Which means that I am destined

370
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,437
to live out
the rest of my days right here.

371
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,234
With you.

372
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,570
<i>While you were
honing your confectionery skills,</i>

373
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,238
<i>I've been working on new algorithms</i>

374
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,941
<i>to redirect power
from the idle quadrants of the ship.</i>

375
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,235
<i>You need to focus
on boosting your distress signal</i>

376
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,074
<i>once power is fully back online.</i>

377
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,905
<i>Now, chin up, Captain!</i>

378
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,245
I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.

379
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,164
<i>I believe in you.</i>

380
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,507
<i>Now, let's get to work.</i>

381
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,839
First, I'm going to vomit.

382
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,760
And second...

383
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,593
Let's do this.

384
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,027
When your minions bring Mick back,
I want to arrange a meeting with Thawne.

385
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,937
And when I say
"arrange a meeting," I mean...

386
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,610
- One between Thawne and his maker?
- DARHK: <i>Cute.</i>

387
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,113
A little mustache-twirly for my taste.

388
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,283
You're really gonna have to
step up your tactics, Leonard.

389
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,661
You didn't think that Thawne was actually
going to fall for that fake meeting trick?

390
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,326
This is not <i>The Godfather.</i>

391
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,995
Although we do agree with your sentiment,
Eobard has to go.

392
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,796
So glad you both approve.

393
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,166
Which brings us back
to our original conundrum.

394
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,342
"How to kill a speedster?"

395
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,174
We found your partner.
And he's got himself some friends.

396
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,301
And where, pray tell,
is your partner Ms. Lance?

397
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,303
We got separated in the fight.

398
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,055
I haven't heard from her since.

399
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,228
So, I'm guessing she's dead by now.

400
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,520
That's the thing about Sara Lance.
She never stays dead for very long.

401
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,816
Sorry. We underestimated them.
Won't happen again. We'll fix this.

402
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,495
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Not so fast.

403
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,331
Yes?

404
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,752
I have a question for you.

405
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,918
Which one is your favorite trophy?

406
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,672
That's like asking a girl
to pick just one pair of shoes.

407
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,506
Oh, please.
Everyone has their favorite kill.

408
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,012
Do you want to hear mine?

409
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,267
Her name was "Black Canary."

410
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,103
I will never forget her.

411
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,445
It was so delicious.

412
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,113
Killing her.

413
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,868
They told me that I'd done it before,
but I can't imagine it ever getting old.

414
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,076
The very first thing I did in this reality
was acquire my magic.

415
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,378
I'm going to miss you, Ms. Lance.

416
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,546
Having you around to attend to
my every whim was too enticing to pass up.

417
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,389
Plus, it's so hard
to find good help these days.

418
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,760
Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

419
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,221
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

420
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,305
No better time than the present.

421
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,318
Amaya. The honor is yours.

422
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,564
Good bye.

423
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,237
What the hell?

424
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,913
Shoot now! Explain later.

425
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,131
Damien, what did I tell you?

426
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,548
For what it's worth, I thought
it was a very good bad guy monologue.

427
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,939
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.
You have nothing to worry about.

428
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,812
Hey!

429
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,935
What do you want?

430
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,486
There's just one thing I don't understand.

431
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,151
If Thawne made this world to punish us,

432
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,120
how are your mom's sandwiches
so good, bro?

433
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,327
Her condiment game is on point, right?

434
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,454
She even had gluten-free bread for me.

435
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,786
Well, let's just get back to the ship.

436
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,164
We don't know where the ship is, or Rip.

437
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,464
Which means our next move
should be to rescue the Professor.

438
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,293
Speaking of which, what did Thawne
have you two working on?

439
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,045
Grey did most of the work.

440
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,638
I just made his life hell.

441
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,516
From what I could tell,
he was building some sort of reactor.

442
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,679
He said it would burn 1,000 times
hotter than the sun once it's operational.

443
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,222
I like the sound of that.

444
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,474
Could be a power generator,
or a particle accelerator.

445
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,069
What if Thawne is
trying to destroy the Spear?

446
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,480
Impossible. You need
the blood of Christ to destroy it.

447
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,403
<i>That's why Rip
broke it up into so many pieces.</i>

448
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,151
Unless he figured out there's another way,
by incinerating it.

449
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,158
But why would Thawne
want to destroy the Spear?

450
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,989
Oh, no.

451
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,245
If he destroys the Spear,

452
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,664
that means this reality
cannot be rewritten.

453
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,547
Okay. We better get that Spear
before he can make that happen.

454
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,346
But, even if we find it,
we don't know how to access its powers.

455
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,679
Rory does. You were there, right,
when they used the Spear?

456
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,229
They read out of some book
called The Calibrate.

457
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,730
<i>Caliber.</i>

458
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,687
Kalablos.

459
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,068
Something like that.

460
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,862
Do you remember what language it was in?

461
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,526
Aramaic.

462
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,237
Dude, how do you even know
what Aramaic sounds like?

463
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,534
<i>Passion of the Christ.</i> Good movie.

464
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,363
Mick, would you be able
to recognize the incantation?

465
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,705
Yeah.

466
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,590
Hey, if they figure out this incantation,
and we get our hands on the Spear,

467
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,208
I want you to use it.

468
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,544
I should've listened to you
back in World War I.

469
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,754
If we had used the Spear
when we had the chance...

470
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,965
I might've been tempted to use it
to change my own future.

471
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,720
Now, we've got nothing to lose.

472
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,315
Marty, Marty, Marty.

473
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,318
I know you've been
working so hard on this project,

474
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,361
and I wanted to come by and say thank you.

475
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,865
But if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

476
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,700
I'll have to kill you.

477
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:36,080
One moment, Mr. Thawne.
I just need one more moment.

478
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,581
There. There.

479
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,380
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional.

480
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,009
Though it may take some time
for the core to reach peak temperature.

481
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,222
Well, then you'll stay until it does.

482
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,435
I was hoping to see my family tonight.

483
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,479
No. No, no. You can't leave
in your moment of glory.

484
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,898
No, you keep monitoring the core
and make sure the reaction remains stable.

485
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,855
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>I think we've got something!</i>

486
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,984
We pieced together a passage
from the Kalabros.

487
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,823
Aka "the Word of God."

488
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,414
All right, Jax. It's on you to restore
Stein's mind before we get to the lab.

489
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,910
We got to destroy the reactor
before Thawne can destroy the Spear.

490
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,628
- Yeah, no doubt.
- And remember,

491
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,964
you guys are going in there
without your powers.

492
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,170
Don't worry. I know that place
like the back of my hand.

493
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,752
- What about Mick?
- Mick's staying here.

494
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,795
We can't trust him.

495
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,424
Not after what you've done.

496
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,054
After what I've done?

497
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,432
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be
walking around like sheep.

498
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,943
If it wasn't for you, we never would've
been turned into sheep in the first place.

499
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,353
We trusted you, Mick.

500
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,981
<i>We can't afford
to make that mistake again.</i>

501
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:54,988
Let's go.

502
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,762
League of Losers cut you loose?

503
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,764
Nobody cuts me loose.

504
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,596
I'm done with those people.

505
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,229
What do you say
we burn this city to the ground?

506
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,110
Knowing Sara,
she's rallied the team by now.

507
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,278
Those idiots aren't who I'm worried about.

508
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,152
Relax, boys.

509
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,863
The prodigal son has returned.

510
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,116
And he's got some news for us,
isn't that right, Mick?

511
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:47,669
Our old friend Eobard has built a device
to destroy the Spear.

512
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,876
No wonder Eobard doesn't want us using it

513
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,045
before he locks in
his own version of reality.

514
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,047
Which, I assume, means erasing all of us?

515
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,590
And your pals?

516
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,045
My Pals?

517
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,050
They wanna steal the Spear
before the deed's done.

518
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,678
I think you can see
what I'm getting at, gentlemen.

519
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,804
The four of us
are no match for a speedster,

520
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,689
so while Thawne is fighting the Legends...

521
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,187
We'll grab the Spear
from under both their noses.

522
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,526
Exactly.

523
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,948
- The enemy of my enemy...
- Is our opportunity.

524
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,008
The status of the machine, Doctor.

525
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,587
Please tell Mr. Thawne
I'm working as fast as I can.

526
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,761
I've powered up the reactor. I just need
to make a few adjustments to the core.

527
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,599
Wait. You already turned it on?

528
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,104
I had specific instructions
from Mr. Thawne to do so.

529
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,847
Grey, we need to talk.

530
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,766
"Grey?"

531
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,609
Please. Don't kill me!
I've done everything Mr. Thawne wanted.

532
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,399
I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm just gonna make you better...

533
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,111
Grey, what have you done?

534
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,115
If Mr. Thawne wants to kill me,
he'll have to do it himself.

535
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,619
Guys, we got a problem.

536
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,083
You got to get here ASAP.

537
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,631
We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

538
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,758
Ray, find us
the quickest way into the lab, now!

539
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,132
Look, you got to believe me, okay?

540
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,054
This is not the way it's supposed to be.

541
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,974
Is this some sort of test? Of my loyalty?

542
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,597
- Does Mr. Thawne even...
- Look, this isn't about Thawne.

543
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,099
It's about you and me.

544
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,767
I assure you, my dedication to Mr. Thawne
has never been stronger.

545
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,146
Did you just press the silent alarm?

546
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,905
What?

547
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,653
No, it's a secondary
radiation sensor for the nuclear core.

548
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,785
Grey, you are a crappy liar
in any reality.

549
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,332
SARA: <i>Martin?</i>

550
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,954
I can't talk any sense into him.
And he just triggered an alarm.

551
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,505
Which means Thawne will be here soon.

552
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,502
Or now.

553
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,753
Well...

554
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,599
Looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

555
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,346
I should have wiped you from existence
when I had the chance.

556
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,309
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

557
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,819
to know that Merlyn was right?

558
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,990
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

559
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,203
Like me destroying this Spear
and cementing this reality for all time.

560
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,326
Martin?

561
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,625
The reactor is fully operational, sir.

562
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:43,505
This is the only reality
any of you will ever know.

563
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,055
We'll never give up trying to stop you.

564
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,932
Well...

565
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,887
If it weren't for your futile efforts,
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

566
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,651
Not so fast, Speedy.
You have something we want.

567
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,737
You need a lesson
on how to share your toys, Eobard.

568
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,240
Yeah, time for us
to get a turn with the Spear.

569
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,576
And do what with it?

570
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:10,080
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to protect you from yourselves.

571
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,366
- With the Spear destroyed...
- Bored now.

572
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,753
Get the Spear!

573
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,359
Let go of the Spear, and I won't use it
to turn you into a jockstrap.

574
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,110
Yeah!

575
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,744
Perhaps not.

576
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,294
Give it up.

577
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,554
Sara. Why do we always
find ourselves in this situation?

578
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,428
Because you keep finding yourself
on the wrong side of history.

579
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,175
Nice work, Mick.

580
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,846
Now hand it over.

581
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,010
Mick, no.
You already gave it to them once.

582
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,928
- You know what happened.
- That was Thawne.

583
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,522
- This time will be different, big boy.
- Don't do this, Mick.

584
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,822
Mick, I don't care what anyone
else thinks, I still believe in you.

585
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,359
Enough!

586
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,822
Mick.

587
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,155
Hand it over.

588
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,618
Like a good boy.

589
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,787
You mean a good dog.

590
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,541
That's all I am to you.

591
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,591
An attack dog.

592
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,253
Now that's not true.

593
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,764
Sure, we both know
you're not the sharpest tool in the shed,

594
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,010
but that's why we're partners.

595
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,723
Remember?

596
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,563
You're right.

597
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,730
I'm not a genius.

598
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,117
But I'm no one's dog, Leonard.

599
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,906
RORY: <i>Not anymore.</i>

600
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:04,455
Well, I guess
you can teach an old dog new tricks.

601
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,091
Undo this mess.

602
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,119
I am sorry about your friend, Mick.

603
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,668
I know you loved her to pieces.

604
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,671
No.

605
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,285
Well, if you want something done right...

606
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,033
Well done, Leonard.

607
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,164
You bastard.

608
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,034
I'll kill you all.

609
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,791
Actually, I believe that's my line.

610
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,175
Now, where were we
before I was so rudely interrupted?

611
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,034
Well...

612
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,203
I guess we're done here.

613
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,062
You know the really swell thing
about the Spear being destroyed?

614
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,025
Now you can't stop us from killing you.

615
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,319
Please, don't insult my intelligence.

616
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,611
Even at your fastest,
you're moving in slow motion to me.

617
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,366
Except, they're not alone.

618
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,908
I say we go down fighting.

619
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,128
You kill one of us, we kill all of you.

620
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,628
For Amaya.

621
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,964
EOBARD: <i>Don't.</i>

622
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,757
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me.

623
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,713
<i>Not without powers or weapons.</i>

624
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,930
And the truth is,
I don't want to see any more of you dead.

625
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,557
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no. Quite the opposite.

626
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:14,903
But because it is so delicious

627
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,904
knowing that you'll be forced to
live your lives in a reality that I...

628
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,243
Well, that we created.

629
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,116
<i>You will walk this world
knowing that something isn't quite right.</i>

630
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,336
That for all your trying,
you only made things worse.

631
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,121
And no one will ever believe you

632
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,791
<i>when you tell them
about all the sacrifices you made,</i>

633
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,131
and how close you came to being Legends.

634
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,471
That sounds
like a fitting punishment to me.

635
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,601
What do you think, Professor Stein?

636
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,599
I don't care what you do to them as long
as I never have to see Mr. Jackson again.

637
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,149
EOBARD: <i>Ah.</i>

638
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,607
Fair enough.

639
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,030
You're free to go.

640
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,824
You're just gonna let them walk?

641
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,328
Be glad I'm letting you
and your fellow traitors do the same.

642
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,328
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

643
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,290
remember this grace

644
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,832
and the fact that I could
kill any of you in the blink of an eye.

645
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,306
My mom's not gonna be cool with that.

646
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,683
Do I look like I give a damn?

647
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,513
I can't believe that's it.

648
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,186
I refuse to believe that this is it.

649
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,193
Without the Spear,
there's no way we can undo any of this.

650
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,654
There is one way.

651
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,069
Time travel.

652
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,649
What do you mean?

653
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,828
We go back in time, to 1916,

654
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,032
and we stop the Legion from ever getting
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

655
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:54,586
No, we are not supposed to
change events we participated in.

656
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,713
And if we do,
we risk time folding in on itself.

657
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,384
Even if we weren't
worried about messing with time,

658
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,178
we can't go anywhere.

659
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,380
Or anywhen.

660
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,260
We don't even know
where the <i>Waverider</i> is.

661
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,350
If it even exists in this reality.

662
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,061
Well, if it does,
there's one person who knows where it is.

663
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,182
We just have to find him.

664
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,776
GIDEON: <i>I've directed all available power</i>

665
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>to the main navigational
controls, Captain.</i>

666
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,446
Thank you, Gideon.

667
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,192
Now, I've started
the communications protocol,

668
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,745
and if I just
splice these two wires together...

669
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,912
<i>Your distress signal will be broadcast.</i>

670
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:40,256
Surely, the rest of the team
must be out there somewhere, listening.
