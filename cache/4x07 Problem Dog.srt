1
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,679
It came out of nowhere.

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,235
You gotta help us.

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,193
Look at all this damn water. Don't drink that.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,517
Ain't no telling if it's gonna be poison.

5
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,195
Nothing ordinary.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,077
How's Junior?

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,034
Exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,312
He hasn't said a word since we told him it was going back.

9
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,910
I spoke to the dealership, they didn't wanna take it.

10
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,599
What?

11
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,833
It's in perfect condition.

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,838
- It's got 17 miles on the odometer.
- I know.

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,999
I spent an hour sweet-talking the
manager down to a restocking fee.

14
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,111
Eight hundred dollars.

15
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,675
Eight hundred dollars? For two days?

16
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,111
Well, the law says they don't have to take it back at all.

17
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,313
All right, here's the registration,
the window sticker, the receipt.

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,750
Make sure you talk to the general manager.

19
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,598
His name is Glenn.

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,119
Glenn.

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,835
Call me if there's a problem. And please just don't -

22
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,917
Don't tangle with anyone.

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,758
Fine.

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,713
Walt.

25
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,591
Shit.

26
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,791
Yes, hello.

27
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,718
I need a cab.

28
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,519
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

29
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,116
I'm at the Pavilion parking lot on University.

30
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,591
Oh, yes, that's right. Just south of the airport.

31
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh, that would be great, thank you.

32
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,428
How long do you think that would take?

33
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,592
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

34
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,199
Thank you.

35
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,268
Contrition?

36
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,630
Hey, there is total contrition here.

37
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,509
There's mountains of contrition.

38
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,917
"Fan-tan-tastic." I will messenger them over right away.

39
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,830
Oh, and about that other thing unrelated, yes, I can get you in...

40
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,157
...but I gotta warn you, the eighth hole is murder.

41
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,074
Oh, yeah. You wanna make it interesting?

42
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,032
Great. Tee time is 7 a.m. sharp.

43
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,196
Prepare to have your ass handed to you.

44
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,516
Okay. Bye.

45
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,949
He was headed for destruction of property.
Since it's your property...

46
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,073
...I sweated him down to misdemeanour trash burning.

47
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,433
Now, the only thing is, it's not gonna be free.

48
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,871
There's a 5 grand fine, 600 for towing and disposal...

49
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,071
...3 grand to steam-clean the blacktop.

50
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,352
So bottom line, your little joyride is gonna set you back...

51
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,232
...about 52,000 bucks.

52
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,670
So was it worth it?

53
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,669
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow. Just tell me it's done.

54
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,836
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

55
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,634
I caught this thing before it got into the system.

56
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,400
Your record stays clean, the wife never finds out.

57
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,434
I've been working magic here. I could at least get an attaboy.

58
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,997
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.

59
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,270
What is it? Fring?

60
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,229
He will see me dead.

61
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,715
And there's nothing I can do about it.

62
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,118
All that's left is to wait.

63
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,993
And we're sure about this.

64
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,033
Because Pinkman says he needs you too much.

65
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,390
Pinkman says.

66
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,469
Pinkman says.

67
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,837
Unless...

68
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,756
...you could help me find a third party.

69
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,030
What third party?

70
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,671
Someone who can ameliorate the situation.

71
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,758
Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?

72
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,916
You talking about a hitman?

73
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,714
Assuming that's still what they're called.

74
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,394
Wrong answer.

75
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,433
That's what the kids call "epic fail."

76
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,832
All I would need is a phone number. I'd do the rest.

77
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,554
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.

78
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,909
A big one.

79
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,517
If you held my feet to the fire, I could come up with names.

80
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,473
One or two guys west of the Rockies who do this work.

81
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,477
But guess what. These guys?

82
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
They know Mike and Mike knows them.

83
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,795
Mike knows everyone who does this?

84
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,877
Who do you think gave me their names?

85
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,629
All right. Okay, plan B. Look, we go outside my network.

86
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,195
Craigslist. Soldier of Fortune.

87
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,312
Let's say we get lucky. I mean, incredibly lucky...

88
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,397
...and find a guy who's not a cop...

89
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,512
...or some kind of survivalist nut-job wannabe.

90
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,792
How good is good enough?

91
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,754
Whatever goombah we buy is gonna come head-to-head with Mike.

92
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,234
And Gus Fring?

93
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,638
Hey, just winging that guy is not gonna
"ameliorate" your situation.

94
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,512
Not by a damn sight.

95
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,871
I've tried to solve this, but I can't get anywhere near him.

96
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,229
You can't get near him?

97
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
Why don't you ask your partner?

98
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,915
Yeah, I saw him.

99
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,354
And you tell Saul before you tell me?

100
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,074
Look, he's my lawyer, same as yours.

101
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,158
Every time I go over there, Saul hassles me about Mike.

102
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,193
He's still scared the dude's gonna come break his legs.

103
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,960
So I give him the latest.

104
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,991
What happened exactly?

105
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,868
I was at a diner with Mike and he just shows up.

106
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,435
They send me outside and the two of them talk.

107
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,119
That's it.

108
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,233
So this is, like, a regular thing?

109
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,917
How close were you to him?

110
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,235
Close.

111
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,591
I mean, closer than you and me right now.

112
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,319
Did he speak to you?

113
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,032
It was over in 10 seconds.

114
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,037
Would you just answer?

115
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,437
He said, he sees things in people.

116
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,712
What things?

117
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,239
What people?

118
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,429
Me.

119
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,837
He said, he sees something in me.

120
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,831
A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us.

121
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,068
And now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as what?

122
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,872
An assistant gunman?

123
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,798
A tough guy?

124
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,798
Does that make any sense to you?

125
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,396
He says, he sees something in you.

126
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,195
What kind of game is he playing?

127
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,834
Does he think you're that naïve?

128
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,109
He can't truly think that you'd forget -

129
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,118
Well, let alone Gale, let alone Victor...

130
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,312
...and all the horror that goes along with all of that.

131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,875
What about this girlfriend of yours...

132
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,116
...and her little brother?

133
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,232
I mean, the man looked you straight in the eye...

134
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,276
...and told you, "No more children."
But that very night, that little boy...

135
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,715
...he just -

136
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,717
He winds up...

137
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,114
Gus can't possibly think that you'd forget that.

138
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,316
- Okay.
- All I'm just saying is that...

139
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,832
...is it possible that he would
think that you're that weak-willed?

140
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,793
Drop the sales pitch.

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,718
I'll do it.

142
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,631
You'll do what?

143
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,311
I'll kill him.

144
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,154
First chance I get.

145
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,235
Piña colada? More like stale bubblegum.

146
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,319
Does anyone want their car to smell
like the bottom of a 6th-grader's desk?

147
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,953
Okay. Hemp? Really?

148
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,550
I know. But you know what they say. "The customer's always right."

149
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,390
Speaking of customer, it's not too late to have a grand opening.

150
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,559
I was thinking huge party, balloons, bouncy house for the kids...

151
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,671
...you know, make a splash, get on TV.

152
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,589
Let people know they won't face the
eyebrows of doom when they come in.

153
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,959
Marie, how's Hank doing?

154
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,358
You know what? He's doing better.

155
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,279
- Really?
- Yeah. He -

156
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,359
Lately, his moods improved and he's like a maniac with his PT.

157
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,515
That's fantastic.

158
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,508
Yeah, don't get me wrong, he's got a long way to go, but he -

159
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,392
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey.

160
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,912
- Hey. Hi, Walt. It's good to see you.
- Hey. You too.

161
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,317
Hey, your cashier here is quite the salesperson.

162
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,035
She just talked me into something
called the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

163
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,232
Oh, yeah, it's very important to maintain your clear coat.

164
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,839
Boy, once that's goes -

165
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,359
Oh, yeah.

166
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,312
Hi.

167
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,479
Hi.

168
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,070
Bogdan was averaging 19 cars during rush hour...

169
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,829
...and we are already up to 22. Twenty-two actual cars.

170
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,875
Last night, I deposited $3800.

171
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,870
Jesus.

172
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,469
How much is that?

173
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,673
Two hundred seventy-four thousand dollars, give or take.

174
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,792
- Give or take?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,191
I haven't counted it.

176
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,958
Wait.

177
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,634
Two hundred and seventy-four -

178
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,592
And this is how often?

179
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,438
Every two weeks.

180
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,315
Thursday's good for a drop-off?

181
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,078
But, Walt...

182
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:10,430
...are you telling me you make $7,125,000 a year?

183
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,793
Seven and a half even, before expenses.

184
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,754
But I can't -

185
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,792
- This is too much.
- So it's more...

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,070
...than you thought...

187
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,874
...and this is somehow bad news?

188
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,275
No, that's not the point.

189
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,836
I mean, there's no car wash in the world...

190
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,996
...that could do this kind of business.

191
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,193
I mean, this is nine months work here, minimum.

192
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,868
Seven million? That could take years.

193
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,913
So set some aside. Save it for a rainy day.

194
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,714
Save it? Where? Save it where?

195
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,118
I can't go to the bank with it. I sure can't leave it here.

196
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,751
Wait a minute.

197
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,359
Is this all 50s?

198
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,553
- Who pays for a car wash with a 50?
- Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

199
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,797
I was under the impression that you had this under control.

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,833
I just didn't expect this amount of money.

201
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,031
- The 50s are gonna be a problem.
- That's what this is, problem solving.

202
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,351
This is a simple division of labour.

203
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,552
I bring money. You launder money. This is what you wanted.

204
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,990
I never wanted any of this.

205
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,958
I've gotta go.

206
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,754
If you want out, just say that you want out.

207
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,358
Okay, then.

208
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,952
You're telling me you made this in the lab?

209
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,913
Why not?

210
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,193
Making it in his own lab seemed appropriate.

211
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,913
There's not much of it.

212
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,992
We had more for Tuco.

213
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,758
It's enough.

214
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,678
This is still the best way.

215
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,077
You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.

216
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,759
But with this?

217
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,076
You slip it into his food or drink.

218
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,430
There shouldn't be any taste or smell.

219
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,154
Thirty-six hours later...

220
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,396
A man his age, working as hard as he does...

221
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,955
...no one will be surprised.

222
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,671
What about Mike?

223
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,157
Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be.

224
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,755
Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.

225
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,993
I don't know when I'm gonna see Gus again.

226
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,116
I mean, if ever.

227
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,917
Keep it with you.

228
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,869
When you have the opportunity...

229
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,753
...be ready.

230
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,196
What if they search me?

231
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,430
Will they do that?

232
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,472
It's the wrong way around.

233
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,310
It's my lucky cigarette.

234
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,553
Well...

235
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,639
...whatever you do, don't smoke it.

236
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,396
You know they have a drive-thru, right?

237
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,238
No, this is good.

238
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,830
Could use the exercise, get the blood pumping.

239
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,634
Don't worry, you're not gonna have to pick me up.

240
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,594
Might take me a while, but I'll get there.

241
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,719
Jesus, ain't we a pair.

242
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,753
Hey, you must really like chicken.

243
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,108
V-8, 470 horses, 20-inch rims, satellite radio, Bluetooth.

244
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,517
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

245
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,915
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean, on a lark?

246
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,353
Spur of the moment, your dad ups and
buys you a brand-new Challenger?

247
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,438
Yeah, I barely got it around the block...

248
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,918
...and Mom said we couldn't afford it so they took it back.

249
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,476
Do you know how long I had it? Fifteen hours.

250
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,433
Well, hey, buddy, let me tell you something.

251
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,913
When I was your age...

252
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,352
...I'd have given my left nut to
drive a car like that for 15 minutes.

253
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,790
Seriously, how does that happen?

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,959
Well, we were looking at used cars and I kind of -

255
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,390
You guilted him into it. I know. I hear you.

256
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,115
You pulled the old, "Poor little me and my troubles," am I right?

257
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,278
- Maybe.
- You flew too close to the sun.

258
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,358
You'd let him buy you a clunker, you'd be driving now...

259
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,869
...instead of borrowing mom's hooptie.

260
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,035
Agent Schrader.

261
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,993
- How are you doing?
- Well, thank you. Good to see you.

262
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,952
Do you remember Mr. Fring?

263
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,628
- How are you?
- Well. Nice to see you again.

264
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,513
It's a pleasure to see you. You're looking well.

265
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,669
Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up
to clean living and vitamin pills.

266
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,440
I must apologise. If I had seen you come in...

267
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,790
...there'd have been no question of accepting your money.

268
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,036
In the future, feel free to ask for me.

269
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,074
A DEA hero should never have to pay for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.

270
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,829
No kidding? Well, I'll take you up on that, for sure.

271
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,792
And how are your mother and father?

272
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,319
They're good.

273
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,431
- The chicken is great.
- Thank you.

274
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,518
If ever you're interested in rewarding part-time work...

275
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,439
...perhaps something after school? My door is open.

276
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,073
Sounds good.

277
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,355
I don't know about this one. He might eat up all your profits.

278
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,117
I'll let you finish your meal. Can I get you anything else?

279
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,153
- A refill, perhaps?
- No, thank you. I'm good.

280
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,069
- Sure. Take a Diet Coke, thank you.
- Of course.

281
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,112
So where are we going?

282
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,598
Oh, big doings today.

283
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,238
The order of the day is eyes open, mouth shut.

284
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,993
What's up?

285
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,998
Test.

286
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,511
Test.

287
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,988
You got me?

288
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,792
Count off.

289
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,633
Let's go.

290
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,910
Right here. Leave the wrap on, please.

291
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,236
You know how to make coffee?

292
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,675
Sure.

293
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,598
There you go.

294
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,114
- You want a rundown?
- Please.

295
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,790
Three guys up at the gate, two visible, one in the blind.

296
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,709
We got five guys down here with a backup out of sight.

297
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,039
I got Tyrus down in the tree line with a Barrett. 50.

298
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,233
Planted him there last night, in case we had any early arrivals.

299
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,952
I don't have an extra holster.

300
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,594
Stick this in your pocket. Keep it out of sight.

301
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,272
If you're gonna be here today, you're gonna have a gun.

302
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,589
It's loaded?

303
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,232
I don't wanna see that in your hand unless you see me with mine.

304
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,670
Emergency only.

305
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,636
First car is coming.

306
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,759
All right, what's the order of the day?

307
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,196
Eyes open, mouth shut.

308
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,751
A lot of guns.

309
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,758
Nobody's asking you to give up yours.

310
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,832
You wanna sweep the place before you bring in your guys?

311
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,351
I am the guy.

312
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,516
All right, then.

313
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,918
Welcome.

314
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,077
Where is the rest of your party?

315
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,239
I am the only one coming.

316
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,193
And why is that?

317
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,072
My employers feel I can adequately represent their interests.

318
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,399
Please, sit.

319
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,353
This is my offer.

320
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,231
In consideration of our previous relationship...

321
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,432
...I will make a one-time payment...

322
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,792
...of 50 million U.S. dollars.

323
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,035
In return our business is concluded.

324
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,436
No further payments. No further contact.

325
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,353
An absolute severance.

326
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,030
You have no response?

327
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,713
Yes or no?

328
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,189
You know what the Cartel wants.

329
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,070
Anything else would be a waste of time.

330
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,358
Is it to be yes... or no?

331
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,919
A hard way to begin a negotiation.

332
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,635
This is not a negotiation.

333
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,913
You got something of mine?

334
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,156
Glove box.

335
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,314
Figure I better teach you how to shoot.

336
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,431
Could be things are gonna get hairy.

337
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,117
What is this?

338
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,677
I mean, you're giving me a gun...

339
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,475
...and now I'm, like, part of the team or whatever?

340
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,553
He said he sees something in me.

341
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,835
Like what?

342
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,360
If I had to put it in a word...

343
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,795
...I'd guess loyalty.

344
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,752
Loyalty.

345
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,797
Only maybe you got it for the wrong guy.

346
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,678
Jesse?

347
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,278
- Hey.
- Hey.

348
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,311
Long time, no see.

349
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,472
How you doing?

350
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,352
Yeah, you know...

351
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,514
- ...good.
- Good.

352
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,438
Good.

353
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,316
Okay, we're gonna get started. You coming in?

354
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,230
So the truth is, we can't change the past, what's done is done.

355
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,716
We've gotta own our actions, but putting ourselves on trial...

356
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,674
...acting as our own judge,
jury and executioner, it's not the answer.

357
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,075
A lot of the time, all that judging does...

358
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,478
...is just ensure that we're gonna repeat the cycle.

359
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,352
Right?

360
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,638
"I'm such an asshole.

361
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,469
It's totally hopeless, what's the point?

362
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,432
I think I'll have a hit."

363
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,795
Jesse...

364
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,108
...what's going on with you these days?

365
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,193
I went back to the crystal.

366
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,391
You sober now?

367
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,989
Yeah.

368
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,758
Four days.

369
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,949
Big whoop, right?

370
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,832
Hey, four days is four days.

371
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,359
You're here.

372
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,838
You still...

373
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,754
...working at the laundry?

374
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,029
How are things there?

375
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,475
Sucks ass.

376
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,038
Anything you wanna talk about?

377
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,990
A couple of weeks back...

378
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,597
...I killed a dog.

379
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,632
You hit it with your car?

380
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,992
No.

381
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,116
I put him down.

382
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,911
I watched him go.

383
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,153
I was looking him straight in the eye.

384
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,796
He didn't know what was happening. He didn't know why. He -

385
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,992
He was just scared.

386
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,872
And then he was gone.

387
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,471
He was suffering.

388
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,318
It was a kindness.

389
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,028
No, he wasn't sick.

390
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,590
No. He was just, like -

391
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,837
I don't know, like, a...

392
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,756
...problem dog.

393
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,678
What did he do?

394
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,835
Bite someone?

395
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,831
No, this dog never -

396
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,429
Never bit anybody.

397
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,115
You pick up the rock, you go right to the dark side.

398
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,349
Anything can happen.

399
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,755
It ain't no rock that made me do it.

400
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,269
What was the problem? Why did you kill him?

401
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,596
Watch the crosstalk, please.

402
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,590
Maybe it's not the details that matter, right?

403
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,395
How do you feel about what you did, Jesse?

404
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,236
I don't know.

405
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,398
Who cares how you feel?

406
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,230
What kind of person kills a dog for no reason?

407
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,429
Colleen.

408
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,200
Put an ad in the paper, drop him off at a shelter.

409
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,359
You don't just sit there and talk about
killing a helpless, innocent animal.

410
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,317
We're not here to sit in judgement.

411
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,872
Why not?

412
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,640
Why not? Maybe she's right.

413
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,152
Maybe I should have put it in the paper.
I should've done something different.

414
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,312
The thing is, if you just do stuff and nothing happens...

415
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,910
...what's it all mean?

416
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,708
What's the point?

417
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,798
Oh, right, this whole thing is about self-acceptance.

418
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,117
Kicking yourself doesn't give meaning to anything.

419
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,279
So I should stop judging...

420
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,235
- ...and accept?
- It's a start.

421
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,954
So no matter what I do...

422
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,390
...hooray for me because I'm a great guy?

423
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,556
It's all good?

424
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,029
No matter how many dogs I kill, I just,
what, do an inventory and accept?

425
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,549
I mean, you back your truck over
your own kid and you, like, accept?

426
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,750
- What a load of crap?
- Hey, Jesse.

427
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,075
I know you're in pain.

428
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,236
No, you know what?

429
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,512
Why I'm here in the first place?

430
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,879
Is to sell you meth.

431
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,351
You're nothing to me but customers!

432
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,078
I made you my bitch.

433
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,555
You okay with that?

434
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,070
You accept?

435
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,068
No.

436
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,551
About time.

437
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,315
Jesse.

438
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,794
Jesse.

439
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,389
Bring a light over here, will you?

440
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,469
Do you see any residue there?

441
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,230
- Where?
- Here. On the bottom, right there.

442
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,358
It's been a week. What's going on?

443
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,150
I haven't seen him.

444
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,548
I didn't think so. But I'll just give it another shot anyway.

445
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,594
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy. Look at that.

446
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,236
Graduated to doorman. Finally found your calling.

447
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,237
Oh, little whiskers, Marie.

448
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,395
What did you do?

449
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,639
Show your barber a picture of a dog's
ass and said, "I'll take that"?

450
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,989
Charming as usual.

451
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,315
Welcome back.

452
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,636
- Looking good, Marie.
- Thanks, Steve.

453
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,799
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- He's fine. We can take it from here.

454
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,877
- Yeah.
- If you wanna hold his elbow.

455
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,959
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me. I'm good. I'm good.

456
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,075
Hey.

457
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,953
Good luck.

458
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,070
Let's go, we're running late. Come on.

459
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,156
Hank, seeing you walk in here,
I can't tell you what that means to all of us.

460
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,352
Your progress, it's incredible.

461
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,711
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living and vitamin pills.

462
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,354
- Steve tell you his news?
- What?

463
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,516
Finally got your period?

464
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,478
I made GS-14.

465
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,272
Wow, that's all right, man.

466
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,199
Next stop: Washington, D.C. Sitting behind a desk...

467
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,709
...papers piled so high, you can't see over them.

468
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,638
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

469
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,751
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.

470
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,279
Thanks.

471
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,675
Steve said you might have something for us.

472
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,713
Yeah, maybe. You guys are gonna have to tell me.

473
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,790
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

474
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,194
APD detective?

475
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,516
Yeah, well, he's working on a murder case.

476
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,029
The victim's a 34-year-old male Caucasian...

477
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,231
...by the name of Gale Boetticher.

478
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,557
One night last month, Boetticher opens the door...

479
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,999
...takes a bullet to the face from a person or persons unknown.

480
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,909
Now, this Gale Boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius.

481
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,998
I mean, he's got degrees up the wazoo, right?

482
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,273
And, well, as you might expect, he's a nerd's nerd.

483
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,199
Vegan, sandals and socks kind of guy.

484
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,394
As it turns out, he's also an A-number-one meth cook.

485
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,469
And what caught my eye is his speciality product is blue.

486
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,638
So, what are you thinking?

487
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,114
This is your Heisenberg?

488
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,796
No. What I think we got here is Heisenberg's former cook...

489
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,390
...and maybe a line on Heisenberg himself.

490
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,830
Anyway, lo and behold, amidst all the hippie-dippy nonsense...

491
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,799
...I find this.

492
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,830
Now, this here, I do a little Google-fu...

493
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,431
...and I realise it's a parts number specifically for this baby.

494
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,678
That there is a high-volume HEPA industrial air filtration system.

495
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,638
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.

496
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,913
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant or microchip factory...

497
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,955
...or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border.

498
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,392
Okay.

499
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,955
So this little dingus here is manufactured...

500
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,029
Madrigal Electromotive.

501
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,631
I call their Houston office, I get through
to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.

502
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,719
I use the Schrader sweet-talk.
Before you know it, she's pulling files.

503
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,074
Six months ago, one of these systems
was shipped to a depot here in ABQ.

504
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,191
Who signed for it?

505
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,675
Gale Boetticher.

506
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,514
So I asked my new girlfriend,
"Who paid for it?" And she says, "Nobody."

507
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,428
They have no record that anybody actually paid for this thing.

508
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,916
So I go back and push more and before you know it...

509
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,076
...the temp's gone, there's no address.

510
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,068
I'm talking to some snot-nose lawyer
who's asking me for my badge number.

511
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,032
Brick wall.

512
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,799
So I take a peek into Madrigal Electromotive.

513
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,434
Now, Madrigal is based in Hanover, Germany...

514
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,234
...but they're what they call "highly diversified."

515
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,035
Industrial equipment, global shipping, major construction...

516
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,313
...and a tiny little foothold in American fast food...

517
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,795
...specifically a local chain.

518
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,912
Pollos Hermanos.

519
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,355
Okay. So what, right? Boetticher's dead.

520
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,393
I got no line on who's been bankrolling him...

521
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,397
...or where his lab was.

522
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,750
The whole thing's a snipe hunt, right?

523
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,839
But now I get this crazy idea...

524
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,237
...and I can't shake it.

525
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,553
I mean, I stay up nights staring at the ceiling...

526
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,955
...trying to make sense of it. That napkin.

527
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,718
I told you Boetticher's vegan.

528
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,117
We're talking this guy makes his own fermented lentil bread...

529
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,390
...or whatever the hell that is.

530
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,795
What's a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint?

531
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,792
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

532
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,638
Like who?

533
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,196
Well, like, maybe...

534
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,718
...this guy.

535
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,797
I mean, what do we know about Gustavo Fring, huh?

536
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,230
This whole friend-of-law-enforcement thing?

537
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,432
Could be a case of, "keep your friends
close but your enemies closer."

538
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,596
He's got the money to finance this operation.

539
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,349
Maybe he's got the connections too. Maybe, just maybe...

540
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,115
...he's our guy.

541
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,755
Hank, no offence, but I think you're really reaching.

542
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,077
If your guy had his meeting at KFC...

543
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,114
...you wouldn't immediately assume
he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.

544
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,912
You know, I -

545
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,590
I couldn't agree more, guys.

546
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,359
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know.

547
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,191
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.

548
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,478
I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat, you know?

549
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,632
Except...

550
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,469
...I can't seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing...

551
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,390
...and that is, what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints...

552
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,868
...doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
