1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,833
How's it coming?

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,070
Very, very well.

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,119
It's a flurry of deliveries.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,039
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,798
It's exciting.

6
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,438
It's really coming together. And I'd like to point out...

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,279
...that if you have any understandable questions...

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,391
...about the price tag...

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,835
That sound? Quality.

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,397
At Pfizer, at Merck, that unit would be right at home.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,033
That goes for all of it.

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,439
Good. I want you to have what you need.

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,108
Well, I doff my proverbial cap to you, sir.

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,436
When do you think we'll be up and running?

15
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,868
Within a month, I'd say.

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,632
Two weeks.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,633
Or, yeah, two weeks.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,671
Good. Very good.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,270
By the way, that sample you asked me to run?

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,077
- I ran it, and it is quite good.
- Thank you very much, Gale.

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,078
- You can give that to Victor to discard.
- Sure.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,671
Is that our competition?

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,440
- I'm sorry?
- The...

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,597
It really is quite good.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,873
The purity, of course, I'm speaking of,
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,159
And I can't, as of yet, account for the blue colour...

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,589
...but if that is our competition...

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,951
...we have our work cut out for us, so to speak.

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,914
You don't have any competition, Gale, not as far as I'm concerned.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,510
After all, how pure can pure be?

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,830
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,919
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96 percent.

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,874
I'm proud of that figure. It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,311
However, this other product is 99.

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,633
Maybe even a touch beyond that.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,957
I'd need an instrument called a gas chromatograph...

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,434
...to say for sure...

38
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,677
...but that last 3 percent...

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,873
...it may not sound like a lot, but it is.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,957
It's tremendous.

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,789
It's a tremendous gulf.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,393
Gale, for our purposes, 96 percent will do just fine.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,512
Please, don't let this trouble you.

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,996
Yeah. It's just...

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,633
I'd love to know who synthesised it, is all.

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,231
A man who wants to work with me.

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,351
A trained chemist, like yourself.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,831
But it won't happen.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,230
I don't consider him a professional.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,030
If he's not, I don't know what that makes me.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,075
I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job -

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,511
With this person, there are other considerations.

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,155
His is the best I've ever seen, hands down.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,112
And I look at this place that you've built...

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,470
...the money you're investing...

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,955
...sparing no expense.

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,316
And I know...

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,390
...I know that you want the best.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,031
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,629
No, no. Eubank's west.

61
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,515
It's between Eubank and Spain, but Mazatlan's closest.

62
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,790
I don't know. I just heard the one...

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,594
...like, you know, a backfire, a truck backfiring.

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,234
I came out of my apartment. A couple came out.

65
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,112
No. No, nobody saw.

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,671
Did you guys see anybody?

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,031
Guys, did you-? I don't know if they speak English too good.

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,276
I don't think they saw anybody.

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,950
It was just this one loud - This very loud pop and that was all.

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,594
No arguing or like that.

71
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,030
So you guys good in directions there? You want me to...?

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,428
They coming east or west?

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,998
If heading east, tell them there's
an Exxon on their left-hand side.

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,636
Then it's straight residential. You want me to what? Yeah.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,956
No. I'll stay on the line.

76
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,639
You know him?

77
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,230
We all heard this shot. I don't think you ought to go in there.

78
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,750
Mister, this is a crime scene. You don't wanna touch anything.

79
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,509
Mister?

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,834
Mister, are you listening to me?

81
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,631
Little bastard.

82
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,438
Drive.

83
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,353
Drive.

84
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,351
What the hell happened?

85
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,635
He's gone?

86
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,832
Look at me.

87
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,639
Gone?

88
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,353
You sure?

89
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,633
- Gone. Splattered all over.
- Oh, Jesus.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,594
Jesus. Oh, shit.

91
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,832
All right.

92
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,077
So...

93
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,594
Shit.

94
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,957
- All right, you do a sweep?
- Couldn't. People there.

95
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,915
People? He get himself seen by these people?

96
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,315
What about you?

97
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,548
What about you?

98
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,910
Yeah. So what?

99
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,669
Just another looky-loo.

100
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,310
I guess I'd better get this over with.

101
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,192
Hey.

102
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,193
Oh, jeez, I woke you up. I woke you up.

103
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,198
No, no, no, it's okay. I needed to get up anyway.

104
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,829
Are you coming in?

105
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,349
No. It's kind of my only time to run errands.

106
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,913
I just needed to...

107
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,233
I...

108
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,072
Sorry.

109
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,429
It's okay.

110
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,316
And thank you, big time, as always.

111
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,517
They seem to be getting bigger instead of smaller.

112
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,757
Not really sure what that's all about.

113
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,276
Please, for God's sake...

114
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,199
...tell me if this is getting to be too much for you.

115
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,834
Absolutely not, okay? It's absolutely fine.

116
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,712
Okay.

117
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,239
Does this mean what I think it means?

118
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,235
- What?
- You and Walt?

119
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,475
What?

120
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,478
His car is in the driveway. It's not a state secret.

121
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,719
I- All right. Okay. I'm not pressing. I just...

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,956
I think that it's great.

123
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,957
That's all, all right?

124
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,559
- I'm out of here.
- Okay.

125
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,754
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

126
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,514
In Albuquerque today.

127
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,599
But you know what? It always is when
you have 330 days of sunshine a year.

128
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,871
On morning commute, northbound 25...

129
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,833
...we've got a two-car accident on the right shoulder.

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,759
You gotta be careful. Also, from the west side...

131
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,555
...we've got another accident, Paseo del Norte and Second Street.

132
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,672
That one's on the left shoulder, so be on the lookout.

133
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,872
That's a look at your morning commute on Coyote 102.5

134
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,951
Oh, hey.

135
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,310
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

136
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,317
Yeah? Okay.

137
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,916
All right. What you want?

138
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,712
All right, look.

139
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,037
So I make it 10 to 9, which means -

140
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,152
Shut up.

141
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,115
Which means we need to start a cook in the next 10 minutes...

142
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,753
...to keep to our schedule.

143
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,474
Gus' schedule.

144
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,197
And as angry as he may be, I don't believe he's willing...

145
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,958
...to forfeit an entire batch.

146
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,799
That just might make him angrier.

147
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,274
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

148
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,153
Isn't that what this whole thing is about?

149
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,998
That's right, genius. Watch me.

150
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,795
We ain't missing no cook.

151
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,630
We're closed.

152
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,954
Closed.

153
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,909
Saul Goodman and Associates.

154
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,793
I'll see if he's in. Please hold.

155
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,632
Saul, Skyler White calling.

156
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,838
Saul.

157
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,789
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

158
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,830
- Saul.
- Hey.

159
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,031
Skyler White.

160
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,875
What the hell does she want?

161
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,234
He's nowhere to be found.

162
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,510
I called his condo, every number I have.

163
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,119
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

164
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,039
You're sure?

165
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,470
As in, you know where he is?

166
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,037
I'm not the man's keeper, but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.

167
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,992
Mr. Goodman, something is going on.

168
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,714
Why would he leave his car in my driveway?

169
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,071
People carpool to work, right? It's good for the environment.

170
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,636
He carpools? He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

171
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,354
Hey, you're breaking up there.

172
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,120
I didn't quite catch that last...

173
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,471
- You're a Chatty Cathy today.
- Okay, do you know anything?

174
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,956
Anything at all? Please, I'm looking for some help here.

175
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,280
Look, Walter is fine, okay? I guarantee that, hundred percent.

176
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,390
One hundred percent.

177
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,031
You got a passport, right?

178
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,438
Yeah. Albuquerque.

179
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,710
I'm in Nob Hill.

180
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,593
I need the number for a locksmith.

181
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,876
I don't know. Pick one.

182
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,232
- You sure there's nothing?
- No, it's not even me. It's state law.

183
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,193
Are you sure there isn't some sort of-? I don't know.

184
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,038
No. Nothing.

185
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,391
Maybe a car registration. That would have your address.

186
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,832
No, but I can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

187
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,952
My God, my credit cards, my - It's all right, sweetheart.

188
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,869
My driver's licence, my chequebook.
I have to start cancelling all that.

189
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,119
My whole life was in that purse and
he just cut it right off my shoulder.

190
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,878
We could've been stabbed.

191
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,073
I'm sorry, really. But without proof of residency...

192
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,918
I can take you down to my shop.

193
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,395
You're welcome to wait, file a police report.

194
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,751
I can't believe this. I cannot believe this day.

195
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,554
I know. It's just, it's the law.

196
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,151
Oh, my God. My medication. I bet it's gone.

197
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,749
Oh, God, not now, not this. Gotta call the pharmacy.

198
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,518
Are you okay?

199
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,633
Please, just- Please, just take her.
Please. Just take her, please.

200
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,918
Oh, God.

201
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,678
Not now.

202
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,269
No. Not now.

203
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,552
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.

204
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,718
Here you go, sweetheart. Oh, there you go.

205
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,518
How do you-? How do you wanna deal with the bill?

206
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,838
I- Unfortunately, all my cash was taken so...

207
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,272
- That's fine. We'll mail it to you.
- Will you? You know where I live, right?

208
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,632
- Sir, again, thank you so much. Really.
- Yeah.

209
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,798
Hey there. I'm back.

210
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,151
How was PT?

211
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,111
I heard it was very good.

212
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,998
I'm really liking this new therapist.

213
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,795
He keeps me in the loop, always has time for a phone call. It's...

214
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,592
I like it.

215
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,917
So?

216
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,636
Tell me all about it.

217
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,714
I heard you broke new ground today.

218
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,633
I broke new ground?

219
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,718
That's what he said. Tell me.

220
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,557
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes...

221
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,116
...which is up from my 15 and a half yesterday.

222
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,197
And this much less shit in my pants.

223
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,678
So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and
everybody in America took a vote...

224
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,394
...changed the meaning of the English language...

225
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,637
...yeah, I guess I "broke new ground."

226
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,558
Well, call it a figure of speech, but I am seeing progress.

227
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,435
Definite progress.

228
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,151
You're ordering a new rock?

229
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,079
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

230
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,478
It's a nice one.

231
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,591
What? It's pretty.

232
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,678
I need the thing.

233
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,393
Okay.

234
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,391
Okay.

235
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,071
It has all those pretty little crystals. I like that.

236
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,998
Okay.

237
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,839
All right, I just wanna go on record,
we should all be wearing masks.

238
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,676
We should be wearing masks.

239
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,190
Bet he forgets the aluminium.

240
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,591
Guaranteed.

241
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,991
Guarantee he forgets.

242
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,313
Oh, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you?

243
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,431
You forgot the aluminium.

244
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,039
One of the first steps in the...

245
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,991
Son of a bitch.

246
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,712
All right, let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

247
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,236
He was a good man and a good chemist...

248
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,237
...and I cared about him.

249
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,314
He didn't deserve what happened to him.

250
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,155
He didn't deserve it at all.

251
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,156
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow and
the next day and the day after that.

252
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,831
When you make it Gale versus me, or Gale versus Jesse...

253
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,237
...Gale loses, simple as that.

254
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,673
This is on you, Gus. Not me, not Jesse.

255
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,519
Gale's death is on you.

256
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,869
I mean, really, what did you expect me to do...

257
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,198
...just simply roll over and allow you to murder us?

258
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,676
That I wouldn't take measures, extreme measures to defend myself?

259
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,915
Wrong.

260
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,629
Think again.

261
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,116
And whatever it is you're planning there...

262
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,676
...whatever it is, the point that you're trying to make here...

263
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,156
...let me suggest that you keep one thing in mind.

264
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,508
Without us, without Jesse and myself...

265
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,516
...you have no one to make your product.

266
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,556
Certainly not him.

267
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
This person doesn't know what the hell he's doing.

268
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,115
Been watching him for weeks. I know every step of his cook.

269
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,195
Do you really? You?

270
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,559
Really? Oh, so please tell me.

271
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,510
Catalytic hydrogenation,
is it protic or aprotic? Because I forget.

272
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,589
If our reduction isn't stereospecific how can our product be pure?

273
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,032
I mean, is 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy - 2-methylamino-propane...

274
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,435
...containing, of course, chiral centres...

275
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,393
...at carbons number one and two on the propane chain?

276
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,636
Then reduction to methamphetamine...

277
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,150
...eliminates which chiral centre is it again?

278
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,351
Because I forgot.

279
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,837
Come on, help me out, professor.

280
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,598
Gus.

281
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,595
We're here. Come on. Let us work.

282
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,270
All his bullshit aside, it's called a cook.

283
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,789
Everything comes down to following a recipe.

284
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,355
Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.

285
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,869
The steps never change...

286
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,071
...and I know every step.

287
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,840
Oh, is that what you want?

288
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,269
This short-order cook? You're not flipping hamburgers.

289
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,040
What happens when you get bad barrel of precursor?

290
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,673
How would you even know it?

291
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,793
And what happens in the summer when the humidity rises...

292
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,514
...and your product goes cloudy?

293
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,158
How would you guard against that, huh?

294
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,679
Gus.

295
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,435
You do this, all you'll have left...

296
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,757
...is an $8 million hole in the ground.

297
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,678
This lab...

298
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,236
...this equipment is useless without us.

299
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,479
Without Jesse and myself, you have no new product.

300
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,591
You have no income.

301
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,793
Your people out there will not be paid.
Your distribution chain collapses.

302
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,911
Without us...

303
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,277
...you have nothing.

304
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,758
You kill me, you have nothing.

305
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,955
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.

306
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,519
You won't do this.

307
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,676
You're too smart.

308
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,313
You can't afford to do this.

309
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,193
Please.

310
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,475
Let us just go back to work.

311
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,272
We're here.

312
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,510
Let us work. We're ready to go to work.

313
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,474
We'll just pick up right where we left off.

314
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,753
Well?

315
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,591
Get back to work.

316
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,030
Listen, we'll just lay this down.

317
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,313
Put him in feet first. Grab his shoe.

318
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,634
Here. Wait, wait, wait. Just lift him up. There. All right.

319
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,315
Oh, God.

320
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,829
You push that way, I'll hold him in.

321
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,398
Okay, ready? One...

322
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,798
Oh, shit.

323
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,110
Wait, wait. Wait.

324
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,198
Forget that. Okay.

325
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,830
Come on. Up.

326
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,231
Get down.

327
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,271
Okay, okay.

328
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,918
I never use this stuff. Are you sure it'll do the job?

329
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,234
Trust us.

330
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,234
Here you go, hon. Get you anything else?

331
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,158
No, I'm good. Thanks.

332
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,073
How you doing?

333
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,679
No, I mean, you know...

334
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,951
...how are you doing?

335
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,071
You did the only thing that you could.

336
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,157
I hope you understand that.

337
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,117
Thoughts?

338
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,432
Any thoughts on what our next move might be?

339
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,558
What next move?

340
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,354
Our next move.

341
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,552
Our next move, given the fact that at
the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.

342
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,672
What, that wasn't an opportunity just now?

343
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,116
Seemed like a damn good opportunity to me.

344
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,470
- No, no.
- Golden, I would say.

345
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,116
We bought ourselves some time, yes, but...

346
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,879
The question is how much. He'll be looking for another chemist.

347
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,748
He's not gonna find another chemist.

348
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,349
Where is he gonna find another chemist?

349
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,394
It's not just about somebody being able to run a lab that big.

350
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,953
Someone he can trust...

351
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,835
...someone he knows will keep their mouths shut.

352
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,429
Yeah. Good luck with that.

353
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,430
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

354
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,079
Bet he's sorry now.

355
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,151
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Now we all understand each other.

356
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,873
Right?

357
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,310
- What do you mean?
- I mean, him and us, we get it.

358
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,634
We're all on the same page.

359
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,109
And what page is that?

360
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,830
"If I can't kill you...

361
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,674
...you'll sure as shit wish you were dead."

362
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,994
Yo, excuse me.

363
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,352
Thanks.

364
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,557
- Here.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good one.

365
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,318
Thanks.

366
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,272
Hi.

367
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,271
Hi.

368
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,835
It's parked over on Amsden.

369
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,993
Junior was about to get up and he would've seen it...

370
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,078
...so I wanted to avoid a lot of questions.

371
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,592
Smart.

372
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,153
Well.

373
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,915
Kenny Rogers.

374
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,798
Yeah.

375
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,757
You okay?

376
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,434
Yeah.

377
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,157
Right as rain.

378
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,515
Do you have your keys?

379
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,039
Yeah.

380
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,557
It's parked three blocks down on the right.

381
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,319
Yeah.
