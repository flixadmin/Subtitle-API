<font color=#FF00FF>*GAME OF THRONES*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 07 Episode 02</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Stormborn"</font>

5
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,594
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

6
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,399
I remember that storm.

7
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,774
All the dogs
in King's Landing

8
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:32,508
howled through
the night.

9
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,350
I wish I could
remember it.

10
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:37,102
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

11
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,081
Doesn't feel
like home.

12
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,337
We won't stay
on Dragonstone for long.

13
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,762
Good.

14
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,852
Not so many lions.

15
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:48,688
Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

16
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,110
The lords of Westeros
despise her.

17
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,070
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

18
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:57,219
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

19
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,993
They drink secret toasts
to my health?

20
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,227
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

21
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,220
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

22
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:12,969
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

23
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,052
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

24
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,563
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

25
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:20,329
But you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

26
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:22,641
No.

27
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:25,028
We can take
the Seven Kingdoms

28
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,657
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

29
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:30,511
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

30
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,422
the game is won.

31
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,052
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

32
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,696
we have powerful allies
in the south.

33
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,618
I never properly
thanked you for that.

34
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,508
They joined our side,
my queen,

35
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,805
because
they believe in you.

36
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,547
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

37
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:50,700
I did.

38
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,339
And then you served
the man who overthrew him.

39
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:53,790
I had a choice,
Your Grace...

40
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,165
Serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

41
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:58,258
But you didn't
serve him long.

42
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,053
You turned
against him.

43
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:04,915
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

44
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,266
There have been
few rulers in history

45
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,188
as cruel
as the Mad King.

46
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:11,610
Robert was
neither mad nor cruel.

47
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,386
He simply had no interest
in being king.

48
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:17,204
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

49
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,110
Your Grace,

50
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:22,248
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

51
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,407
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

52
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:27,641
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

53
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,985
All your spies,
your little birds,

54
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,954
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

55
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,766
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

56
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:44,887
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

57
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,368
I knew nothing about you,
save your existence

58
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,602
and that you were said
to be beautiful.

59
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:53,313
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

60
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,305
Which you turned
to your advantage.

61
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,417
Who gave the order
to kill me?

62
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,188
King Robert.

63
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,993
Who hired
the assassins?

64
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,563
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

65
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,922
Your Grace, I did what had to be
done to... - To keep yourself alive.

66
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,251
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

67
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:18,282
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

68
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:21,790
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

69
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,032
What kind of a servant
is that?

70
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,165
The kind
the realm needs.

71
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:29,493
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

72
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:32,907
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

73
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,610
I wasn't born
into a great house.

74
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,852
I came from nothing.

75
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,969
I was sold as a slave
and carved up as an offering.

76
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:45,790
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

77
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,110
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

78
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:51,735
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

79
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,501
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

80
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:58,141
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

81
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:03,094
If you demand
blind allegiance,

82
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:05,782
I respect your wishes.

83
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,079
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

84
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,973
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

85
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:16,312
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

86
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,376
because I choose you.

87
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:22,485
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

88
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,814
Swear this to me,
Varys.

89
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:37,305
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

90
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,672
you won't conspire
behind my back.

91
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,850
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

92
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,708
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

93
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,584
I swear it,
my queen.

94
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:59,633
And I swear this...
If you ever betray me,

95
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:01,644
I'll burn you alive.

96
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:08,534
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

97
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,219
Forgive me, my queen.

98
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:16,689
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

99
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:56,313
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

100
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:00,071
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

101
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,274
No, it didn't.

102
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:05,516
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

103
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,912
We've just decided
to pardon those

104
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,524
who once served
the wrong king.

105
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,688
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

106
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,540
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

107
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,032
can serve his cause.

108
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,946
What does your lord
expect from me?

109
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:33,480
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

110
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:36,602
I'm afraid
I'm not a prince.

111
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:38,354
Your Grace, 
forgive me,

112
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,102
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

113
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,062
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

114
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,133
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

115
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,266
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

116
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,477
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

117
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,105
No, but I like it
better.

118
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,536
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

119
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,399
Prophecies are
dangerous things.

120
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:04,415
I believe you have
a role to play.

121
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:06,360
As does another...

122
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,146
The King in the North,
Jon Snow.

123
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,549
Jon Snow?

124
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,954
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

125
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:18,195
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

126
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:21,891
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

127
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,646
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

128
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,282
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

129
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:29,735
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

130
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,895
to protect them
from grave danger.

131
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,313
As King in the North,

132
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,312
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

133
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:38,430
so together they may
face their common enemy.

134
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:40,780
He sounds like
quite a man.

135
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,891
Summon Jon Snow.

136
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,877
Let him stand
before you

137
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:46,916
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

138
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,230
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

139
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,223
I can't speak
to prophecies

140
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:55,727
or... visions
in the flames,

141
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,290
but I like Jon Snow
and I trusted him.

142
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,209
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

143
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,359
If he does
rule the North,

144
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:05,547
he would make
a valuable ally.

145
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,528
The Lannisters
executed his father

146
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,712
and conspired
to murder his brother.

147
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:14,282
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

148
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,860
Very well.

149
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,813
Send a raven north.

150
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,751
Tell Jon Snow
that his queen

151
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,094
invites him to come
to Dragonstone...

152
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:28,855
and bend the knee.

153
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,922
Gather round.
Come here.

154
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,633
You think
it's really Tyrion?

155
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:46,723
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

156
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,685
Read the last bit.

157
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,075
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

158
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,225
What does that mean?

159
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:58,261
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

160
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,551
You know him better
than any of us.

161
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,036
What do you think?

162
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:09,387
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

163
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:13,004
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

164
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:15,342
"The Seven Kingdoms
will bleed

165
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:17,661
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

166
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:18,915
Join us.

167
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,278
Together, we can
end her tyranny."

168
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:26,635
Sounds like a charmer.

169
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,241
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

170
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,825
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

171
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:33,622
A bit less charming.

172
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:36,955
What?

173
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,692
Fire kills wights,
you told me.

174
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,817
What breathes fire?

175
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,379
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

176
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,739
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

177
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:50,892
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

178
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,778
do we have enough men
to fight them?

179
00:11:57,352 --> 00:12:00,090
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

180
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,473
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

181
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,958
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

182
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:09,676
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

183
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,629
With their help,
the Mad King's daughter

184
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,598
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

185
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:19,942
Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

186
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,981
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

187
00:12:24,184 --> 00:12:26,200
rape and enslave
your women,

188
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:29,145
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

189
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:34,106
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

190
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,794
You all remember the Mad King.

191
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,192
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

192
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:41,989
His daughter
is no different.

193
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:45,145
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

194
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:49,262
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

195
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:51,708
And when she
grew bored of that,

196
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,497
she fed them
to her dragons.

197
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,012
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

198
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:00,598
But I need your help,
my lords.

199
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,270
We must stand together,
all of us...

200
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,090
if we hope to stop her.

201
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:15,973
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

202
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,614
The same as Aegon
when he conquered

203
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,770
the Seven Kingdoms.

204
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,495
How do you propose
to stop them?

205
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:31,513
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

206
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:39,833
Lord Tarly.

207
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,551
Ser Jaime.

208
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,728
I believe
you know my son.

209
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,051
Ser Jaime.

210
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:47,520
Rickard, isn't it?

211
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,730
Dickon.

212
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,301
That's it.

213
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,387
Thank you for coming.

214
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,333
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

215
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,129
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

216
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,051
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

217
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,629
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

218
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,254
You ride for
Horn Hill today?

219
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,997
I have an army
to mobilize.

220
00:14:12,364 --> 00:14:14,379
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

221
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,090
And which side
will you be fighting for?

222
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,348
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

223
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,871
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
could do that.

224
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,020
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

225
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:28,950
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

226
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,236
I want you to swear
allegiance to Cersei

227
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,942
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

228
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,770
All her enemies.

229
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,214
Including
Olenna Tyrell.

230
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,794
I'm a Tarly.

231
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,340
That name
means something.

232
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,895
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

233
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,848
We don't stab
our rivals in the back

234
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,754
or cut their throats
at weddings.

235
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:59,286
I swore an oath
to House Tyrell.

236
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:02,689
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

237
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,129
I've known Olenna
since I was a child.

238
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,786
She was
a great woman once.

239
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:11,278
Now she's broken.

240
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,489
She wants revenge
so badly,

241
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,778
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

242
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:19,772
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

243
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,473
I know you don't
like my sister,

244
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,114
but you have
to make a choice.

245
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,534
Do you fight with us

246
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:32,622
or with foreign savages
and eunuchs?

247
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:39,098
When the war is won,

248
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,340
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

249
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,215
I can think
of no better man

250
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,355
than Randyll Tarly.

251
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,801
The infection
has spread too far.

252
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,208
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

253
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,090
How long?

254
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,692
It'll be years
before it kills you.

255
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:05,309
Could be 10.

256
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:06,887
Could be 20.

257
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:08,855
But how long until...?

258
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,856
Your mind?

259
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:15,317
Six months,
maybe fewer.

260
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:28,731
Um...

261
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,137
Pardon, Archmaester.

262
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,317
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

263
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:39,022
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

264
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,708
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

265
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:42,563
Does this look
like a baby to you?

266
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,809
- No.
- Have you studied

267
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:45,856
the varying rates
of greyscale progression

268
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,926
in infants
and fully grown men?

269
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,815
No.

270
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:54,236
Maester Cressen discovered

271
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:57,176
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

272
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,067
This is quite advanced.

273
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:04,285
And beyond
our skills, ser.

274
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:10,481
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

275
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,747
to live out your life
with the stone men.

276
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:16,938
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

277
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,653
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

278
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:29,739
Come, Samwell.

279
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:36,522
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

280
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:39,481
Jorah.

281
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,731
Jorah Mormont.

282
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,200
Mormont?

283
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,098
There's no need.

284
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:50,145
I've been dead
to them for years.

285
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:53,215
Come, Samwell!

286
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,661
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

287
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,399
No, I can't say
I have.

288
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:16,106
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

289
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,965
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

290
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,200
They were his trophies.

291
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:23,604
He couldn't
keep them around.

292
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:25,715
They would have
made him look small.

293
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:29,063
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

294
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,339
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

295
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,994
Balerion the Dread.

296
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,544
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

297
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:50,372
His flames forged
the Iron Throne

298
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:53,372
and brought the Seven
Kingdoms to heel.

299
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:55,762
Powerful...

300
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:58,438
but not invincible.

301
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:06,044
Apparently,
one of Daenerys's dragons

302
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,145
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

303
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,340
And if they can
be wounded,

304
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,942
they can be killed.

305
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,317
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

306
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:23,090
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

307
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,067
If you'll kindly
pull that lever.

308
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:51,614
If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

309
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:56,311
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

310
00:19:56,567 --> 00:20:00,481
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

311
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,536
The city will fall
within a day.

312
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:05,474
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

313
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:06,817
It's called war.

314
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,965
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

315
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:11,327
I know
how you wage war.

316
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,723
We don't poison
little girls here.

317
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:15,306
Myrcella was innocent.

318
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:16,590
She was a Lannister.

319
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,137
There are no
innocent Lannisters.

320
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:22,575
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

321
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,184
That's enough.

322
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,049
Lord Tyrion
is Hand of the Queen.

323
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,184
You will treat him
with respect.

324
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,879
I am not here to be
queen of the ashes.

325
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:37,848
That's very nice
to hear.

326
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,059
Of course,
I can't remember a queen

327
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,551
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

328
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,622
The common people
loved her.

329
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,492
The nobles loved her.

330
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:48,437
And what is left
of her now?

331
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,817
Ashes.

332
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,837
Commoners, nobles,

333
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:54,622
they're all
just children, really.

334
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:58,817
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

335
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,645
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

336
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,465
I'm grateful
to all of you.

337
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,559
But you have chosen
to follow me.

338
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,160
I will not attack
King's Landing.

339
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:12,661
We will not attack
King's Landing.

340
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:15,794
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

341
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,848
By asking nicely?

342
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:20,933
We will lay siege
to the capital,

343
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,794
surrounding the city
on all sides.

344
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:24,481
Cersei will have
the Iron Throne,

345
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:26,723
but no food for her army
or the people.

346
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,590
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

347
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:31,814
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

348
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,200
by appealing
to their loyalty,

349
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,991
their love
for their country.

350
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,911
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

351
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,575
we prove her point.

352
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,340
Our army should be
Westerosi.

353
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:42,637
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

354
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,996
You are.

355
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,903
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

356
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:53,067
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

357
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,044
back up to King's Landing.

358
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:58,173
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

359
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:00,129
alongside
the Tyrell army.

360
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,850
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

361
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:07,832
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

362
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:11,989
Forgive me for asking, but why did
you bother to bring your own?

363
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,598
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

364
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,294
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

365
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:23,649
And the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

366
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:25,604
Grey Worm
and the Unsullied

367
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:28,480
will sail for the Rock
and take it.

368
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,466
Do I have
your support?

369
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:51,672
You have mine.

370
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:55,684
Dorne is with you,
Your Grace.

371
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,598
Thank you all.

372
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,958
Lady Olenna, may I speak
with you alone?

373
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:17,372
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

374
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,067
But I swear to you, she will
pay for what she's done.

375
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:24,700
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

376
00:23:24,895 --> 00:23:26,153
Peace?

377
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,817
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

378
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:31,973
Or his father?
Or his?

379
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,536
Peace never lasts,
my dear.

380
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,958
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

381
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,583
He's a clever man,
your Hand.

382
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:44,731
I've known
a great many clever men.

383
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,700
I've outlived them all.

384
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,669
You know why?

385
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,299
I ignored them.

386
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:53,762
The lords of Westeros
are sheep.

387
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,355
Are you a sheep?

388
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,270
No.

389
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:00,520
You're a dragon.

390
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,318
Be a dragon.

391
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,356
Mají.

392
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,901
You leave tomorrow.

393
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,229
Were you going
to say goodbye?

394
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,559
I will see you
when I return.

395
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,747
But you don't know
when that will be.

396
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,090
No one knows.

397
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:32,564
I wish you
good fortune.

398
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,161
Missandei.

399
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,038
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

400
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,356
Why?

401
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:49,644
You know why.

402
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:51,075
I don't.

403
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,681
Y-you are my weakness.

404
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:00,661
That's what I am?

405
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,298
Your weakness?

406
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:06,458
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

407
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,911
One boy is scared
of dogs,

408
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,036
one boy hates
high places,

409
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:14,583
one is frightened
of the ocean.

410
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,254
They make the boy
sleep with dogs

411
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,926
or climb a cliff.

412
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:21,348
They throw him
in the water.

413
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,575
If he learns
to swim, good.

414
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:25,997
If he drowns, good.

415
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:29,700
Either way,
strong Unsullied.

416
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:32,161
But I had no fears.

417
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:36,434
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

418
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:41,176
but I was bravest,
always.

419
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:44,051
- I believe it.
- Until...

420
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,114
I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

421
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:52,989
Now I have fear.

422
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,044
I do, too.

423
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:16,778
No.

424
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:20,143
I want to see you.

425
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:22,835
Please.

426
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:56,857
Might be useful.

427
00:28:57,107 --> 00:28:58,638
Ch'Vyalthan was
a dreadful writer,

428
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,388
but an excellent
researcher.

429
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:02,849
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

430
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:04,732
Maester Faull was
quite the opposite...

431
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,591
A brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

432
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,302
Um, I wanted
to ask you...

433
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:11,240
If you're going
to write histories, Tarly,

434
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:12,729
you have to do
the research.

435
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:14,440
If you want people
to read your histories,

436
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:16,607
you need
a bit of style.

437
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,712
I'm not writing
"A Chronicle of the Wars

438
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:20,607
Following the Death
of King Robert I"

439
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,302
so it can sit
on a shelf unread.

440
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:28,349
What? You don't like the title?

441
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:30,259
What would you
call it, then?

442
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,688
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

443
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,224
We're not poets, Tarly.

444
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:38,295
Um, Archmaester, if I
could just have a moment.

445
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,959
This is your moment.

446
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:41,920
Use it wisely.

447
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:46,349
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

448
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,163
There are
two recorded cases

449
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:50,826
of advanced greyscale
being cured.

450
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:52,831
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

451
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:54,060
by Archmaester Pylos.

452
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:56,295
I'm familiar with
Archmaester Pylos

453
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:58,162
and his study
of rare diseases.

454
00:29:58,313 --> 00:30:00,021
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

455
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:02,451
And shall I tell you
how he died?

456
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,130
From greyscale.

457
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:08,349
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

458
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:10,263
which is why
it's now forbidden.

459
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,255
Hello.

460
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:58,072
What are you doing?

461
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:01,073
You're Jorah Mormont,

462
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:03,289
the only son
of Jeor Mormont.

463
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,477
My name
is Samwell Tarly,

464
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,354
Sworn Brother
of the Night's Watch,

465
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:10,690
training to serve
as maester at Castle Black.

466
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:12,182
I knew your father.

467
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,956
I was with him
when he died.

468
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,036
You are not dying
today, Ser Jorah.

469
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,612
Drink this.

470
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,370
- What is it?
- Rum.

471
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:34,159
Drink it all, please. I'm
afraid this is going to hurt.

472
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,758
If you could
take off your shirt.

473
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:14,356
If you wouldn't mind,
bite down hard.

474
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:17,121
I'm sorry, but no one
knows I'm here,

475
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,833
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

476
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,458
Have you ever
done this before?

477
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:33,653
No.

478
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,895
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

479
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:42,630
Have a seat.

480
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,437
I'm going to have to remove the entire
upper layer of infected tissue,

481
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,753
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

482
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,648
Shh, shh!

483
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:08,965
Shh.

484
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:11,778
Again, I'm sorry,

485
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:15,153
but please try
not to scream.

486
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,914
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

487
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:18,632
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

488
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,015
I hope it's true.

489
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:23,186
If she lays siege to King's
Landing, prices will triple.

490
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,273
As long as we get back
there before they start.

491
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:29,245
One more round.
It's a long ride.

492
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,218
Arry!

493
00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:34,336
Hello, Hot Pie.

494
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,437
Sit down.

495
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,859
Who's that for?

496
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:51,039
Mm. This is good.

497
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,666
You think so?

498
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,587
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

499
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,404
Most people don't do that 'cause
it takes up too much time.

500
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,312
Mm, I didn't do that.

501
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,068
You've been
making pies?

502
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:04,943
One or two.

503
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,826
I can't believe
you're here.

504
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,060
Did you meet
the big lady?

505
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:12,512
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

506
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,060
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

507
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:17,927
She was looking for your sister,
but I told her about you.

508
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,188
Did she ever find you?

509
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:23,146
She found me.

510
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,068
What happened
to you, Arry?

511
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:41,521
You got any ale?

512
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:58,493
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

513
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:01,063
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

514
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,649
Heard she blew up
the Great Sept.

515
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,309
That must have been
something to see.

516
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,118
- Boom.
- Mm.

517
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,281
I can't believe
someone would do that.

518
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:09,953
Cersei would do that.

519
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,581
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

520
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,837
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

521
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:19,526
No, the Boltons
are dead.

522
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:22,866
What?

523
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:25,172
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

524
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:26,758
and won the Battle
of the Bastards.

525
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:28,680
He's King
of the North now.

526
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:31,081
You're lying.

527
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:32,837
Why would I lie
about that?

528
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,479
He's your brother,
right?

529
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,005
Thanks for the pie.

530
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,658
Friends don't pay.

531
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:48,031
Can't believe
I thought you were a boy.

532
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:49,890
You're pretty.

533
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,170
Thanks.

534
00:36:58,117 --> 00:36:59,789
Take care
of yourself, Hot Pie.

535
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,265
Try not
to get killed.

536
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:03,539
Ah, I won't.

537
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,887
I'm like you, Arry.

538
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:06,867
I'm a survivor.

539
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,146
200 miles
to King's Landing.

540
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:16,907
One bottle of rum.
You think we'll make it?

541
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:52,148
Come in.

542
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:56,039
A raven, my king,
from the Citadel.

543
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,836
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

544
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:11,523
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

545
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:16,070
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

546
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:19,039
He's discovered proof
that Dragonstone

547
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,929
sits on a mountain
of dragonglass.

548
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:30,093
I received this
a few days ago

549
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:31,927
from Dragonstone.

550
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:35,902
It was sent to me
by Tyrion Lannister.

551
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:41,781
He is now Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

552
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:45,242
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

553
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:47,257
She has a powerful army
at her back

554
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:50,687
and, if this message
is to be believed,

555
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:52,395
three dragons.

556
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,984
Lord Tyrion has
invited me to Dragonstone

557
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:58,855
to meet with Daenerys.

558
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:01,833
And I'm going
to accept.

559
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,889
Accept?!

560
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:08,914
We need this
dragonglass, my lords!

561
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,356
We know that dragonglass
can destroy

562
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,397
both white walkers
and their army.

563
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,980
We need to mine it
and turn it into weapons.

564
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:20,640
But more importantly,
we need allies!

565
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,273
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

566
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,461
We can't defeat them
on our own.

567
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:28,015
We don't have
the numbers.

568
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,695
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

569
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:35,312
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

570
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:38,867
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

571
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,398
then sail
for Dragonstone.

572
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:43,265
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

573
00:39:43,524 --> 00:39:45,679
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

574
00:39:45,704 --> 00:39:47,938
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

575
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,209
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

576
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:53,312
The North is one
of those seven kingdoms.

577
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:56,007
This isn't an invitation;
it's a trap.

578
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,281
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

579
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,617
You know him.
He's a good man.

580
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:05,500
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

581
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:08,476
I remember the Mad King
all too well.

582
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,242
A Targaryen
cannot be trusted.

583
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,382
- Nor can a Lannister.
- Yeah!

584
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:17,015
Aye. We called
your brother king.

585
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:21,038
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

586
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:24,242
Winter is here,
Your Grace.

587
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:27,689
We need the King in the
North in the North.

588
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,319
Aye!

589
00:40:39,456 --> 00:40:41,790
You all crowned me
your king.

590
00:40:43,602 --> 00:40:45,671
I never wanted it.

591
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:48,296
I never asked for it.

592
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,742
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

593
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,718
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

594
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,304
no matter the odds.

595
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:03,090
But the odds
are against us.

596
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:10,000
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.
None of you.

597
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:13,114
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

598
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:16,586
We need allies,
powerful allies.

599
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:21,073
I know it's a risk.

600
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:24,195
But I have
to take it.

601
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:26,945
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

602
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,343
Daenerys is a queen.

603
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,382
Only a king can
convince her to help us.

604
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:32,744
It has to be me.

605
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:34,593
You're abandoning
your people!

606
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,375
You're abandoning
your home.

607
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,312
I'm leaving both
in good hands.

608
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,086
- Whose?
- Yours.

609
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,187
You are my sister.

610
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:45,395
You're the only Stark
in Winterfell.

611
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:49,562
Until I return,
the North is yours.

612
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:14,961
I delivered his bones myself.

613
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,696
Presented them
to Lady Catelyn

614
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,230
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

615
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:23,562
Seems like
a lifetime ago.

616
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:27,750
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

617
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:32,593
I was sorry
when he died.

618
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:36,656
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

619
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:40,594
So did I.

620
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,146
She wasn't fond
of you, was she?

621
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:50,105
Well, it appears she vastly
underestimated you.

622
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,234
Your father
and brothers are gone,

623
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:55,354
yet here you stand,
King in the North.

624
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:59,851
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

625
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:06,480
You don't belong
down here.

626
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:09,029
Forgive me.

627
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:14,023
We haven't ever
talked... properly.

628
00:43:14,568 --> 00:43:16,257
I wanted
to remedy that.

629
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:19,343
I have nothing
to say to you.

630
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,062
Not even
"thank you"?

631
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:27,218
If it weren't for me, you'd have been
slaughtered on that battlefield.

632
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:31,101
You have many enemies, my king, but I
swear to you, I'm not one of them.

633
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:35,156
I love Sansa,

634
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,025
as I loved her mother.

635
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:51,023
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

636
00:44:16,938 --> 00:44:18,689
- Ready?
- Ready?

637
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:23,730
Ready!

638
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:28,299
Come on.

639
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:34,105
- Yah!
- Come on!

640
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:24,810
Nymeria?

641
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:42,630
Nymeria,
it's me, Arya.

642
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:49,937
I'm heading north, girl.

643
00:46:52,454 --> 00:46:54,995
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

644
00:46:58,459 --> 00:46:59,920
Come with me.

645
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:11,443
Come with me.

646
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,272
That's not you.

647
00:47:57,146 --> 00:47:59,879
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

648
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,262
I'm oldest.

649
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,864
Mama will want Cersei
for herself.

650
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:05,442
She's not my mama.

651
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:07,596
You can have Cersei.

652
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,840
I want the Mountain.

653
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:12,215
The Mountain
killed Father.

654
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:13,919
He'll crush you
with one hand.

655
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:16,684
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

656
00:48:16,747 --> 00:48:18,955
Will you shut up
about Mama?

657
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,688
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

658
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:24,333
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

659
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,184
And then I won't
have to share.

660
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,239
"Mama!"

661
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:33,934
How can you drink
this piss?

662
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:35,817
When we reach
Sunspear,

663
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:38,419
I'll treat you
to a Dornish red.

664
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,871
The best
in the world.

665
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,312
Have you ever
been to Dorne?

666
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:44,106
A few times.

667
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:45,688
Never stayed long.

668
00:48:45,946 --> 00:48:47,487
A boy in every port?

669
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:50,067
A boy, a girl.

670
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:52,848
Depends on the port.

671
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,266
Could we get
some more?

672
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,598
I thought
it wasn't for you.

673
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:04,021
I'm developing
a taste for it.

674
00:49:05,391 --> 00:49:07,739
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

675
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,989
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

676
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,161
Once I kill my uncle.

677
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:18,356
And what will you be,
handsome?

678
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:20,286
Whatever
my queen commands.

679
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:24,090
He'll be my advisor,
my protector.

680
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:26,098
Oh, I see.

681
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:28,504
Your protector.

682
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:32,278
So, if someone gets
too close to you...

683
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:34,012
He might have
to intervene.

684
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:35,676
To hold
that person back.

685
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,458
Until they've made
their intentions known.

686
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,090
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

687
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,298
A foreign invasion
is underway.

688
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,589
Leave him be.

689
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,605
Seems like you
don't need a protector.

690
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,522
Stay here.

691
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,651
We're under attack!

692
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:31,010
Euron.

693
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:41,606
You mother's below deck.
Keep her safe.

694
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,866
Aah!

695
00:52:48,614 --> 00:52:49,895
Yah!

696
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,648
Aah!

697
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:16,126
Yah!

698
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:18,891
Yah!

699
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:38,169
Kill us.

700
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:39,870
Get it over with.

701
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,549
Give your uncle a kiss.

702
00:54:42,933 --> 00:54:44,891
Little Theon!

703
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,965
Ah, come on,
you cockless coward.

704
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:07,456
I have her.

705
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:09,440
Come and get her.
