1
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,437
I'm John Dykstra.

2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,524
Here today with me are Scott Stokdyk
and Anthony LaMolinara.

3
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,776
Anthony was director of animation.

4
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:30,198
Scott's the visual effects supervisor
for SPI. Imageworks.

5
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,577
And I am the visual effects designer.

6
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,334
This title sequence was done
by Imaginary Forces.

7
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:55,264
The important part of the relationship
between the people in visual effects...

8
00:00:55,431 --> 00:01:00,436
...and the people who were doing the
title sequence was obviously the web.

9
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:06,067
We worked with them to come up with
a web that gave the impression...

10
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:10,363
...of the web that's in the movie,
but keep the stylized quality...

11
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:15,409
...that our director wanted to have
for the title sequence.

12
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,734
Some of the volumes
that you see here...

13
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,697
...the Spider-Man character, the hand,
the Goblin's face...

14
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:58,536
...was interpreted from the geometry
that we used for our virtual character.

15
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,206
They simplified it and put it
into the sequence.

16
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,793
They were trying for
something that wasn't real.

17
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:10,631
They wanted a stylized version
of the web and the characters.

18
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,924
They succeeded.

19
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,053
- So we shared. There you are.
- Yeah, there I am. That's me.

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,473
- "Visual effects designed by."
- Yeah.

21
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,396
We shared a couple models,
passed some models over.

22
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,825
I hope we get to do the next one.

23
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:42,830
- The next set of titles.
- The next opening sequence.

24
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:53,674
It's interesting, because
it's this sort of period graphic...

25
00:02:53,841 --> 00:03:00,097
...that goes on the front of a movie
that is fairly starkly real.

26
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:12,902
If we did these as photo-realistic
webs for this whole sequence...

27
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,280
...it would have taken months.

28
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,788
This is the transition from
our stylized web into the real web.

29
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,499
The opening scene of the film.

30
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,169
The background for this
was shot in New York...

31
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:35,174
...and they overlaid the synthetic web
from the title sequence...

32
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,637
...across the cross-dissolve
to create the opening sequence.

33
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,848
Originally, wasn't it...

34
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:48,396
...a cross-dissolve behind her head,
where the bus materialized?

35
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:54,110
There were a couple of different ideas
of introducing the opening sequence...

36
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,988
...introducing Mary Jane,
whom the story is about...

37
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,867
...as is said in the monologue.

38
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,702
But this was the...

39
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,791
This was chosen as the best means
to make that transition...

40
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:14,964
...because it didn't leave us looking
at her for a huge amount of time.

41
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:19,343
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

42
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:29,270
That's a good look for Tobey
with those glasses.

43
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,483
And like that.

44
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,613
We shot all of this stuff...

45
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,535
Throughout the film, we used
live-action locations in New York.

46
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:52,001
In some cases we shot in Los Angeles
to be substituted for New York.

47
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:57,423
And sometimes we created components
completely synthetically...

48
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,844
...that are added into both locations
in Los Angeles and New York...

49
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,764
...to create our version
of New York City.

50
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,524
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?

51
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,526
The entrance is right there.

52
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,405
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

53
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,949
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

54
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,661
Lot of setup here. Lot of exposition.

55
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,790
One of the things
that we're gonna talk about...

56
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:37,254
Working with Sam was terrific.
He's a very collaborative director.

57
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,382
Using his version of the script...

58
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,387
...the script that he approved
and interpreted to us...

59
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:50,726
...we started creating the preliminary
visual effects for this movie.

60
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:57,399
Sam not only welcomed...

61
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,486
...contributions from people
on the crew...

62
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,071
...he encouraged it.

63
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:06,992
He was the arbiter of all the stuff
used in the film, as the director...

64
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:13,624
...but everybody got the feeling that
they had a vested interest in this...

65
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,920
...in some very small part
as a filmmaker...

66
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:22,258
...as well as whatever
their particular job was.

67
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,844
I think that comes through
in the sense of this movie.

68
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,348
I think it trickled on down
through the whole crew.

69
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:34,478
Our CG supervisors, Ken Hahn,
Peter Nofz and Dan Eaton...

70
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:40,442
...they at different points had input
into the process, which was nice.

71
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,239
It's unreal.

72
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:49,201
Getting close to our first
effects shot. Any minute now.

73
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,869
The atomic spider.

74
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,915
One of the things about this story
is it's a period piece.

75
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:59,837
In the original origin, the character's
bitten by an irradiated spider.

76
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,465
We now know, if you get bitten
by an irradiated spider...

77
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,094
...you'll probably get
radiation poisoning.

78
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:12,266
But in those days it imbued the
character with superhuman capabilities.

79
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:18,856
Rather than use a sort of old saw
for this superhero transition...

80
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,443
...Sam brought the story
into a contemporary vein...

81
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:28,490
...by using the DNA basis.

82
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,120
Genetics, this genome-splicing
capability...

83
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:38,334
...as the component to cause
the transition from our normal kid...

84
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,546
...to the superhero character,
Spider-Man.

85
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:48,469
That contemporary science brings
the film into a contemporary sense.

86
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,849
When she describes the characteristics
of all these spiders...

87
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,811
...we think about what Spider-Man
will do with those powers.

88
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:02,608
It'll be a spider
trapped in a man's body...

89
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,737
...dying to get out.

90
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,658
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...

91
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,662
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on.

92
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,414
That's part of how
Spider-Man moves.

93
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:21,669
His molecular structure
has been changed after this bite...

94
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,466
...so that he no longer moves according
to the physical rules we know...

95
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:32,721
...with human bodies, but something
combined between human and spider.

96
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,143
- Like a Spider-Man?
- Just like that.

97
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,690
One of the things I point out
in the live-action material:

98
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,567
The personality of these characters...

99
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:50,197
...both Tobey and Willem...

100
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:54,702
...they are the basis...

101
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,997
...for our hero and our villain.

102
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,876
Their postures, positions
and body language...

103
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,755
...are an important part
of defining them as a character.

104
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:11,218
Keeping an eye on that, trying to
integrate that into the characters...

105
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,847
...once they are masked
and dressed in costume...

106
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,560
...was a very important part of
making the character seem...

107
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,522
...like he was an extension
of the actor...

108
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,817
...as we have seen him
without the costume.

109
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,491
Here's Tobey getting ready
to take his photo.

110
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:38,746
You did a lot of photography
a long time ago, didn't you, John?

111
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,039
Oh, yeah. That was me, actually.

112
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,419
I got bitten by a spider.
It bit me in my visual-effects lobe.

113
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,630
Trying to get the girls
by taking their picture.

114
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,469
I did fashion photography when
I was in college. It was terrific.

115
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,723
You do a headsheet.

116
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,518
- There's our first effects shot.
- There you go.

117
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,230
- The beautiful crawling spider.
- That pesky spider.

118
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:11,069
A close-up is coming up,
which was a lot harder on many levels.

119
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,781
That was a real spider, and...

120
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:16,784
Stand by.

121
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,662
This guy let the spider crawl
on his hand. It isn't Tobey.

122
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,373
The guy who did the spider shot quit.

123
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,835
This bite is so short.
It was a much longer shot...

124
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,672
...and we just see a little snippet
of the actual bite.

125
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,220
It actually sits on his hand
and grinds into his fangs for a while.

126
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,058
Parker, let's do it.

127
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:47,981
To get that close-up of that hand
that the close-up spider was on...

128
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,320
- John, you want to talk about that?
- Yes, I'd be pleased to.

129
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,947
First matte painting.

130
00:10:55,197 --> 00:11:00,828
The close-up of the hand was done
with a very special piece of optics...

131
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,914
...designed for photo-microscopy...

132
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,042
...which is microscopic photography.

133
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,046
We used special strobe lights
to illuminate the hand...

134
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:16,844
...to give us enough brightness to make
the entire hand be in relative focus.

135
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:22,182
It was recorded at high speed to out
down on the quivering of the hand...

136
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,893
...so we could put
our CG spider on there.

137
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,688
I talked over the guy
landing the glider.

138
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,941
We were just looking
at our first effects.

139
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,736
There's a practical glider,
but we added effects.

140
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,866
We added heat distortion,
thrusters coming out the bottom...

141
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,870
And heat distortion.

142
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,539
One thing that's interesting:

143
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,376
Sam's concept for this movie
was for it to be real.

144
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,963
It's not Metropolis. It's not Gotham.
It's New York...

145
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,759
...right down to the pigeon droppings
and the rust underneath the pipes.

146
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:04,600
Throughout the film,
he'd ask us to pursue...

147
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:10,272
...a very "real" effect
in all of these environments.

148
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,692
The toughest thing to do
when we made virtual versions...

149
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:19,114
...of the characters and the objects
was putting in high-frequency noise.

150
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:24,119
By that, I mean the dirt and debris...

151
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,872
...that populates our real life.

152
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,459
Dust bunnies under the bed,
stains on the wall...

153
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,337
...the pigeon droppings
on the windowsill.

154
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:38,216
That's tough for a computer to do
because it's random, a chaotic event.

155
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:43,805
So although we were successful...

156
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,433
Scott can talk about
the procedures...

157
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:52,272
...but we had our artists go back in
and add dirt to many sequences...

158
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:59,154
...to give you the visual cues that
this is real, not computer-generated.

159
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:05,827
A lot of texture work on this movie.
Many thousand textures.

160
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,498
We figured out there were
62,000 textures painted.

161
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,460
A texture is a...?

162
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,882
It's basically just a color map
that's mapped onto objects...

163
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,636
...and represents its texture,
if you will.

164
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,806
It represents its look...

165
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,309
Like taking the textures
from Tobey's face...

166
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,647
...and laying them on
the model of Tobey's face...

167
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:38,193
...to achieve the look and try
to make it look realistic.

168
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,865
- The texture is basically a photograph.
- Starts out as a photograph.

169
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,786
A photograph of the surface
you want to reproduce...

170
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,373
...in the computer environment.

171
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,333
The artists add to it...

172
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,129
...and then that photograph
could be shrink-wrapped...

173
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,717
...or vacuum-formed onto the shape,
which we call the geometry...

174
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,387
...of the person or the object
that we're creating.

175
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,849
Since the photograph contains
all of that detail...

176
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,643
...you get that in your
representation.

177
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,147
This is not Tobey Maguire's body.

178
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,775
But he'd love to have it.

179
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,195
It was Tobey's head
mapped onto that body.

180
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:27,367
It was a big tracking job.
And color-correction job too.

181
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,495
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

182
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:39,546
We did some digital color-timing
on many of these sequences.

183
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:45,886
When you take original photography
and bring it into the computer...

184
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,556
...you have to make adjustments
to the color...

185
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,643
...to make sure when you take it
out of the computer...

186
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,189
...it will look like
the original photography.

187
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:01,985
This is a nice matte painting.
The OSCORP image.

188
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,905
Done by Ivo,
one of our matte painters.

189
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:11,703
The image from the computer
needs to cut back into the movie...

190
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,081
...adjacent to original negatives.

191
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:20,545
Rather than make it significantly
different from the original photography...

192
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,591
...we try and make it match
the original photography...

193
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,970
...so when they do color correction,
everything falls into place.

194
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:35,477
But in many sequences, especially
with cross-dissolves and fades...

195
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,564
...you have scene-to-scene
color timing that's critical.

196
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:43,527
So we did an awful lot
of digital color adjustment...

197
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:48,115
...throughout those montage sequences.

198
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,452
I was wrong before. Ivo,
the head of our matte department...

199
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,081
...painted the daytime
OSCORP lab exterior...

200
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,334
...and Dave Bleisch
painted the nighttime version.

201
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:08,260
Norman Osborn is put into this thing,
this dramatic moment...

202
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,930
...and he goes, "It's cold!"
when he straps him in.

203
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,517
I think that's pretty interesting.

204
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:20,021
We're coming up to the green gas
modification shots.

205
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:25,902
They didn't want to shoot with
toxic green gas, for some reason.

206
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,612
I don't understand it.

207
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,492
So our friends at Digiscope
did a handful of shots...

208
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,872
...maybe 10 to 15 color-correction
shots on the gas.

209
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,138
Started out as white smoke
and got turned into green.

210
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,102
Norman?

211
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,690
One of the things Anthony
talked about earlier was...

212
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,570
...characters going from being
human to superhuman.

213
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,532
One of the things that people
talked about...

214
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,579
...was whether or not we used
motion capture for our characters.

215
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,750
Although I have an opinion,
Anthony's might differ.

216
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,420
I think motion capture's
an interesting technique...

217
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:31,301
...to get the detail that defines
a person's body language.

218
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,848
Motion capture is essentially a series
of measurement points attached...

219
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,808
...to a person's body.

220
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:42,354
You have that person
go through a series of moves...

221
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,148
...and then you record those points.

222
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:50,695
It allows you to then animate a
synthetic version of that character.

223
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:56,910
When we did our motion capture,
we got great high-frequency detail...

224
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,330
...in terms of defining
a character's personality.

225
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,543
But if you have a character
jump off a three-foot-high box...

226
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,672
...that high-frequency detail
gives away...

227
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,841
...that all he did was jump off a box.

228
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:18,473
So the animators have to expand
the personality of this leap...

229
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,768
...into something for a 100-foot fall.

230
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:28,525
Although the motion capture for
high-frequency detail was very good...

231
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,860
...that same detail was a giveaway...

232
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:35,198
...when we made him
do superhuman things.

233
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,286
That's Tobey's real body, by the way.

234
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,162
Superhuman.

235
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:47,002
As a result, the principal characters,
Goblin and Spider-Man...

236
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,005
...were key-frame animated...

237
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,757
To use the high-frequency detail...

238
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,176
...we had to do so much adjustment...

239
00:18:55,343 --> 00:19:01,182
...it would take longer to do it that
way than to animate it from the top.

240
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,398
Another thing about motion capture...

241
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:12,319
...as the technology exists right now,
it is cumbersome.

242
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,156
You have to dress up in a Lycra suit...

243
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,909
...and have these big, reflective balls
stuck all over you.

244
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,580
You can't go outside a 30-by-30 area.

245
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,834
There's a lot of new technology
that's being developed.

246
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,921
Hopefully, it'll be
a little less restrictive...

247
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,383
...in how you capture the data,
and the setup for it.

248
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:40,513
Not that it'll necessarily influence
our choice of doing motion capture.

249
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:45,810
I always tell people how pissed off
the gorilla got in Hollow Man...

250
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:50,982
- ...when we stuck those balls on him.
- And shaved him. Or her.

251
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,320
We missed it. There were two
beautiful wire removals there.

252
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:59,366
Him flying out, the doctor flying out,
and Willem flying out.

253
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,743
As far as motion capture goes...

254
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,915
...even if, say, a guy from
Cirque du Soleil...

255
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,001
...could swing down
between the buildings...

256
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,714
...the technology's not there
to capture that in that distance.

257
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,761
Yeah, it's too big. When you compress
that action into a small space...

258
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,639
...it looks compressed
into a small space.

259
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:27,352
So the accuracy of the capture
is also a curse.

260
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,524
If you don't use a real actor you can tell
just because of the way he moves.

261
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,194
Anything Spider-Man would do...

262
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,864
...shooting a web one way,
then changing directions...

263
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,825
The G-force on his body...

264
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:47,038
...if it didn't rip his arm out,
would rip his whole body in half.

265
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,333
It's impossible for a person to do...

266
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,255
...and therefore impossible
for a real person to fake.

267
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,717
Tobey looking at his hands
is a precursor...

268
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,179
...to the close-up of his hands
that comes up.

269
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,724
Dad, are you all right?

270
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,813
- Dad's been out for a fun night.
- Exactly.

271
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:16,401
A couple of other things,
just definitions.

272
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:23,074
One, we decided that the Spider-Man
character wanted to be...

273
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,828
...a mechanism by which
the audience experiences...

274
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,540
...what it's like to swing
between buildings.

275
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,961
At the end of the film,
Sam wanted the audience...

276
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,589
...to feel they had been Spider-Man.

277
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:43,553
The animators worked with a camera
as well as the character...

278
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,016
...much like a skydiving team works.

279
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:52,145
The guy doing the performance
is photographed...

280
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,607
...by his partner,
the skydiving photographer.

281
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,651
We're gonna see some webs
in a minute.

282
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,572
Lot of web shots.
One of our guys...

283
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:07,160
This is a mechanical rig,
where he catches all this stuff.

284
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,245
Yeah. He actually did that.

285
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:16,711
Pretty good. Take 156.

286
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,923
At any rate...

287
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:24,511
...we decided that Spider-Man,
when he swung through the city...

288
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,305
...would have his own
cameraman with him.

289
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,975
The cameraman had the same
abilities as Spider-Man...

290
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,436
...and was able to operate the camera.

291
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,526
The cameraman gets better over the
course of the film as does Spider-Man.

292
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,071
He gets more adept
at doing the photography.

293
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,075
That's another way we added
this sense of reality to things.

294
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:51,496
This is a practical...
The first one's a practical web.

295
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,209
That's a real one, and then this...

296
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,169
That last one's a CG.

297
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:03,800
The first one was our effects shot.
That's practical, and then...

298
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,636
I can't even tell anymore.

299
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,722
Our guy, Theo,
set up this great web system...

300
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:14,769
...including the dynamics and shading,
just to be multipurposed.

301
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:20,650
To work for small webs, and to work
for the large-scale webs he swings on.

302
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:25,822
This fight scene coming up,
as well as Wirework that's in this...

303
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,367
There is a wire attached,
lifting him up in the air...

304
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:34,914
...or supporting him so he can
lean back and not lose his balance.

305
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:39,961
A lot of these shots were speeded up
in certain sections of this shot...

306
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,797
...to give them more force,
like the punch.

307
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,882
John should talk about this.

308
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,884
Well, this is spider sense.

309
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:51,180
It's made up of all of the components
that you want to see...

310
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,100
...when you think about
what Spider-Man can do.

311
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,062
It's expanded time.
Why don't you talk about the fight?

312
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:04,193
We took part of the punch and sped
it up so that there's more force...

313
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:08,281
...and slowed it down at the right
moment so it's not so obvious.

314
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,702
And the one long shot where we see
that arm just glide by him...

315
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,872
...and Tobey sees everything
in slow motion.

316
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,625
That's another idea
of the spider sense.

317
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,670
He's in one temporal realm,
they're all in a different one.

318
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,009
And here, for example,
when he grabs Flash's arm.

319
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:32,263
It's speeded up, then back
to real speed as he holds it...

320
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,391
...and then it's speeded up again
for the punch.

321
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,893
Which one?

322
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:44,567
There were so many shots that were
sped up and slowed down.

323
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,822
Both Stan and Bob
liked experimenting with that.

324
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,493
- We tried a little bit of it too.
- All right.

325
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,705
Spider sense, by its very definition,
is time expansion.

326
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:02,543
Spider-Man slows everything down to
inspect all these potential threats.

327
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:08,216
The beginning of this, where you saw
the fly being inspected...

328
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,552
...were events that he had
no control over.

329
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:16,015
His spider sense, which is newly
developed, checked out all this stuff.

330
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,643
It gives you a sense
of his ineptitude.

331
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,730
Next is a sequence where you see
his first experimentation...

332
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,483
...with his newfound powers.

333
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,363
That's the spider's
genetic modification to his wrist.

334
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,742
It's not exactly where
the spinneret ought to be, but...

335
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,038
We figured putting it in
the right place might be a mistake.

336
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,750
There's the big microscopic hair shot.

337
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:47,088
- This is how he climbs up the wall.
- That was Theo's shot too.

338
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:51,926
A lot of tight tracking work
to get those to work too.

339
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:56,472
Here are our first real
digital environment shots, actually.

340
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:01,561
They're extension shots.
That's a fake alley floor there.

341
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,312
And there.

342
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,070
When we look up on the side,
it's all building extensions.

343
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,867
This was the beginning of
the personality for this camera.

344
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:22,081
The idea that the camera actually rose
with him, kind of stayed with him.

345
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,712
Keeping the camera with the character,
as opposed to watching him from afar.

346
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,342
Most of this is Wirework.

347
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,970
It's our video-game shots.

348
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:39,390
We were going to use a stuntman,
but they decided...

349
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:45,646
...that it was not practical to do.
It was a little too dangerous.

350
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,858
Here's the first webs that he shoots.

351
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,736
He's figuring how
to control his webs...

352
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:56,949
...and how to dictate where they go.

353
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,869
Up, up and away, web.

354
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:05,333
So the web, this is Theo's work...

355
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,503
...has a huge range of personalities.

356
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:13,800
It comes out of his wrist, it's
thin and willowy in some cases.

357
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,260
It's big and strong in others.

358
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:20,014
It has to spread into an actual
spider web in some cases...

359
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:24,310
...and in other cases it's a lump
on somebody's face.

360
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,897
An enormous effort went into
defining the web.

361
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:33,361
If you think about real webs, the
biggest problem is, they're invisible.

362
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,989
If bugs could see the webs,
they wouldn't fly into them.

363
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:42,245
We knew that, in order to meet
the expectations of an audience...

364
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:46,040
...who knows of spider webs
as just glints...

365
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:51,420
...we had to figure out a way to make
the web like a spider web...

366
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:56,259
...in that it had what we called a
sundog defining it by highlight...

367
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,847
...and keep enough volume
to feel it was strong enough...

368
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,684
...to do whatever it was
we were asking the web to do.

369
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:09,146
There are a number of practical webs
intercut with our CG ones.

370
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:13,192
The web had to be flexible
enough to look practical...

371
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,028
...or go away from that
when we needed to.

372
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:20,950
That last shot where he was swinging
on the web and hits the wall...

373
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:28,040
We'll see him almost do the same thing
when he's in his homemade spidey suit.

374
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:31,711
Then he just misses it
at the last moment.

375
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,880
Gotten a little better.

376
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,007
We've got this character arc.

377
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:40,052
He's not so facile
when he first gains that capability.

378
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,723
Over the course of the film,
he gets better and better.

379
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,895
You see that happen. Also, the way
he is followed through the film...

380
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,607
The camera work also gets
better and better.

381
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:57,737
So everybody's kind of got this same
learning curve.

382
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,408
I guess you can always hear us.

383
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,869
Everybody shouts.

384
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,621
Your aunt and uncle don't.

385
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,457
When we were shooting this stuff...

386
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:13,461
...you see these scenes that last
two or three minutes...

387
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:17,673
...yet it takes an entire night
to shoot this stuff.

388
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,177
This was a situation where
color correction was used.

389
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:26,599
Over the course of the evening,
we went from dusk to night to dawn.

390
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,893
And it wasn't shot in continuity.

391
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,438
In some cases,
they're taking light out of a scene.

392
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:38,486
In other cases, they're adding light
to make it all consistent throughout.

393
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:45,242
A difficult problem
when he was on the roof...

394
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:51,165
...is that the actual size it needs
to be to see it in the distance...

395
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:55,670
...is gigantic as opposed to
what it really would be.

396
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,215
Yet I buy it when I see it on screen.

397
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,426
The illusion in the service
of the story.

398
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:07,431
It's cinemagraphic license,
making the web change size.

399
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:11,227
Also, depending on the background...

400
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:15,690
...we had to do different things
if it went over a bright sky.

401
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,901
The whiter specular hits
wouldn't show up as much.

402
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:24,657
You had to get some dark in there,
and sundogs running down too.

403
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:31,080
The web had several different states.
It's liquid when shot from his wrist.

404
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,709
As it attached to things,
it did a catalyzation...

405
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,922
...which was a change of state,
like water becoming ice.

406
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:45,761
When it changed state, there was a
difference to the visual personality.

407
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:50,808
You can see when it strikes a building
when he swings through the city...

408
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:56,647
...the web has a transition that occurs
once it's stuck to a surface.

409
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:02,153
He also seems, through some
psycho-physio process...

410
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,990
...to make the web come out and have
different consistencies.

411
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:11,704
One time it would be hard as steel,
another it would be elastic...

412
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:16,167
...and he could pull on it and
pop himself up to a building.

413
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:23,549
Just like a mutant spider could,
I'm sure.

414
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,135
Absolutely.

415
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,185
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

416
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,562
Come on.

417
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,981
I gotta go.

418
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:45,279
Something I'd like to do in the sequel
is put Tobey's idiosyncrasies...

419
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:49,408
...into the digital actor.

420
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:54,705
There's another alleyway.
Lots of alleyways in this movie.

421
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,501
Cool car.

422
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,721
John was talking about the performance
of the digital actor.

423
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,766
In this film, we're almost
working backward.

424
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:18,479
Usually you work
from the facial expression down...

425
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:22,024
...as far as the hierarchy
of what gives the expression.

426
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:25,569
In this case,
there is no facial expression.

427
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:31,117
Spider-Man maybe has a jaw moving.
Goblin has nothing.

428
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,702
It's a very big challenge...

429
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,706
...to try to let this digital actor...

430
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,127
...emote from body movement.

431
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,466
Goblin is certainly more complex
than Spider-Man...

432
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:53,264
...with his Shakespearean moves
and psychotic personality...

433
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,143
...that goes from kind to sadistic.

434
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:02,106
That was a very big challenge,
something we'll develop more next time.

435
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:08,195
The interesting thing about
the personality of this character...

436
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:12,408
Sam asked, and maybe
you can give input...

437
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:17,663
...that we use some of the classic
Spider-Man poses...

438
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:21,709
...to brand this character
from the comic books.

439
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:26,130
I know the animators
had that stuff as reference.

440
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:30,885
Do you have a sense of
how you integrated that stuff?

441
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,513
Certainly, we worked
from all of the comics...

442
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:41,061
...then tried to figure out what pose
works best in a given situation.

443
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,648
If he's perched,
waiting for something.

444
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,943
In the last swing,
there are a lot of...

445
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,364
...typical key Spider-Man poses.

446
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,075
When his hands are raised
over his head...

447
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:59,580
...his wrists are arched and
his fingers are in a formation.

448
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:03,667
That's a good example of these poses.

449
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,630
It comes from the storyboard artist
and animators...

450
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,091
...on up through me, you, Sam...

451
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:15,971
...and everybody else who's
watching this film on a daily basis.

452
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:21,143
The other interesting thing...
You talked about Willem Dafoe.

453
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:27,441
When we started defining what the
Goblin would be like as a character...

454
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:31,654
...we started with this conveyance,
the Goblin glider.

455
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,660
We built a simulator,
a motion base with a glider attached.

456
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,247
It boiled down to something
like a mechanical bull...

457
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,376
...only you had to stand on it.
It was an ankle-breaker.

458
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,921
We worked with the stunt people
to figure out a way...

459
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:54,218
...to come up with something
to give them a timing choreography...

460
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,096
...so when it moved,
they'd anticipate it...

461
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:03,519
...and position themselves to look
as if they're affecting the machine.

462
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:08,607
Interestingly, we weren't successful
with the stunt people...

463
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:15,364
...but when Willem Dafoe showed up
and started to define the character...

464
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:21,453
...they stuck him on the machine,
and within 15 minutes of riding...

465
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,459
...he didn't put new moves in,
he's just reacting to the machine...

466
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:33,257
...he managed to come up with
these terrific moves for the Goblin.

467
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:38,137
I don't know how you feel about it,
Anthony, but for me...

468
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:42,224
...when I saw him on the machine,
I was encouraged...

469
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:47,021
...as to how well the character
was going to work on the glider.

470
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,190
That was the first experience...

471
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,986
...of seeing the actor
define the character for us...

472
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,031
- ...to bring to the screen.
- Go ahead.

473
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:01,493
This sequence is interesting
for color correction...

474
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,415
...because their skin tones
were so different.

475
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:10,502
Ben had a more ruddy,
reddish complexion.

476
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:16,175
Tobey leaned toward olive tones and
went green, if you weren't careful.

477
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:21,513
Especially in two-shots, where they're
together. This was tricky.

478
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,519
I remember when Willem came in.

479
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:32,232
The pumpkin bombs
pop out of the glider...

480
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:37,780
...and when he had his mask on,
he couldn't see where they came from.

481
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:43,202
He had to learn how to catch the bombs
just by feel...

482
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,246
...or having his hand
in the right place.

483
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:52,419
He ended up doing the work
that a stuntman would normally do.

484
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:59,301
He dedicated himself to creating
body-language personality for Goblin.

485
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:05,682
He was so studious in terms
of his positions in every situation...

486
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,853
...as to whether or not it was
appropriate for the Goblin.

487
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:18,821
A lot of effects guys tried to go in
and be extras in the movie.

488
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:22,408
One guy, Jeff Wolverton,
made it into this match...

489
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,077
...holding a Bone Saw sign.

490
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:29,998
- Is that him in the bikini?
- Yeah, that's him on the left.

491
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:38,132
I haven't spotted him, but I'm going
to go frame-by-frame on the DVD.

492
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,345
It's the guy trying to pitch a film.

493
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:48,183
The thing I didn't realize the first
couple times I saw this movie...

494
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,438
...is that it's Bruce Campbell
in a cameo as the announcer.

495
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:57,943
Bruce is the hero from Sam's movies.

496
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:01,280
And you're participating
under your own free will?

497
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:05,492
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

498
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,750
Here's a case where it's
a reverse of the norm.

499
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:19,506
Usually, they couldn't do what
they needed to do with a stuntman...

500
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,884
...so we did it digitally.

501
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,136
In this sequence...

502
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:30,267
...they did most everything
with the actor or a stuntman.

503
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:34,271
Wouldn't you like to have
done Bone Saw CG, though?

504
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,064
That would've been fun.

505
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,818
$3000 will be paid to...

506
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,739
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

507
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,700
That's it? That's the best you got?

508
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,994
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

509
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:53,665
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

510
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,293
...the terrifying, the deadly...

511
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,630
There's some web work
coming up in this sequence...

512
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:03,008
...and it's more of an
elastic-type web.

513
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,470
Anthony mentioned
the different characteristics.

514
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:09,723
In this sequence, Tobey uses...

515
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:15,187
...that web as just a very springy
substance to help him do some flips.

516
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,356
Almost like bungee cord.

517
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:25,072
This is another place, although
they did this actual work on-stage...

518
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:31,078
...this is another case where
the Cirque du Soleil performers...

519
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,539
...or performances were used.

520
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:39,044
The idea of the multiple webs
sort of like some of the stuff...

521
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:45,259
...that they do on multiple bungee
cords in Cirque du Soleil performances.

522
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,677
Cage!

523
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,807
There were some speed up
of some shots in here too.

524
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,727
Some skip-framing,
or different software sometimes...

525
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,565
...to speed it up and make it
look a little smoother.

526
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:03,485
...Please lock
the cage doors at this time.

527
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:08,490
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

528
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:12,160
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

529
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,162
Hey, freak show!

530
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,999
You're going nowhere.

531
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,543
I got you for three minutes.

532
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,004
Three minutes of playtime.

533
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,678
When we did tests
of our homemade costume...

534
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:33,348
...we used some of this photography...

535
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:37,102
...to check how our CG version
costume would light.

536
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,397
We really liked the dramatic
lighting here.

537
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:45,027
And it made for a good color
comparison kind of check.

538
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,284
Smash him!

539
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,996
One of the things that...

540
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:03,003
Back to this Green Goblin thing
we were talking about before...

541
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,590
One thing we did to make
the Green Goblin feel...

542
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,593
...as if he were a
contemporary character...

543
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,138
...is the motions of him
on his glider.

544
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:17,851
Rather than looking like he's
standing on top of a small airplane...

545
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,479
...and flying straight and level...

546
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,982
...we gave him the sense of motion
you get...

547
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:28,487
...from skateboarding and
surfing and snowboarding.

548
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:33,158
That kind of finesse that the
characters have in movement...

549
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:39,289
...you see in sports to bring this
into a contemporary vein as well.

550
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:43,710
Yeah, the Goblin's glider
is sort of like his pet.

551
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:49,216
Some kind of pet
that he can call at will...

552
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:54,805
...and watches out for him,
and comes back to him.

553
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:59,267
We had to give the feeling
like he controlled it...

554
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:04,356
...not completely by body movement.
A thought process was going on...

555
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:10,987
...as if he had to just lean and it
knew where to go, as opposed to...

556
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:14,199
...just pushing it around by leaning.

557
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:19,287
It was partially the understanding
of the Goblin and him as one.

558
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,457
- What the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

559
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,627
Hurry UP!

560
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,052
Hey! He stole the gate!

561
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,179
Stop that guy!

562
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,015
Stop him! He's got my money!

563
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:43,186
I like this costume.
It had interesting detail work...

564
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,647
...when we made our CG version.

565
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,025
One of the first things we did
were the shoes...

566
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,112
...which you don't really see here.

567
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:57,159
But he had these red Nike sneakers
we sort of did on a turntable...

568
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,495
...flying around a screen
to try to balance...

569
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,458
...how the colors and lighting
looked on it.

570
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,627
The interesting thing about
a movie like this...

571
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:11,882
...because it took two years,
we had to make promises...

572
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:17,554
...we weren't certain that we could
fulfill at the beginning of this film.

573
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:21,391
As any film of this scope,
it's a living document.

574
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,978
It has to be able to change
over the course of time.

575
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:28,982
The homemade costume
was something...

576
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:31,860
...that evolved over the course
of time.

577
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,655
The homemade costume wasn't
in the first script...

578
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:39,242
...certainly not as it ended up
being in the film.

579
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:43,497
And this is something
that we had to embrace.

580
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:47,125
It was different than
our hero character costume:

581
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:51,630
It's baggy and floppy and has folds
and the wind affects it.

582
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:54,132
So it was actually more challenging...

583
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,678
...than the more polished,
finished version of Spider-Man.

584
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:02,641
Definitely. We had to build
an extra layer, basically...

585
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:06,937
...on top of our slick costume
and do a cloth simulation.

586
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,565
John Lee did that and had to add in...

587
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:14,694
...all the effects where he's flying
and get those ripples...

588
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,739
...and the Wind's amplitude
and frequency...

589
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,367
...to just give him a sense of motion.

590
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:26,665
Multilayers of wrinkles,
wrinkling in there.

591
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:31,586
You can see on this sweatshirt
how many wrinkles and folds there are.

592
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:35,006
This is a little thicker
than our costume...

593
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:39,010
...but those kind of details
really give it realism.

594
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:43,765
The guys who did the cloth came up
with a garment workers' stamp...

595
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:48,061
- ...they put on dailies.
- Migrant textile workers of Imageworks.

596
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:51,731
An interesting thing about
this cloth:

597
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:57,487
When you make these costumes, you
end up using the same techniques...

598
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,573
...real patternmakers use.

599
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:05,328
So this cloth you see here was
fitted to the body of the character.

600
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:11,877
If it doesn't fit right in the chest,
it might come back and take a pleat.

601
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,962
We re-tailor it, basically.

602
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:18,133
And it's actually tailoring
the way a real tailor works.

603
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,469
That wall crawl is a great shot
by Spencer Cook.

604
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,432
It shows what we came to
for the character's movement.

605
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:29,311
First we tried suspending
him from a track...

606
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:35,483
...and let him crawl along the surface,
A stuntman or Tobey.

607
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,322
But there's no way you can
get the correct weight distribution.

608
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:44,034
You lift one hand,
they've got two feet and one arm...

609
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,954
...the way that pulls on the body,
it didn't look right.

610
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:51,416
Here's the shot
when he just misses the wall.

611
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,293
The camera follows him.

612
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,212
In one of those shots we had a bus...

613
00:45:56,421 --> 00:46:00,425
...and on top there's lettering.
We put "PT13" on there.

614
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:06,556
PT13 was just one of our first building
tests. It was an homage to that.

615
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:11,019
The thing about this fabric
in this sequence...

616
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:14,898
I think I heard you
talking about this, Anthony.

617
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,567
The fabric enhances
the sense of motion.

618
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:21,029
The idea that it's fluttering
helps the animators...

619
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:23,907
...keep a sense of motion
in the character.

620
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:27,452
The fabric gives an impression
of the wind moving.

621
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:31,623
It makes the animation...
It complements it.

622
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,709
It makes you aware of
how much clothing...

623
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:39,381
...is what tells you the kind
of movement a person is making.

624
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:46,012
There was a huge section of CG
buildings earlier in this sequence.

625
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:51,559
A lot of work went into it by Ken Hahn,
Francisco, Laurence, Dan Abrams...

626
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,813
...a bunch of really great lighters.

627
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,232
We did a couple of things here.

628
00:46:57,399 --> 00:47:01,778
One of them is this business
of adding New York...

629
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,450
...into Los Angeles and adding
New York into New York.

630
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,955
The buildings you see in some
of these sequences are from L.A...

631
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:14,708
...and some are from New York.

632
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,253
And there are buildings
that have been added...

633
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,964
...so you're gonna see more of that.

634
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:26,386
Here's the first animated shot in the
film. This shadow across the ceiling.

635
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:30,265
- That was the very first shot.
- One of our first finals.

636
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,934
Not that one. That's a live action.

637
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,520
This one.

638
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,025
He's animated, funny enough.

639
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,028
The rolling bear animation.

640
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,489
We did quite a few different
versions of that.

641
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:58,043
That must have been an
interesting thing to animate.

642
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:03,590
Indirect animation. You animate the
character and then cast his shadow.

643
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,885
Because you've got to go
by silhouettes.

644
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:12,140
What looks right from one angle
doesn't look right from another.

645
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,975
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

646
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,229
You had a version of the character
you were using...

647
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:24,027
...and he was in an impossible pose
to make a feasible-looking shadow.

648
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:27,280
It wasn't our final
physiquing on the character...

649
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,077
...so his shape wasn't perfect.
You had to manipulate that a bit.

650
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,003
That was some of Koji's
earliest physiquing there.

651
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,756
Part of an eight-month process.

652
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:49,636
"Physiquing" being the creation
of the model of the character.

653
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:55,517
Actually, the Goblin and Spider-Man
were set up by two different people...

654
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:59,020
...and set up in different ways.

655
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:05,443
Koji's version, Koji Morihiro,
set up Spider-Man.

656
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:10,031
He approaches it differently...

657
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:14,661
...than JJ Blumenkrantz
did on Goblin.

658
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,541
One of our guys, Alberto,
helped set up the Goblin system...

659
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:25,213
...which was based on an underlying
skeleton and muscle system.

660
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:31,553
The Goblin also had, in addition
to having a skin over Willem's skin...

661
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:36,683
...it had a hard exoskeleton
that had a little bit of flux in it...

662
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,102
...but basically, like, slid...

663
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:43,940
...slid up and down
his arms and his chest.

664
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:48,528
So it had to be a different technique
than our Spider-Man.

665
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:53,533
The definition of the physical form
of the peoples' bodies...

666
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,286
...also included a muscle system.

667
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:00,415
So when they flexed,
you could see a change displacement...

668
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:03,376
...in the forms of their body.

669
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:07,547
The legs, the contours of their thighs
and chests and arms.

670
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:12,886
There was also breathing. Anthony had
access to breathing controls.

671
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:17,265
Those are the kinds of subtle details
that tell the audience...

672
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:22,854
...that this is a live character,
as opposed to a CG simulation.

673
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:26,274
A lot of that work was based on
reference footage...

674
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:30,028
...we took of the actors and stunt
doubles at the start.

675
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:33,781
We put them through calisthenics
and range-of-motion tests...

676
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:39,120
...and basically took up days of their
time to get all of that set up work.

677
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:43,750
But it paid off. I mean, just having
video reference...

678
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,712
...of how the quads flex,
and the deltoids and biceps.

679
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:52,175
All through the body,
how muscles distort their volumes.

680
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:55,428
It was really useful.

681
00:50:56,137 --> 00:51:01,100
And it had to be there because when
he's in that custom-made costume...

682
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:06,314
...that's the only real feeling you get
of this character being alive.

683
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:10,360
Because the suit is tight,
there's no clothing to flow...

684
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:13,488
...and give the sense
of movement.

685
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:20,203
So it's more difficult to bring
the character to life in that costume.

686
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:27,752
I keep thinking of that shot
in the fire building later...

687
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:31,130
...where Spencer animated him landing.

688
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:36,886
It's just such a nice, subtle flex
in his quads on his legs as he lands.

689
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:43,059
It didn't make the out, but it gave a
sense of the weight of the landing.

690
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:48,022
When we first started doing the work
on this movie...

691
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:51,442
...we did a test as a proof of concept.

692
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:56,614
And we used a model of a body that
came from another environment.

693
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:01,411
It wasn't the real character, but we
put a Spider-Man costume on him...

694
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:07,292
...and had him climb up the side
of a set piece, a piece of set wall.

695
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:12,130
And when we did the test, we shot
the set wall with a camera move...

696
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:15,049
...with a stuntman crawling
on his belly...

697
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:19,095
...using a rig we'd designed
to let him slide on the surface.

698
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:22,265
The mechanical effects guys
put that together.

699
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:26,269
Then we shot the same camera move
without the character.

700
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:33,067
Then we took the version of the wall
without the character on it...

701
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:39,741
...and created a CGI version using
this existing model of this person.

702
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,536
Then Anthony and the guys...
Did Spencer animate that?

703
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,538
- That first test?
- Yeah.

704
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:49,917
Anyway, so we took this in
and showed it to them.

705
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:54,005
I don't know who the lighters were.
It was our first...

706
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:56,924
That was a long time ago.

707
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,804
- I think Greg Anderson was involved.
- So we gave it our best shot.

708
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:06,142
This was before we'd worked out
how we were going to do this.

709
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:11,230
We took it in, and the producer,
sort of as a tongue-in-cheek joke...

710
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:16,402
...told the executives
who were watching the film:

711
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,405
"So here's Tobey
climbing up the wall."

712
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:22,784
And they ran film.
The executives watched it.

713
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,828
The lights come up,
and they smile and say:

714
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:31,042
"It's great-looking, but that couldn't
have been Tobey. It's a stuntman."

715
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:38,049
So they had mistaken the animated,
computer-generated character...

716
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,968
...that animators had put
on the wall...

717
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:46,933
...and that SPI had lit and composited,
for a real image.

718
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:53,564
So we knew we had a shot at being
successful when they decided...

719
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:58,069
...our first test was indistinguishable
from a real human being.

720
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,530
You look back on those tests now...

721
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:05,576
...and Spider-Man looks nothing like
he does now in terms of his costume...

722
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,664
...and even some
of his body language.

723
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:13,334
On every movie we do a test on,
you look back...

724
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:17,505
...and that test looks so different
than the final product.

725
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:20,591
We were trying to arrive
in these tests...

726
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,971
...at the proper movement for him
to be a mix of man and spider.

727
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:31,394
That anecdote of Laura Ziskin
watching the screening and saying:

728
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:36,315
"Wow. You know, this character
looks like a man...

729
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,901
...but, well, like a spider."

730
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:42,113
Everybody said:
"That's exactly what it is."

731
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,577
And then we knew we had more or less
what we needed to sell this character.

732
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:52,790
A couple of shots ago, the camera
swinging through the city, shot in L.A.

733
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:57,378
That was where a couple of us
got a cameo. We were in on Sunday.

734
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:00,756
On the street corner.
And Sam's there waving.

735
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,968
And Bob, the editor, and you and I.

736
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,762
But you'd never find it on the DVD.

737
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:12,310
In trying to give this the feeling of
a camera flying through the street...

738
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:16,439
...there were amplitude
and frequency controls...

739
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,526
...so as the camera accelerated
into the skyscrapers...

740
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:25,573
...into these canyons,
the camera would shake...

741
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,202
...as if it were being shaken
by wind buffeting.

742
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,747
As it came up, it would slow
down and steady out...

743
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:37,001
...and then hang in the air
to give the feeling of an operator...

744
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,588
...following along with Spider-Man.

745
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,008
<i>But we should all just give him
One big hug</i>

746
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:50,932
On this montage sequence they cut in
some of our very early shots...

747
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,395
...from the original teaser trailers
and in the early trailers.

748
00:55:56,562 --> 00:56:01,484
If we tried to follow along with
the character, that didn't work.

749
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:06,155
You had to let him go away,
then come back to the camera.

750
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:09,158
And let the character work the frame...

751
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:12,328
...while depending on
where he was headed.

752
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:18,584
Work it from bottom left
to upper right, or opposite.

753
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:22,630
Give this feeling of an operator
behind this camera...

754
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,132
...following this digital actor.

755
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,634
What's he got to hide?

756
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,845
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

757
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,473
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this.

758
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,601
We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...

759
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:41,148
I was trying to figure out what was on
that TV. What movie we're showing...

760
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:44,986
They switched there,
but it was some old horror film.

761
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,029
Some monster, big monster.

762
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,824
Sam loves sneaking little things in.

763
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:52,868
He would never give away
his secrets.

764
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:56,622
I'm sure you have to watch it
many times to find that.

765
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:00,167
Some creature coming out of the water.

766
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:04,547
Aren't those, like, oil-spill victims?

767
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,218
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

768
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:13,472
The interior of that office
existed in three places.

769
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,392
It was built on the stage once...

770
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,938
...then it was photographed
in a location in downtown L.A.

771
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:26,694
Then it was rebuilt in another piece
shot yet again on a separate stage.

772
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:30,781
That sets up the interesting
problem that there was...

773
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:36,203
...after Goblin comes crashing through
into Jameson's office...

774
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:40,750
...and then Spider-Man comes down
outside the window...

775
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,170
...and the Goblin knocks him out.

776
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,214
When he falls down
the side of the building...

777
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:50,593
Because of the lights
for the shots to match...

778
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,014
...we had to do a matte painting
of the building, right?

779
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,475
I'm talking to you! Hey!

780
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,977
Yes, Enrique, okay? I get you!

781
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:04,273
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

782
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,194
The process is interesting.
You shoot all this material...

783
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:10,780
...and they edit the thing together.

784
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,909
There's times when complete
sequences get left out.

785
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:18,037
And you end up with a sequence shot...

786
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:22,416
...for a particular time of day
used at a different time.

787
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:28,005
Or a shot even where a shot that was
made with the sun in one direction...

788
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:32,760
...cut with the sun in another
direction, or perhaps the sun gone.

789
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:37,598
Those are things now, although they've
always been a part of it...

790
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,893
...those are things now
that we are using...

791
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,689
...digital color timing and techniques
to smooth out...

792
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:50,111
...so they don't create as big
a disconnect for the audience.

793
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,949
The trick is to get people
to not be aware of being in a theatre.

794
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:59,161
The one thing we would never do
though, is flip a shot.

795
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,082
Are you being facetious?

796
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:08,462
You're still sensitive about
your Times Square shot they flipped.

797
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:12,174
The whole process,
every studio, every group...

798
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:17,138
...every visual effects house
has a different approach...

799
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:22,017
...to how they're going
to work together.

800
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:26,188
Even within a certain house,
you'll find that every group...

801
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:31,527
...certainly every effects designer, is
gonna have a different way of working.

802
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:37,533
On this, we were all together.
All departments saw dailies together.

803
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,829
And I think that was healthy
because everybody contributes.

804
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:48,085
It may hurt to hear what they have
to say, but it usually makes it better.

805
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:51,005
We would separate animation dailies...

806
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:56,677
...where we were blocking out the shots
with lighting and compositing dailies.

807
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:03,517
John, Anthony and I, and some
supervisors would sit in all of them.

808
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,436
Peter Parker.

809
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,855
Maybe you'll tell me who she is.

810
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,442
It's interesting,
we've had stuff to say...

811
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,154
...about the first part,
but it hasn't been intense.

812
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:20,034
I guess it's the same kind
of distribution a lot of films have.

813
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:24,872
But there was an effort in this to
focus on the people at the beginning...

814
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,417
...to establish these characters
and create empathy...

815
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:35,132
...before we got too carried away
with the visual theatrics.

816
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,804
If it ended now, you wouldn't
call it an effects film.

817
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,305
It would just be...

818
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:45,810
No, and I'd still be wondering what
happened at the beginning.

819
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,020
...About photography.

820
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:51,607
Hello.

821
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:54,610
Let's go!

822
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:58,697
This was interesting.
This was a fascinating sequence.

823
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,995
It became evident that the character...

824
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:09,750
...in this custom-made costume,
when he would be animated...

825
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:14,839
...the best explanation we could
come up with was that as light...

826
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:19,260
...arced across his skin, backlight,
it caused him to speed up.

827
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:24,598
So we went through several speed
changes in that sequence.

828
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,559
It's funny.

829
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,479
All three of us have seen this
several times now.

830
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:33,440
But shots like those
you're talking about...

831
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,861
...we've seen hundreds
and hundreds of times.

832
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:41,031
We see them at artists' workstations
when they're first being made.

833
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,663
We see them in dailies on a loop,
maybe 30, 40 times a day.

834
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:51,834
Then we see them on film,
just looped over and over again.

835
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:55,504
So we've seen this film many,
many times over.

836
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:01,010
The little shot where Spider-Man's
on the ground...

837
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:04,638
...and he's kicking the bank robber...

838
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:08,559
...and then flips over the top of him.

839
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:13,856
We went through so many different
versions of this because...

840
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:18,611
...as in a lot of shots, some shots
we'll see later, it's the same thing.

841
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,280
This character is a superhuman...

842
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:25,910
...but we still wanted him
to be a thinking character.

843
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:30,623
So if everything's too
well-choreographed...

844
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:33,250
...it can have a false look to it.

845
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:37,630
As if the character weren't thinking
on his feet at that moment.

846
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:43,594
It can look scripted, as it were.
Contrived.

847
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:54,063
Interesting thing about this character,
something Sam said consistently:

848
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,732
"I want to know what he's thinking."

849
01:02:56,899 --> 01:03:00,319
When you have a character
who has a face...

850
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:04,698
...the idea of establishing
his thoughts is much easier...

851
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:09,995
...than with a character who is only
using his body because he's masked.

852
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:13,666
That's the interesting thing
about animation in this film.

853
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:18,170
From my point of view, you have
a sense of what he's thinking...

854
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:21,840
...just based on the way
his body's moving.

855
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:28,055
The actors actually dealt with the
same issues as our animators.

856
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:31,225
Acting with the body
instead of the face.

857
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:35,479
We both kind of had to come
to our solutions separately.

858
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:38,023
You can't do this to me.

859
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,487
I started this company.

860
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,949
You know how much I sacrificed?!

861
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:52,621
Here's Willem Dafoe
in his psycho routine again.

862
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,335
No effects used to enhance his
expressions there.

863
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:06,051
The character's physicality is part of
what made the Goblin successful.

864
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:11,682
Not only in the virtual character,
but in the actor himself.

865
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:18,313
He's never static. There's always
something going on with him.

866
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,483
I know it's an acting issue...

867
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,570
...but Tobey's very quiet as an actor.

868
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,864
He moves his body much less.

869
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:31,702
All those board members we just saw
we had to make digital versions of...

870
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:35,205
...to mess with later in this
Times Square sequence.

871
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:40,002
This was one of the first sequences
we got live-action photography on.

872
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:42,129
It was the first sequence.

873
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:44,715
This is where we cut our teeth.

874
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:48,677
This is where we worked out
how we'd achieve these events.

875
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,764
This is exciting.
I animated that balloon.

876
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,641
That was Anthony's personal animation.

877
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:58,562
What did that take,
three or four weeks to do, Anthony?

878
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:02,441
That was the first time.
We did it again.

879
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:07,321
The tough thing about this sequence
is it's a daylight exterior.

880
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:11,658
Without getting into specifics,
this was shot in New York.

881
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:17,039
Portions of it were shot in New York,
portions of it were shot on a stage.

882
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:22,836
Portions of it were shot in Downey,
portions were computer-generated.

883
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:26,882
It's not necessarily
the same piece all the time.

884
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:29,927
When you watch the sequence
you can see...

885
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:34,056
...that we had to create everything
from very small-scale...

886
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:41,105
...to very large-scale components
to make this sequence complete.

887
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:46,276
There's no other way we could do it,
aside from shutting down Times Square.

888
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,780
They talked to us...
We talked to them, excuse me.

889
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:54,660
We talked to them about shutting down
Times Square for the weekend.

890
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,912
They weren't going for it.

891
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,542
The animation on the balloons
in there is dynamics...

892
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,045
...which is a method of...

893
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:09,174
...how the energy would flow
through an object...

894
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:13,512
...if it were animated
or hit with energy.

895
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:19,768
So in this case, the balloons
are hit with air, or an object.

896
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:25,357
Dan Kramer did a nice job making these
balloons look natural for their size...

897
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,651
...and the way it would move.

898
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:31,780
The balloons helped tie
different environments together.

899
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:35,576
They gave good foreground objects
and bridged the gap...

900
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,370
...between the different photography.

901
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:46,253
We have our somewhat controversial
sign replacements in this sequence.

902
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:50,799
One thing the balloon did,
in foreground and middle ground...

903
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:55,762
If you look at Times Square,
we were on Dick Clark's balcony...

904
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:59,808
...the one he stands on
during the New Year's celebration.

905
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,686
Then the people were below us.

906
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:06,481
If you stand and look down,
everything's in the distance.

907
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,068
You don't have much of a sense
of perspective or scale.

908
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:15,782
Putting the balloons into the sequence
gave us some middle-ground elements...

909
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:20,954
...which allowed us to show not only
the scale of the environment...

910
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,166
...but also to keep the screen
alive with movement.

911
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:28,420
Because as the camera moves,
you can see that the balloons...

912
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,215
...give a sense of foreground
and background...

913
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:34,801
...which you wouldn't have
if it wasn't for them.

914
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:39,681
These are a series of multi-purpose
pumpkin bombs.

915
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:44,895
Another CG creation.

916
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:49,691
I'm sure everybody noticed a couple of
minutes ago the Stan Lee cameos.

917
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,905
Originally he was selling
sunglasses at a stand.

918
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,783
He had a couple funny lines,
but they got cut.

919
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:02,371
One of his lines was,
"Yeah, they use these in X-Men."

920
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:07,125
- There's your cameo.
- I ran by in front of the kid.

921
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,964
Shot at the very end of production.

922
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:16,969
There was a case of the glider
coming back to the Goblin...

923
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:22,766
...waiting on him for when he needs
to jump back on, like a cowboy's horse.

924
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:30,315
A lot of these ground shots of Goblin
we used as lighting reference...

925
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:34,653
...when we were developing our Goblin
CG model, and its lighting model.

926
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,154
There he is.

927
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:40,075
This was shot by
Pedram Goshtasbpour...

928
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:46,498
It cuts together with live action,
goes back and forth between the two.

929
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,170
Watch Goblin spin out.

930
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:57,301
- He stalled.
- Kicking off a wave on a surfboard.

931
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:06,810
Interestingly, the people in the street
are made of digital characters...

932
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:08,979
...generated in the computer...

933
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,606
...people from Downey,
who were shot...

934
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,693
I think we had 5000 people one day.

935
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:18,322
Another day we had 1000,
then it got down to 250.

936
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,032
People got tired of coming.

937
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,869
And the crowds in the streets
are all made up...

938
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:29,541
...of separate pieces
that are all sewn together...

939
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:35,797
...to create much more scope
than we actually had to photograph.

940
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:40,719
This is Peter Nofz's sequence,
as a CG supervisor.

941
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:45,682
He coordinated the set up of a bunch
of these different systems...

942
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:49,311
...including our crowd system
and the character setup.

943
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,813
He got a taste of every pipeline.

944
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,776
Our building pipeline,
our painted tile pipeline.

945
01:09:55,942 --> 01:10:00,364
We stitched together photography
that John shot in New York.

946
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,698
It came together.

947
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:08,622
Just for the sense of description,
when Scott talks about a pipeline...

948
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:15,003
...it's the process characters and
environments go through to be finished.

949
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,508
Once principle photography is done,
if that's a component of a shot...

950
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:24,137
...let's say a background plate,
in the case of this New York piece...

951
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:27,474
...then all of the pieces
begin to come together.

952
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:32,521
Those pieces may take five weeks
to assemble, or a week to assemble.

953
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,732
We call the length of time
that it takes...

954
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:41,613
...to go from the beginning components
to its completion a "pipeline."

955
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:46,910
In some cases the pipeline
is tied to a character.

956
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:50,789
In other cases, it's tied
to the complexity of the shot.

957
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:55,836
The last shot in the movie
took six months, I believe.

958
01:10:56,002 --> 01:11:00,674
- Yeah, six to eight months.
- That's not a pure pipeline...

959
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:04,428
...but it gives you a sense
of how long it takes.

960
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:10,100
We had to decide what we were actually
going to do fairly early on...

961
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:15,230
...to get the shots done by the time
the film was in the theatres.

962
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,195
By the time we got
into really finishing...

963
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,740
...or getting close to finishing
the last swing shot...

964
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:29,286
...everybody wanted to do
more shots like it.

965
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:33,582
We just knew we didn't have the time
in the schedule to do more.

966
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,542
Well, you use every moment.

967
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,795
I have yet to work on a movie
where we said:

968
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,465
"We're done. We'll take the week off."

969
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:46,928
You always work until,
as Sam said for this movie...

970
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:50,682
...I believe he's quoting someone
else but he says:

971
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:54,603
"They will pry the film
from his cold, dead hands."

972
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:58,690
That's pretty much the way
these movies always are.

973
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:04,613
The whole process,
from script to storyboard artists...

974
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,115
...to Sam, and then over to us...

975
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:12,037
...then going through you, John,
then filtering through other people.

976
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:17,667
Going from me to the animators, and
then back in the other direction again.

977
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,046
It goes back and forth
through this hierarchy...

978
01:12:21,213 --> 01:12:25,675
...and you arrive at something
until Sam finally agrees upon it.

979
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:29,513
But everybody has their input
into these things.

980
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,808
And different people input
on many different things.

981
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:37,020
The lighter can comment
about the animation.

982
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:41,775
An animator might comment
about the lighting.

983
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:43,777
It works a little...

984
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:47,072
- Is that a sore spot?
- No. Not at all.

985
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:52,452
Anthony and I always argue
a little bit in jest, in dailies.

986
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:56,790
- But we won't do that now.
- Oh, I'll miss it.

987
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:01,878
I was gonna say, the pre-visualization
that Anthony was talking about...

988
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:07,425
...it's different for live-action shots
and an all-CG shot.

989
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:12,931
For live-action photography,
a lot of it was used to hash out...

990
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:17,894
...where the camera should be
and what lens would be used...

991
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,398
...and to block out
for the day of the shooting.

992
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:27,946
In the case of all-CG shots,
it was actually much easier, in a way.

993
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:32,492
The animators were really blocking out
the shot in that case.

994
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:37,122
It just went from pre-vis
to finishing animation stages...

995
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:43,211
...straight into lighting without a
photography section in that path.

996
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:46,131
We talked about pre-visualization...

997
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:50,510
...which is the geometry of a set
or a location...

998
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,680
...and simple geometry
of the characters...

999
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:58,184
...with a virtual camera that can be
positioned to create shots.

1000
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:03,982
We did pre-visualization on shots that
were live-action pieces, as well...

1001
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:08,320
...so that when we showed up on-stage
to do the photography...

1002
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:12,449
...we could tell the director of
photography the focal lengths...

1003
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:16,745
...and the distance from the camera
to the subject.

1004
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:23,001
That was a place to begin.
Pre-visualization isn't cast in stone.

1005
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,504
It's always, again, a living document.

1006
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:29,716
But it gave everyone
an exhibit to work with...

1007
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:33,803
...to determine the needs of a shot
on a given day.

1008
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:38,975
It makes you more efficient.
You put more of your money on screen...

1009
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:44,564
...instead of putting the money into
doing fix-its or changing your mind.

1010
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:46,775
Pre-visualization was good.

1011
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:52,906
John Schmidt was great about working
out those things for shoot days.

1012
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,867
He also made printouts for them.

1013
01:14:56,076 --> 01:15:00,330
He went through a ream of paper
making printouts used for shooting.

1014
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,625
Here comes the Goblin.

1015
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:11,383
We worked with the mechanical guys
and the stunts guys.

1016
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:15,095
In many cases, the Goblin was there
on a practical glider.

1017
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:21,059
Sometimes it was Willem on the glider,
sometimes it was a stuntperson.

1018
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,896
We had to communicate
on an ongoing basis.

1019
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:30,360
We used the pre-visualization as the
exhibit that we discussed together.

1020
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:35,031
It allowed us to bring the proper tools
for the day's photography...

1021
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,703
...as well as the postproduction work
that had to be done in visual effects.

1022
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:42,455
Another shot by Koji Morihiro...

1023
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:48,545
...the guy who actually made the set up
for Spider-Man animation.

1024
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:50,630
Jeff Stern lit that shot.

1025
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:54,884
When I saw that lighting,
it was such a nice golden-hour look.

1026
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,638
It influenced how we ended up
on that sequence.

1027
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:02,142
This is a great sequence
to get a feeling...

1028
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:06,438
...for the psychotic behavior
that Goblin has...

1029
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,732
...and what I looked to...

1030
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:13,778
...to give different facets of
his behavior in the performance.

1031
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,865
Well, to each his own.

1032
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,993
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

1033
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:28,209
This was also the sequence
shot on-stage...

1034
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:33,506
...and we decided that the backing
didn't have the right contrast level.

1035
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:38,052
As a post process, we did some
adjustments on the background.

1036
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,096
Put some steam in.

1037
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:44,184
The other interesting thing,
because of dialogue changes...

1038
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,438
...we obscured the Goblin's mouth
in some of these shots...

1039
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:51,775
...so the lip-synch wouldn't be off.

1040
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,820
We did a lot of editorial tinkering
with this shot...

1041
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:59,866
...during the process of making it.

1042
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:05,997
We went through a lot of different
versions of his performance in this.

1043
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:10,126
When the glider comes in,
he jumps on it and flies away.

1044
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:15,256
In his speech, we tried to get across
in his body what Sam wanted him to say.

1045
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:17,592
We had different versions.

1046
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:21,846
One time, we were repeating
what he was doing to his head.

1047
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:27,811
There's something coming up where
he puts his fingers to his head.

1048
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,729
Well, that's cut out.

1049
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:36,110
But he flies away, and gives
this Shakespearean gesture to him.

1050
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:46,246
For characters, the actors,
Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire...

1051
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,582
...one who's very still,
one who's animated...

1052
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:53,169
...once we put the costumes on...

1053
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:59,259
...the somewhat melodramatic motions
become totally acceptable.

1054
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:05,056
You don't balk at them, because they
replace the business of the guy's face.

1055
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:09,811
It's very interesting that some of the
motions and positions...

1056
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:14,732
...that the characters get into
when they're masked seem extreme...

1057
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:18,611
...but don't seem extreme
in the context of the story.

1058
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,280
So how'd it go?

1059
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:24,450
They said I needed acting lessons.

1060
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:27,328
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

1061
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:32,792
There's a lot of little wire removal
and some composite shots...

1062
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:36,379
...Imageworks didn't do.
We worked with vendors.

1063
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,091
CIS, Post Logic, Digiscope
did a lot of the work...

1064
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,011
...coming up in the next
rain sequence.

1065
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,472
What's interesting
about contemporary filmmaking...

1066
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:50,810
...is it used to be you couldn't
remove wires or posts.

1067
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:55,940
So production had to be very careful
about what they put into a scene.

1068
01:18:56,149 --> 01:19:01,613
Although, I'd like to say this
production wasn't bad that way.

1069
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:07,785
On films I've worked on, they've left
the food truck in the background.

1070
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:10,997
Because it was quicker
to shoot the scene...

1071
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:14,500
...and have the truck
removed in postproduction.

1072
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:19,714
And the whole business of wires now,
and posts to support people...

1073
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:26,012
...to make them fly and do other things
is rampant. Every other shot...

1074
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,473
...in action sequences...

1075
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:32,644
...often times have support rods,
or tubes...

1076
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:38,983
...or cranes, or people's hands, that
you end up going back to paint out.

1077
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:44,238
It's one of the things digital imagery
has provided to the filmmakers.

1078
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,409
You can take eyes from one take
and a mouth from another...

1079
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:52,580
...and paint them together
to make another shot.

1080
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:57,126
Pixel Magic was our
other vendor, I forgot to mention.

1081
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:01,089
Now it doesn't necessarily mean
that you should do that.

1082
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:05,051
We had many
wire removal and fix it shots...

1083
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:10,264
...they all just blend together.
I can't remember where they all are.

1084
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:29,200
Tobey's fighting style
is not martial arts.

1085
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:34,330
It's a cross, as Anthony was calling
it, between human and superhuman.

1086
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:38,960
He throws conventional boxing-type
punches, but he also uses...

1087
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,504
...almost Judo-type moves.

1088
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:46,801
It's kind of an interesting mix
of a collage of fighting styles...

1089
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:52,306
...which, I think, gives him
a personality all his own.

1090
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:56,310
I love the shot in that sequence
where he's all wet.

1091
01:20:56,561 --> 01:21:01,149
It's just so unmotivated if you look
at this shot out of context.

1092
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,068
I felt sorry for Tobey in this shot.

1093
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:07,947
Because I was there
when they shot it...

1094
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:14,245
...it's difficult for me to see it as
romantic. His sinuses were full of water.

1095
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:20,043
He was breathing out of his mouth,
through the wet fabric.

1096
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:56,245
Boy, that spider web
does some interesting stuff.

1097
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:59,457
- You just press a button...
- And up you go.

1098
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:03,419
In those shots, even though
you don't see anything...

1099
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:08,841
...we've done a little extra movement
around and overriding post move...

1100
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:13,012
...to just reframe or add extra
motion into those shots.

1101
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:17,225
And there, this is kind
of the first of our daytime...

1102
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:20,770
...CG buildings in the
background of some shots.

1103
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:23,856
Except for Times Square.

1104
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:28,820
Nice work on the webs where they
waft in the wind after he goes...

1105
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:31,364
...to get back into the window.

1106
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:37,370
That shot came together pretty fast
at the end of the show.

1107
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:41,749
That was a kind of last minute
pull-together shot.

1108
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:58,182
Okay, this fire sequence contains
components shot in New York.

1109
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:02,812
This piece, for instance,
is located in New York, as is that.

1110
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,606
Once we go inside, we're on a set...

1111
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:09,443
...that was built once
in a parking lot in Downey...

1112
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:14,490
...then again, to shoot subsequent
components of the shot...

1113
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:18,286
...in a parking lot in Culver City.

1114
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,997
It all goes together very nicely.

1115
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:27,461
This is an example of integrating this
character seamlessly into a scene.

1116
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:33,092
I think this is a terrific shot
that is in this sequence...

1117
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:35,011
...which we'll point out.

1118
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:39,682
It was a great transition
between real and digital actors.

1119
01:23:39,891 --> 01:23:43,853
That was a great shot by Ken Morris,
coming in the window.

1120
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:49,400
That web, animated by Todd Boyce, was
a web that Sam kept coming back to...

1121
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:54,155
...as a reference of a floating web
where it wafted into the air.

1122
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:59,160
He liked that quality. We tried
to get that in some other shots.

1123
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:07,835
The actors were actually in this set
as it was on fire, wearing Lycra...

1124
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:14,258
...which is flammable. You can imagine
how excited they were about that.

1125
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:19,388
I don't know whether Willem talked
about this or Tobey...

1126
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:24,435
...but it was quite hot on that set.
If you were gonna be on the set...

1127
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:29,398
...you wore a complete firefighters'
uniform, including a respirator.

1128
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:33,361
This is Spencer Cook
in a really beautiful shot...

1129
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:38,616
...where all the elements come together
very well. People thought this...

1130
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:40,284
...was a real actor.

1131
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:45,164
Greg Anderson did a great job lighting
that and Greg Derochie...

1132
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,124
...compositing it.

1133
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:52,129
Jeff Lin doing this work,
Torn Gurney doing this work.

1134
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,549
Razorbats exploding.

1135
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:59,971
I thought it was a very well
choreographed sequence too.

1136
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:07,687
No one says no to me!

1137
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:18,906
I think the transitions Sam uses
are somewhat dated...

1138
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:23,953
...but they're interesting. It gives
a certain personality to the film.

1139
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:28,833
The flame transitions. There's other
places where he's used wipes...

1140
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:32,253
...and interesting kinds
of fades and things.

1141
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:35,923
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

1142
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,884
Who is this lovely young lady?

1143
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,345
M.J., I'd like you to meet my father...

1144
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:45,308
We worked on this movie
through the transition...

1145
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:49,520
...of the September 11th
disaster in New York.

1146
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:55,109
I was gonna mention it earlier,
we didn't remove...

1147
01:25:56,068 --> 01:26:00,281
...the World Trade Centre
from any of our shots.

1148
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:04,994
The only shot that had
the World Trade Centre in it...

1149
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:07,204
...was the one in the trailer.

1150
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:12,043
They chose to not use it because
the Trade Centre was featured...

1151
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:15,796
...so they felt that
that was too painful.

1152
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:22,136
John, when you shot the footage
after September 11th for the top...

1153
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:26,974
...of the buildings in the last swing,
the Twin Towers weren't there.

1154
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:32,688
To make it consistent, Dan Eaton
actually put those towers in there.

1155
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,983
And this our famous blood shot.

1156
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:39,320
So this was a bone of contention.

1157
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:45,409
This is a shot Anthony teased me
about looking like ketchup.

1158
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:49,830
I still, to this day,
don't think it looks like ketchup.

1159
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:55,378
I think that the shot wouldn't have
worked unless it looked like ketchup.

1160
01:26:55,961 --> 01:27:01,717
Well, I was hoping for some kind of
big conflict. I guess that was quick.

1161
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:07,723
I tease Scott, but it had to be thick.
Real blood would splatter horizontally.

1162
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:12,686
Yeah, I was ready to jab Anthony
and get some blood experiments...

1163
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:16,023
...to really test
what it would look like.

1164
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,404
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

1165
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,155
...and we can say grace.

1166
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,452
Here we go.

1167
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:36,627
There we are.

1168
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:42,842
So New York City, real New York City
with all the bits and pieces...

1169
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,720
We started using a technique
called photogrametry...

1170
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,850
...where we were gonna create
large chunks of the city...

1171
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:56,939
...based on multiple-positioned
camera photographs of New York.

1172
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:02,570
It turned out that that technique
didn't provide us enough resolution.

1173
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:06,490
Meaning that the buildings
we created that way...

1174
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:12,955
...didn't have enough detail in them
for the camera to get close to them.

1175
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:16,292
We then decided instead
of doing that...

1176
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,420
...to use conventional...

1177
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:22,756
...surveyors' instruments...

1178
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:28,095
...to create a mathematical model
of buildings in much higher detail...

1179
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:34,643
...and use still photographs of the
surfaces of those buildings to be...

1180
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,688
...stretched back
onto that geometry.

1181
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:42,985
We had the shape of the building and
we had a picture of the surfaces...

1182
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:47,448
...on the building. We placed
those surfaces onto the building.

1183
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:50,284
It's called mapping.

1184
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:54,997
And as you look at this...
As we continues through this...

1185
01:28:55,206 --> 01:29:00,336
...you're gonna see extensive
use of this technique.

1186
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:05,966
We had buildings in the middle ground,
foreground, and in the distance.

1187
01:29:06,217 --> 01:29:12,806
Some were in original photography
and some were added in after the fact.

1188
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:16,977
The other weakness
photogrametry had was you tend...

1189
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:20,314
...to get the built
in lighting of the day...

1190
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:23,484
...so it depends on
how overcast it is...

1191
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:27,905
...the sun's angle, what time of day.
You don't have leeway.

1192
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:31,992
Our buildings had to hold up
for different sun angles...

1193
01:29:32,243 --> 01:29:34,328
...and different times of day.

1194
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:41,085
So our main texture painter guy,
Carey, ended up taking all the photos.

1195
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:47,216
They painted out a lot of detail that
we'd add back in later with lighting.

1196
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:50,219
Also, paint the edges
so we could tile...

1197
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:54,640
...and reuse some of that photography
to extend buildings.

1198
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:59,228
Talk about the tiles. That's an
important thing that we used.

1199
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:03,607
- The tiles in terms of...
- Just how we did it.

1200
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,779
We started out making
this whole building system.

1201
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:13,409
We knew we would have complex
scenes that had a lot of geometry.

1202
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:16,745
We made our buildings
as building blocks.

1203
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:21,792
We used a system that Steve LeVietes
created in Houdini software...

1204
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:27,590
...to easily instance pieces
and assemble them all together.

1205
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:32,094
Also there was a notion that
when we took these photos...

1206
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:34,847
...they had to seam up on the edges.

1207
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:39,852
If you look at real buildings,
there's lots of variation in color...

1208
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:43,105
...and lighting across
these buildings.

1209
01:30:43,314 --> 01:30:48,110
Our texture painters had to balance
those out of the textures...

1210
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:53,616
...make them so they could seam up
together and work generically.

1211
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:58,662
The beautiful thing about the
tiles is, you get this hemisphere...

1212
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:01,165
...which functions as a plate.

1213
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:06,754
But a normal plate, you've gotta work
within what the camera has shot.

1214
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:11,342
When you have this hemisphere
of tiles stitched together...

1215
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:14,470
...you can move
the camera all around...

1216
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:19,391
...and create your own camera move
within this background.

1217
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:22,186
Our pan and tile system...

1218
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:27,399
...which was another technique we used
to put behind our CG buildings.

1219
01:31:27,608 --> 01:31:32,988
The camera sits in one place.
You take a shot and then tilt up.

1220
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:37,117
Take one to the right and left,
until you have these...

1221
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:43,666
...photos that define or capture
the panorama before you.

1222
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:49,755
If you look at David Hockney's art,
you see some of this kind of tiling.

1223
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:54,718
We did it in a much more precise
fashion, but far less artistic.

1224
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:59,139
It's a lot of single images
which are combined together...

1225
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,893
...to create a much larger image
at high resolution.

1226
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:08,524
That allows you to move in closer
and further away and to pan...

1227
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:15,155
...and move up and down
on this big domed projection.

1228
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:20,619
It's a technique that's been
getting more and more...

1229
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:24,123
...in use over the last couple
of years.

1230
01:32:24,331 --> 01:32:29,002
Many years ago, you'd have
to assemble it in 3-D and render out.

1231
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:32,464
Nowadays, at Imageworks,
we've got a system...

1232
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:39,346
...where we do it in our last
compositing stage so it's much faster.

1233
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:48,564
One of the interesting things about
visual effects in movies is that...

1234
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:55,195
...you start out with scripts that have
more stuff than you can afford to do.

1235
01:32:55,404 --> 01:33:00,409
Using resource as a definition
of time and money.

1236
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:05,330
You always have twice the material
as you have the resource to do.

1237
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:09,543
Throughout the creation of the film,
you have to go back...

1238
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:15,048
...and constantly be on top of deciding
where you'll put the resource.

1239
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:21,472
We knew we had to create a virtual
version of the Spider-Man character...

1240
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,224
...a virtual version of the Goblin...

1241
01:33:24,391 --> 01:33:27,895
...and a virtual version of
portions of New York...

1242
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:32,524
...to allow us to do the kinds of
camera moves that we wanted...

1243
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:38,530
...because they weren't allowing
anybody to swing through the streets.

1244
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:42,993
So those were our primary
allocations of resource.

1245
01:33:43,202 --> 01:33:48,457
Then as the script developed,
as we worked on the movie...

1246
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:51,168
...the story became clearer to us.

1247
01:33:51,418 --> 01:33:56,965
We then had to re-evaluate where we
were putting our efforts or resource.

1248
01:33:57,216 --> 01:34:02,721
And one of the things that was...
We also knew we had to do the web.

1249
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:06,350
The web was a component
of resource allocation.

1250
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,561
But as we continued
through the process...

1251
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:13,732
...we had to re-evaluate
what was being put into the film.

1252
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:17,986
We'd get new sequences they
wanted to make a story point.

1253
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:24,243
Then that sequence would be evaluated,
then abandoned because of expense.

1254
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:28,872
And that was going on
for the live-action stuff as well.

1255
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:32,167
It requires that you be very flexible.

1256
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:37,631
You have to be willing to abandon
a scene that you like that you've...

1257
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:42,427
...spent months developing since
it no longer applies in the story.

1258
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:47,224
That's the hardest thing in doing
visual effects and filmmaking...

1259
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,936
...is giving away your "babies,"
so to speak...

1260
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:54,940
...in pursuit of a more
effective storytelling.

1261
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,652
You also have to be willing to meet...

1262
01:34:58,861 --> 01:35:03,490
...an impossible challenge at the last
moment. When we did this film...

1263
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,619
...it wasn't unusual
in the last two or three weeks...

1264
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:13,250
...for the director and editor to
come up with a shot that required...

1265
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:15,377
...some heroic performance.

1266
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:20,507
We talked about one of the shots
earlier which was Spider-Man...

1267
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:24,386
...swinging through buildings
on his way to the fire.

1268
01:35:24,595 --> 01:35:28,682
That shot came out
through animation, lighting...

1269
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:34,396
...and compositing in record time.
You have to be light on your feet...

1270
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:40,986
...and willing to pursue the end
goal of the story, first and foremost.

1271
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:46,783
Seems like on every film,
you always promise something...

1272
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:50,621
...that you have no idea
whether or not you can do.

1273
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,039
You have to.

1274
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:56,835
And that's generally how new ways
of doing things are created.

1275
01:35:57,044 --> 01:36:00,589
What's interesting
is that Sam's very pragmatic.

1276
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:05,385
He chose, in many cases,
to use practical effects...

1277
01:36:05,594 --> 01:36:08,347
...meaning mechanical
effects or stunts.

1278
01:36:08,597 --> 01:36:12,059
Other filmmakers I've
worked with have defaulted...

1279
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:14,853
...to a digital solution immediately.

1280
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:20,692
He'd explore more traditional methods
extensively before allocating...

1281
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:26,406
...that visual effects resource
to a single shot or a sequence.

1282
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:32,454
And I think that that shows up
in his understanding of this story.

1283
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:37,084
He knows where he wants
to put the money, the resource...

1284
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:40,420
...in terms of the telling
of the story.

1285
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:47,344
Just another note,
there's a sort of different class...

1286
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:51,473
...of shot that's
become more popular recently...

1287
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:56,687
...and that's these product placement
or product replacement shots.

1288
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:02,109
We went through a sequence earlier
where he's shooting at a can.

1289
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:07,155
- Of course, we replaced products.
- Three different kinds of cans.

1290
01:37:07,364 --> 01:37:10,117
We went through different
types of cans.

1291
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:16,498
There's a critical phone call shot
coming up where Tobey's on the phone...

1292
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:21,294
...and it was a brand of payphone
nobody wanted to see in the shot.

1293
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:25,257
So we had one of our
vendors take it out.

1294
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:31,930
So there's a lot of attention to those
sort of details that happens nowadays.

1295
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:39,688
I think people must think
that people will want to...

1296
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:43,859
...drink and eat the same
things that Spider-Man does.

1297
01:37:44,026 --> 01:37:46,653
- I think so.
- I do.

1298
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:52,200
I personally eat almost every sugared
cereal that has his picture on it.

1299
01:37:52,451 --> 01:37:56,121
How do you think
he makes all that web?

1300
01:37:58,999 --> 01:38:01,293
You were supposed to be asleep.

1301
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:06,882
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1302
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:11,094
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1303
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:17,476
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1304
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:21,021
- Did I say that?
- You sure did.

1305
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:23,023
Now it'll get fast and furious.

1306
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:27,694
This last portion of the movie goes
at about 100 miles an hour.

1307
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,655
We'll never be able
to talk fast enough.

1308
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:35,452
We should go through all the methods
that we were thinking of.

1309
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:40,499
There's a moment
when he has to jettison...

1310
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:43,668
...himself to the
Queensborough Bridge...

1311
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:48,882
...and he attaches his webs
to the top of these flagpoles...

1312
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:53,095
...pulls himself backward
and then lets go and springs off.

1313
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:58,058
We went through several ideas
on how to get him over there.

1314
01:38:58,308 --> 01:39:00,811
From cannons to clock springs, to...

1315
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:05,273
So much of this next
sequence is all virtual sets.

1316
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:09,111
It gave us flexibility
to explore ideas like that.

1317
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:12,364
The thing that's interesting
to me is that...

1318
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:16,827
...we paid very little attention
to physics.

1319
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:20,205
The truth is,
I'm a stickler for physics.

1320
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:25,168
I like to make stuff kind of stay
within the practical world.

1321
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:29,131
That probably is a disadvantage.

1322
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,467
Actually, it's probably
a good balance...

1323
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:36,138
...because Sam
and the writers' penchant...

1324
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:42,060
...is for writing stuff that's so
fantastic that you might not buy it.

1325
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,898
So I temper that particular tendency
on their part by going:

1326
01:39:47,149 --> 01:39:50,026
"Physically, this couldn't happen."

1327
01:39:50,277 --> 01:39:55,407
So the sequences that you see here,
swing from one end of the pole...

1328
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:59,619
...to the other. Things that
are practical and that aren't.

1329
01:39:59,828 --> 01:40:05,625
But the truth is, it all goes together
in a way where you're not aware of it.

1330
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:11,339
I think that the willing suspension
of disbelief has been achieved here.

1331
01:40:11,548 --> 01:40:16,511
In a couple of these shots,
Anthony and I also got little cameos.

1332
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:21,683
- We're people on the ground...
- That's my daughter right there.

1333
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:23,977
That's Chloe.

1334
01:40:24,186 --> 01:40:29,191
That was a shot by Brad Booker
of him looking into the tram.

1335
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:32,903
It was a shot done early on
and Sam liked...

1336
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:35,447
...the acting from the Goblin.

1337
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:40,577
Lit by Kevin Hahn. It was one
of our first lighting jobs on Goblin.

1338
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:45,916
This is an integration of all manner
of mechanical effects too.

1339
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:49,878
We photographed explosions
against black so we could...

1340
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:52,547
...combine them in those images.

1341
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:54,299
There are miniatures...

1342
01:40:54,507 --> 01:41:00,055
...combined with computer generated
cables and cable cars and people.

1343
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:05,518
This is a real potpourri
of the visual effects techniques.

1344
01:41:05,769 --> 01:41:09,272
We shot from the top
of the Queensborough Bridge.

1345
01:41:09,481 --> 01:41:13,652
We were gonna climb to the top
of the bridge and photograph...

1346
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:20,075
Here's Anthony's shot of him being
shot to the bridge with the flagpoles.

1347
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:25,914
Chris Williams, Ken Morissey,
Bill Diaz did this great shot of him.

1348
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:31,419
<i>And then James Pam's does the shot
where he comes over the top here.</i>

1349
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:36,132
This is a real great shot in the film.
It was a beautiful shot.

1350
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:40,762
So this is again...
Mechanical effects boys...

1351
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:46,851
...had to provide wind, explosions,
fog, smoke and all kinds of things.

1352
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:52,190
So it's another case where departments
had to collaborate extensively.

1353
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:56,569
We did lots of photography
on Roosevelt Island in New York.

1354
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:02,409
It was exciting to have our own
Roosevelt Island tram car.

1355
01:42:02,617 --> 01:42:08,915
We rented it. We could make it go back
and forth, wherever we wanted to.

1356
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:11,793
What pre-visualization
did for us is...

1357
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:17,215
...when you've a sequence where points
of view aren't on the same level...

1358
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:22,220
...you have to establish the camera's
angle relative to the live action.

1359
01:42:22,429 --> 01:42:25,140
Pre-visualization allowed us to say:

1360
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:31,438
The camera needs to be 40 feet below
the subject on a 15 millimeter lens.

1361
01:42:31,688 --> 01:42:37,485
Those kinds of details allowed us to
photograph our characters...

1362
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:41,072
...in some cases,
against green screen...

1363
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:47,829
...then put them into a photography
of the real bridge or a CGI bridge.

1364
01:42:48,038 --> 01:42:50,957
Ken Hahn is the CG
supervisor of this...

1365
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:56,796
...and did a great job pulling together
all the green screen and CG elements...

1366
01:42:57,005 --> 01:43:01,718
...and putting up with listening
to me talk about the black levels...

1367
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:05,388
...and different variations
across the images.

1368
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:12,020
This is a difficult area, to keep the
character doing the same thing...

1369
01:43:12,187 --> 01:43:18,026
...all the time so there's a continuity
of what he does in the physical world.

1370
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:22,614
You have a temptation to make
the character do something human...

1371
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:26,076
...and you can't
let yourself fall into that.

1372
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:32,332
Just like before when he was shooting
web and going through the bridge.

1373
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:37,337
He comes up, flies over the top
and I had him landing so hard...

1374
01:43:37,504 --> 01:43:40,423
...in this big follow through.

1375
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:44,803
Sam said, "He can't do that."
I said, "He has to do that."

1376
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:51,476
I thought about it and he was right.
He's not a person, he's Spider-Man.

1377
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:02,237
As opposed to this,
which a person could easily do.

1378
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:08,827
Lots of pieces went
into this sequence.

1379
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:15,083
The toughest part is you're working
with a large set piece, this bridge.

1380
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:21,756
You get close to the characters, it's
hard to see the bridge and vice versa.

1381
01:44:21,965 --> 01:44:28,638
So this was a real tour de force
of editing and design of sequence...

1382
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:33,393
...to integrate the pieces so you
had a sense of the environment...

1383
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:39,858
...but were still close enough to the
characters to read their emotions.

1384
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:48,116
It was interesting to just set up all
the lighting of our virtual sets...

1385
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:52,662
...and matched pieces. Sometimes
it worked, sometimes it didn't.

1386
01:44:52,871 --> 01:44:59,252
We just dialed in different fall offs
and bright and dark areas for shots.

1387
01:44:59,544 --> 01:45:01,337
Spider-Man, watch out!

1388
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:19,147
Interesting thing about this,
this is our "hulking ruin" sequence.

1389
01:45:19,355 --> 01:45:23,067
Spider-Man gets pretty beat up
in this sequence.

1390
01:45:23,318 --> 01:45:28,573
We made a full CG version
of Spider-Man completely beat up.

1391
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:31,409
One of our guys
painted beautiful maps.

1392
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:35,163
It's this pristine CG model
that looks fabulous.

1393
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:40,168
And by the end of the cut that
they made, it was no longer in there.

1394
01:45:40,335 --> 01:45:44,380
I hope in the sequel, there's
an area where he's beat up...

1395
01:45:44,589 --> 01:45:49,719
...pretty similarly to this so we can
use that model. I'm sure we won't.

1396
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,974
That was the shot that,
because of the rating system...

1397
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:58,478
He had a mouthful of blood
spewing out...

1398
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:03,399
...and to get the rating down
to PG-13, we had to turn that blood...

1399
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:06,444
...from red to clear to be spit.

1400
01:46:06,694 --> 01:46:13,076
We had to take out a bit so it didn't
look like he was spewing a fountain.

1401
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:17,121
This was an interesting solution
with the web.

1402
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:19,999
This is of course a new kind of web...

1403
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:26,005
...but also had to look like the real
web because it was already shot.

1404
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:31,761
Todd Boyce spent a lot of time
weaving that pattern...

1405
01:46:31,928 --> 01:46:35,598
...making it match the next shot.

1406
01:46:39,686 --> 01:46:44,983
This sequence really got out down.
At one point, it went on for days.

1407
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:48,152
The thing that happens
is these sequences...

1408
01:46:48,403 --> 01:46:54,158
...end up being distillations
of much, much larger vintages.

1409
01:46:54,367 --> 01:46:57,537
The Razorbats used to be
in this sequence.

1410
01:46:57,787 --> 01:47:02,584
There were Razorbats and even another
kind of thing at some point.

1411
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:07,505
In this sequence, there were flocks
of them all over the place.

1412
01:47:09,591 --> 01:47:12,510
But again,
I think that the distillation...

1413
01:47:12,677 --> 01:47:16,514
...really focuses on the
development of the characters.

1414
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:21,060
That's the saving grace of this
movie. You pay more attention...

1415
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:25,231
...to the people involved
than you do to the...

1416
01:47:25,398 --> 01:47:28,610
- Action.
- Action, yeah.

1417
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:36,826
This is definitely an homage to
some of Sam's earlier movies.

1418
01:47:36,993 --> 01:47:39,662
<i>Army</i> of Darkness or whatever.

1419
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:51,257
A lot of speed up on this thing.

1420
01:47:53,593 --> 01:47:55,511
Did that wall move or no?

1421
01:47:57,597 --> 01:48:01,267
- Can't give away all the secrets.
- I'm sorry.

1422
01:48:04,187 --> 01:48:07,774
Again the spider sense
comes into play here.

1423
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:13,988
The spider sense thing was a huge
combination of many elements.

1424
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:18,284
It's a beautiful digital blade
that comes out of this.

1425
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:23,539
It comes out of the glider.

1426
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:28,753
It's photography
done on the set, paintwork...

1427
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:32,090
...some CG components
that were generated...

1428
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:38,137
...in three dimensions and painted and
added. The glider is a virtual...

1429
01:48:38,304 --> 01:48:41,808
...version of the glider,
a CGI version...

1430
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:44,936
...and that's combined with our...

1431
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,357
...actually live actor
in the foreground.

1432
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:50,942
Give me your hand.

1433
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:55,988
For the spider sense shot coming up,
Dan Kramer did a great job...

1434
01:48:56,155 --> 01:49:00,034
...because we shot different ideas,
motion control...

1435
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:05,415
...and the end result ended up being
a combination of some of those ideas.

1436
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:10,294
So we had to piece together
different photography in.

1437
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,214
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1438
01:49:15,133 --> 01:49:16,634
That shot right there.

1439
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:33,359
We also, actually, had to try
to give a character to the glider...

1440
01:49:33,526 --> 01:49:38,072
...to have it and a certain feeling,
as silly as that may sound.

1441
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:43,327
Well, it's back to
your faithful servant, the glider...

1442
01:49:43,494 --> 01:49:48,374
...hanging out,
waiting to take care...

1443
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:49,834
...of the threat.

1444
01:49:50,001 --> 01:49:55,590
And of course that sequence was cut
down to get into the PG-13 rating.

1445
01:49:55,757 --> 01:49:59,385
Some of our work was
cut out of there as well.

1446
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:11,230
I'm sure in the director's cut, the
R-rated version, that'll show up.

1447
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:12,982
What have you done?!

1448
01:50:18,988 --> 01:50:23,701
A lot of these shots have to be
leading towards sequels to come.

1449
01:50:23,868 --> 01:50:26,829
Setting up some of the situations.

1450
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:34,003
So this is the set-up
before the final shot...

1451
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:38,007
...in which Sam had a small request...

1452
01:50:38,174 --> 01:50:42,345
...that the animation
in this last shot...

1453
01:50:42,512 --> 01:50:45,431
...be more incredible,
more astounding.

1454
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:51,145
The all time, best animated shot in
history. That was all he asked for.

1455
01:50:51,312 --> 01:50:57,735
We went away and tried to do that.
This went through many generations.

1456
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,614
But it was interesting to see...

1457
01:51:01,823 --> 01:51:06,118
...as we got down I think John
has said before, what is it?

1458
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:10,957
Ninety percent of your time you
spend getting ready for the shot...

1459
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:16,045
...and 10 percent getting it done.

1460
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:22,260
All the camera moves
and the animation.

1461
01:51:22,468 --> 01:51:25,763
There were minute adjustments
on these things.

1462
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:30,059
One frame of a change
of a move where the camera...

1463
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:33,062
...would come close to a
building or move.

1464
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:38,401
It really got down to a beautiful shot
that I think is well remembered...

1465
01:51:38,568 --> 01:51:41,320
...in great animation
by Peter Giliberti.

1466
01:51:41,487 --> 01:51:45,241
Lighting and compositing-wise
it came down to the wire.

1467
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:50,288
Like, our artists Marc Rienzo,
Jeff Stern, Dan Abrams...

1468
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:54,375
...Laurence, Dan Eaton
all these guys in the last week...

1469
01:51:54,542 --> 01:51:58,337
...working around the clock,
sleeping under their desks.

1470
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:02,383
It's funny, the president
of our company, Tim Sarnoff...

1471
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:06,971
...had to come and force these guys
to go home and walk them out.

1472
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:10,766
We had people drive them home
so they wouldn't crash.

1473
01:52:10,933 --> 01:52:14,520
That's how dedicated
they were to this last shot.

1474
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:17,815
It took about seven months
for this last shot.

1475
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:20,484
When you watch this shot...

1476
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:26,991
...I mean, if you've seen the movie in
a theatre where it's on a big screen...

1477
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:32,997
...it actually succeeds in getting you
to sort of be physically involved...

1478
01:52:33,164 --> 01:52:38,669
...in swinging through the city.
In terms of a storytelling component...

1479
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:43,507
...it gives you a sense of what
it's like to be Spider-Man.

1480
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:48,012
Not the irony where he has
to deny the woman of his dreams...

1481
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:51,974
...but where you understand
why he goes forward.

1482
01:52:52,141 --> 01:52:56,604
Why he sees some
kind of real future...

1483
01:52:56,771 --> 01:53:01,567
...in the business of being responsible
for this power he wields.

1484
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:05,112
It comes along
with some great fun too.

1485
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:09,200
And I think that this shot
embodies all of those things.

1486
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:15,039
It embodies the best of the work
of the visual effects in the movie.

1487
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:18,793
I love you so much, Peter.

1488
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:44,276
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1489
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:46,362
I can't...

1490
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:50,032
You can't what?

1491
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,618
Tell you...

1492
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:58,666
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1493
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:03,671
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1494
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,549
I want you to know...

1495
01:54:06,966 --> 01:54:09,635
...that I will always be there
for you.

1496
01:54:09,844 --> 01:54:13,806
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1497
01:54:14,807 --> 01:54:16,809
I promise you that.

1498
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:22,398
I will always be your friend.

1499
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:27,194
Only a friend...

1500
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,613
...Peter Parker?

1501
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,618
That's all I have to give.

1502
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:03,647
<i>Whatever life holds in store for</i> me...

1503
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:06,692
<i>...I will never forget these words:</i>

1504
01:55:06,901 --> 01:55:11,947
<i>"With great power
comes great responsibility."</i>

1505
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:16,327
In the performance of the character,
in the beginning...

1506
01:55:16,494 --> 01:55:21,707
...he's not sure what move to make,
where to shoot his web...

1507
01:55:21,874 --> 01:55:26,087
...how to move around it.
And through the film he develops.

1508
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:31,008
Whereas in this shot, you feel
that he knows where he's going...

1509
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:36,680
...and exactly what he's doing and
he's in control of his movement.

1510
01:55:40,309 --> 01:55:46,857
I think a lot of the photography ended
up helping us out in the last shot.

1511
01:55:47,024 --> 01:55:52,655
The photography that we got on that
Sunday in downtown L.A. swinging...

1512
01:55:52,822 --> 01:55:56,033
...through the cars
and everything built off of that.

1513
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:01,080
And that stuff you got in New York
for the tiles. The sort of...

1514
01:56:01,247 --> 01:56:05,626
...golden-hour looking tiles that we
processed and pushed more.

1515
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:12,383
That sort of grounded it and gave us a
base to build our virtual environment.

1516
01:56:15,803 --> 01:56:21,267
Also we had good success
with finishing the buildings off...

1517
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:25,980
...and figuring out how to use them
in the lighting...

1518
01:56:26,147 --> 01:56:31,777
...environment to make them feel
more real. So when you...

1519
01:56:32,236 --> 01:56:35,865
...get to the point of watching...

1520
01:56:36,031 --> 01:56:39,702
...what he's doing and what's
happening around him...

1521
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,704
...it's very spectacular.

1522
01:56:41,871 --> 01:56:44,790
The composition,
the choice of buildings...

1523
01:56:44,957 --> 01:56:49,336
...the color compositing.
Even if it were something that were...

1524
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:53,382
...done for real and wasn't put
together as elements...

1525
01:56:53,549 --> 01:56:58,470
...it would be
a very successful shot.
