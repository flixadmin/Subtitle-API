And in the trial that went wrong, what

of their exoskeleton design.

human trial by that date,

And voilà! There is light.

Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

the way of the hero.

And they found you amusing for a
while, the people of this city.

But the one thing they love
more than a hero

is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

There are eight million people
in this city.

And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose
