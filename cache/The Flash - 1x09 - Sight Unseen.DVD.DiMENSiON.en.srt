1
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,225
Mr. Burnhardt. Mr. Burnhardt.

2
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,698
Sleeping on duty is grounds for dismissal.

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,238
No, ma'am, I wasn't sleeping.
I was just relaxing.

4
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,170
Okay, so Julio and I doped
all the races, right?

5
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,102
Gum Legs is a long shot in the fourth.

6
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,903
Barry, I'd love to go horseracing
with you, but I can't.

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,740
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I have a report to finish.

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,008
Come on, it's tote-bag night.
Don't you want your free tote bag?

9
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,550
- With the lucky horseshoe patch, huh?
- Yes, I do.

10
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,744
- All right, then.
- But you go on without me.

11
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,719
You've been working on this all week.

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,358
- One more day won't matter.
- Tell that to Ruth.

13
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:37,121
Ruth? If she were any tighter,
she'd snap.

14
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,095
- Did someone mention my name?
- Oh, hello, Ruth.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,235
Barry, you remember Ruth Werneke,
Star Labs' chief administrator.

16
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,337
We met at a party, didn't we?

17
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,441
I don't go to parties. Tina, I was wondering
when you're going to finish that report.

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,236
I'm working on it now, Ruth.

19
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,642
I'll be in my office.
And I'd like to get home before dawn.

20
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,011
Yes, wouldn't we all.

21
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,111
What happens at dawn,
she turns into a human being?

22
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,050
One of these days
I'm gonna strangle her.

23
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,814
Look, I'm sorry, Barry.
I've gotta finish this.

24
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,428
That's okay.
Don't work too hard, all right?

25
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,527
Okay.

26
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,618
And behold a pale horse:

27
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:20,282
And he who sat on it
had the name Death.

28
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,287
And so it begins.

29
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,399
First, Star Labs will be consumed
by the evil it created.

30
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:05,731
Then, the men who conceived
that evil will be destroyed.

31
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,136
And finally, the city that stood by
and did nothing...

32
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,244
...will pay the price for its silence.

33
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:18,373
And I have become Death,
the destroyer of worlds.

34
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,317
- What's happening?
- Contamination lockdown.

35
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,012
Come on.

36
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,623
Damn it!

37
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,554
Maybe there's another exit.

38
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,456
It's too late.

39
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,256
The building will seal itself off.

40
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,360
Looks like we won't get home
before dawn after all.

41
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,025
I'm telling you, Murph,
cost of living the way it is...

42
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,036
...it's getting real tough
to make ends meet.

43
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,606
There's another way to make money
in the department.

44
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,869
- You talking about investments?
- No, I'm talking about a sideline.

45
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,104
I'm an entrepreneur.
Here's the latest thing.

46
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,114
- "I saw the Flash."
- "I saw the Flash."

47
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,946
They cost 6 bucks to make,
we sell them for 20 bucks, man.

48
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,781
We could clean up with these. Look.

49
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,981
Wait a minute. I thought
you didn't believe in the Flash.

50
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:43,686
I don't believe in UFOs either, man,
but there's a lot of folks who do, okay?

51
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,424
Those are the people we're gonna
talk about. I see a whole cottage industry:

52
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,433
T-shirts, underwear, Flash gum.

53
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,800
- Flash gum? Wait a minute, Murphy.
- What?

54
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,840
Just wait, all right?
This guy saved my life.

55
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,137
This is beginning to sound
a little like exploitation.

56
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,144
The story of your life, Bellows,
okay?

57
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,113
Every time opportunity knocks,
you're out walking the dog.

58
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,945
It's amazing to me.

59
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,885
- You know, do you have anything saved up?
- That's weird. Did you see that.

60
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,425
That's very weird.

61
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,062
<i>Car 20</i>...

62
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,363
Say again, dispatch.

63
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,560
<i>Repeat, we have a code 10 alarm</i>
<i>at the Star Labs.</i>

64
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,332
Star Labs. On our way.
Let's roll, brother.

65
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,799
- I thought you had this fixed.
- I did.

66
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,143
See?

67
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,096
<i>Got the horse right here</i>
<i>His name is Paul Revere</i>

68
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,429
Hey, come on, we got the guys.
Where's the doll?

69
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,731
The doll is working. Again.

70
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,808
This is bad. This is terrible.
You gotta call her up, quick.

71
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,341
- No use. She won't go.
- Look...

72
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,173
...a woman has to pick the winning horse
in the last race.

73
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,043
- It's a Mendez family superstition. Please.
- Call Sabrina.

74
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,582
It's her poker night.

75
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,016
- Poker?
- Please, will you call Tina?

76
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,485
- Please.
- All right, I'll call her.

77
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,885
- Thank you.
- She won't go.

78
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,858
- Please, will you just beg her? Please.
- I'll beg. I'll beg.

79
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,226
<i>All phone lines are inoperable.</i>

80
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,529
<i>Star Labs is currently</i>
<i>in security lockdown.</i>

81
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,200
- What is it?
- I don't know.

82
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,170
Some kind of emergency
at Star Labs.

83
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,772
- Oh, my God!
- Don't touch him.

84
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,145
Whatever contaminated the lab
must have killed him.

85
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,386
What kind of work were they doing here?

86
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,785
I don't know.

87
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,427
You're the chief administrator,
it's your job to know.

88
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,190
This is a complex facility, McGee.
I can't keep tabs on every project.

89
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,401
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

90
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,471
<i>This is Star Labs security.</i>

91
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,509
<i>The lab is currently under</i>
<i>the emergency lockdown.</i>

92
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,511
<i>No access should be attempted</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

93
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,149
<i>Please stand away from the door.</i>

94
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,047
<i>Please stand away from the door.</i>

95
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,485
<i>Please stand away from the door.</i>

96
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,285
- <i>Please stand away from the door.</i>
- All right, already.

97
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,266
One of these combinations has got to work.

98
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,284
Barry, what's going on?

99
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,855
That's what I'm trying
to figure out myself.

100
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,887
And, guys, whatever you do,
stand away from the door.

101
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,530
Why?

102
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,237
- Nice talking to you. What door?
- What's wrong with him?

103
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,309
- What are you doing?
- Accessing the videotape...

104
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,850
...from the surveillance camera in that lab.
- You don't have clearance.

105
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,614
Whatever killed that man
could kill us too.

106
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,620
<i>Listen, McGee, I'm in charge here,</i>
<i>not you.</i>

107
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,425
Tina.

108
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,569
Barry! Barry, thank heavens.

109
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,398
<i>Barry, I'm losing you.</i>

110
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,008
<i>I rigged a video hookup through</i>
<i>the Star Labs satellite computer.</i>

111
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,440
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

112
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,512
<i>There seems to be some sort</i>
<i>of toxic leak.</i>

113
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,115
<i>It killed a guard.</i>
<i>That's why the lab's locked down.</i>

114
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,610
- <i>What kind of leak?</i>
- I'm not sure.

115
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,619
But it has to do with something
called Project Pandora.

116
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,121
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No, nothing.

117
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,090
- <i>Don't worry, I'll get you out of there.</i>
- No, you can't.

118
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,753
<i>If you break the seal on the door,</i>
<i>the lab will decontaminate itself.</i>

119
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,595
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- The entire lab will be irradiated. Sterilized.

120
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,533
<i>The process will destroy</i>
<i>any living tissue.</i>

121
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,637
- <i>We'll be dead within seconds.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

122
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,733
<i>So, what do we do?</i>

123
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,343
<i>What we should do is we should find out</i>
<i>what really happened.</i>

124
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,177
Hang on while I play the tape
where the accident occurred.

125
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:36,344
Wait. I can't authorize some outsider
to view one of our security tapes.

126
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,013
- Barry is a policeman.
- McGee, I'm warning you.

127
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,718
No, I'm warning you.
Now, stay out of my way!

128
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,204
<i>Those vials are floating all by themselves.</i>

129
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,413
<i>That's the security guard.</i>

130
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,389
<i>And I looked and behold a pale horse:</i>

131
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:19,554
<i>And he who sat on it</i>
<i>had the name Death.</i>

132
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,394
<i>Tina, see if there's anything else</i>
<i>on the tape.</i>

133
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,995
Let me fast-forward
and see what set off the alarm.

134
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,516
That must be how the lab
was contaminated.

135
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,255
<i>Freeze that, Tina.</i>

136
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,990
Did you see all that?

137
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,153
Yeah, I saw it. But I don't know
if I should believe it.

138
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,494
Well, the thief must have used
some sort of stealth device.

139
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,330
- An invisible man?
- <i>It's possible he found a way...</i>

140
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,065
...to generate an electromagnetic field
to bend the light rays around him.

141
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,573
<i>It's the only way I can explain</i>
<i>what's on the tape.</i>

142
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,042
- What was in the vials?
- Let's find out.

143
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,623
I can't bring up the file.

144
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,227
<i>Every time I try to access Project Pandora,</i>
<i>it disappears on me.</i>

145
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,088
It must be some sort of computer virus.

146
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,262
Let me try one of my retriever programs.

147
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,665
It's working.

148
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:38,475
"Project Pandora. Client:
Government Weapons Research Center."

149
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,872
What is this?

150
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,481
"Objective: To develop nerve toxins."

151
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,441
Nerve toxins?

152
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:51,454
"Project director: Dr. Emil Velinski.
Project coordinator: Ruth Werneke."

153
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,219
My God! Weapons research.
How could you do this?

154
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,329
Get real, McGee. This is a business,
not a science club.

155
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,762
- But we're manufacturing death here.
- Don't be so melodramatic.

156
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,596
These things never get used.
They're put up on a shelf.

157
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,931
Well, it's not
on the shelf anymore, is it?

158
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,403
<i>Tina.</i>

159
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,476
What's it say about the toxin itself?

160
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,307
I still can't access that information.

161
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,975
- You've gotta tell us everything you know.
- I'm just an administrator.

162
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,747
Well, what about this Dr. Velinski?
Maybe he could tell us something more.

163
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,686
Well, he lives somewhere in the Heights.
Near Columbus Square, I think.

164
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,091
I'll find him. You hang on.

165
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,795
I'll be here.

166
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,262
Oh, good evening, Dr. Velinski.

167
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,630
You're amazing, Reggie.
How do you do it?

168
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,830
I could tell from the sound of your shoes
and your little cough.

169
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,942
And the smell of your aftershave.

170
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,402
You're better than Sherlock Holmes.

171
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,875
Who's there?

172
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,544
Nobody here but us, Reggie.

173
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,153
Doc, there's somebody else out there.
I can feel him.

174
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,848
I think your sixth sense
just blew a fuse.

175
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,621
Look out, doc, he's right behind you!

176
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,796
For God's sake, somebody help him!

177
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,533
Dr. Velinski.

178
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,945
Hey, I don't believe it. It's really you.

179
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,483
- What happened?
- He had some kind of a seizure.

180
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,847
No, he didn't. He was murdered.

181
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,149
You're crazy.
There wasn't nobody near him.

182
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,259
I tell you, there was another guy here.
I can even describe him.

183
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,756
- Go ahead.
- Maybe 6 feet tall...

184
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,560
...and kind of wheezes when he breathes
and sweats like he was scared.

185
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,396
Call the police.

186
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,007
- Thanks.
- Anytime, Barry.

187
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,237
Yeah, Reg. Take care now.

188
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,046
<i>Barry, I was able to access</i>
<i>more information on Project Pandora.</i>

189
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,657
<i>Two of those vials</i>
<i>were an experimental, deadly toxin.</i>

190
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,060
<i>The third was the only existing</i>
<i>vial of antitoxin.</i>

191
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,899
Tina, somebody got to Dr. Velinski first.
He's already dead.

192
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,103
It looks like the thief wants to make sure
nobody's around to make more antitoxin.

193
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,501
- Would anyone else have the formula?
- <i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

194
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,076
<i>But I do know one thing:</i>

195
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:06,317
<i>The vial of toxin he's got</i>
<i>could kill everyone in Central City.</i>

196
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,485
What about you?

197
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,385
According to the computer...

198
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,792
...we have less than four hours to live.

199
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,865
All right, let's set up the line right here.

200
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,204
Edwards, I want the phone lines
fixed ASAP.

201
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,278
- Yes, sir.
- Allen, this is Quinn.

202
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,041
He's a government agent.
Barry Allen, from our crime lab.

203
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,777
Two women are trapped in the lab.
They've been exposed...

204
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,750
I'm already aware of your situation.

205
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,687
We've been monitoring your
phone conversations with Dr. McGee.

206
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,260
- Keep the media outside the perimeter.
- Since you've been eavesdropping...

207
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,556
...you know it's important
we find those vials.

208
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,063
I've got 100 federal agents
combing the city now.

209
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,101
They don't have a chance in hell.
The thief has a device...

210
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,931
...that makes him invisible.

211
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,630
It's an optical illusion at best. A trick.

212
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,268
- Or a glitch in the security cameras.
- No, sir, I don't think so.

213
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,778
If such a device did exist,
don't you think we'd know about it?

214
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,384
Relax, we'll have the vials back
within 24 hours.

215
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,680
Twenty-four hours? They'll both be dead
by then, you know that.

216
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,516
I've got a medical team standing by.

217
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,853
If necessary, we'll blow that door
off its hinges and get them out.

218
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,723
You'll trigger the sterilization system
and kill them both.

219
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,725
We're trying to override that
right now. Okay?

220
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:34,001
Barry, I know McGee is a friend of yours,
but you can't do anything right now.

221
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,801
Maybe you'd better head home
and let Quinn handle it.

222
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,367
I'm not going anywhere.

223
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:44,141
This incident is now
under federal jurisdiction.

224
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,049
Take a walk.

225
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,044
It's out of our hands, Barry.

226
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,689
The mayor got a call from Washington.
Like it or not...

227
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:56,521
And I sure as hell don't like it!
- It's Quinn's show for now.

228
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,527
Like the man said, you're out of it.

229
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,511
- What are you doing?
- We need to analyze the toxin...

230
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,047
...to find out what makes it tick.

231
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:24,081
- I don't feel so good.
- Neither do I. It must be the toxin.

232
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,625
Are we...? Are we gonna die?

233
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,024
Not if I can help it.

234
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,123
Come on.

235
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,326
I have to find that thief.
Or somebody else with the project...

236
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,902
...who can make the antitoxin.

237
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,540
But to do that,
I have to establish contact with Tina.

238
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,370
Why not hook up through
the police communications network?

239
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,069
I thought of that.
Quinn will know every move we make.

240
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,306
Not if I jam his signal.

241
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,981
<i>Mr. Allen is no longer involved</i>
<i>in this operation. I'm in charge.</i>

242
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:02,525
- I want to talk to Barry Allen.
- <i>I'm afraid that's impossible.</i>

243
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:07,028
<i>I suggest you turn over any data</i>
<i>you have immediately.</i>

244
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,499
What happened?

245
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,004
- Barry, thank God.
- <i>Julio found a way to hook us up.</i>

246
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,943
<i>I'm trying to analyze the toxin now.</i>

247
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,377
- <i>How you feeling?</i>
- Ruth's feeling pretty sick.

248
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,539
I'm not feeling too good myself.

249
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:29,778
<i>Tina, you gotta rest, okay?</i>
<i>Conserve your strength.</i>

250
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,823
<i>I've managed to get another name</i>
<i>out of the computer, Velinski's assistant:</i>

251
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,450
"Dr. Taylor Cartwright.
1624 Sherwood Park."

252
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,655
That'll be the killer's next victim.

253
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,823
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

254
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,835
You've got to reconstruct the antitoxin.

255
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,303
Reconstructing the antitoxin
without my notes...

256
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,204
...or without a sample of the toxin itself
could take days.

257
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,641
We don't have days, Dr. Cartwright.
We have hours.

258
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,577
- How are they doing?
- Not too good.

259
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,612
Tina.

260
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,754
I found Dr. Cartwright.
He'll try to reconstruct the antitoxin.

261
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,822
<i>Barry's been telling me you've been</i>
<i>analyzing the toxin.</i>

262
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,516
- Your information could help.
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>

263
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,288
<i>But, Barry, first I need</i>
<i>to talk to you alone.</i>

264
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,537
We're running out of time, Barry.

265
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,616
Stop worrying about us
and try to find the other vial of toxin.

266
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,945
If it's opened, a lot of people
are gonna die.

267
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,781
<i>You are my first priority.</i>

268
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,547
<i>Listen to me.</i>

269
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:42,091
<i>If anything should happen,</i>
<i>I just want you to</i>...

270
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,855
<i>To take care of yourself.</i>

271
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,828
<i>Nothing is gonna happen to you,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

272
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,594
<i>Now, I'm gonna find those vials in time.</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

273
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,764
All right, Allen, where is it?

274
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,341
That's what
they've been jamming us with.

275
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,873
- <i>Shut it down.</i>
- <i>Wait, Quinn.</i>

276
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,404
- Hey, wait a minute, man.
- Barry, what's going on?

277
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,712
- Dr. Cartwright, if you'll come with us.
- He's trying to reconstruct the antitoxin.

278
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,377
- He can do it under our jurisdiction.
- There isn't time!

279
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,490
Two women are in that lab.
Without the antitoxin, they'll die!

280
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,126
Edwards, cuff this man.

281
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,455
- You can't do that.
- Can't I?

282
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,394
You two are interfering
in a priority government operation.

283
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:27,004
So unless you'd like bracelets of your own,
I suggest you shut your mouth.

284
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,367
- Look, man...
- Don't.

285
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,352
Barry, what's going on?

286
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,388
Where are you taking them?

287
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,895
What the hell's going on?

288
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,628
I don't know, but it looks like trouble to me.
We better go talk to Garfield.

289
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,670
- Come on.
- All right.

290
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,281
Someone connected with this project
is trying to sabotage it, Cartwright.

291
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,520
- You'd better tell me what you know.
- I don't know anything.

292
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,926
I don't believe you.

293
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,761
Instead of wasting my time
with these ridiculous accusations...

294
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:35,635
...you should let me work on the antidote
before it's too late.

295
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,941
Get him out of here.

296
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,147
You know, I'm a cop, all right?
Is it really necessary, these handcuffs?

297
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,548
Just take them off,
and we'll go have a...

298
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:51,880
Cartwright.

299
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,048
Even if Cartwright finishes the antidote...

300
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:58,686
...we still haven't been able to bypass
the lab sterilization circuits.

301
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,128
Keep on it.

302
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:05,759
If things get tight, we'll have to force
those doors anyway.

303
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:10,374
But if we don't neutralize the fail-safe,
those women will be killed.

304
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,010
And if we do nothing at all?

305
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,374
They'll be just as dead. Right?

306
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,769
Where are they taking him?
Where are they taking him?

307
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:45,740
Quinn! Listen. You know, those vials,
you don't have to look for them, all right?

308
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,572
- He's gonna bring them to you.
- What?

309
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,306
He killed Velinski. He's gonna try
to kill Cartwright.

310
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,746
If he does, I'll catch him.

311
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,852
Damn it, he's invisible!

312
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,248
Better yet.

313
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,117
If I can nail the killer
and his invisibility machine...

314
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,021
...l'll be a big man in Washington.

315
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,753
"A big man in Washington"?

316
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,701
This time you can't escape.

317
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,308
Who are you?

318
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,173
- Death.
- I know that voice.

319
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,504
That voice...

320
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,370
Gideon.

321
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,340
Star Labs.

322
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,424
My God, he exists.

323
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,026
Don't shoot, I want him alive!

324
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,667
He disappeared!

325
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,607
He was standing right there.
He disappeared.

326
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,983
We lost him.
And Allen's disappeared too.

327
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,453
I don't care about Allen.

328
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,491
I want Cartwright's killer.

329
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,325
And that stealth device.

330
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:23,289
- Did you see his face?
- No.

331
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,930
I did.

332
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,230
It was our old friend Gideon.

333
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,634
Gideon?

334
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,278
That's the last thing Cartwright said
before he died:

335
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,313
"That voice," "Star Labs" and "Gideon."

336
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,643
I'm gonna see what the FBI
has to say about it.

337
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,514
Also, I've cross-referenced it
with Star Labs.

338
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,824
Okay, Brian Gideon.
Physicist and biochemist.

339
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,430
Worked briefly for Star Labs
about six months ago.

340
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,966
Before that, he was involved with
the Government Weapons Research Center.

341
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,934
They're the ones who paid Star Labs
to develop the toxin.

342
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,166
According to this, he lost
his security clearance and was fired.

343
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,333
I think I better have a talk with this guy.

344
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,605
You might wanna take
some reinforcements with you.

345
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,919
We spend our lives blaming others,
but we're all responsible.

346
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:31,999
I sold them my knowledge and tried
to pretend that I wasn't responsible.

347
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,130
But the people of Costa Luca know
the truth. They paid with their lives.

348
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,907
Soon Central City...

349
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:48,780
...will pay the price for harboring
the death merchants of Star Labs.

350
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,019
I will taint the waters.

351
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,482
I will poison the well.

352
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,327
And they can drink
their own destruction.

353
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,788
Looking for something?

354
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,963
You may be fast, but you can't catch
what you can't see.

355
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,068
No, wait.

356
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,733
Please.

357
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,706
What do you want?

358
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,604
The toxin.

359
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,544
And the antitoxin.

360
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,275
There are two innocent women
trapped in Star Labs.

361
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,148
- Innocent? They deserve to die.
- No!

362
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:01,449
Two thousand people died at Costa Luca.

363
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,424
- Nobody cares about them!
- Costa Luca?

364
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,655
No one remembers them except me.

365
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:12,201
Wait. There was a nerve-gas leak
from an American factory.

366
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,235
It wasn't a factory.

367
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,431
It was a secret laboratory developing
chemical weapons.

368
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:22,603
- I worked there. And Quinn was in charge.
- Quinn?

369
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:27,710
One day, there was an accident.
An accident.

370
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,083
And there were bodies everywhere.

371
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,349
But what does that got to do
with Star Labs?

372
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,389
I went to Star Labs to start over...

373
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,796
...to use my science to help people.

374
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:49,139
But then I discovered they were developing
chemical weapons for Quinn.

375
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,867
All right, but the other scientists
didn't know.

376
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,238
There are no innocents!

377
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,340
We are all responsible!

378
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,475
Stay back!

379
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:12,188
- Are you all right?
- It's just a dark spot on my CAT scan.

380
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,260
It's a brain tumor from Costa Luca.

381
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,128
You can't play with fire
and not get burned.

382
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:26,132
Gideon, give me the antidote.

383
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,643
Let me save my friend.

384
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,678
It doesn't matter.

385
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,744
They'll all be dead anyway.

386
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,984
Don't you see?

387
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:40,955
If it happens here in Central City,
then maybe we will have done something.

388
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,060
You can't kill 100,000 people.

389
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,987
- I can, and I am.
- No, there's another way.

390
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,566
We'll call the newspapers,
the television stations.

391
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,533
- We'll tell people what's going on.
- They never listen.

392
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,172
We'll make them listen!

393
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,147
- Any movement inside?
- <i>No, sir.</i>

394
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,442
<i>Checked the area thoroughly,</i>
<i>not a soul moving.</i>

395
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:11,452
All right, we're moving in.
And remember, no live ammo...

396
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,681
...just rubber bullets.

397
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,951
We're taking him alive.

398
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,452
Go!

399
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,335
I'll help you.

400
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,302
I promise.

401
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,240
I'm so tired. I'm so tired.

402
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,242
Gideon!

403
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,845
My men have the house surrounded.

404
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,912
I just wanna talk.

405
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,346
Quinn!

406
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,312
You set me up.

407
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,957
No!

408
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,471
Damn.

409
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,916
Another dead end.

410
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,217
Ruth! Are you okay?

411
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,125
My legs, they're numb.

412
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,563
It's the toxin. It attacks
the body's nerve centers.

413
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,794
Lie still.

414
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,930
We're running out of time.

415
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,371
Another half an hour, we'll be dead.

416
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,374
Barry will find the antidote.

417
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,813
No, he's looking for a needle
in a haystack.

418
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,075
And the needle is invisible.

419
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,653
There must be a way we can help him.

420
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,484
How do you make
an invisible man visible?

421
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:59,088
He has to make sounds, doesn't he?

422
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,324
Isn't there a way you can,
I don't know, detect his breathing...

423
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,162
...his heartbeat?

424
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,636
Not easy on a busy street corner,
even with directional microphones.

425
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,105
What about...

426
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,768
...heat?
- What?

427
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,912
Science was never my subject...

428
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:23,078
...but isn't there a way you can...

429
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,188
...detect his heat waves?

430
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,691
Ruth, you're brilliant!

431
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,624
You can do more than that,
you can see them.

432
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,163
It looks like some kind
of recording device.

433
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,640
I'll run it through the laser scanner,
maybe we can get an audio image.

434
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,507
Well, someone's up awful late.

435
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,115
"Invisible man should give off
infrared heat signature.

436
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,752
Seventy-five- to 100,000 angstroms."

437
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,081
- What is this?
- It's from Tina.

438
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,690
Infrared heat signature.

439
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,325
It's a way to see the invisible man.

440
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,006
What's it say?

441
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:29,119
It says, "Why didn't I think of that?"
And, "Don't give up hope."

442
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,557
This is Allen. Give me Spencer,
Search and Rescue.

443
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,928
Jack, about that infrared gear
you guys have been testing...

444
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,965
...how sensitive is it?

445
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,640
Great. Listen, I need to borrow a set.
It's an emergency.

446
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,942
Okay, I'll be down to pick it up
in a couple of minutes. Thanks.

447
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,010
Hey, Barry, I think I got something.

448
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,441
Listen to this.

449
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:01,449
<i>Soon Central City will pay the price for</i>
<i>harboring the death merchants of Star Labs.</i>

450
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,080
<i>I will taint the waters and poison the well.</i>
<i>And they will drink their own destruction.</i>

451
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,455
Poison the well?
He's gonna put it in the reservoir.

452
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,297
Infrared contact lenses, very impressive.

453
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,833
But they won't do you any good now.

454
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,102
First, you'll feel your body
going numb...

455
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,974
...then, you won't be able to breathe.

456
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,680
And then finally, you'll suffocate.

457
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,208
Your magic belt needs a power surge.

458
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,486
Someone has to do something.

459
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,030
We are all responsible.

460
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,156
Where's the antidote?

461
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,134
It's too late.

462
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,435
- The vial is broken.
- Lie still, Gideon. I'll send help.

463
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,175
Why aren't you dead?

464
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,573
Something in my metabolism
is fighting the toxin.

465
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,665
Our lab guys are still going over
Gideon's house...

466
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,202
...but it looks like he destroyed
all his research.

467
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,864
We can't let that stealth device
slip through our fingers.

468
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,806
How are we doing on getting
those women out?

469
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,810
We're almost out of time.

470
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,110
We're tapped
into Star Labs' security system...

471
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,278
...but we haven't neutralized
all the emergency countermeasures.

472
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,016
- Where does that leave us?
- There's a 50-50 chance...

473
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,888
...that if we crack that door...

474
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:08,020
...the fail-safe circuits will kick in anyhow
and irradiate the lab.

475
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,524
- 50-50?
- Yes, sir.

476
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,028
I can live with those odds.

477
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,605
Let's do it.

478
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,424
You wanna hear something terrible?

479
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,120
What?

480
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,932
I've been lying here thinking...

481
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,069
...what I'll miss most when I'm dead.

482
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,402
My family...

483
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,331
...my boyfriend, my dogs.

484
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,604
You know what I came up with?

485
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,405
What?

486
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,841
Chocolate.

487
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,344
Oh, God, yes.

488
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,549
Tina, are you afraid?

489
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,791
I'm trying not to be.

490
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,559
Is it working?

491
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,894
No.

492
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,043
We're ready, sir.

493
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,511
Cut the circuits.

494
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:09,946
Blow it.

495
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:18,495
<i>Security breach. Commence</i>
<i>radiation sequence in 10 seconds.</i>

496
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,927
- <i>Nine, eight, seven...</i>
- No!

497
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,167
The fail-safe is starting to sequence.

498
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,758
Tina.

499
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,360
Barry, I knew you'd come.

500
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,287
I found the antidote.

501
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,161
It's my blood.
I figure a couple of cc's of this...

502
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,531
...and both of you will produce enough
antibodies to fight the toxin.

503
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,535
What do you think?

504
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,936
It may work.

505
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,074
Let's go check out the damage.

506
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,649
And you better call a coroner.

507
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,078
Quinn.

508
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,584
How did they get out?

509
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,426
These two are now
in government custody.

510
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,691
Transfer them
to the Weapons Research Center...

511
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:34,201
- I don't think so.
- Allen. Stay out of this.

512
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,339
Pack up your cloak and dagger
and go home.

513
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,967
- You can't tell me what to do.
- Well, I can. I just left the mayor's house...

514
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,273
...where I reported your activities
here tonight in full detail.

515
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,939
When I left, she was on the phone
to Washington.

516
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,915
Mr. Quinn, I've just spoken
to Washington.

517
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:53,579
I have orders to confiscate
your credentials and your weapon.

518
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,486
- What?
- You're on suspension...

519
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,595
...and to be detained,
pending full investigation of your conduct.

520
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,256
This won't stick.

521
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:06,335
I've done nothing
to exceed my authority.

522
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,405
- Nothing.
- Mr. Quinn, let's have a jury decide.

523
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,270
Because tomorrow, I'm going
to call a press conference...

524
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,208
...and blow the whistle on you
and your entire operation.

525
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,976
Now go crawl back under your rock.

526
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,347
Well said, boss.

527
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,057
Let's go! Come on!

528
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,660
- Hello there.
- Hi.

529
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,626
I think after you're feeling better...

530
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,324
...we should take the racing form
and feed it into the analysis computer.

531
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,163
I think we could really clean up
at the track.

532
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,135
The only horse I would bet on
is the Flash.

533
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:47,710
Yeah? I'd need a king-size bag of oats.

534
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,743
I could see to that.

535
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,744
Mr. Quinn.

536
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,783
Stay out of my face, Allen.

537
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,623
I just thought you might want this.

538
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:06,118
- What is it?
- Well, some guy in a red suit left it for you.

539
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,365
Said it was that stealth device
you were looking for.

540
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,035
You might have a little trouble
putting it together, though.

541
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,538
