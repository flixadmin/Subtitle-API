1
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,395
Pod.

2
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,195
Find bronn or varys.

3
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,740
Tell them I am here with maester pycelle.

4
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,910
Tell them I am very much alive.

5
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,495
Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,583
Would you like something for the pain?

7
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,003
What happened?

8
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,090
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon

9
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,885
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

10
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,889
Where am I?

11
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,934
These are your new chambers.

12
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,772
A little cramped, perhaps,
but you don't need much room, do you?

13
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,984
You are no longer hand of the king.

14
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,704
For your trouble.

15
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,106
I, Joffrey of the house Baratheon,
first of my name,

16
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,985
the rightful king of the andals
and the first men,

17
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,322
lord of the seven kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

18
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,700
do hereby proclaim my grandfather,

19
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,747
tywin Lannister, the savior of the city
and the hand of the king.

20
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,511
Thank you, your grace.

21
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,483
Lord petyr baelish, step fonnard.

22
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,112
For your good service and ingenuity

23
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,823
in uniting the houses
of Lannister and Tyrell,

24
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,160
I declare that you shall be granted
the castle of harrenhal

25
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,287
with all its attendant lands and incomes

26
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:52,334
to be held by your sons and grandsons
from this day until the end of time.

27
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,170
You honor me beyond words, your grace.

28
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,133
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

29
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,306
Ser loras Tyrell.

30
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,147
Your house has come to our aid.

31
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,526
The whole realm is in your debt,
none more so than I.

32
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,695
If your family would ask anything of me,
ask it,

33
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,031
and it shall be yours.

34
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,574
Your grace,

35
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,995
my sister margaery,
her husband was taken from us before...

36
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,624
She remains innocent.

37
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,419
I would ask you to find it in your heart
to do us the great honor

38
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,880
ofjoining our houses.

39
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,759
Is this what you want, lady margaery?

40
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,973
With all my heart, your grace.

41
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,393
I have come to love you from afar.

42
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,022
Tales of your courage and wisdom
have never been far from my ears.

43
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,902
And those tales have taken root
deep inside of me.

44
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,577
I, too, have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

45
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,081
but the tales do not
do you justice, my lady.

46
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,377
It would be an honor to return your love,

47
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,255
but I am promised to another.

48
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,717
A king must keep his word.

49
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,176
Your grace,

50
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,890
in the judgment of your small council,
it would be neither proper nor wise

51
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,560
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

52
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:38,148
a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
against the throne as we speak.

53
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,569
For the good of the realm,
your councilors beg you

54
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,158
to set sansa stark aside.

55
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,329
Man: Margaery!
Man 2: We want margaery!

56
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,754
Joffrey: I would like to heed your wishes
and the wishes of my people,

57
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,381
but I took a holy vow.

58
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,383
Pycelle: Your grace,

59
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,179
the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,

60
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,808
but your father, blessed be his memory,

61
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:20,023
made this pact before the starks
revealed their falseness.

62
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,944
I have consulted with the high septon

63
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,031
and he assures me
that their crimes against the realm

64
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,910
free you from any promise
you have made to them

65
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,455
in the sight of the gods.

66
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,000
The gods are good.

67
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,336
I am free to heed my heart.

68
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,215
Ser loras, I will gladly
wed your sweet sister.

69
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,717
You will be my queen

70
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,390
and I will love you from this day
until my last day.

71
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,497
My lady.

72
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,126
My sincerest condolences.

73
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,170
They're right. I'm not good enough for him.

74
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,089
You shouldn't say that.

75
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,758
You'll be good enough for many things.

76
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,593
He'll still enjoy beating you.

77
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,430
And now that you're a woman,

78
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,183
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

79
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,728
But, if he's not marrying me...

80
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,771
He'll let you go home?

81
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,027
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

82
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,198
You have a tender heart,
just like your mother did at your age.

83
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,784
I can see so much of her in you.

84
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,455
She was like a sister to me.

85
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,002
For her sake, I'll help get you home.

86
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,091
King's landing is my home now.

87
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,678
Look around you.

88
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,264
We're all liars here.

89
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,351
And every one of us is better than you.

90
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,156
Come in.

91
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,201
Make yourself comfortable.

92
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,502
That doesn't look very comfortable.

93
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,755
Here, watch me.

94
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,678
- No need for that, my dear.
- You sure?

95
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,264
Most men like what they see.

96
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,141
I'm not like most men.

97
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,435
That's what most men say.

98
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,147
If you don't want what most men want,

99
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,609
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

100
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,486
I would like you

101
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,907
to tell me if working for lord baelish
has been all you'd hoped it would be.

102
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,327
Have we met?

103
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,830
You wouldn't remember me if we had?

104
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,373
I meet a lot of men.

105
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,667
And I think you remember all of them.

106
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,379
I think your true talents
are wasted on them.

107
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,881
You're very kind, my lord.

108
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,384
Allow me to return the favor.

109
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,226
You're afraid.

110
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

111
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,898
I know who you are.

112
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:54,404
And, unlike your current employer,
I protect those who work for me.

113
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,784
I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims
or force them to abuse each other.

114
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,287
How do you know about that?

115
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,540
I thought you said you knew who I was.

116
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,586
What can I do for you, lord varys?

117
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,769
Littlefinger looks at you
and sees a collection of profitable holes.

118
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,981
I see a potential partner.

119
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,611
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

120
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,906
He's a dangerous man.

121
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,534
But everyone has their weaknesses.

122
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,871
Your current employer hides his very well,

123
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,416
but not as well as he thinks.

124
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,964
You're a virgin, I take it?

125
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,382
Walk.

126
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,221
Childhood must have been awful for you.

127
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,140
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?

128
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,143
They laughed at you, called you names?

129
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,395
Some boys like a challenge.

130
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,899
One or two must have tried
to get inside big brienne.

131
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,651
One or two tried.

132
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,238
But you fought them off.

133
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,240
But maybe you wished one of them could

134
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,701
overpower you, fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

135
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,246
But none of them were strong enough.

136
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,706
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

137
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,669
Of course you are. You'd love to know
what it feels like to be a woman.

138
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,131
Jaime: Ah.

139
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,175
"They lay with lions."

140
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,177
Tavern girls, I'd say.

141
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,680
Probably served my father's soldiers.

142
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,183
Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.

143
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,727
That's how they earned this.

144
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,690
The glorious work of
the northern freedom fighters.

145
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,942
Must make you proud to serve the starks.

146
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,027
I don't serve the starks.

147
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,238
I serve lady catelyn.

148
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,700
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

149
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,706
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

150
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,126
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

151
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,354
I think these women would understand if...

152
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,796
I don't care what you think.

153
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,299
Man: I didn't leave it
here. I had me dagger.

154
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,550
Untie me. Now!

155
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,529
Man: I gave it to you to cut the rope,
and now I don't have me dagger no more.

156
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,097
So unless it got stuck in your arse
on its way to your cunt,

157
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,017
it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.

158
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,103
What's your business here?

159
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,063
Traveling a prisoner.

160
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,652
- You're a woman.
- A woman!

161
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,279
Well, fuck me!

162
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,782
If you've quite finished up...

163
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,163
- All right, we'll be going.
- Whoa. Whoa!

164
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,082
Who do you fight for?

165
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,710
The starks.

166
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,921
What did he do?

167
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,510
- Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
- No, stealing is a crime.

168
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,180
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

169
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
- Where are you taking him?
- To riverrun.

170
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,850
Why riverrun?

171
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,686
Steal from the tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

172
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,980
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

173
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,316
I don't give the orders.

174
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,776
He must be important to someone.

175
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,695
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

176
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,324
All right, have it your way,

177
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,618
my lady.

178
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,457
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to ashemark?

179
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,210
- No.
- Then you don't know me.

180
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,296
Do you ever go to the river market
at salt rock?

181
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,673
- Is it near ashemark?
- No.

182
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,342
I've never been there.

183
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,886
What do you think of these beauties?

184
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,515
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

185
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,393
Two of them we did, yeah.

186
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,771
Wait.

187
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,692
I do know you.

188
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,487
That's Jaime Lannister.

189
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,341
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

190
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,784
If this is the kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

191
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,707
How do you know what
the kingslayer looks like?

192
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,247
I was at whispering wood. I saw him.

193
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,809
They dragged him out of the woods
and threw him down before the king.

194
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,377
He's not the kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

195
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,337
If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

196
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,756
I have a question for you both.

197
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,175
And I want you to
answer it at the same time.

198
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,469
I count to three, you both answer.

199
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,680
What's his name?

200
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,515
One.

201
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,768
Two. Three.

202
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,869
Two quick deaths.

203
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,899
Those were stark men.

204
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,401
I don't serve the starks.

205
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,154
I serve lady catelyn.

206
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,283
I told you I'd take you to king's landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.

207
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,953
Stay.

208
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,016
Walder frey is a dangerous man to cross.

209
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,809
I know that.

210
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,312
And you mean to do it anyway?

211
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,275
I love her.

212
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,362
I know that seems important to you.

213
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,072
It is important to me.

214
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,285
Your father didn't love me when we married.

215
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,121
He hardly knew me or I him.

216
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,834
Love didn't just happen to us.

217
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,630
We built it slowly over the years,

218
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,423
stone by stone,

219
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,261
for you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.

220
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,599
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

221
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,018
but it is stronger.

222
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,813
It lasts longer.

223
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,943
And that is what would be in store for me
with one of walder frey's daughters,

224
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,487
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

225
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,531
Because she's not beautiful?

226
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,491
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

227
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,494
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

228
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,413
And you agreed to it.

229
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,833
You gave him your word.

230
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,087
Treat your oaths recklessly,
and your people will do the same.

231
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,940
If your father lived
his life for one thing...

232
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,632
My father is dead.

233
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,721
And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.

234
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,619
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

235
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,870
Melisandre: I did.

236
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,040
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

237
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,418
And I'm no better than a savage

238
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,545
trusting in a fire god.

239
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,259
I fought for your god in Blackwater bay.

240
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,721
I led my men to the
gates of the seventh hell

241
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,766
as their brothers burned
alive, and for what?

242
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,895
Attacked from behind
by tywin Lannister and the tyrells.

243
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,956
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

244
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,815
The lord of light only allows me glimpses.

245
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,234
You claimed to speak for a god.

246
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,518
Will you quit the war
just because you've lost a battle?

247
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,906
You talk about war as if you understand it.

248
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,991
I've been fighting far longer than you.

249
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,242
Have you?

250
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,578
Show me how you fight.

251
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,291
Show me.

252
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,591
Where's your god now?

253
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,053
Will he save you?

254
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,264
Where is your god?

255
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,018
Inside you.

256
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,280
I murdered my brother.

257
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,290
We murdered him.

258
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,918
Share the weight with me.

259
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,920
He wasn't your brother.

260
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,136
This war has just begun.

261
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,346
It will last for years.

262
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,641
Thousands will die at your command.

263
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,812
You will betray the men serving you.

264
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,149
You will betray your family.

265
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,986
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

266
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,115
And it will all be worth it

267
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,910
because you are the son of fire.

268
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,413
You are the warrior of light.

269
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,169
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

270
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,672
You will be king.

271
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,970
You promise these things,

272
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,474
but you don't know.

273
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,893
None of us know.

274
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,479
Let me show you.

275
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,032
Look into the fire, my king.

276
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,617
Look.

277
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,662
- I see fire.
- Keep looking.

278
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,631
Do you see?

279
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,259
Do you see, my king?

280
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,279
Yes.

281
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,292
I will kill that man.

282
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,171
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

283
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,507
how many Spears they run through me,

284
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,677
I will kill that horn-blowing
cunt before I fall.

285
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,013
They want you to know you're surrounded.

286
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,598
I know I'm surrounded.

287
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,309
I know that because
I stood on the battlements

288
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,395
and saw I was surrounded.

289
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,980
They don't want you to sleep.

290
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,940
They want to sap your spirit before...

291
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,150
Thank you, wise bald man.

292
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,905
Thank you for explaining
siege tactics to me.

293
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,703
No word from my father?

294
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,500
Send more ravens.

295
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,129
You killed all the ravens.

296
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,093
The first time I saw winterfell...

297
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,018
First time I saw winterfell,

298
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,607
it looked like something
that had been here for thousands of years

299
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,527
and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.

300
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,656
I saw it and I thought,

301
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,661
"of course, ned stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.

302
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,516
"We never stood a chance against
the man who lives here."

303
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,251
Lord stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

304
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:44,006
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.

305
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:50,387
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me of that.

306
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:58,062
You know what it's like to be told
how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?

307
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,024
To be told how much you owe them?

308
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,905
And then to go back home
to your real father...

309
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,369
I will kill that man.

310
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,912
I swear to the drowned god,

311
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,497
the old gods, the new gods,

312
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,709
to every fucking god in every
fucking heaven, I will kill that man.

313
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,544
Theon, listen to me.

314
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,547
I serve winterfell.

315
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,342
Now winterfell is yours.

316
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm bound by oath to serve you.

317
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,973
And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

318
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,599
Run.

319
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,729
Five hundred northmen
wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.

320
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,982
You can't win.

321
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,733
Wait for nightfall and run.

322
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,069
There's nowhere to run.

323
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,488
I'd never make it back to the iron islands.

324
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,868
And even if I did, even if by some miracle I
slipped through the lines and made it home,

325
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,996
I'd be a coward.

326
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,498
The greyjoy who ran.

327
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,711
The shame of the family.

328
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,339
Don't go home.

329
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,759
Join the night's watch.

330
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,597
Once a man has taken the black,

331
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,727
he's beyond reach of the law.

332
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,272
All his past crimes are forgiven.

333
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,776
I won't make it to the wall.

334
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,030
I won't make it 10 feet past
the winterfell gates.

335
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,656
There are ways.

336
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,494
Hidden passageways built
so the lords of winterfell could escape.

337
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,956
The road will be dangerous.

338
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,419
But with a little luck...

339
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,468
The night's watch
is an ancient, honorable order.

340
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,847
You'll have opportunities there.

341
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,977
The opportunity for Jon snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

342
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,148
The opportunity to make amends
for what you've done.

343
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,861
I've done a lot, haven't I?

344
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,907
Things I never imagined myself doing.

345
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,579
I've known you many years, theon greyjoy.

346
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,376
You're not the man you're pretending to be.

347
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,297
Not yet.

348
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,095
You may be right.

349
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,643
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

350
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,320
You hear that?

351
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,491
That's the mating call of the northmen.

352
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,451
They want to fuck us.

353
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
I'm ready for one.

354
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,419
They say every ironborn man
is worth a dozen from the mainland.

355
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,546
Man: Aye!

356
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,757
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

357
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,886
We die today, brothers.

358
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,141
We die bleeding from 100 wounds

359
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,894
with arrows in our necks
and Spears in our guts,

360
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,065
but our war cries will
echo through eternity.

361
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,902
They will sing about
the battle of winterfell

362
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,738
until the iron islands
have slipped beneath the waves.

363
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,784
Every man, woman
and child will know who we were

364
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,744
and how long we stood.

365
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,497
Aggar and gelmarr,

366
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,999
wex and urzen,

367
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,001
stygg and black lorren.

368
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,379
Ironborn warriors will cry out our names

369
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,883
as they leap onto the shores
of seagard and faircastle.

370
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,092
All: Aye!

371
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,720
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

372
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,723
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

373
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,807
Aye!

374
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:09,313
And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower
will stand in bronze above the shores of pyke!

375
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,522
All: Aye!

376
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,234
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

377
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,574
Thought he'd never shut up.

378
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,494
It was a good speech.
Didn't want to interrupt.

379
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,833
What is this?

380
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,501
What are you doing?

381
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,509
Let's go home.

382
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,722
Man: Come on.

383
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,483
Tyrion: Why should I believe you?

384
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
Varys: Why would I lie about it?

385
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,487
To create strife between my sister and me.

386
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,323
Where before there was nothing but love.

387
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,994
Ser mandon Moore tried to kill you
on your sister's orders.

388
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,165
If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
you'd be a dead man.

389
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,169
- Pod.
- Yes, my lord?

390
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:20,175
Would it be excessive of me to ask you
to save my life twice in a week?

391
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,137
- No, my lord.
- You're a good lad.

392
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,723
Get bronn, tell him

393
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,060
I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks
outside my door at all times.

394
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,814
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved
of his command of the city watch.

395
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,653
The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands
of your father or your sister.

396
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,990
It varies from cloak to cloak.

397
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,909
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

398
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,788
Your father paid them quite handsomely.

399
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other
for some time, my lord.

400
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,383
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

401
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,594
And I thought we were friends.

402
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,929
We are.

403
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,057
Podrick, would you mind?

404
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,953
There are many who know that without you
this city faced certain defeat.

405
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,332
The king won't give you any honors,

406
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,584
the histories won't mention you,

407
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,754
but we will not forget.

408
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,674
Come along now, podrick.

409
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,930
My love.

410
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,850
It was good of you to come.

411
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,144
Good of me? Of course I come.

412
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,027
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

413
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,279
Have you looked?

414
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,157
I will be the first.

415
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,808
Well?

416
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,977
You are a mess.

417
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,524
I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.

418
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,985
- You should charge me double.
- You think I'm here for money?

419
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,904
That was the arrangement we made.

420
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,615
I pay you and you lie to me.

421
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,577
I'm a poor little rich man
and nobody loves me,

422
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,414
so I make jokes all the time
and pay them to laugh.

423
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,165
Fuck your money.

424
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,252
- Letsleave.
- Leave?

425
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,172
Leave king's landing. They
tried to kill you. They will try again.

426
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,676
Going into wars, fighting soldiers,
you're terrible at this.

427
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,264
Let's take a boat to pentos
and never come back.

428
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,434
- You don't belong here.
- What would we do in pentos?

429
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,644
Eat, drink,

430
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,147
fuck, live.

431
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,862
I want to go with you.

432
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,405
So do it.

433
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,659
Your father, your sister, all these
bad people, they can't stop you.

434
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,245
Forget about them. Come with me.

435
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,999
I can't.

436
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,127
I do belong here.

437
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,673
These bad people are what I'm good at.

438
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,800
Outtalking them, outthinking them.

439
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,219
It's what I am.

440
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,723
And I like it.

441
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,311
I like it more than
anything I've ever done.

442
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,234
Are you going to leave?

443
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,451
You have a shit memory.

444
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,498
I am yours and you are mine.

445
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,095
Septon: In the sight of the seven,

446
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,557
I hereby seal these two souls,

447
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,938
binding them as one for eternity.

448
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,777
Look upon one another

449
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,321
and say the words.

450
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,118
- Father, Smith...
- Father, Smith...

451
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,995
- Warrior, mother...
- Warrior, mother...

452
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,040
- Maiden, crone, stranger.
- Maiden, crone, stranger.

453
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,544
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

454
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,214
- From this day until the end of my days.
- From this day until the end of my days.

455
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,826
A house of ghosts, khaleesi. It is known.

456
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,719
Where are the guards?

457
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:01,349
No guards.
The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.

458
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,561
Let them try.

459
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,284
Is this a riddle?

460
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,493
Khaleesi!

461
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,245
Khaleesi!

462
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,750
Jorah: Khaleesi!

463
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,007
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

464
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,387
You want me? Here I am.
Are you afraid of a little girl?

465
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,996
Hot pie: How did he find us?

466
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,691
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

467
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,944
How did you know we'd come this way?

468
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,614
After all the things you have seen,
this is your question?

469
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,117
How did you kill those guards?

470
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,077
Was it hard?

471
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,581
No harder than taking a new name,
if you know the way.

472
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,082
Show me how.

473
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,503
- I want to be able to do it, too.
- If you would learn, you must come with me.

474
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,005
Where?

475
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,091
Far and away across
the narrow sea to braavos.

476
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,927
My dancing master was from braavos.

477
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,974
To be a dancing master is a special thing,
but to be a faceless man,

478
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,018
that is something else entirely.

479
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,605
The girl has many names on her lips.

480
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,107
Joffrey, Cersei, tywin Lannister,

481
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,318
ilyn Payne, the hound.

482
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,154
Names to offer up to the red god.

483
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,533
She could offer them all one by one.

484
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,704
I want to.

485
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,250
But I can't.

486
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,004
I need to find my brother and mother.

487
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,965
And my sister.

488
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,761
I need to find her, too.

489
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,722
Then we must part.

490
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,099
A man has duties as well.

491
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,644
- Here.
- What is it?

492
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,980
A coin of great value.

493
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,400
Could it buy a horse?

494
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,362
It is not meant for the buying of horses.

495
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,322
Then what good is it?

496
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,699
If the day comes
when you must find me again,

497
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,119
just give that coin to any man from braavos
and say these words to him,

498
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,497
"valar morghulis."

499
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,041
Valar morghulis.

500
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,839
Please don't go, jaqen.

501
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,052
Jaqen is dead.

502
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,264
Say it again. Valar morghulis.

503
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,641
Valar morghulis.

504
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,435
Good.

505
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,570
Farewell, Arya stark.

506
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,972
Osha, what are you doing?

507
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,409
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

508
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,228
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

509
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,985
They burned it down.
They burned everything.

510
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,737
Not everything. Not you.

511
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,368
But they may come back. You have to go.

512
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,370
Put on your warmest clothes.

513
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,706
Pack as much food as you can carry
and go north.

514
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,666
North's the wrong way.

515
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,710
And mother and brother are south.

516
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,586
We don't know where.

517
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,589
There are too many enemies in the south.

518
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,717
Go to the wall, to Jon.

519
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,594
He'll look after you
and let your mother know you're safe.

520
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,722
I don't want to leave you.

521
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,100
No more than I want to leave you.

522
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,436
I pulled you into the world.

523
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,355
Both of you.

524
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,109
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

525
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,778
And for that, I consider myself very,

526
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,072
very lucky.

527
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,826
Go now with hodor. Go on.

528
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,620
I'll be right here.

529
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,546
Osha.

530
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,674
You must protect them.

531
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,135
You're the only one who can.

532
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,016
You may have to protect them
against your own kind.

533
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,518
I've got no great love for my own kind.

534
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,149
I'll get you milk of the poppy.

535
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,986
- Tell me where to find it.
- I don't want milk of the poppy.

536
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,873
Do it quickly.

537
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,824
Moon of my life.

538
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,589
This is dark magic, like the magic
that took you from me.

539
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,468
Took you from me before I could even...

540
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,390
Maybe I am dead and
I just don't know it yet.

541
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,769
Maybe I am with you in the night lands.

542
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:39,565
Or maybe I refused to enter the night lands
without you.

543
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:45,946
Maybe I told the great stallion to go fuck
himself and came back here to wait for you.

544
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,533
That sounds like something you would do.

545
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:04,590
Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream...

546
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,467
I do not know.

547
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,597
These are questions
for wise men with skinny arms.

548
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,019
You are the moon of my life.

549
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,897
That is all I know...

550
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,983
And all I need to know.

551
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,655
And if this is a dream...

552
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,785
I will kill the man
who tries to wake me.

553
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,187
Until the sun rises in the west
and sets in the east,

554
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,859
until the rivers run dry

555
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,696
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

556
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,323
They miss their mother.

557
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,201
They want to be with you.

558
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,119
Do you want to be with them?

559
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,579
You will be.

560
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,667
When your dragons were born,
our magic was born again.

561
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,669
It is strongest in their presence.

562
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,923
And they are strongest in yours.

563
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,092
You will be with them,

564
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,012
through winter, summer,

565
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,598
winter again.

566
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,851
Across a thousand, thousand seasons

567
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,686
you will be with them.

568
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,898
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

569
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,782
Welcome home, Daenerys stormborn.

570
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,284
This is not my home.

571
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,788
My home is across the sea,
where my people are waiting for me.

572
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,998
They will be waiting a long time.

573
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,268
Dracarys.

574
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,110
Ygritte: We should be there by sundown.

575
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,698
Won't be a fun night for you.
Mance knows how to make crows sing.

576
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,746
If you know what to say,
you mightjust make it through the night.

577
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,043
Not talking's not the way to go.

578
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,421
Careful with that.

579
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,381
You might out yourself.

580
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,426
Never swung a sword before, have you?

581
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,053
You look like a baby with a rattle.

582
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,346
Enough of that!

583
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,858
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

584
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,403
So you can give mance rayder
an invitation to castle black?

585
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,655
Let 'em fight.

586
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,886
That's it? That's what you can do?

587
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,930
You little shit.

588
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,062
Your traitor father teach you that?

589
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,776
Or was it your whore mother?

590
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,506
We are the watchers on the wall.

591
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,438
You can tell mance

592
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,150
that's the man who killed qhorin halfhand.

593
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,541
- Burn the body.
- Man: Aye.

594
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,669
You don't want this
one coming back for you.

595
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,809
Come along, Jon snow.

596
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,630
Time to meet the king-beyond-the-wall.

597
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,719
What the...

598
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,978
Doreah: Khaleesi, please.

599
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,146
He said you'd never leave qarth alive.

600
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,273
Daenerys: Come.

601
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,306
Nothing.

602
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,150
Thank you, xaro xhoan daxos.

603
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,361
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

604
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,826
I am king of qarth.
I can help you now, truly help you.

605
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,786
We can take the iron throne.

606
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,307
- I'll bring you a thousand ships.
- Please, khaleesi, I beg you.

607
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,249
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

608
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,001
I beg you, please!

609
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,963
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

610
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,882
Xaro: Khaleesi!

611
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,654
It's all a lie.

612
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,032
Looks real enough to me.

613
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,705
Real enough to buy a ship?

614
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,709
Aye, a small ship.

615
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:53,136
Take all the gold and jewels.

616
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,257
I thought we were coming north
to fight wildlings.

617
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,720
Is this goat?

618
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,847
It's moose.

619
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,018
People shouldn't live anywhere
you need to burn shit to keep warm.

620
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,229
Well, you see a tree, let me know.

621
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,568
If you step back and think about it,

622
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,862
the thing about gilly
that's so interesting is...

623
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,031
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

624
00:58:54,614 --> 00:59:00,078
The thing about her that I find so interesting
is that after all that craster's done to her,

625
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,622
she's still got hope
that life might get better.

626
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,876
The thing about gilly
that you find so interesting

627
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,378
is that she said six words to you.

628
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,257
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

629
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,217
is absolutely nothing.

630
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,474
It's Jon and the halfhand. They're back.

631
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,897
Two blasts is wildlings.

632
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,816
You're not fighting them alone. Come on.

633
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,489
Grenn: Three blasts?

634
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,032
Run!

635
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,999
Wait! Wait for me!

636
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,962
Grenn!
