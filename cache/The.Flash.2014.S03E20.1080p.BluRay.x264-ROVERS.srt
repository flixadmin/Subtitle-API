00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,605
BARRY: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,723
<i>Next time you decide to release
my friend's inner ice demon,</i>

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,001
<i>you do it sometime in July.</i>

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,645
I was trying to save her life, Cisco.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,444
When I became Killer Frost,

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,484
<i>Savitar appeared to me
and showed me the way.</i>

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,761
If the answers that we need

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,167
to stop Savitar and save you
are in the future,

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,327
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,522
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,767
Just tell me how you did it.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,161
- I had help.
- Help from who?

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,249
A physicist. Her name is Tracy Brand.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,164
I know who you are.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,521
Cecile,

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,850
most people quit
their New Year's resolutions by now.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,081
Uh-uh.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,489
Central City Marathon is in two months,
and I've got to shave...

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,687
Oh! I've still got half a minute
I've got to take off my time. You?

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,689
A lot more than 30 seconds.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,562
Look, I am going to wait for you
at the end of the marathon.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,529
No, you're not pulling out of this thing.

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,890
I am not as easy with running
as some other members of my family.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,646
I'm gonna let it slide. I'm gonna let it.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,807
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,081
Are you getting mad?

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,371
I would never get mad.
I love you too much to be mad.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,844
Uh... Yeah. That's... I...

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,007
I didn't really mean to...

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,241
No, absolutely, it's...

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,169
I was looking at you, and it came out,
and I don't want you

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,646
- to feel uncomfortable.
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Hold on.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,281
- Sorry, I've got to take this.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go for it.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,687
Yeah? Okay, I'm on my way.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,721
Yeah.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,601
Sorry. I've got to head out.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,331
Her name is Tracy Brand.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,727
She's one of the world's
top theoretical physicists.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,410
You know, or at least, she will be.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,166
No kidding.
Girl Scout earns her merit badges.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,331
2021 Nobel Prize,
Copley Medal, presidential commendation...

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,050
She's a genius. What's that to us?

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,447
She's the key to stopping Savitar.

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,483
Future me said that four years from now,

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,047
Dr. Brand invents the technology
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,441
Four years too late?

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,005
Yeah, but if she invents the tech then,

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,844
then maybe she's working
on the prototype now.

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,606
That's exactly right,
so we should find her.

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,131
Agreed.

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,684
Sorry, why are we not looking
for Caitlin, again?

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,851
Easy, Romeo and Julian.
None of us have forgotten about Caitlin.

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,567
Right, but Future Flash already confirmed
that she teams up with Savitar.

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,406
We should be doing everything in our power
to stop that from happening.

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,607
- We know.
- We know.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,690
Right, so what is Wally doing swanning off
to Earth-3 to be with his girlfriend?

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,609
He could be here right now
looking for her!

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,928
- It's like no one's doing a thing!
- CISCO: <i>No one's doing a thing?</i>

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,361
Barry and Wally searched the city
half a dozen times.

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,527
No one's doing a thing?

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,484
Every chance I get,
I try to vibe where she is.

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,489
We're using facial recognition technology.

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,205
We're using the meta-human app,
the satellite.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,482
- We're doing everything we can.
- I just wanna her back, okay?

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,409
Yeah, well,
if you wanted her here so badly,

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,806
maybe you shouldn't have ripped off
that necklace

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,445
- and turned her into a killer.
- BARRY: <i>Okay.</i>

68
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,165
- Okay. All right.
- CISCO: <i>Just saying.</i>

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,011
We got a hit.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,409
Tracy Brand, currently enrolled
in C.C.U.'s Theoretical Physics program.

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,602
So our hopes
of defeating an evil speed god

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,808
- hinge on a grad student?
- Yep.

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,203
Could be worse.
B.A., Cisco, let's do this.

74
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,730
Let's go.

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,084
CISCO: Ah... The soul-sucking
fluorescence of academia.

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,441
Yeah, this is exciting, though.

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,483
It's like meeting Norbert
before he was Einstein.

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,444
- Albert.
- Norbert, Albert...

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,051
Do you guys smell that?

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,408
Toast?

81
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,881
Holy...

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,964
WOMAN: Hey!

83
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,801
What are you doing?

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,611
You mean,
save you from a painful, fiery death?

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,689
I had it under control.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,570
- Come on!
- Okay, you know what?

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,728
Let's put this down
while you still have your eyebrows?

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,200
Did you set the fire on purpose?

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,811
Yes, I'm burning everything.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,801
- What?
- Everything? What...

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,321
My work.
Well, I don't know why they call it "work"

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,249
because none of it works.

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,602
Well, this isn't exactly what I expected.

94
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,926
Me, neither.

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,210
- Dr. Brand?
- Oh, no, just Tracy.

96
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,805
I failed my dissertation.

97
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,046
Nothing like 10 years down the drain
and a pile of debt as a legacy.

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,568
Tracy, we were just hoping
that you'd have a moment to talk.

99
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,286
Oh, no, my bus leaves in five minutes.

100
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,608
Oh, please tell me
I didn't burn my bus ticket.

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,600
That's hot.
Your bus... Where are you going?

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,564
Big Belly Burger. I hear they're hiring.

103
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,560
What, you're...
What about all your research?

104
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,401
Oh. No, you mean my "unsubstantiated
and transactional inquiry"

105
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,604
"into the purely suppositional nature
of extra-dimensional energy"?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,967
- Yes.
- Yeah.

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,606
A waste of time, or as Dr. Hersh puts it,

108
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,724
"a total misapplication
of the university's resources."

109
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,366
I might as well start practicing,
"Do you want fries with that?"

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,681
- Yes.
- No.

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,961
- B.A.
- BARRY: <i>Stop.</i>

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,764
Look, don't let the naysayers
get you down.

113
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,884
Your doubts, they're traitors.
Don't believe them.

114
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,209
Your mind is too fine to waste
turning tubers into finger chups.

115
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,125
- Finger chips?
- Finger chups, it's like a...

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,446
- He's from out of town. H.R.
- Stop.

117
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,449
Look, you can't give up.

118
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,449
Your work
on relativistic quantum mechanics

119
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,529
and its application to interspatial theory

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,361
to manipulate matter on a subatomic level,
it's ground-breaking.

121
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,845
I haven't shared that hypothesis
with anyone other than my therapist.

122
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,970
- Who are you?
- BARRY: <i>We're therapists.</i>

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,161
CISCO: <i>No.</i>
H.R.: <i>No.</i>

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,969
Admission here is so easy.

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,370
Get her out of here. Go!

126
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,361
So you've gone full-on Killer Frost, huh?

127
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,726
New threads and everything.

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,169
No more pencil skirts for me.

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,840
I don't wanna hurt you.

130
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,881
You won't, but I will hurt her.

131
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,327
Cisco! Hey! Hey! You good?

132
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,881
- Yeah. That's gonna leave a mark.
- Come. Come on.

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,727
- Caitlin's after Tracy.
- BARRY: Yeah.

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,251
That means she's working with Savitar.

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,531
That's definitely her, Detective,
icy eyes and all.

136
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,845
Yeah, that's her.

137
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,883
So I'm gonna spread this around
so everyone knows to look for her.

138
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,969
- Can you give me one second?
- Mmm-hmm.

139
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,890
All right.
So, if Caitlin wants Tracy dead,

140
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
I guess what you saw in the future
was true.

141
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,569
She's teamed up with Savitar.

142
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,410
I just didn't think
it was gonna happen this soon.

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,409
It certainly makes things
more complicated.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,045
Makes what more complicated?

145
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,567
Uh... There was a meta-attack at C.C.U.,

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,446
and we just don't have much to go off of.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,405
Really? It's a college campus.
Isn't there video footage?

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,921
Uh... No, it got erased.

149
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,931
Uh, well, I'm sure
you two will figure it out.

150
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,480
Joe, can I...

151
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,926
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,571
So I'm feeling weird about this morning.

153
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,721
I...

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,009
Look, when I told you that I loved you,
I didn't mean to make you feel pressured.

155
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,043
No, no, no, I didn't feel pressured.

156
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,564
Okay, so we're good?

157
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,121
- We're great.
- Great.

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,521
Okay. Um...

159
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,483
In that case, good luck with your meta.

160
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,690
Um... So I totally heard that.
Do you wanna talk?

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,251
No. Hey, where are you going?

162
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,891
Oh, nearest bus stop.

163
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,402
No, you should stay here. Um...
With Detective West for a little bit.

164
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,007
Why? That sketch artist
was like freaking Michelangelo,

165
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,201
and you've got your woman.

166
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,370
Not yet, and until we do,
you could be in a lot of danger.

167
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,331
You really think Jack Frost's sister
wants to kill me? I'm no one.

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,244
In my experience,
if she's come after you once,

169
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,726
she's likely to do it again.

170
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,447
Look, this whole witness-overprotection
thing is totally unnecessary.

171
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,920
It was just a random attack.

172
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,923
Oh, the bus is coming. I've got to go.

173
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,928
We need to keep an eye on her.

174
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,011
Yeah, we do.

175
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,521
She got away.

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,042
I told you exactly where she'd be.

177
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,765
Barry and Cisco were there when I arrived.

178
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,122
As I told you they would be.

179
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,287
Maybe there's more Caitlin Snow inside you
than you led me to believe.

180
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,648
Are you saying I let her go on purpose?

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,961
Did you?

182
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,610
You call yourself Killer Frost,

183
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,724
but you haven't actually killed
anyone yet.

184
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,324
You and I can both be gods,

185
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,245
free of the pain and suffering of man.

186
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,971
All you have to do is kill the girl.

187
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,131
Okay. Look, I might not have any cash,

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,325
but I have one of those Jitters cards
that has 10 stamps on it,

189
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,927
which means you owe me a free drink. Okay?

190
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,321
Allow <i>moi</i> to help out
a damsel in distress.

191
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,931
I will pay for myself and the lady.

192
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,168
I will have a triple-shot,
no whip, mocha-Flash

193
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,528
and anything this young lady desires.

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,491
Yeah, I need to calm down, so a Zoom.

195
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,081
- A Zoom? Never heard of it.
- Mmm.

196
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,004
- Oh, it's on the secret menu.
- Secret menu?

197
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,844
Triple espresso with a shot of cayenne.

198
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,363
- Marry me.
- Hey, wait.

199
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,931
You were at the college this morning.

200
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,844
- No. This morning? Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,805
No, I remember you now. Yes, I was. H.R.

202
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,520
Wait. What is with you people?
Did the C.C.P.D. send you to find me?

203
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,843
No, no, no. No, the reason I am here is,

204
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,043
my team and I are very interested
in your research.

205
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,281
- Really?
- Yes.

206
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,209
You're interested in
my theories on quantum mechanics?

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,809
Your ideas of wave-particle duality,
your quantization of energy,

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,527
and your time-symmetric formulation
of quantum theory, and...

209
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,202
how the boundary conditions
lead to principle causality

210
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,005
and the psychological arrow of time.

211
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,362
And the psychological arrow of time.

212
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,721
You really know your stuff.

213
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,965
Well, <i>je suis </i>smart.

214
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,043
Lay off the French,
and lay off the improv, too, please?

215
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,401
Just keep her talking.

216
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,648
Ah, thank you, Misha.

217
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,209
- Please, the Zoom.
- Thank you.

218
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,004
- You're welcome.
- Let's zoom.

219
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,928
Mate, was it just me, or did it sound
like H.R. was trying to flirt?

220
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,164
Hmm. Didn't notice.

221
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,087
Listen, the security footage today
from C.C.U.,

222
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,245
the stuff that we wiped
to protect Caitlin's identity? I saw it.

223
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,522
As in I saw the two of you squaring off.

224
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,161
Okay.

225
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,885
Well, from the angle that I saw,

226
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,606
it looked like
you had a pretty clear shot.

227
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,567
Okay.

228
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,922
You had a clear shot, Cisco,
and you didn't take it. Why?

229
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,123
Julian, I'm trying to focus on
what we're here to focus on.

230
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,044
I suggest you do the same.

231
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,769
Gents, how we doing?

232
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,601
Uh, all good.

233
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,807
I don't know about this one, Barr.

234
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,724
H.R. isn't exactly our best closer.

235
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,365
He'll be fine.

236
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,364
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just...

237
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,246
BARRY: <i>Cecile?</i>

238
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,285
She's just...
She caught me off-guard.

239
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,882
- Mmm-hmm.
- Just didn't think we were there yet.

240
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,049
Well, obviously, she is.

241
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,648
- Are you'?
- <i>I care for her a lot.</i>

242
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,409
It's just, with everything going on
with Iris and Savitar

243
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,845
and now Caitlin, just feel
like I lie to Cecile all the time.

244
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,491
<i>Then maybe you should stop.</i>

245
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,641
You're gonna have to tell her about Wally
and me and all this at some point, right?

246
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,410
So why not now?

247
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,651
Well, just so you know, you don't have
to keep her in the dark for us.

248
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,286
If you love her,
you should be honest with her.

249
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,967
At least, that's what you'd tell me to do.

250
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,005
Okay, so here's the thing

251
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,521
that I could never get them
to understand at the university.

252
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,761
See...

253
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,322
- Yeah?
- I've been studying speedsters.

254
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,521
Uh-huh.

255
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
And so you know how, when they run,

256
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,124
they generate
a trail of lightning behind them?

257
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,685
Right. Lightning.

258
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,525
I don't think all of that is generated
by them running.

259
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,364
- I think...
- No?

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,008
Some of it comes from somewhere.

261
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,483
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like some sort of a... Like a...

262
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,848
Speed Force?

263
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,690
Yeah. Wait. That is a great term for it.

264
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,041
- "Speed Force."
- Well, thanks.

265
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,362
Anyway, so I've been doing
some calculations.

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,321
I think there might be
a way to manipulate it.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,847
- Mmm-hmm.
- Maybe even control it.

268
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,004
Maybe even turn it into a prison.

269
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,891
Maybe. Um, yeah.

270
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,049
Yeah. Just a random thought.

271
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,890
How do you think
one would accomplish that?

272
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,081
- See, I don't know.
- Okay.

273
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,402
Because the university
wouldn't fund my research.

274
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,931
Why are you so interested in this?
Because everybody thinks I'm a crackpot.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,367
I certainly don't think you're a crackpot.

276
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,601
I...

277
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,685
What's wrong?

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,240
- We should go.
- Wait. What?

279
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
I think we should go. Yep.

280
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,162
Guys, guys, we need a little help here.

281
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,044
We've got a little trouble here!

282
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,441
Flash?

283
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,568
- Where is she?
- FROST: <i>Right here.</i>

284
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,401
Her again?

285
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,886
Caitlin. Caitlin, stop!

286
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,890
- Get her out of here!
- Wait, wait. What did I ever do to you?

287
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,611
So, what, you're Savitar's lackey now?

288
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,811
More fun to reign in hell, and all that.

289
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,289
All right.
I'm gonna get her to head back this way.

290
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,608
When she does, you've got
to knock her out, okay? Okay?

291
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,801
Yeah.

292
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,326
Now, Cisco!

293
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,841
Savitar says I'm not allowed to kill you,

294
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,522
but I can't have you following me around.

295
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,085
It was the left leg last time, right?

296
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,361
What?

297
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,530
Scar tissue's a lot more sensitive
than regular tissue.

298
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,970
This isn't you.

299
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,771
It is now.

300
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,928
Cait. Cait!

301
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,886
This is where
the Flashy Flash goes to, huh?

302
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,402
It's not exactly what I imagined,
but it's cool.

303
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,761
So I always wondered how you kept

304
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,407
the friction from building up
a lethal dose of static charge.

305
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,089
Yeah, that's vulcanized Teflon.
It neutralizes any electron imbalance.

306
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,445
Okay, and the White Witch?
I'm guessing you know why she's after me?

307
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,003
Well, she's teamed up
with an evil speedster from the future,

308
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,844
and, apparently,
you develop the technology

309
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,402
to trap him for an eternity, so...

310
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,450
You can't be serious.

311
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,246
Totally serious.

312
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,329
An evil speedster?

313
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,761
He calls himself Savitar.

314
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,531
- "Savitar," and he's from the future?
- IRIS WEST: <i>Yep.</i>

315
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,808
- And I build a trap for him? Me?
- You.

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,809
BARRY:
<i>He wants to kill you before you build it.</i>

317
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,844
That's why he's sending
Killer Frost after you.

318
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,811
"Killer Frost"? Her name is Killer Frost?

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,809
- H.R.: Yeah.
- We know it's a lot to take in.

320
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,646
Well, to be fair, you're basically
telling me I'm Sarah Connor in <i>Terminator.</i>

321
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,201
- More like...
- Well, Miles Dyson.

322
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,124
Yeah. But good effort, though.

323
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,210
So, wait.
You're telling me my ideas about the...

324
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,010
The Speed Force.

325
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,642
Speed Force, being able to control it,
manipulate it, all of that...

326
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,201
I'm right?

327
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,731
It appears so.

328
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,966
That's me.

329
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,002
Nobel Prize? All of that?

330
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,202
In the future, yeah.

331
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,849
Look, Tracy.

332
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,362
We need your help.
We need you to build this trap now.

333
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,526
What happens if I don't build the trap?

334
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,044
Someone very important to us
is going to die.

335
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,084
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

336
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,604
I know that normally one of you fellows
goes out for the chat,

337
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,165
but I got this one.

338
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,845
Tracy? Oh, Tracy?

339
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,886
Working.

340
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,441
I can see.

341
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,287
I thought you'd like to be informed
that H.R.'s managed to talk Tracy around.

342
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,931
Oh, perfect.
That means we can get to work.

343
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,043
Yeah, there's one thing
I need to know first.

344
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,562
Outside Jitters earlier,
you could've stopped Caitlin with a vibe,

345
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,804
but just like C.C.U., you didn't.

346
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,402
- I'm not doing this again with...
- No, no, no.

347
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,886
You are.

348
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,283
I need to know, Cisco.

349
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,090
Tell me why you couldn't do it.

350
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,811
Get out of my way.

351
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,209
Caitlin could be home now.

352
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,088
Had you stopped her, she would be here.

353
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,961
But you didn't. You couldn't.

354
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,246
- Tell me why!
- Because I'm afraid!

355
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,246
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid of killing her!

356
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,769
I'm walking around with
two loaded guns here, ready to go off.

357
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,244
And what if she's hurting
Barry or Joe or you,

358
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,609
and I have to save you,
and I can't control my powers,

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,966
and I end up killing her?

360
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,451
She's my best friend,
and I'd rather it be me than her.

361
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,281
Hey.

362
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,481
Hey.

363
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,131
How's Tracy holding up?

364
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,646
<i>We'll see.</i>

365
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,329
Um...

366
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,851
Have you told Cecile about us yet?

367
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,802
Cecile is the only thing normal
I have in my life right now,

368
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,650
and I like having something normal.

369
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,522
If I tell her about all of this,
that goes away.

370
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,962
But if you don't tell her...

371
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,687
- There may not be an "us."
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,329
Joe, there's no such thing as normal.

373
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,161
Love is the only thing
that makes the fight worth it,

374
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,527
and it's the only thing
that's gonna get us through it.

375
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,563
Guys. Guys, there you are.

376
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,963
We've got a big problem. Tracy's gone.

377
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,401
I checked C.C.U., her apartment,
and Jitters. Tracy's not at any of them.

378
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,371
I'll bet you Savitar and Killer Frost
are hunting her down as we speak.

379
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,409
H.R., you were with Tracy last.
How did she seem?

380
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,483
Rattled, Ms. West. Rattled.

381
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,250
But I gave her a rousing
and reassuring pep talk,

382
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,402
so I think she's okay.

383
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,762
- Oh, that's why she left.
- That's not why... I'll...

384
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,082
Look, I'll have you know,
my book on motivational speeches,

385
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,890
<i>All's Wells that Ends Wells...</i>

386
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,041
Tracy is in danger.

387
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,004
- You're right. Iris, focus.
- What?

388
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,441
- We need to find her. Now.
- Yeah, we've got to find her.

389
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,883
Where else could she be?

390
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,406
Oh...

391
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,886
Why don't we start
with her future hologram, right?

392
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,445
That'll give us insight
into her psyche, no?

393
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,681
Of course, yeah.

394
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,291
- That's pretty good.
- Thank you.

395
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,090
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

396
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,401
- She's cute.
- This is creepy, right?

397
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,561
- Yeah.
- I find her charming.

398
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,643
Do you think you could
screenshot a hologram?

399
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,251
Go back to that last one.

400
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,130
Yeah, there's another one like it.

401
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,962
- Whoa! Whoa! Look at that. Zoom in.
- Yeah.

402
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,765
<i>Eppur...</i>

403
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,084
<i>Eppur si muove.</i>

404
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,447
Tracy, you blessed paramour of science.
Gang, I know exactly where she is.

405
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,046
<i>Eppur si muove.</i>

406
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,202
"And yet it moves."

407
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,283
Galileo's famous statement,

408
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,011
uttered moments
after being forced to recant his theory

409
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,488
that the Earth revolves around the sun.

410
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,607
"And yet it moves." Mocha-Flash for me.
A Zoom for my lady.

411
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,047
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

412
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,645
How did you know I was here?

413
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,644
Um, I might have done
a bit of holographic stalking.

414
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,211
I stalked you holographically.

415
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,962
You mean in the future I'm still obsessed
with a 500-year-old Italian polymath?

416
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,810
H.R.: <i>Yes, it would appear so.</i>

417
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,010
- I'm sorry I ran off. I just...
- No.

418
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,810
- Just needed to clear my head and think.
- Of course.

419
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,331
And this is where I do it best.

420
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,410
I can see that.
That statue is nothing if not inspiring.

421
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,201
Concrete beard, foreboding, smart.

422
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,210
- Totally inspiring.
- Yep.

423
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,371
You know, Galileo's peers
thought he was a crackpot, too.

424
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,561
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

425
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,490
- And I used to find that comforting.
- Oh.

426
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,371
But then when your team
showed me the future,

427
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,370
showed me that my crazy ideas
aren't so crazy after all,

428
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,084
I just felt more intimidated than ever.

429
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,444
Well, I can see that.

430
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,526
It's like you're sitting
in the shadow of greatness.

431
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,160
- Your own greatness, right?
- Exactly!

432
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,849
It's like I've failed so many times,
that's all I know how to do.

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,087
I don't know how to be
that brilliant woman in the hologram.

434
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,365
But you wouldn't understand.
You are a born genius.

435
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,686
Yeah, about that,
I'm not technically a genius.

436
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,721
That was a cheap thing to do. I'm sorry
I misled you about me being a genius.

437
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,761
The point is, you are a genius.

438
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,566
You are. I know it. I can...
I can feel it.

439
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,566
It's right there. It's right there
just brimming just below the surface.

440
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,722
- It is?
- Yes, absolutely.

441
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,923
Yes, it is, Tracy.

442
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,567
And you can defeat Savitar.

443
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,450
All you need is
to just believe in yourself.

444
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,925
For what it's worth,

445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,731
I already do.

446
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,081
Hmm.

447
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,010
- Hi.
- Hey.

448
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,241
I didn't know you were dropping by.

449
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,131
Yeah, well, if you'd read
any of my texts you'd know.

450
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,451
Yeah. Um...

451
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,451
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

452
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,602
<i>It's why I'm here. Look,</i> I...

453
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,287
You know, it doesn't take a detective
to see that something's not right.

454
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,841
Look, Cecile...

455
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,645
Is it because I said,
"I love you," this morning?

456
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,887
Because, Joe, it's... It's okay
if you're not ready to say it back.

457
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,884
No, no, it's not about that.

458
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,282
No? Well, then what's going on?

459
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,290
'Cause you've been acting weird all day.
I mean, not just with us this morning,

460
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,647
but at work with that meta case. I...

461
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,962
You've got to give me something, Joe.

462
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,970
All I can say is that
part of my life is very complicated,

463
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,325
and if you were to become part of that,

464
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,162
your life would be very complicated,
and it would change us.

465
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,211
And I mean change us forever.

466
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,201
It's not a bad thing, you know.
It's called growth.

467
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,729
And then I was thinking
about what you said this morning,

468
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,168
and it told me where you were.

469
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,408
It also showed me where I was, and...

470
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,961
And you add those complications

471
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,648
and I think we should stop
seeing each other.

472
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,566
Really?

473
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,968
That's what you think we should do?

474
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,329
I... I think it's the best thing
for both of us.

475
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,291
Here I was thinking that being together
was the best thing for both of us.

476
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,204
I guess I'll... I'll see you
around the station, Joe.

477
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,001
- Cecile!
- Joe.

478
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,806
- No, I guarantee you I'm faster.
- Joe, help.

479
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,003
Caitlin, we can talk about this.

480
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,844
FROST: <i>I'll talk. You listen.</i>

481
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,203
In an hour, you're gonna get a message
with an address.

482
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,724
Bring me Tracy Brand,
or I will kill your little sweetheart.

483
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,644
Joe.

484
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,961
Wait.

485
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,403
So you're saying that if we
don't turn Tracy over to Killer Frost...

486
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,011
She's gonna kill Cecile.

487
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,247
Correct me if I'm wrong,

488
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,642
but Tracy is our key
to finding Savitar, right?

489
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,887
Yes, but what are we gonna do?

490
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,481
We're gonna just let Killer Frost
live up to her name and kill somebody?

491
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,284
Not if I have anything to say about it.

492
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,450
All I'm saying is, we need to do
whatever it takes to save her.

493
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,610
No one's gonna die, all right?
We're gonna get her back, I promise.

494
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,161
That's them.
They're at the old Dressler Factory.

495
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,887
Okay, we know where they are.
That's something.

496
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,131
So what do we do?

497
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,005
I have a plan.

498
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,089
- Cisco, can I have a quick word?
- Not now, Julian.

499
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,442
Listen, please, mate, just...
Just hear me out.

500
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,567
I know you're terrified of losing her.

501
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,927
So am I.

502
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,842
I know you're... You're worried about
not being able to control your powers,

503
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,725
but I know you can.

504
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,322
I don't think your abilities have ever
come from a place of negativity or hate.

505
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,124
They come from somewhere good.

506
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,045
They come from love.

507
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,203
If you can find it in you to stop her,
then I really think we can save her.

508
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,206
Cheers, mate.

509
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,725
H.R.: <i>Hi.</i>

510
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,886
Yeah, you know how I said, you know,
we were gonna keep you safe?

511
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,241
Um, yeah.

512
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,168
So now I need to ask you
to do something dangerous.

513
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,090
Cecile. Are you all right?

514
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,961
Joe, I'm okay. She didn't hurt me.

515
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,926
FROST: That's because
killing you does nothing for me.

516
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,124
Killing you, Tracy, that's everything.

517
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,011
Hand her over.

518
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,325
You don't have to do this.

519
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,050
Yes, I do.

520
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,925
Why? Because Savitar commands it?

521
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,811
He's not a god.
He's just a man that's using you.

522
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,770
- Come on. You're one of...
- "One of us"?

523
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,605
- We're...
- "We're a family"?

524
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,923
- We protect each other till the end.
- "We protect each other till the end."

525
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,086
How are you doing that?

526
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,731
Savitar told me everything you'd say.

527
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,287
You two are more alike than you realize.

528
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,090
You see, that's how Savitar knows
every move you're going to make.

529
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,762
He's always one step ahead of you

530
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,122
because this is all history to him.

531
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,326
That's how I know
Cisco's in the rafters right now.

532
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,771
Oh, no.

533
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,400
No!

534
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,090
It's over, Caitlin.

535
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,530
Caitlin is dead.

536
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,685
Not to me.

537
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,566
Go, go, go.

538
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,641
Caitlin. You're alive.

539
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,929
I'm sorry. I had to stop you to save you.

540
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,966
My ascension is nearly at hand, Flash.

541
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,286
As I rise, you will fall.

542
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,963
How do we keep surviving these things?

543
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,969
'Cause we're in control of our fates.

544
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,885
And how did she know
I was up in the rafters?

545
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,650
<i>Is she psychic now, too?</i>

546
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,649
And that thing where you guys
were talking at the same time,

547
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,285
how do you think she was doing that?

548
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,807
I don't know. She said Savitar told her
what was gonna happen.

549
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,646
No way, man, this wasn't
just brushing up on days to come.

550
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,650
This was precise. Scary precise.

551
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,367
- Like Savitar was there.
- Mmm-hmm.

552
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,686
IRIS WEST: <i>What I don't understand is</i>

553
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,123
why Savitar wouldn't kill Tracy
when he showed up.

554
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,601
I mean, why would he choose
to rescue Caitlin?

555
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,287
He needs her for something.
We've got to figure out what that is.

556
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,125
Agreed. Well, thanks to Cisco,
we now have a sample of her blood

557
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,964
when she was fully mutated
as Killer Frost.

558
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,966
This, it could be the key
to reverse-engineering a cure,

559
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,248
- so it's good work, mate.
- You, too.

560
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,251
There you are.
I brought us some coffee treats.

561
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,449
Unfortunately, we're all out of cayenne.
Careful, that's hot.

562
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,723
Yeah. Hot cup. Sorry. How are you...

563
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,964
- Careful.
- How are you holding up? Oh, it's hot!

564
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,322
- Well, I'm processing.
- Mmm.

565
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,641
That was really...

566
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,485
I mean, the voice and the...

567
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,168
Killer Frost. Savitar.

568
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,767
You know some people
with really scary names.

569
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,490
Yeah, but is it too much?

570
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,242
All of us here would understand,
and personally, I just...

571
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,810
I just wanna make sure that, you know,
you don't get hurt.

572
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,164
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking that we should...

573
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,607
- I was thinking, too. About Savitar.
- Mmm-hmm.

574
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,643
The way the light reflects off his suit,

575
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,605
it's unlike any other metallic compound
I have ever seen.

576
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,922
Hmm. You and I were thinking
about different things.

577
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,088
- What do you think it is?
- In Fermi-liquid theory,

578
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,688
any sort of non-Fermi liquid
is called "strange metal."

579
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,810
It's a theoretical compound capable
of dispersing heat at high temperatures.

580
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,771
I think Savitar travels so fast

581
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,442
that he needs that suit to neutralize
the charge he builds up around him.

582
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,847
Ha! Interesting. So without the suit,

583
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,324
he's just a dude
with a bad case of static cling.

584
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,889
Yeah. So if we could build a device
capable of harnessing that power,

585
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,011
theoretically, we could use
his own velocity against him.

586
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,521
And trap him in the Speed Force.

587
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,730
Tracy, you are indeed a genius.

588
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,281
- I'm getting there.
- Well, yes, you are.

589
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,887
That means you're gonna stay and help us.
Is that what that means?

590
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,043
If I do, does that mean
the future's changing?

591
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,643
I think it means mine certainly has.

592
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,645
- Hey.
- Hey.

593
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,528
Thanks for seeing me. Come on in.

594
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,006
So how are you doing?

595
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,770
Joe, I'm fine. I just...

596
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,047
You know, I wish that you would've told me
what was going on with you.

597
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,609
Although I obviously have some idea now.

598
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,444
Yeah, it was my fault
that you got caught up in all of this.

599
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,764
I'm so sorry, Cecile.

600
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,608
Joe, me, too. Look, I...

601
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,926
When you told me
that you loved me this morning,

602
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,243
- I froze.
- Yeah.

603
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,248
I knew that it meant that
we moved up a level in our relationship,

604
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,807
and, for me, that level
comes with a lot of baggage.

605
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,402
Like Killer Frost and the Flash.

606
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,726
Yeah.

607
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,810
So you thought that pushing me away
was the thing to do?

608
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,811
I thought that I was protecting you.

609
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,965
Clearly, I was wrong
because not only did I lie to you,

610
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,961
I lied to myself.

611
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,085
<i>And you know what?</i>

612
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,801
I'm done with that.

613
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,451
And I'm done with this.

614
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,163
Thank you for not making a big deal
about me wearing this.

615
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,289
Cecile Horton...

616
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,810
I love you.

617
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,650
I love you with all my heart.

618
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,647
And I'm sorry
that I was dishonest with you,

619
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,851
and from now on,
there will be no secrets between us.

620
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,562
CECILE: Mmm.

621
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,001
- Okay?
- Mmm.

622
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,891
I should have told you a long time ago.

623
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,251
It's not bad.

624
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,686
- Wally!
- Hey, Dad.

625
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,161
Hey.

626
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,447
How was it?

627
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,603
It was... Yeah, it was great.
Jesse says hi.

628
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,841
So you talked to Cecile?

629
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,566
I did. Told her everything.

630
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,047
Told her I love her.

631
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,088
I told her that you were the Flash,
and that Wally was Kid Flash.

632
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,444
Don't worry, she promised me
that she wouldn't tell Joanie.

633
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,048
- What changed your mind?
- You. All of you.

634
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,686
Love's the only thing
we've got in this world.

635
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,891
- Without it, nothing really matters.
- Hmm.

636
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,603
And who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?

637
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,971
<i>How was Earth-3?</i>

638
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,208
Yeah, um... Hanging outwith Jesse
was awesome. She's...

639
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,771
JOE: <i>Love's the only thing
we've got in this world.</i>

640
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,440
<i>Without it, nothing really matters.</i>

641
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,281
<i>And who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?</i>

642
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,086
SAVITAR: <i>You did this to me, Barry.</i>

643
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,321
BARRY: <i>I created you?</i>

644
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,482
I created myself.

645
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,404
BARRY: You're even gonna create time
remnants of yourself,

646
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,726
<i>but he's gonna kill them all.</i>

647
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,127
FROST:
<i>Savitar told me everything you'd say.</i>

648
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,601
You two are more alike than you realize.

649
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,770
<i>Savitar knows
every move you're going to make.</i>

650
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,246
<i>He's always one step ahead of you.</i>

651
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,441
<i>This is all history.</i>

652
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,769
CISCO: <i>This wasn't
just brushing up on days to come.</i>

653
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,007
<i>This was precise.</i>

654
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,241
Like Savitar was there.

655
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,329
JOE: <i>Who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?</i>

656
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,130
FROST: <i>One step ahead of you. All history.</i>

657
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,964
I am the future, Flash.

658
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,287
<i>FROST: One step ahead of you.</i>

659
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,807
IRIS WEST: <i>Barry? Barry?</i>

660
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,641
Are you okay?

661
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,641
Yeah.

662
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,131
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,489
I'll be... I'll be right back, all right?

664
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,850
I'm here.

665
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,685
I'm here!

666
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,162
I know who you are.

667
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,362
It's about time.

668
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,525
Yes, it is.

669
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,966
Everything with you
is about time, isn't it?

670
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,523
The past, the present, the future.

671
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,529
<i>You know all of it, right?</i>

672
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,968
And you know everything about me!

673
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,050
About Joe, about Wally, and Iris!

674
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,641
You know our strengths.
You know our fears.

675
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,648
You know how much we love each other.

676
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,002
And you know
how to use that love against us.

677
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,881
<i>All this time,</i>

678
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,683
we thought that we couldn't stop you
because you were one step ahead,

679
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,166
but that's not it.

680
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,883
<i>You don't just know
what's gonna happen to us.</i>

681
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,211
You were there.

682
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,091
You lived it. You remember.

683
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,404
When you were me.

684
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,241
Like I told you from the beginning,

685
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,244
I am the Future Flash.
