00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,650
Yeah, and who said
you're staying the night?

162
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,131
ARTHUR: I know what we can do.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,570
We get the guns out, John.

164
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,562
We go outside,
and we shoot some fucking pheasants.

(BOTH LAUGH)

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,609
- That's what the bosses do, isn't it?
- Yeah.

167
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,886
Fuck off, Arthur.

168
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,965
Fuck you just say to me?

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,401
I didn't ask for separate meetings
today, all right?

170
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,124
No. No, what the fuck did you just say?

171
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,960
'Cause I didn't fucking hear you right.

172
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,042
I didn't ask for separate meetings
today, all right?

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,561
Fucking pheasant.

- Carl!

175
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,530
You can't say things like that.

176
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,762
Now look what you've done.

177
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,605
All right, brothers.

178
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,404
It's just the fucking whisky talking.

179
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,403
I don't ask to be protected, all right?

180
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,041
POLLY: Right. Shut up.
The pair of you, sit down!

181
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,371
Sit down!

182
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,529
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Look around you.

183
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,091
And look at this house.

184
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,970
Look where we are.

185
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,327
Look how far we've come.

186
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,482
I think it's about time
we all started acting

187
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,767
in a way more appropriate
to our station.

188
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,248
We're none of us bin men any more,
Arthur.

189
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,530
Tommy needs us all together.

190
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,129
I'd like to propose a toast.

Tommy's gone. Swear to God,
he's in a wagon with johnny Dogs.

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,761
Shit.

196
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,685
This is what he does now.

Walk on. Walk on.

JOHNNY: Tommy.
TOMMY: Walk on.

203
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,764
They're coming out in the drive.

204
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,249
- You're not gonna tell them?
- Tell them what?

205
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,451
That we're going to Wales.

206
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,041
I left a note.

207
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,846
Did you tell them
why we're going to Wales?

208
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,967
No.

209
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,168
At some point you're gonna tell me
why we're going to Wales?

210
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,651
Yeah, when we get there.

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,487
TOMMY: Walk on.

212
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,369
Should have brought
at least one woman, Tommy.

213
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,522
Johnny, it's a woman we're going to see.

214
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,931
- There, boy. Walk on. Walk on.
- Right.

215
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,686
Says he'll be back in Birmingham
in three days.

POLLY: (SIGHS) Let him go.

The important thing is,
if he says he'll be back, he'll be back.

Come on.
Let's go light a fire in the big room.

So we'll go out through Meridian,

Now, remember last night
when you asked after Mama?

She's gone, Charlie, and there's
a few things we need to get straight.

There's her photographs.

There's her clothes.

in the room. (CLEARS THROAT)

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,448
Yeah. Here you go.

236

I'm not much good, Charlie.

- (CHARLIE EXCLAIMS)
- You'll find that out soon enough.

She's not gonna be coming back,
so it's just you and me.

She'll be with us in our hearts

- Yeah.

This fucking horse of yours
won't come to me.

242
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,083
- All right, I'll be there. All right.
- Huh? Come on.

243
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,929
That was her favourite horse, Charlie,

244

and he's been all over the place
since she's gone.

- Tom?
- Yeah, you watch him.

I will. Oh, yeah.

Huh?

248
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,483

You boys are fucking crazy men.

- Yeah, but you feel it, though, right?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,326
You feel it.

259
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,767
Yeah, you can feel the power.

on his arse all day wanna fire a gun?

Hmm? Eh?

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,090
Cock it again.

- Cock it again.

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,084
Look at that face.

272
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,890
Now he feels it.

273
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,847
But you won't feel nothing

until you point that thing on a man.

275
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,644
So do it.

276
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,451
There you go, young boss.

277
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,724
There you go. Now you feel it.

278
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,041
Now you feel what we feel.

279
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,526
This is what it's like.

280
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,047
Michael, that's a Webley.

Jumps on the hammer.

282
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,603
How does it feel, Michael, huh?

283
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,241
Better than having a pen
in your hand, isn't it?

284
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,165
More like having your cock in your hand.
Yeah.

285
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,046
Yeah, it is.

286
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,529
One squeeze.

I'm fucking meat.

Michael, you fucking watch
that Webley don't jump. You know that?

291
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,281
When you pull that fucking trigger,

292
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,969
and the body of the man you shot
wraps itself around your ankles,

293
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,644
- they pile up.

a load of them with you.

Polly, we're just
educating the boss here

299

one our side of the business.

300
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,201
Michael, get in the house.

301
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,370
I'm not a fucking kid any more.

You've come to tell me it's cancelled.

305
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,725
No, why would it be?

306
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,881
I read the papers.

307
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,406
- This is business.
- It won't work.

308
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,488
I told your brother,
this whole fucking plan won't work.

309

If Tommy wants to keep this secret...
Tell him.

310
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,089
There was a woman in a fur coat
walking through here in broad daylight

311
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,289
like the Queen of fucking Sheba
asking about armoured cars.

312
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,046
During a period of grieving,
some things were allowed to slip.

313
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,450
We know the woman.
We're dealing with it.

314
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,448
Now, take a look at this list.

315
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,329
These are all the men
who work the night shift

316
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,125
who are members
of the South Birmingham Communist Party.

317
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,761
You've got six weeks. Sack them all.

318
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,010
Are you fucking mad?

319
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,041
He is.

320
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,001
Yeah.

321
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,163
Every factory in the city
will come out on strike.

322
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,528
So? You find reasons.

323
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,485
You set them up.

324
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,006
You sack them.

325
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,241
Look at the list again.

326
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,406
Are there any communists on your shift
who aren't on the list?

327
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,566
No.

328
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,682
Please don't fucking lie to us.

329
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,967
- Who's missing?
- I don't know.

330
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,686
Emmanuel Hunter.

331
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,961
Hmm?

332
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,051
Convener, deputy treasurer,
Sparkhill Communist Party.

333
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,563
Lathe operator to you.

334
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,771
I didn't know he was a communist.

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,006
We left that name
off the list on purpose.

336
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,362
See if you could be trusted.

337
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,445
You can't be trusted.

338
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,648
Look, I'm just a working man.

339
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,290
JOHN: We're gonna be watching you.

340
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,291
- Watching your fucking house.
- I've got kids.

341
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,286
Ethan and John.

342
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,290
Just get them sacked

343
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,571
as they appear on the list, two a week.

344
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,451
The last one before
the clocks go forward.

345
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,090
Is that a yes or a no?

346
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,565
- Yes.
- Thank you.

347
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,571
- (METAL CLANKING)
- (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

348
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,686
Good.

349
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,561
Good.

350
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,687
- Do you think he'll return?
- Tommy?

351
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,771
He'll always come back.

352
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,881
You speak differently when you talk...

353
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,724
I prefer to talk about other things.

354
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
Let me see.

355
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,170
What books do you like?

356
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,290
Riding, flower arranging, embroidery?

357
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,362
You'd be surprised of the things I know.

358
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,081
You'd also be surprised
of the things I don't know.

359
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,282
What could you possibly not know?

360
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,885
I wasn't educated.

361
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,241
- At all.
- What is there to learn, after all?

362
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,081
Goodness.

363
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,607
I'm sorry. You must need a rest.

364
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,201
Do you tell your friends
you're painting a gangster?

365
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,130
Is that the fun in all of this?

366
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,610
In truth, I don't have any friends.

367
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,089
I knew everyone through my wife.

368
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,926
When she died...

369
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,841
Well...

370
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
Look, Polly,

371
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,321
my motivation for doing this is twofold.

372
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,047
Firstly, you have a face
full of contradictions,

373
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,806
and it's a challenge
to capture them in one expression.

374
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,009
- (SCOFFS)
- That's the sales pitch.

375
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,729
The second motivation is that
I am planning to seduce you eventually

376
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,208
and, please God, sleep with you.

377
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,244
How would that please God?

378
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,291
Please me.

379
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,081
And stop.

380
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,930
And he didn't say what he wants.

381
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,809
When he was drunk, he said absolution.

382
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,805
Other than that, nothing.

383
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,362
Thank you for your time, Madame Boswell.

384
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,929
I heard someone shot your wife.

385
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,606
If you're looking for soldiers,
our men are all up at Appleby.

386
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,564
I have no need for soldiers.

387
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,085
It's not why I came here.

388
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,481
What do you think?

389
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,040
You're selling?

390
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,281
Giving.

391
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,650
- Why?
- Would you take it?

392
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,766
I'd take it.

393
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,686
Would you wear it?

394
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,762
- Why would I not?
- That's my question.

395
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,807
My wife was wearing it
the night she was shot,

396
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,330
and I lie awake at night
at 4:00 in the fucking morning,

397
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,801
and I blame myself for her death.

398
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,404
I pushed some people too far.

399
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,766
You want me to tell you
this jewel is cursed,

400
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,607
and then her death won't be
all your fault.

401
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,522
If I believed in the priests,

402
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,521
I would confess and ask for forgiveness,

403
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,764
but all I have is you, Madame Boswell.

404
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,770
I have a son.

405
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,684
I have a business.

406
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,810
I need to get some sleep.

407
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,965
It is cursed.

408
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,448
I feel its curse
burning through my heart.

409
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,283
Bless you, Tommy Shelby.

410
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,408
You'll have good fortune from now on.

411
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,926
- The business is done?
- It's done.

412
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,725
You're not going to give me
one fucking clue what that was about?

413
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,842
All religion is a foolish answer
to a foolish question.

414
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,440
What does that mean?

415
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,931
Go and get Charlie from the camp.

416
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,002
He'll have learned enough
bad habits by now.

417
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,923
You can drop us to the train station.

418
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,402
And johnny boy, if I were you,

419
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,883
I'd come back here tonight later on.

420
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,681
It's gonna be
one hell of a big fucking party.

421
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,364
MAN: The day and date on your ticket.

422
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,927
If you can't read, find someone who can.

423
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,446
Tickets for sailings other than today's
will be destroyed.

424
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,289
He has people all over the docks.

425
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,408
If it's going to happen,
it will happen now.

426
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,005
We'll be all right.

427
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,289
Why don't these Irish
fill in their papers in advance?

428
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,331
Think about Mott Street, the café,
the smell of the coffee.

429

Police! Help! Police!

431
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,209
Officer, there are some men,
they mean us harm.

432
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,682
We are in danger here.
Can you escort us to the dock?

433
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,687
Please.

434
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,001
Come with me.

435
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,211
Excuse me, brother. You got a light?

436
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,207
Thank you, Officer.

437
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,283
- That'll be all.
- John Shelby.

438
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,771
Is that the lad I used to teach?
John Shelby, I smacked your arse.

439
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,486
Let him go.

440
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,331
- Please. Please, let her go.
- Arthur?

441
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,890
How many times I looked the other way
because of your sweet smile.

442
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,931
I said, let him go. He's coming with us.

443
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,651
Not until I know my wife is safe.

444
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,604
She's safe. We're not going to harm her.

445
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,401
Let's just get a move on.

446
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,326
Look, we're disobeying Tommy's orders
just by talking to you.

447
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,807
Don't push it, please.

448
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,528
- Come with us. Let him go.
- AUDREY: Let him go, too.

449
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,285
Say it's done.

450
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,123
Say he's in the harbour.
He can do you no harm from New York.

451
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,330
I can't do that, Mrs Changretta.
I can't do that. Sorry.

452
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,368
OK, OK. Audrey, listen.

453
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,010
- No!
- Listen to me!

454
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,691
Go to the café in Mott Street.
Bonito will take care of you.

455
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,327
Let him go, too. He's an old man.

456
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,529
I gave you sweets and cakes.

457
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,170
Mrs Changretta, there are rules.

458
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,684
Your husband knows the rules.

459
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,291
- Come on, old man.
- AUDREY: No.

460
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,720
Sorry.

461
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,528
We're disobeying orders here.

462
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,329
Let him fucking go!

463
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,485
You have 10 seconds,
or Tommy's orders stand.

464
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,608
They stand. One!

465
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,848
- Two!
- Please!

466
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,011
Three.

- I love you forever.
- Four.

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,924
I'll tell you.

481
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,647
It's a beautiful sound,

482
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,322
which my wife will never hear again.

483
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,448
Now, I'm gonna have to choose carefully

484
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,242
which part of you I cut away first.

485
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,851
Open your eyes.

486
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,562
Open your eyes,
or I will cut away your fucking eyelids!

487
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,089
Now look at me.

488
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,884
Look at me.

489
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,330
This is the end.

490
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,885
This is the end.

491
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,167
It was your tongue that gave the order.

492
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,041
I'll take your tongue first.

493
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,524
Then I'll take your ears.

494
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,287
Then I'll take your fingers.

495
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,483
Then your fucking toes.

496
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,283
See, I take your balls first,
you drain too fast like you fuckers do.

497
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,290
No, I think tongue first. Tongue first.

498
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,250
(MUFFLED GROANING)

499
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,921
Tongue first.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

501
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,411
If I take your tongue,
you won't be able to explain,

502
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,963
and I want you to explain.
I want you to fucking explain.

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,841
Come on, Tommy.

506
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,722
I forget who I am.

507
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,130
I forget who I am.

00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,050
I'm a Blinder.
I'll take your fucking eyes first!

(GUNSHOT)

510
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,762
I heard the blackbird sing.

511
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,363
And we let his wife
board the immigrant ship to New York.

512
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,527
We didn't kill Mrs Changretta.

513
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,406
And tonight...

514

(SIGHS)

522
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,521
Did you do what was on your list, Ada?

523
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,602
You and your fucking lists.

524
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,691
Did you?

525
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,686
I spoke to an old friend of Freddie's.

526
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,445
He's a Communist Party candidate
for Basall Heath.

527
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,360
I asked him about the Birmingham branch
of the National Vigilance Committee.

528
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,851
He said he'd heard the Soviet Embassy
was getting information from the inside.

529
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,767
And? Has he got a name?

530
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,566
Yes.

531
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,888
But just promise me
no one will get killed.

532
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,568
Ada, it'll be me or John or Arthur
who gets killed

533
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,210
if you don't give me the fucking name.

534
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,250
There's someone ahead of us,
and I need to know why.

535
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,930
James Monkland.

536
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,009
He's a Lloyds underwriter.
He's got an office on Curzon Street.

537
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,327
Tommy, for fuck's sake,
who is it that's ahead of you?

538
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,881
I knew I could count on you, Ada.

539
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,243
No, you can't,
and I just asked you a fucking question.

540
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,209
And I notice
you started wearing lipstick again.

541

(SCOFFS)

542
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,045
So what?

543
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,126
I got bored.

544
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,250
You can change what you do,
but you can't change what you want.

545
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,326
And what is it that I want?

546
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,443
There's gonna be a vacancy coming up
at Shelby Company Limited.

547
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,444
Boston office.

548

Boston, America?

549
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,089
Lipstick. Clothes from Paris.

550
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,249
No revolvers. All legal.

551
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,409
Just turn a few heads.
Do the transit deals.

552
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,884
James Monkland, right?

553
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,368
Good night, Ada.

554
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,451
- James Monkland?
- Yours, sir.

What do you want with me?

557
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,242
You've been passing information
about a robbery

558
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,322
at the Lanchester factory in Sparkbrook.

559
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,686
Are you Tommy Shelby?

560
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,730
I need to know the name of the person
in the organisation

561
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,201
that was giving you information.

562
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,201
What organisation?

563
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,922
The Economic League,
the Vigilance Committee,

564
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,764
the Odd Fellows, Section D.

565
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,204
They have many fucking names.

566
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,520
Shit, shit, shit.

567
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,402
Give me the name of the informant.

568
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,570
Mr Shelby,

569
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,202
they are very, very dangerous people.

570
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,248
Oh. Hmm.

571
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,527
Well, fortunately, so are we.

572

You have to choose
who you're more afraid of.

573
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,371
The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11:43,

574
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,480
or Section D at some point
in the future.

575
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,885
If you make the wrong choice,
you won't see 11:44.

576
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,004
LINDA: Do they always have to do
the stock taking at night, Arthur?

577
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,368
ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know,
it slows down production.

578
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,566
Thank you.

579

It will. It will.

582
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,321
You'll have things to do at night.

583
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
Yeah.

584
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,684
I know.

585
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,842
We've spoken about it.

586
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,730
I was gonna wait until you had
a strong cup of tea in your hand.

587
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,122
- Come on, then.
- But I'm gonna have a baby, Arthur.

588
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,561
Pregnant?

589
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,045
Yeah.

590
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,726
You said you spent the night
taking stock. Well, so did I.

591
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,605
This working at night will have to stop.

Come on. Let's have that tea.

Arthur, for fuck's sake, what is it?

602
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,609
No. We wait for Tommy.

Tell us. Tell Tommy later.

He's not here. I'm going.

- Yes.

644
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,130
- They say you're an expert on cars.
- Yes, I am.

645
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,488
I am curious.
What was your father's profession?

646
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,763
Well, he told fortunes,
and he stole horses.

647
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,083
Often, he would tell a man
that his horse would be stolen,

648
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,686
and they would marvel at his powers
when it was.

649
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,566
Before we eat, should we say grace?

650
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,605
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

651
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,849
- Amen.
- I'm not here to eat.

652
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,171
I'm here to do business.

653
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,251
What I have to say can be said
before the main course.

654
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,004
Then I will leave you all
to your evening.

655
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,884
Grand Duchess, I must apologise
for the bad manners of my compatriot.

656
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,203
This is a report on the mission's
progress so far. (CLEARS THROAT)

657
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,681
I've made only one copy for security.

658
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,446
Who should I give it to?

659
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,126
My husband
is in charge of this operation.

660
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,485
But since there will no doubt
be vodka later,

661
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,086
perhaps you should give it to me
for safe-keeping.

662
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,011
Speak, Mr Shelby, while we eat.

663
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,802
Five factory foremen on our payroll
have begun a campaign of victimisation

664
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,531
against communist workers
in five factories across Birmingham.

665
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,050
Anger amongst the workers will grow,
but we will control it.

666
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,043
On the night of June 21st,

667
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,811
a general strike will be called
across the city.

668
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,762
Protests will develop into riots,

669
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,322
and all police that are not
already under our control will be busy.

670
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,050
The city will be paralysed.

671
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,369
So how will you move the train?

672
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,363
We have two locomotive drivers

673
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,410
who've been allocated to drive
the midnight goods train to London.

674
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,767
The armoured vehicles will be waiting
on flatbeds.

675
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,729
- And ammunition?
- The ammunition...

676
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,883
I have to say
that this soup is exceptional.

677
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,930
Absolutely delicious.

678
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,680
Ammunition, incendiaries will already
have been packed up and crated

679
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,285
for transport to Istanbul.

680
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,489
- And how long to London?
- The train won't reach London.

681
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,641
All the goods will be unloaded
at a coal yard at St Albans

682
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,884
and put onto Shelby Company trucks.

683
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,849
From there, they will go directly
to the Poplar Docks.

684
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,367
You Highness, if you're having
difficulty understanding his accent,

685
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,808
then I can go through the plan with you
at a later date.

686
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,843
If there is no ship waiting for my men,

687
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,686
all goods will be dumped into the sea
before first light.

688
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,127
What happens when they discover
the armoured cars are missing?

689
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,364
During the rioting, the
Lanchester factory will be firebombed.

690
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,966
A scrap metal dealer of my acquaintance
will declare

691
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,202
that all the armoured vehicles
are in the wreckage

692
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,044
and should be written off as salvage.

693
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,327
No one will know
that they are in your possession.

694
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,048
We formulated this plan
when we met at Birmingham.

695
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,647
I'm certain that
nothing has been overlooked.

696
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,886
This is the amount of extra expense
I believe I will incur

697
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,724
for trucks and fuels.

698
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,443
I trust you will respond in kind.

699
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,964
But of course, Mr Shelby.

700
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,971
Before I go,

701
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,609
I would like it known
that I'm unable to swallow food

702
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,049
in the same room as this priest.

703
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,765
Enjoy your evening.

704
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,043
Tatiana, see Mr Shelby to his car.

705
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,531
Yes.

706
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,445
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

707
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,646
Walk with me.

708
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,441
The priest is passing information
about the robbery

709
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,204
to a Lloyds underwriter called Monkland.

710
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,887
He, in turn, is passing information
to the Soviet Embassy.

711
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,921
You want him dead?
I'll kill him, no charge.

712
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,761
Why would the priest
pass information to our enemies?

713
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,483
I'm being paid to act and to observe,
like a soldier.

714
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,531
The complexities are your business.

715
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,326
Go and speak to Izabella.
I trust her to decide.

716
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,367
You were able to contain your business
dealings even after what happened.

717
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,651
Perhaps you didn't love her.

718
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,411
She's here by my side,

719
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,924
and she says,
"Don't trust these people."

720
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,241
Now give me permission
to kill the priest.

721
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,500
