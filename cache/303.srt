1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,180
What are the characteristics of a gay guy?

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,260
We'll have a pre-drink on Friday.
We were wondering if you guys want to come.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,620
I don't really know.
I think...

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,300
Isak has brain damage, you know?
We're coming.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,680
Text me when we're supposed to be there.
-Yeah, I'll figure it out.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,440
Hello.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,120
And this here is Sonja, my girlfriend.
-Sonja.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,040
Isak.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,760
<i>[Why are you lying?
Talked to Emma and her friends.]</i>

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>[Hi. I just want to say that we talked to your friends and know 
that you didn't have other plans. If you're not interested, that's 
great, but you don't have to give me false hope by saying you're coming 
to the pre-drink when you aren't, that's really asshole-ish.]</i>

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,020
<i>[Hello?! Is it so hard to answer!?!!]</i>

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,520
<i>[Sorry that I called you an asshole. 
It's possible you have a good reason, but can you answer?]</i>

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,060
<i>[ASSHOLE!]</i>

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,940
Hello.

15
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,720
Hello, traitor.
-Hey man.

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,460
Traitor?! Fuck.
-That was dumb of you.

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,340
You just betrayed us.
What's up with that?

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,440
Yeah, sorry man.
Yeah...

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,520
It was just really stressful.
-Stressful? What do you mean, stressful?

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,320
I'll arrange a new pre-drink, okay?
-Yeah, but what kind of stress?

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,400
There was just something with my mom.
-Your mom? What's up with her?

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,560
She's stressed out.
-She's stressed out?!

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,620
My mom has been stressed ever since
I arrived on this earth, and you're talking about stress?

24
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,320
Huh?

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,440
How's it going with her?

26
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,100
She's fine.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,900
Just arrange a new pre-drink. 
Case closed.

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,960
Case closed.

29
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,280
Closed.

30
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,400
<i>[Mamma: Corinthians,6:11]</i>

31
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,600
Hi!
-Can you hold this?

32
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,940
I will be sending out invites…
I wanted to ask you if we can have the pre-drink a bit earlier?

33
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,600
No. I won't be having a pre-drink.

34
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,000
Why not?

35
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,920
I can't because I live with other people and 
they don't want to have a pre-drink.

36
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,380
But I talked to Eskild and he said it was completely fine.

37
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Of course he said that. But I talked to Linn, 
and Linn does not want to have a pre-drink at ours.

38
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,040
Honestly though Isak, what <i>does</i> Linn want?

39
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,000
Linn doesn't want anything. 
Linn is deeply depressed. 

40
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,740
You should take responsibility
and make her socialise a little.

41
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,540
Take responsibility!

42
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,540
You're hosting that party, Friday at 6.

43
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,940
Hi!

44
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,880
I was wondering...

45
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,120
I need advice, so to speak.

46
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,760
Because there's this really sweet girl in the first year

47
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,960
and I managed to make her quite angry.

48
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,940
She has a good reason to be, 
because I fucked up a promise.

49
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,240
That wasn't nice.

50
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:06,920
That's why I was wondering,
do you think I should go and shoot myself?

51
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,720
Or perhaps she'll forgive me?

52
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,800
It'd be cool if she does it in 20 years. 
As long as she does it sometime. 

53
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,720
Jerk.
-I'm a jerk?

54
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,380
You think I'm a jerk?

55
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,940
Fuck, then there are two girls who think I'm a jerk. 
She's sweet, and then you.

56
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,420
Oy, did you just try to kill me with that look? 
Was that what you were trying?

57
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,960
Am I really such a jerk?
You think?

58
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,160
Good job!

59
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,360
We want six dancers for the theatre.

60
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,140
You'll get an answer within the week. 
Thanks!

61
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Show's over, guys.

62
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,440
Really good. So good! Wow.

63
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,940
Did he need to be so gay?
-Huh?

64
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,480
You didn't notice?
-He was ultra gay.

65
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,500
What's up with you dissing people who are gay?

66
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,000
I didn't diss him. 
But you could see it.

67
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,420
Yeah, but you're just pointing 
out that he's gay or what?

68
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,740
Really great observation, Isak. 

69
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,280
What's up with you? You're being so pissy.
-With me? Huh?!

70
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,820
Me?
-Yeah.

71
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,580
You're the one who's fucking grouchy about everything!
-Grouchy?

72
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,420
Ever since we walked into 
the classroom, you were...

73
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
What the fuck are you talking about?
-Hello.

74
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,500
You forgot this Friday.

75
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,260
Is it yours?

76
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,520
I think it's mine.

77
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,520
Forgot where?

78
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,760
In the cafeteria. 

79
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,380
Who's that dude?
He's just some theatre nerd from Vilde's group.

80
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,700
Oh fuck! My dream yesterday. Fuck!

81
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:42,000
Vilde was in it. She was some dominatrix, SM chick
who punished me with sex because I hooked up with a first year.

82
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,100
Sickest dream I've ever had! So wild.

83
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,680
Dominatrix? What are you talking about?
-Dominatrix… I don't know what to call it.

84
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,760
What did she do?
-She was the boss. I didn't do anything.

85
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,000
Black clothes?
-Yeah!

86
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,060
Whip and everything.

87
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,280
So sick.

88
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,140
You have a weird imagination.

89
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,340
What kind of music do you like?

90
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,920
That's difficult.

91
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,520
My favorite music is Justin Bieber!

92
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,180
Oh my god.
-Was that bad? Oh no!

93
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,940
I'm getting a headache.
-You get a migraine from Justin Bieber?

94
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,580
A chronic Justin Bieber migraine.

95
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,520
I can't leave. I live here.
Could you leave?

96
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,160
You're throwing me out because I like him?
What kind of music do you like?

97
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,580
I'm more into 90's hip hop.
Do you know anything about it?

98
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,380
Eh, no.
-You don't know anything about it?

99
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,000
I do... 
-Nas?

100
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,920
Nas? Have you heard of him?
-Huh?!

101
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,340
He made the best album of all time.
Illmatic. Have you heard of it?

102
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,500
Ill?
-Illmatic!

103
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,460
Ill as in sick. And Matic.

104
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,580
Hi! So nice to see you. Hi.

105
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,120
Vilde. Nice to meet you.
Sonja.

106
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,280
I don't know if you know this but...

107
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,420
Do you feel this strap here?

108
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,600
You feel it?
-Yeah.

109
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,480
It sticks out just under my arm.

110
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,540
It will be like that until I get home.

111
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,840
You should be happy you're not a girl.

112
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,220
It's really annoying to be a girl.

113
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,740
Especially when-

114
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm starting to think you're bonding too much.
-Finally! Hello!

115
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,360
<i>Kose</i> group!
-Cool apartment.

116
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,520
Thanks.
-It's so cool here. Sick.

117
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,820
It's a shared apartment. There's always
cool people here. Like Eskild!

118
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,460
Have you met Eskild?
-No, I don't think so.

119
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,120
He's gay. He's really sweet.

120
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,760
I love gay people. They're sweet.

121
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,660
You don't think that's a bit of
a superficial generalization?

122
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,820
How so? By saying gay 
people are funny?

123
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,800
That's like saying all muslims are terrorists.
-What?!

124
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,140
No, that's too much.
It's not like that.

125
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,180
To be funny is really positive.

126
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,520
To be a terrorist is really negative.

127
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,520
That's not what I'm saying, but you are 
generalizing. Not all gays are funny.

128
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,160
This is really boring.
Isak, come dance with me

129
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,980
People! We have ordered 4 taxis.
And we have to go now!

130
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,380
Who took my phone?
Who used my phone to play music?

131
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,540
Does everyone have their tickets?
The tickets are really important.

132
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,960
Can someone call me?
Please. I can't find my phone.

133
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,840
Isak! Me, Sonja, and Even 
are taking a taxi together.

134
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,120
Do you want to come with us?
-No, I'm cycling.

135
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,820
Yeah, okay. Fine.

136
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,360
Didn't you take a taxi with the others?

137
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,240
I have a bicycle. 

138
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,700
Were you having a good time with Emma?

139
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,920
She's something.

140
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,540
Do you know me and Sonja have been
dating since she was 15 or something?

141
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,840
Okay.

142
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm noticing that we're growing
apart more and more.

143
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,960
But I can't dump Sonja.

144
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,940
Okay.

145
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,360
If I dump Sonja, she'll think
it's because she has an aluminum leg.

146
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Huh?
-You didn't know?

147
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,280
Aluminum leg?
-Yeah, her entire foot was amputated.

148
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,780
What? How did that happen?

149
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,180
She stepped on a land mine in Tjøme
when she was nine years old.

150
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,940
Shit.

151
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,420
It was quite bad.
-I didn't know.

152
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,680
But it's going better with her now.

153
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,900
She's gotten really good help from...

154
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,740
What's it called? A physiotherapist. 
They've helped with her motor skills.

155
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,900
You know aluminum technology has come a long way.
You can hardly see that she limps.

156
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,960
You're joking?

157
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,480
You're joking? Yeah?
Fuck!

158
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,440
How can you joke about that?

159
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,340
You think there are land mines in Tjøme?

160
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,080
I don't fucking know!
You can't joke about something like that!

161
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,820
I could've joked about 
something way worse!

162
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,200
No! That's a very serious
thing to be kidding about.

163
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,380
I could've joked about a dick.
That would've gone too far.

164
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,420
Dick...

165
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,760
Too far.

166
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,540
