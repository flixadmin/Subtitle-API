1
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,427
How big's the batch?

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,846
Should be about 50 pounds, give or take.

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,764
Uncle Jack, that mask

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,933
I think you should...

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,727
Mr. White said the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,844
Let me worry about what I breathe, kid.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,816
Just hurry this up so I can grab a smoke.

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,273
Seventy-six percent.

9
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,942
- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

10
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,402
Where's the blue?

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,197
- Where's the what?
- The blue color.

12
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,908
Does it come later, when this hardens?

13
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,117
Where is it?

14
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:20,831
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

15
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,898
See, I'm thinking the headline here
should be "76 percent."

16
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,002
Yeah. Whole lot more than it was.

17
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,964
That dude who looked like Wolverine?
He couldn't crack 70.

18
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:33,385
Fine. Yes, percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

19
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,054
And congratulations, Todd.

20
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,765
But blue is our brand, all over Europe.

21
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,142
It's what our buyers pay top dollar for.

22
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,103
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days

23
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,857
maybe they'll let us slide on that,
but not if it's not blue.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,570
I don't know. To my eye

25
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,406
- it's kind of blue.
- Yeah, a little.

26
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,700
It's bluish.

27
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,039
Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

28
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,338
Yeah, kind of.

29
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,339
If it catches the light just right

30
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:16,303
I could see how you'd think
there's a touch of blue

31
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,556
blue-green in there.

32
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,433
- Aquamarine.
- Hell, we'll put food coloring in it.

33
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,117
Make it any damn shade you want.

34
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,479
Yeah, like they do
farm-raised salmon. Yeah.

35
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,691
I mean, Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

36
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,442
Like, flamingo pink.

37
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,280
It sure as hell don't come out
the ocean looking like that.

38
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,119
All right. Let's make some money.

39
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,759
- Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
- Lydia.

40
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,761
Thank you.

41
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,770
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

42
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,358
You sure? If it's too weak or something,
I can go put another bag in it.

43
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,235
I'm sure.

44
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,865
Look, about the product

45
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:20,743
I'm really sorry about the color.

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,709
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

47
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,521
in the mixing kettle, I think.

48
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,751
I might've just
cooked the color right out of it.

49
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,004
You burned it, like a cake.

50
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,133
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,218
But the point is I think I can fix it,

52
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,639
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

53
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:46,810
I mean, I'm doing everything
just like Mr. White taught me, so...

54
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,356
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

55
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,941
I appreciate you making
every possible effort

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,237
because, as you know,
my buyers expect a certain threshold

57
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,656
a continuity.

58
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,075
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

59
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,083
About your buyers

60
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,672
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them...

61
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,134
if you want.

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,723
I'll pass. Thanks.

63
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,519
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

64
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,438
I believe in you.

65
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,108
Please do make the cook better.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,027
It's very important to me.

67
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,535
I've got a flight to catch.

68
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,860
- Hello.
<i>- Hey. It's Walt.</i>

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,570
Hey, Mr. White. How you doing?

70
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,238
<i>I'm okay.</i>

71
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,031
<i>I...</i>

72
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,995
<i>Todd, I think I might have
another job for your uncle.</i>

73
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,914
Oh, okay.
You want me to set up a meeting?

74
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,334
<i>I... Yes. Please. Let's do that.</i>

75
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,880
Any heads-up I should give him, like

76
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,633
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

77
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,220
- Mr. White?
<i>- Just one target.</i>

78
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,598
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>

79
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,142
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

80
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,935
You got it.

81
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,538
{\an8}I'm surprised you didn't strangle him.
So now what? Book him?

82
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:56,332
{\an8}I'm sure the AUSA will have plenty to say
about how to play him against Walt.

83
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,461
{\an8}Knowing what we know about
how Walt deals with rats behind bars?

84
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,463
{\an8}Punk has to be safer with the marshals

85
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,340
{\an8}than out here where it's open season.

86
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,136
{\an8}What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

87
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,680
{\an8}The kid's got an idea.

88
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,140
{\an8}What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

89
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,559
{\an8}The one that screwed up our sting?
I'm all ears.

90
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,229
{\an8}Just hear him out, would you?

91
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,322
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

92
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,325
You guys need evidence to put him away.

93
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,995
Only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

94
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,663
So you say.

95
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,247
Well, I know some evidence

96
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,209
that greedy asshole would never destroy.

97
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,129
His money.

98
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,631
- You know where he keeps his money?
- No.

99
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,551
But I know someone who might.

100
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,058
{\an8}Oh, hey. How'd it go?

101
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,270
{\an8}Trailed him to the Dog House,
picked him up there.

102
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,230
{\an8}Seemed to be looking for someone.

103
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,774
{\an8}- Had a lot of questions.
- No calls though, right?

104
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,527
{\an8}- You got his phone?
- Yeah.

105
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,741
- He's on ice?
- Safe house off Rio Bravo.

106
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,951
We've got Van Oster babysitting him.

107
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,204
Yeah. What about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

108
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,790
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.

109
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,000
Good job.

110
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,252
{\an8}I gotta tell you this up front, Hank.

111
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,569
{\an8}If this guy decides he wants to lawyer up

112
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,258
{\an8}I don't care if you are my boss,
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

113
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,427
{\an8}He won't lawyer up.

114
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,985
What the hell, man?

115
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,925
You're up.

116
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,061
{\an8}Hey there. You mind
taking it outside for a minute?

117
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,356
{\an8}- No, sir. You got it.
- All right, thanks.

118
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,693
{\an8}Huell Babineaux.

119
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,529
{\an8}Know who I am?

120
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,449
{\an8}I'll take that as a yes.

121
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,493
{\an8}Thanks for your patience.

122
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:41,373
{\an8}As Agent Gomez said,
you're not under arrest.

123
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,458
{\an8}Why am I here?

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,795
{\an8}Well, you're here
for your own protection, sir.

125
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,046
How you figure that?

126
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,009
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

127
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,223
{\an8}Nice poker face.

128
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,100
{\an8}Look, relax.

129
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,017
{\an8}There's not much new you can tell me
about Walter White.

130
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,938
{\an8}Multiple murders

131
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,107
{\an8}ties to a white-power prison gang

132
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,985
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

133
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,487
{\an8}I'm not asking, you're not answering

134
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,698
{\an8}whoop-de-do.
Let's cut to the chase.

135
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,867
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

136
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:21,663
{\an8}We intercepted a call between him
and a certain Saul Goodman, Esq.

137
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,416
{\an8}You know, your employer?

138
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,544
{\an8}Anyway, in the call, Walt said
that he was going to, quote:

139
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,213
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

140
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,591
and that you were next on the hit list.
That's why you're here.

141
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,761
Bullshit. That don't make no sense.

142
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,388
{\an8}I got the recording.
I can... I can let you hear it.

143
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,972
{\an8}Your associate, Goodman's fixer...
What's his name?

144
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,226
Some carrottop named Patrick Kuby.

145
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,979
Boston P.D. ran him out of Beantown
a few years back.

146
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,605
{\an8}Came out here for the sunshine.

147
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,817
{\an8}Walt said he was gonna do this Kuby guy
the same way he does you.

148
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,944
In fact, Kuby's already missing.

149
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,823
Sorry to say, things are looking grim
for your... Your redheaded buddy.

150
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,202
{\an8}Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

151
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,788
{\an8}Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

152
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,831
He sold you down the river bigtime.

153
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,583
{\an8}- The hell you talking about?
- Don't take it personally.

154
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,837
{\an8}Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

155
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,674
{\an8}To be fair, your circus clown of a boss
did try to spare you for all of, what

156
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,551
{\an8}about 15 seconds

157
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,095
before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

158
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,932
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

159
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,725
and as soon as you call him

160
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,810
Walt will find out where you're hiding.

161
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,147
Then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

162
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,028
Oh, man. Oh, man. I swear to God,
I didn't know he was gonna kill him, man.

163
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,073
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
- Relax.

164
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,431
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup,

165
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,578
for conspiracy to commit murder
instead of under our protection.

166
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,998
Tell us everything you know
so we can get him before he gets you.

167
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,000
Why would he wanna kill me?

168
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,419
- I ain't do nothing.
- Who knows with this guy?

169
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,463
From what he said, it may have to do

170
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,843
with him tying up loose ends regarding
poisoning some kid named Brock.

171
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,097
Or maybe it's because
you know where his money is.

172
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,072
I don't know where his money is.

173
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,517
That ain't what we heard.

174
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,934
You ain't listening
to the people in the know.

175
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,980
Me and Kuby rented a van for the dude

176
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,858
loaded his cash up in a self-storage unit

177
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,569
handed over the keys to him at Goodman's.

178
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,946
Who knows where he took it from there?

179
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,740
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

180
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,951
Seven barrels' worth.

181
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,494
Seven barrels?

182
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,125
When you say "barrels,"
you mean "barrels" barrels?

183
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:35,505
Barrels, man. You know,
plastic, black, 55-gallon type.

184
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,007
I got them at Home Depot.

185
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,675
Filled up every last damn
one of them too.

186
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,971
And where did you rent the van?

187
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,933
Lariat. The one
on Candelaria and Monroe.

188
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,730
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah.

189
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,192
Kuby rented the van.
Mr. White dropped it off.

190
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,986
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

191
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,362
Wash the rental? Why?

192
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,365
It was filthy, man,
like he went off-road with it.

193
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,576
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back

194
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,371
handed over the key, and that was it.

195
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,831
That's all I know.

196
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,670
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

197
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:21,051
Agent Gomez and I are going
to do everything we can

198
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,768
to find this son of a bitch.

199
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,470
Like I said, you're free to go.

200
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,515
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

201
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,185
And remember, no phone calls.

202
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,937
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.

203
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,230
I took the liberty
of removing the battery,

204
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,566
so Walt can't track you by GPS.

205
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,527
So don't put that back in.

206
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,737
Agent Van Oster will stay here with you.

207
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,405
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

208
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:49,037
Don't discuss the case with him
because the less you distract him

209
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,456
the better he can protect you.

210
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,042
How long you gonna be?

211
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,420
As long as it takes to keep you safe.

212
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,935
So just one guy this time.

213
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,396
Not even in lockup.

214
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,277
Some former partner, Todd says?

215
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,738
Yeah.

216
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,991
So, what are we talking, rat patrol?

217
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,953
Rat p...?

218
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,455
No, no.

219
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,917
Rat patrol? No. No, he's not a rat.

220
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,170
He's just...

221
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,302
He just won't listen to reason.

222
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,595
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

223
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,347
He's not a rat.

224
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,516
All right.

225
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,853
Angry non-rat. Got it.

226
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,670
How angry we talking, by the way?

227
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,565
Like, Hulk angry?

228
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,902
Like, Rambo-James Bond badass individual?

229
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,452
Not something you'd do yourself, huh?

230
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,705
Jesse is like family to me.

231
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,753
Look, I want what you do
to be quick and painless.

232
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,838
No suffering, no fear.

233
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,155
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

234
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,968
I respect that.

235
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,471
- There's too many savages out there.
- Let's just talk about the money.

236
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,807
No, we don't want your money.

237
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,019
We want you to cook for us.

238
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,947
You know I'm out of the business.

239
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,782
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

240
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,788
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

241
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,332
Get the color right too.

242
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,335
Apparently that blue touch you put on it

243
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,754
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

244
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:07,008
- So I'm told.
- No. Absolutely not.

245
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,887
Look, what was the price per head
last time? I'll triple it.

246
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,654
A drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

247
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,116
Don't skimp on family,
that's what I always say.

248
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,686
You want us to do this job?

249
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,856
Do it right? That's the price.

250
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,662
One cook

251
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,331
after the job is done.

252
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,817
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

253
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,188
Do him tonight if you want.

254
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,232
Just tell me where he is.

255
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,068
I don't know where he is,

256
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,281
but I know how to flush him out.

257
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,912
You want string cheese
or yogurt squeezers with your PBJ?

258
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,497
Both.

259
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,792
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

260
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,758
Hold on, honey.

261
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,055
Hi, Andrea.
I don't know if you remember me.

262
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,140
I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.

263
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,475
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi.
- Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,894
Oh, hi. Hi.

265
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,646
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

266
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,734
but I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

267
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,277
It's about Jesse.

268
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,780
Sure. I'm sort of rushing around
right now.

269
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,907
Wanna talk inside
while I get my boy ready?

270
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,370
Oh, well, yeah. If it's...
If it's okay, yeah, sure.

271
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,663
Thank you.

272
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,752
- You met Brock before, right?
- Yes. Yes, I have. At Jesse's.

273
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,087
How you doing, Brock?

274
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,966
Brock, he asked you a question.

275
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,844
- I'm good.
- Good.

276
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,638
Froot Loops.

277
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,556
That's good stuff.

278
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,810
So Jesse...

279
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,311
Yeah, I...

280
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,778
I don't wanna alarm you,

281
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,482
but I've been trying
to reach him for days.

282
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,025
I've stopped at his house

283
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,820
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

284
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,156
and he won't return my calls.
I can't find him anywhere.

285
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,783
Have you heard from him?

286
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,660
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

287
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:44,331
That was, I don't know,
two weeks ago, maybe.

288
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,792
Andrea

289
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,922
Jesse's using again, and I...

290
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,633
I have a bad feeling about this.

291
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,345
Have you tried calling the police?

292
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,683
Or a better idea.

293
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,061
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

294
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,828
I mean, he may have ways of finding
Jesse without getting him in trouble.

295
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,193
"Better call Saul." Yeah. I... I did that.

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,779
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up,

297
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,033
but, otherwise, very little help.

298
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,203
You see, the thing is

299
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,498
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

300
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:31,920
And I won't bore you
with the details, but he's...

301
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,758
He's... He's pretty upset with me and...

302
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,761
And I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

303
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,724
instead of him being...

304
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,518
Well...

305
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,064
Well, I'll try him right now.

306
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,234
I mean, if that's it, he's mad at you

307
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,197
- maybe I'll have better luck.
- That would be such a help. Yes.

308
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,325
What...? What...?
What number are you calling him on?

309
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:05,287
- His cell.
- You know, he recently got a new one.

310
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,289
And there. That...

311
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,751
That's his new number there,
the highlighted one.

312
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,716
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

313
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,283
Your friend Walter just dropped by.
He's here at the house right now.

314
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,639
We... We're thinking of you.

315
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,016
Call me back as soon
as you get this message.

316
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,733
I really need to hear from you.

317
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,895
It's important.

318
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,773
Thank you, Andrea.

319
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,067
I appreciate that.

320
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,986
Well, I better... I better be going.

321
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,153
You're welcome to stay a few minutes
to see if he calls back.

322
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,908
No, no, no. You're trying to get
your son off to school.

323
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,537
If he does happen to call back,
would you call me?

324
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,332
Better yet, I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

325
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,377
And thank you.

326
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,797
See you, Brock.

327
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,077
We on?

328
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,871
Yes. It should be any time now.

329
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,582
<i>Copy that.</i>

330
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,335
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

331
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,338
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

332
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,340
<i>You got it.</i>

333
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,889
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.</i>

334
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,935
<i>Your friend Walter just dropped by.
He's here at the house right now.</i>

335
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,146
<i>We... We're thinking of you.</i>

336
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,513
<i>Call me back as soon
as you get this message.</i>

337
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,157
<i>I really need to hear from you.</i>

338
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,985
<i>It's important.</i>

339
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,782
Nice try, asshole.

340
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,677
How'd it go at the rental place?
Van have GPS?

341
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,763
No GPS. Nope.

342
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,724
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago

343
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,268
when the ACLU or somebody sued them,

344
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,270
and they had to get rid of it.

345
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,278
Well, that's it. Game over.

346
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,323
Yo, man, you can't just give up on this.

347
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,742
- Who said we're giving up?
- What do you got?

348
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,078
Just thinking about what Babineaux said

349
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,162
about the van being dirty,

350
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,330
and the shovel that Walt had with him.

351
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,750
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

352
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,003
No kidding. So what?

353
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:03,381
There's a whole lot of desert out there.
How we gonna find the spot?

354
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,758
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

355
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,346
Yeah. But Walt doesn't know that.

356
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,851
All right.

357
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,563
Here's your change.

358
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,856
- Oh, count it out, please.
- Here.

359
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,858
Three. That makes 15.

360
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,653
Plus 5, that is 20.

361
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,990
- Give this to your car wash professional.
- Thank you.

362
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,492
Say it.

363
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,828
- Have an A-1 day.
- Oh, you too.

364
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,623
- Good.
- Why...? Why do I...?

365
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,833
Why do I gotta say that?

366
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,044
Because it reinforces our brand.

367
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,213
So getting the hang of it?

368
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,549
It's... It's pretty basic.

369
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,386
Mom, it's Saturday.

370
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,970
Can...? Can I go?

371
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,723
- Go where?
- Home.

372
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,389
Pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

373
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,468
I'm sure the smell is gone by now.

374
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,314
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer?

375
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,358
- I need you.
- Hi.

376
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,901
Who do I give this to?

377
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,822
You know what? I'll take care of it.
Excuse me, son.

378
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,449
That'll be 14.97, please.

379
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,540
Hey. How you doing?

380
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,417
You're on our billboard. You're...

381
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,087
- You're the lawyer guy, yeah.
- "Better call Saul!"

382
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,510
Okay.

383
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:34,390
So 3 makes 15, and 20, 25, 30

384
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:38,060
35, 40, and 10 makes 50. Thank you.

385
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,728
I like your commercial.

386
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,605
What...? What happened to your face?

387
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,649
Oh, this is a... I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

388
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,652
Thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

389
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,072
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

390
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,706
- Yeah.
- Don't drink and drive.

391
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,994
- Okay.
- But if you do, call me.

392
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,163
Have an A-1 day.

393
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,498
Mom, you forgot to say it.

394
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,209
Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay.

395
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,421
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

396
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,675
That's it. Way in there. Attaboy.

397
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,219
What the hell you doing here?

398
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,305
I swear to God, the kid left
so much booger powder in there

399
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,265
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's wet dream.

400
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,852
Is your phone broken? All 200 of them?

401
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,146
Huell's gone.

402
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,772
Huell's gone where?

403
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,610
No idea. AWOL. Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

404
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,695
So, what about Jesse?

405
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,988
He hasn't shown up yet.

406
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,617
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite,

407
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,633
and hasn't gotten our message yet.

408
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,329
Or he got it loud and clear,
figured out it's a setup.

409
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,208
The kid is not as dumb as you think.

410
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,966
Are you wearing a bulletproof vest?

411
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,983
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

412
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,887
Look, I had him watching the Dog House

413
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,640
figuring the kid might show up.

414
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,726
Next thing I know, radio silence.

415
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,354
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

416
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,273
Jesse is not on some killing spree.

417
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,692
It's me he wants.

418
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,194
It's just me.

419
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,061
Well, then where the hell's Huell?

420
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,206
- Any news?
- Not yet, but soon. I promise.

421
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,667
Have an A-1 day.

422
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,634
Next, inventory lists.

423
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,599
These are the inventory lists.
Every day, after close of business

424
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,686
you tally the total of every item sold,

425
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,104
and you mark it
under the appropriate column.

426
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:50,401
So say we sold, I don't know,
10 pine-scented air fresheners.

427
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,736
You mark "10" under this column,

428
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,280
and then you subtract 10
from the stock column.

429
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,533
Okay? Why don't you try that?

430
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,837
Jesse?

431
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,213
<i>Got my photo, bitch?</i>

432
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,215
<i>That barrel look familiar?</i>

433
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,427
<i>Because I just found six more
exactly like it.</i>

434
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,269
<i>That big bastard who works for Goodman</i>

435
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,771
<i>I pistol-whipped that melon
he calls a head</i>

436
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:31,023
<i>till he gave up what he knew,
which led me to your rental van</i>

437
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,861
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.</i>

438
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>How do you like that, genius?
Guess you didn't think of everything.</i>

439
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,576
Look, Jesse, I don't know
what you plan on doing here, but...

440
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,329
<i>Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.</i>

441
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,583
<i>It involves a couple of five-gallon cans
of gasoline and a lighter.</i>

442
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,835
No, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.

443
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,545
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch.</i>

444
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,130
<i>You get your ass out here
as fast as you can.</i>

445
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,924
Yes, I'm coming. Okay! Okay!

446
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,637
<i>And don't even think about
calling anyone for help, all right?</i>

447
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,930
<i>You hang up on me, put me on hold</i>

448
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,891
<i>lose my call for any reason</i>

449
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,769
<i>as soon as you do, I'm burning all of it.</i>

450
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,688
<i>All right? One big bonfire.
You get the picture?</i>

451
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,607
- I get it, I get it. Okay.
<i>- All right. You better hurry</i>

452
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,818
<i>because I'm burning 10 grand a minute</i>

453
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,987
<i>till you get here, starting right now.</i>

454
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,865
I said, I'm coming!
Don't you touch my money!

455
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,285
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch.
There goes 10 G's.</i>

456
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,914
<i>- Oh, nice orange flames.</i>
- No, no, no!

457
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,002
Jesse... Jesse, please.

458
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,130
I'm dying. My cancer is back.

459
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,676
You're not hurting anyone
but my family. Okay?

460
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,886
I can't spend this money.

461
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,139
It's not for me. I won't be around
long enough to use it.

462
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,808
It belongs to my children.

463
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,644
<i>Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.</i>

464
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,604
<i>You're seriously gonna go there?</i>

465
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,900
I am sorry about Brock.

466
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,443
<i>No, you're not.</i>

467
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,570
- I am.
<i>- You're not, but you're gonna be.</i>

468
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,532
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

469
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,325
But he's alive, isn't he?

470
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,411
He's fine, just as I planned it!

471
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:09,123
Don't you think I knew
exactly how much to give him?

472
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,333
That I had it all measured out?
Come on!

473
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,920
- Don't you know me by now?
<i>- I know you're a lying, evil scumbag</i>

474
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,187
<i>that's what I know.</i>

475
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,382
<i>Manipulating people</i>

476
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,135
<i>- messing with their heads.</i>
- Open your eyes!

477
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,013
Can't you see that I needed you
on my side to kill Gus?

478
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,182
I ran over those gangbangers!

479
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,269
I killed Emilio and Krazy-8! Why?

480
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,979
I did all of those things
to try to save your life

481
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,565
as much as mine.

482
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,817
Only you're too stupid to know it!

483
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,031
Jesse.

484
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,577
Jesse!

485
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,287
Jesse, talk to me.

486
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,415
Jesse!

487
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,298
Jesse, I didn't hang up! Jesse!

488
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,395
Jesse?

489
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,317
Jesse, I'm here. Where are you?

490
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,784
Son of a bitch.

491
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,912
Son of a bitch.

492
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,710
Son of a bitch!

493
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,383
No. No. No, no, no.

494
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,087
Come on, come on.

495
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,797
Yes.

496
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:51,970
Yeah?

497
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,097
It's me. I've got Jesse in sight,

498
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,064
and he's coming for me right now.

499
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,143
<i>He knows I'm alone.</i>

500
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,312
- Let's go, boy.
<i>- I'm guessing he's got backup.</i>

501
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,274
- How many guys?
<i>- I do... I... I don't know.</i>

502
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,319
- Where are you?
<i>- To'hajiilee.</i>

503
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,446
<i>An Indian reservation west of town.</i>

504
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,990
<i>- Get a pen.</i>
- Go.

505
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,035
Okay.

506
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,745
Okay.

507
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:21,083
"Thirty-four, 59, 20

508
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,419
<i>106, 36, 52."</i>

509
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,837
Those are coordinates.

510
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,675
<i>If you want me around to cook for you</i>

511
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,467
- you get here now.
<i>- You got it.</i>

512
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,929
As fast as you can. Okay. Wait.

513
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,598
They're coming.

514
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,441
Looks like there could be
three men total.

515
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,816
Wait a minute.

516
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,068
What? What is it?

517
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,822
- Stay in the car.
- Oh, my God.

518
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,282
<i>Walter, what is it?</i>

519
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,453
<i>Walter, you still there?</i>

520
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,416
<i>Walter?</i>

521
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,548
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?</i>

522
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,638
<i>What do you see?</i>

523
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,394
<i>Walter, talk to me.</i>

524
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,938
Forget it.

525
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,734
Don't come.

526
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,450
What do you mean, "don't come"?

527
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,737
<i>It's off.</i>

528
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,407
Do not come.

529
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,309
Walt!

530
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,978
Come on out!

531
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,524
Walt!

532
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,075
Walt!

533
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,744
I know you're out here!

534
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,001
It's over!

535
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,235
Walt!

536
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,198
Come on out, Walt!

537
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,959
Got him.

538
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,563
Drop it!

539
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,407
Hands up!

540
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,042
Walk towards me slowly!

541
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,326
Stop.

542
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,703
Turn around.

543
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,795
Lace your fingers behind your head.

544
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,716
Walk backwards to me.

545
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,180
Stop.

546
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,599
Get on your knees.

547
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,093
How'd you like my barrel photo, huh?

548
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,554
Took it in the backyard
by the barbecue grill.

549
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,474
You know, where we used
to cook out with the family.

550
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,518
Gomey thought the dirt
might not match. But me?

551
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,771
I bet your greedy ass
would be so worked up

552
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,939
about the prospect of losing your cash

553
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,025
that you wouldn't catch it.

554
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,112
Looks like I was right.

555
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,239
He's clean.

556
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,826
Yo, I remember this place.

557
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:51,413
It's the very first place
we cooked, like, ever.

558
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,333
It is, isn't it?

559
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,796
Hey, what say you save us
the busywork, Walt,

560
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,757
and point out the spot
where you buried your money?

561
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,055
No?

562
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,308
No matter.

563
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,728
I'll get a search team out here.
We'll find it.

564
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,108
Agent Gomez, should we flip a coin
for the honors?

565
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,903
No way, man. It's all yours.

566
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,239
Walter White

567
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,658
you have the right to remain silent.

568
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,375
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

569
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,954
in a court of law.

570
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,997
You have the right
to speak to an attorney,

571
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,999
and have an attorney present
during questioning.

572
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,793
If you cannot afford an attorney

573
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,827
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

574
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,842
Do you understand these rights
as I have just recited them to you?

575
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,803
Coward.

576
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,229
- Get... Get over here!
- Bring it!

577
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,992
- Get in the truck, will you?
- Bring it, bitch!

578
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,953
- Put him in the car!
- Come on!

579
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,413
Get in the car! Hurry up!

580
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,169
Get in the car, kid. Come on.

581
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,722
Gonna take him down for booking, okay?

582
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,224
You should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

583
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,311
- You got it.
- I'd take the kid with me,

584
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,439
but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

585
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,442
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Hey.

586
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,764
I'll call the tribal police,
let them know we're here.

587
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,411
Gonna make a phone call.

588
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,347
Hank, why is there what looks like
brains in our garbage can?

589
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,183
Hey, baby. I got him.

590
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,393
Dead to rights.

591
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,397
- You got Walt?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

592
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,150
<i>I got him in handcuffs as we speak.</i>

593
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,777
<i>Want me to wave to him for you?</i>

594
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,743
Well, he's not...

595
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,745
He's not feeling too friendly.

596
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,706
Oh, my God.

597
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,791
You did it.

598
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,878
Thank God.

599
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:48,005
Things are gonna be a little rough
for the next couple weeks,

600
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,389
but they'll get better.

601
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:55,847
Baby, you okay?

602
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,685
I'm much better now.

603
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,773
I gotta go.

604
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,317
It may be a while before I get home.

605
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,198
I love you.

606
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,534
I love you too.

607
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:47,573
Who the hell is this?

608
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,734
Tribal police?

609
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,323
Hank! Hank! Hank!

610
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:13,675
No...

611
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,894
Police! Drop your weapons!

612
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,229
Jack, don't do it!

613
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,858
Jack!

614
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,655
Drop your weapons!

615
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,782
You heard the man! Put them down!

616
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,160
How do we know you're cops?

617
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,454
Show us some ID!

618
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,040
Damn straight! Let's see some badges!

619
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,001
Jack!

620
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,754
Jack, don't do it! Jack!

621
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:56,551
No, Jack, it's off! Jack!

622
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,679
We'll give ourselves up,
you show us some badges!

623
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,350
Simple as that!

624
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,812
How about it?

625
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,689
No!

626
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,275
Jack!

627
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,319
Jack!

628
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:19,282
Jack, it's off! Forget it!

629
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,577
Jack!
