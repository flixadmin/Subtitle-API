Um, so it's amazing
to see, uh, everybody here...

3
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,394 X1:0
...from DC television tonight.

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,863
It's kind of crazy to have the universe
represented like this.

5
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,633
Uh, so I'm gonna ask some questions
for a bit...

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,136
...and then we're gonna turn to you
and get some questions from the audience.

7
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm gonna start with some <i>Gotham</i>
questions, so, Bruno, start with you.

8
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,977
Uh, and Danny. So where--?
I mean, <i>Gotham--</i>

9
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,879
Where did this all come from?

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,148
Why start with the death of the Waynes?

11
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,483
Where did you, uh, spark that idea?

12
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,152 X1:0
Origin stories are my favorite part...

13
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:58,457 X1:0
...of the mythology of, uh, the DC Universe,
and origin stories in general.

14
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:04,564
So actually, when I started talking with Geoff
about doing something in the DC Universe...

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,834
...it was just natural to me to start thinking
from the start of the process.

16
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:14,440
And what is more sort of iconic and seminal
than the death of the Waynes?

17
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,075
JOHNS:
Danny, where'd you get the--?

18
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,678
Like, what was your inspiration
for the vision of the show?

19
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:23,316
It's so spectacular. It's just a beautiful,
majestic, cinematic show.

20

Where did you--?
Like, what did you draw from from the lore?

21
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,422
CANNON: It was a dream come true,
as far as a director's concerned.

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,092 X1:0
And it was a dream, um...

23
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,662 X1:0
...of Gotham, a city that I always wished
I could have visited as a kid.

24
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,398
The comic books I read,
the movies that I saw.

25
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:46,004
We just had to go back in time and imagine
what that decrepit, decaying, corrupt city...

26
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,408
...was like from the very beginning,
and, uh, I just started sketching.

27
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,611
And it went from there.

28
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:57,449
JOHNS: And, Ben, so you're like
the only good cop in Gotham right now.

29

MCKENZIE:
That's correct.

30
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:03,021
And, Donal,
you're a pretty bad cop in Gotham.

31
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:06,891
So are you gonna drag Gordon down
or is Gordon gonna pick you up?

32
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,428 X1:0
I think we're gonna meet in the middle,
probably, right? Heh-heh.

33
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:13,964 X1:0
Yeah, Harvey's-- You know, like,
Harvey knows how the city works.

34
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,668
And Jim, uh, believes he knows
how the city ought to work.

35
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:22,039
And between those two worlds
is, uh, Gotham.

36
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,811
LOGUE: It's hard not to love Ben, so it seems--
MCKENZIE: Ooh, wow, hey. All right.

37
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,883
He's such a do-gooder, he kind of pulls him
to the other side of the equation.

38
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:35,718
JOHNS: So speaking of the cops,
we'll go to the villains.

39
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:40,656
Jada, so you're one of the most
charismatic people on-screen...

40
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,692
...and in this,
you bring a real seductive quality--

41
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,228
Like you do right now.

42
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:50,098
--to everything.
So, what's it like playing this villain...

43
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:51,800
...who, Bruno, you created.

44
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,703
It's a brand-new character,
so you can really do whatever you want.

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,239
We don't know what the outcome
of this character is. What's that like?

46
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,308 X1:0
Um, it's a very unique experience.

47
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:06,281 X1:0
And, you know, to be part of a franchise
like this and have the opportunity...

48
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:09,651
...to collaborate with someone
like Bruno, Danny...

49
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:12,187
...to create this character
has just been amazing.

50
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:16,324
And Robin.
So everyone saw the Penguin.

51
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,795

representation of the Penguin.

Like, it's really-- And I've read the scripts
that Bruno and his crew are doing...

55
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,707
...and it's extremely twisted. Thanks, Fox,
for letting us get away with that.

Uh, so, what's your inspiration
for Oswald Cobblepot?

57
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:41,115

than, I think, anyone's ever seen.

-There's a lot of makeup on me. Heh-heh.

It's a lot. I mean, you wouldn't think so.
It's very subtle, and I actually really like that.

Um, they gave me a butt.

163
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:21,007
Like, I have a really nice butt in the costume,
so I'm really excited about that.

164
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:24,210
Uh, but really, it'sjust really cool to,
you know, join team <i>Arrow...</i>

165
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:28,515

you know? It feels like a family.

Your Black Canary's such a badass.

She's badass.

is coming back. Can you say anything...

170
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,364
...about how it's been
to play Black Canary...

171
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:47,267
...and what you were inspired by
for this character?

172
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:50,336 X1:0
-She's so wounded and tortured.
-Yeah.

173
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:56,609 X1:0
Um, well, of course I read some <i>Birds of Prey</i>
comics and the Black Canary comics.

174
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,680
Uh, which, of course, are written
by our wonderful writers over here.

175
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:06,586
And mostly I just took it from, you know,
like, she has a really dark past.

176
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,923
And I think that makes her character
so strong...

177
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,593
...but she's so vulnerable with
her connection with her family and stuff.

178
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,596

that costume is like....

with a smile on his face all the time...

for <i>Flash,</i> I think the heart of it is really...

...something that you help
bring out obviously. It's from you.

to make the same show twice.

didn't wanna watch two hours...

And, you know, so whereas <i>Arrow</i> has,
you know, a much darker quality to it...

261
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,988
...you know, with <i>Flash</i> we wanted
to do something a little lighter...

262

you're on the Show, Jesse. You're amazing.

321
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,527
The other father figure, who's an actor.

322
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:46,763
He played The Flash before,
John Wesley Shipp.

323
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,999
[CROWD CHEERS]

324
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,468
Amazing actor, we were talking earlier...

325
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:56,139
...like, there was no Comic-Con like it is now
when <i>The Flash</i> TV Show was originally on.

326
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:59,409
So this is pretty different, I assume,
from your experience the first time around.

327
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,345
Yeah, we shot till 9 a.m.
one Saturday morning...

328
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:04,681
...and they said
we need to go to San Diego.

329
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:08,084
And I think we walked through a convention
hall and signed a few autographs...

330
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,754
...and took a few pictures,
and the whole thing took about two hours.

331
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:14,624
-This is, uh, very different. Very different.
MAN: Yeah.

332
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:19,696
So, Tom, what's the deal, man?
You stepped up out of that wheelchair.

333
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:25,402 X1:0
You tell me, Geoff.
You tell me, Geoff Johns. What is the deal?

334
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,803 X1:0
JOHNS:
What is the deal?

335
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,040 X1:0
So, what's Dr. Wells' interest in The Flash?

336
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:33,175
Can you delve into that a little bit?
Why is he--? How's he know all this stuff?

337
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,044
Heh-heh. Um....

338
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,712
KREISBERG: Say nothing.
-Yeah.

339
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,747
You heard Kreisberg, right? "Say nothing"?

340
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,817
This is like--
Yeah, I'm caught in a tough place.

341
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:50,623
Uh, I will say that sometimes, Geoff...

342
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,594
...in the comic book world, people are not
always exactly what they appear to be.

343
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:58,697
JOHNS: I've heard that.
-Ahem. Yeah, that happens occasionally.

344
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,998
And this might be one of those instances.

345
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:04,368
Certainly, Barry has three,
uh, mentor figures.

346
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:07,037
He's got his real father, played by John.

347
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:08,839
Jesse, the man who brought him up.

348
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:13,110
And then once he gets struck by lightning,
he's got a guy who has a vested interest.

349
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,780
I play that guy. And you know more than me,
so quit asking me the questions.

350
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,549
[JOHNS LAUGHS]

351
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,451
Sorry, I had to torture you a little bit.

352
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,286
CAVANAGH: Understood. Understood.
You owe me though.

353
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:24,855
Candice, um....

354
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,460
So we know where your character's going,
obviously, coming up in <i>Flash...</i>

355
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,263
...but you know the character
from the comic books, She's a reporter.

356
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:35,833
So where's Iris gonna go...

357
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:40,337
...and how is her relationship with Barry
gonna stay the same, change?

358
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,807 X1:0
Well, I think--
I mean, what I love about Iris...

359
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,977 X1:0
...is, I mean,
something that we all look for in our lives.

360
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,415
We're always looking for that person who's
kind of our true north and our best friend.

361
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:55,319
And I think Iris is that for Barry,
and that's fun to play.

362
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,790
But I think it's gonna be interesting
to see how their relationship evolves...

363
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,326
...once he's got these superpowers...

364
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:05,663
...and she learns that not only
is Barry, her best friend...

365
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,831
...and her father keeping this secret
from her...

366
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,734
...how she deals with that family dynamic...

367
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:13,870
...and how that changes her relationship
with, not only her father...

368
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:16,739
...but someone that she's considered
her best friend her entire life.

369
00:20:17,273 --> 00:20:19,308
It's gonna be a little tricky.

370
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,310
It's exciting
to see how that's gonna happen.

371
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,513
I'm at Comic-Con, guys.

372
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,580
[CROWD CHEERS]

373
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:28,316
-Can we take a moment for that?
JOHNS: You just realized that.

374
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:29,885
You've been here three days.

375
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:32,821
PATTON:
Oh, my God. Thanks for inviting me.

376
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,656
So, uh, David. Where's Mr. Goyer?

377
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:36,491
Hey, David.

378
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:40,629
So you guys know David,
he wrote all those kickass Batman movies.

379
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:42,464
[CROWD CHEERS]

380
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,933
<i>Man of Steel.</i>

381
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,003
He made the first good Marvel movie
with <i>Blade.</i>

382
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,872
[CROWD APPLAUDS]

383
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,709
So, David, I know when you sat down
and talked to everybody...

384
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:56,911
...about what you wanted to do
in television...

385
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:59,513
...you had your choice
of basically anything you could do.

386
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,384
So after Batman and Superman,
why John?

387
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,887 X1:0
He doesn't have any Spandex, which is
kind of nice, doesn't have any superpowers.

388
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:11,192 X1:0
And we joke that, like, if he--
You know, first he'll try to throw a spell...

389
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,227
...and if that doesn't work,
he might try to pick a fight...

390
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:16,030
...and if that doesn't work,
he might try to do a con.

391
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:18,466
If that doesn't work,
he'll try to kick the guy in the balls.

392
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,335
And if that doesn't work, he'll just run.

393
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,106
And that's, like, a fun character to write
after all this time.

394
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:27,508
JOHNS: Yeah, very different than Superman.
GOYER: Yeah.

395
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:31,512
So, Daniel, when, uh, you guys
were casting the show...

396
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:34,614
...what made you land on Matt Ryan?

397
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:37,016
Who's tremendous
and he's Constantine embodied.

398
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,353
But how did you know
that you'd found him?

399
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:44,991 X1:0
You know, I have to say that I don't know
if an actor has ever worked harder for--

400
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:47,060 X1:0
-Where's Matt? I don't see him.
GOYER: There.

401
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:50,563 X1:0
I don't know if an actor has ever worked
harder for this role than Matt Ryan did.

402
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,202
We got one self-tape in from this guy
who's worked with Jude Law in <i>Henry V.</i>

403
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,237
And you should've seen the tape we had.

404
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,939
First of all, he was about 10 pounds lighter
than he is now.

405
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,811
He had dark hair, long,
Slicked back completely to his skull.

406
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:09,782
And he had a beard. And he looked like
Sasquatch. It was this wide, and it was....

407
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:13,185
RYAN: David said that I was Sasquatch.
-I mean, he looked like a Hasidic Jew.

408
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:16,088
But, like, Six Million Dollar Man Sasquatch.

409
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:19,824
But here's the thing, I mean, and I don't
know if it's the Shakespearian training...

410
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,494
...I don't know what it is, but he said
the lines and you could see it in his eyes...

411
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,496
...and you could see it
in the way he owned it.

412
00:22:25,963 --> 00:22:27,765
He looked nothing like this now...

413
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:30,067
...but it was like,
"This is John Constantine."

414
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:32,403
What kind of research did you do
for this character?

415
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,607
Because this cha-- He's very unique,
obviously, and you embody him perfectly...

416
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:38,176
...so, what'd you do to get there?

417
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:44,115 X1:0
I read one comic and then, uh,
just carried on delving deeper and deeper.

418
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:48,219
And after I got the role, I just kind of gleaned
as much as I could from the comics.

419
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,522
And I'm still reading them.
I mean, there's a lot to get through...

420
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,090
...So I'm still reading and still searching...

421
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:58,962
...and still trying
to get under John's flesh and, uh, yeah.

422
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,465
Are there any other DC Characters--? I know
the answer, but I'd love to hear it from you.

423
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,835
Any other DC characters
gonna show up in the series?

424
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:06,670
RYAN:
Um....

425
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,506
Yeah, I think there are, right?

426
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:11,074
There's Jim Corrigan.

427
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:14,277
GOYER: Corrigan and, obviously,
he turns into The Spectre.

428
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,412
-Yeah.
GOYER: Helmet of Doctor Fate Shows up...

429
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,447
...in the pilot, so....

430
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,783
Yeah, there's lots of Easter eggs in there.

431
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,052
And, uh, we've obviously got Zed.

432
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:27,289
-Played by the beautiful Angélica.
GOYER: Angélica.

433
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:30,793
Papa Midnite's showing up
in a few episodes.

434
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:34,530
-We'll be rolling out a number.
JOHNS: Cool.

435
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,999
Uh, well, I'm gonna open up
to fan questions.

436
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,767
I don't know where the mic is,
but we can take a few questions.

437
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,503
We don't have a lot of time,
but we'll take a few questions.

438
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:51,279
Well, we wanted to have
one of his most iconic villains in the pilot...

439
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:55,650
...so, um, but we also knew
that we wanted Jesse to shoot him.

440
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:01,923
So, you know, fortunately in the comics,
Mark Mardon, um, has a brother, Clyde.

441
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:05,425
So, you know, somebody
was obviously flying the plane...

442
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,928
...that we saw Clyde Mardon jump into.

443
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,297
So, uh, there is
another Weather Wizard out there.

444
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:13,466
Um, and we will see him one day.

445
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,034
And, you know, we were very conscious of--

446
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:18,470
You know, we weren't just doing a show
about The Flash.

447
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:21,473
We were doing a show about The Flash
and everyone in that comic book.

448
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,211
And Central City and Iris and Joe
and, um, you know, all the villains.

449
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:27,512
Because the Rogues--

450
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:31,983
Especially all the work that our very
handsome moderator tonight, Geoff Johns...

451
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,887
...has done in comics, you know, over the last
15 years in building up the Rogues' Gallery.

452
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,322
So we're very blessed.

453
00:24:37,455 --> 00:24:41,826
Wentworth Miller is, uh, gonna be playing
Captain Cold in episode four.

[CROWD CHEERS]

455
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:49,099

of Felicity on <i>The Flash.</i>

[CROWD CHEERS]

457
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:57,141
Uh, and, you know, the others will,
you know, they'll get rolled out one by one.

458
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:59,610
JOHNS: You will get a glimpse
of another one in episode four.

459
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,412
That's true.

460

JOHNS: Yeah, and you will see Grodd.
That cage was not there by mistake.

We heard you guys.

462
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:09,686
Next, please.

463
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:18,394
For me, this is, like, completely,
completely surreal.

464
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:22,665
I grew up loving this genre of, like--

465
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:24,934
I wasn't a comic book fan necessarily
growing up...

466
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:29,672
...but I was a huge fan of the
Christopher Reeve's <i>Superman</i> franchise...

467
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,341
...all those movies.

[CROWD CHEERS]

469
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:37,780
Uh, and so this-- But I also grew up
doing musical theater and, like, tap dancing.

Grew up in Virginia, so, I mean,
this is not only something that--

472
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:46,422
It's not a dream come true,
it's something I could've never fathomed.

473
00:25:46,689 --> 00:25:49,658
And when I got to put the suit on
for the first time...

474
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,759
...I mean, it blew my-- That's me right there.

475

JOHNS:
Well, <i>Gotham</i> kind of takes--

479
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,741
I mean, Bruno, you can talk
about that a little bit.

480
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:13,579
It kind of takes place kind of in the past,
but also in the present.

481
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:18,550
Um, yeah, that's a good question.
Again, I would say never say never.

482
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:21,820
I think at the moment both shows are new.

483
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:24,323
And one of the things
about creating a TV show...

484
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,627
...is you're trying to, um, create
and find the tone of the show.

485
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:34,933
And if those two worlds, if those two
DC worlds coincide, then it would work.

486
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,938
But, as you say, I'm not really clear about the
chronology with how Constantine interacts--

487
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:44,276
Maybe Constantine is only 5 or something
in this universe.

488
00:26:44,443 --> 00:26:46,745
And that wouldn't be very entertaining.

-But, yeah, never say never. Yeah.
JOHNS: Or would it?

490
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:51,417
You could come up with a story over there.
