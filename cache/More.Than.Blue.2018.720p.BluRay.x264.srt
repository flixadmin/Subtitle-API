00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,600
"I don't love Lu Snake"

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,700
"When love is over"

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,100
"Early bus"

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,500
"I miss you, I am pulling."

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,200
"The way a person walks"

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,400
"How to make your baby cry"

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,500
"How do you make up for a dumbfounded cat?"

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,400
"Retreating scenery"

10
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,500
"More and more"

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,000
"From now on, the baby is a passenger."

12
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
How about Dongge
Like it

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,900
This lyrics was written an hour ago.
Hot

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,300
"87 points is also a life attitude"
Arranger Jonny is still popular

15
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,100
"87 points is also a life attitude"
The market needs a topical song
That's right.

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,600
But the company has already saved money to play online drama.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
If this song does not cause a topic
We are GG

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,300
She is born to singer yeah
Sing what listeners will pay for it

19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,000
really

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,300
"Baby loves to be deeper"
What are you worried about?

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,800
"Baby loves to be deeper"
I look at it and wait for the money to count.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
"Scare to eat hands"

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Wait

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,600
I am worried about this
Amanda

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,600
This lyric

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,500
I have no way to invest

27
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,400
baby

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
Scared to eat

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,100
How to sing this
A-Lin, we will not record now.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,500
Will not have time to mix
Hey, let’s sing first.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,300
it is good

32
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,300
I do not sing
You sing by yourself

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,700
Hey baby

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh, no, A-Lin
I am born to singer yeah

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
A-Lin

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh, just help me with this busy.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,500
I also want to help.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,900
But how can I sing, there is no way to invest in feelings
I know I know

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,500
These words are very popular on the Internet.
But with this song

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
It’s totally different tonality
How do you want me to sing?

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,400
Sorry

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
What?

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,200
I have a song in my phone.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
It seems that it has not been published yet.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I want to say that the boss wants us not to

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,700
no need

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,300
Xiaoyou, let me listen
it is good

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,100
"I don't envy the sun."

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,700
"I don't shine you in the past"

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
"Some dark"

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,600
"we are the same"
What is the name of this song?

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,800
The word is also well written

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
This song is called a sadness

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,400
It is better to ask him to help us write words.

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Maybe this song is still saved.
Who wrote the word

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
I do not know

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,700
This song is given to me by a friend of mine, Abang.
You take me to find him now.

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,500
"No need to open"

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
"There is no need"

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
"hide"

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Abang

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,900
Small tour
How come?

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,300
Hello, I am Amanda.
A-Lin Broker

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
A-Lin

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,000
Is that A-Lin?
Hello

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,300
I am A-Lin

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Come, please
I invite you to have coffee.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
Xiaoyou helped me close the door

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Abang

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Do you know the lyricist?

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Because our company has a song

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
I want to invite him to write
Know

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
Her name is Cream.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Is it the face-to-face breakup of the Cream?
Yuanyuan

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,900
Song Yuanyuan
Then you have the contact method of Yuanyuan.

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,000
Line, WeChat, or Facebook?

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
No one is contacting her now.
What other people she knows?

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,200
The person who sang this song Demo

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,300
I should be able to contact her.

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,600
The singer is called Zhang Zhekai.
Zhang Zhekai

81
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,300
Did he know Song Yuanyuan? Zhang Zhekai
understanding

82
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
They used to love each other
Great

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Can Zhang Zhekai call me?

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
please

85
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,200
This is really important
I have to find him when I kill him.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,300
He has passed away

87
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
died

88
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,500
I remembered it.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Zhang Zhekai is K brother

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,900
Our same record company

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,500
When I first entered the company
Still meet him

92
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,000
Later, it seems to have left.

93
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,100
It turned out to be him

94
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,400
How could it be so sudden?

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Zhang Zhekai's story

96
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,900
To start from the age of sixteen

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,200
That year his family left him.

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,900
He started his life alone

99
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,800
Living in that building, there is only one person left.
Piled up with father's relics

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,100
In an old house that is incapable of finishing

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,200
He became closed for a while

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,300
As if he was just an individual who was destined to be lonely forever.

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,800
Living is the saddest thing

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Until that day, met her

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,100
Eh

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
Please drink

107
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
What?

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,900
How are you smoking?

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,900
Hey
Which class do you have?

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,700
Dare to smoke at school

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No, instructor, instructor

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,100
not me
stand up

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Just have you like this
Instructor

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,300
The instructor does not catch my hair. I don’t follow the rules.

115
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,400
Unclean, self-love is very painful

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
I don’t know how to be honest

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
Zhang Zhekai met Song Yuanyuan for the first time in the playground.

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,500
I fell in love at first sight.

119
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
I asked him if he didn’t even introduce himself.

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,300
This can also be love at first sight.
He said

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,000
If love needs to be explained

122
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,200
No one in the world will suffer from it.

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,000
Eh

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
go home together

125
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,700
Hey
I am being remembered for being harmed.

126
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't worry about it
a little over

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,100
Otherwise, I invite you to watch comics and add instant noodles.

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,200
Go

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Eat instant noodles, right?
Three bowls, you will eat this.

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,100
Add meat, add eggs, add greens

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,500
since that day
Song Yuanyuan entered my life

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
Changed my life

133
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,800
Her informality

134
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
Her sunshine

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Zhang Zhekai

136
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Opened my originally closed atrium
Which one

137
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
What is the same school?

138
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
We are admitted to the same university

139
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,500
We decided to have a birthday together
happy Birthday

140
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,400
go

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Wait

142
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
We have a lot in common

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Like to watch comics

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
I like to eat instant noodles.
Lost guests

145
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
What are you doing?

146
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,600
Hey, Zhang Zhekai, you are too big.

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,700
Specially took me to Kyoto to take a graduation photo

148
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Spend a lot of money

149
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,700
And cherry blossoms

150
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, it’s very exaggerating. How are people so good?
Come, look here

151
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
One hundred and thirty pieces in Kyoto

152
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Boss, is it not one hundred and five?

153
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Two people
Come, look here

154
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,100
I just didn't watch
It's ok

155
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,600
I count one two three
One two

156
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,200
Six hundred pieces
Too expensive

157
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,900
The most powerful coming
She likes to challenge

158
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,900
but me

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Like to challenge with her

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,500
Faster

161
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,100
We all like to eat ice in winter.
Like rain

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,900
Like to have each other's season

163
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,600
We become the indispensable part of each other

164
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,200
You live alone.

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,700
Beginning at the age of sixteen
I will live by myself.

166
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Come

167
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Come, sly clothes

168
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
Oh, yes.

169
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,400
How do you change this?
Go away

170
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,300
You are very wet, you also wipe it.

171
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,200
You can't peek at you?

172
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I won’t peek at it.

173
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Eh

174
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
Okay
naive

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,400
Not allowed to watch

176
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
I am looking at you?
I didn't see it.

177
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,200
Comfortable

178
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Eh

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
I am moving to live with you.

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,500
The house is so big

181
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,100
I

182
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,000
I am used to one person

183
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,800
I am alone

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,700
get up
What time is it?

185
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,300
From that day, Cream has lived in this home.

186
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,900
She opened a window for me

187
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,900
a window that originally trapped me in loneliness

188
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,100
She took my sadness

189
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,500
let me know

190
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
original

191
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
I deserve someone to accompany me.

192
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
original

193
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,300
Once people get used to loneliness

194
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,700
That is more sad than sadness

195
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,700
Zhang Zhekai

196
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
Zhang Zhekai

197
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,700
I think your name is not good.
I will help you take a new one.

198
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,200
What are you talking about?
You will be called K later.

199
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
K

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Correct
K is the nickname, not the name.

201
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,200
Anyway, I will call you K later.
So this is your name

202
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,800
Then why is K?

203
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,700
Because I am Cream

204
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,000
Ice Cream's Cream
So why is Cream?

205
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,800
Because I like to eat Ice Cream

206
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,200
I like to eat Ice Cream.

207
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
It should be called Ice Cream.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Why is it called Cream?

209
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Cream, Cream is cream

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,300
Is the meaning of milk
milk

211
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,000
Where are you looking?

212
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,500
grandmother

213
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,200
Ice Cream's Cream
Cream has milk

214
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,100
you really are

215
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,800
Ok, Cream
Cream

216
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
Cream
K

217
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,100
Eh

218
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,800
I heard that people with Roman feet
Mom will live longer

219
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,700
What is Roman foot

220
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,400
Like this

221
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
Longer thumb

222
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,000
Not right?

223
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
My parents, they died together in a car accident.

224
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,700
My mom hasn't lived for a long time.

225
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,300
But my mom is still alive.

226
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,200
Your mother left when you were a child.

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,900
She has long been out of your life.
So that doesn’t count

228
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,300
Still, I am not a Roman foot.
I will help me look at it.

229
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Don't affect me watching movies
Hurry, help me look at it.

230
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,400
Do you think this is like a Roman foot? You are annoying.
Very stinky, it hurts

231
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
I warn you ?

232
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,700
If you dare to go earlier than me
You are dead, I heard no.

233
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,200
Don't bother me to watch a movie
Very poor

234
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,100
Are you watching?

235
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,400
I cherish everything I get along with her.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,300
But like a prisoner in a cell.

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,100
Once people fall into love

238
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,800
It’s hard to escape

239
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I fell in love with Cream

240
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
Fall in love with her

241
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,100
I want to live with her forever.

242
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
But I can't

243
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,900
Don't dare to confess with Cream

244
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,000
because

245
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I have cancer cells ready to wake up.

246
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,300
Small K

247
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,800
Small K

248
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
Zhe Kai

249
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,100
Zhang Zhekai
You stayed up late at the company.

250
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Don’t want money, don’t want money, don’t want to die.
keep your voice down

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How do you sleep and sweat too much?
Have it

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Clothes are wet

254
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,500
Maybe it’s really too tired.

255
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,200
Recently, our company has a person named Lisa who wants to get married.

256
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,500
I am really busy and very hard.
You mean to say me.

257
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
You suddenly took a vacation for a whole week.
I almost fainted.

258
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Miss

259
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
I am really fainting.

260
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,200
Confrontation

261
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,600
Seriously, this thing really can't let Cream know
I know

262
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,100
You have reminded me
Third time

263
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Swear

264
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,300
I swear

265
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Okay?
Thank you

266
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Go back soon

267
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,200
I haven't finished yet.

268
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Health first
Yes, super health

269
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,400

Excuse me, go

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Help me a lot

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,700
Too fake

284
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,000
How did your father teach you when he was a child?

285
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,300
Hey

286
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,000
Say hi to Bonnie

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,100
Small K

288
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Bonnie's new look
How are you, not bad?

289
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,300
K brother is good
Bonnie is the Department of the Universe

290
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,800
New star beauty

291
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
I feel good

292
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,500
Giggle is embarrassed

Can you turn off the music first?

This is my executive broker.
Abang

295
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Hello, K.
Hello there

296
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,300
Jige

297
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,700
Let's talk in our conference room

298
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,600
Good ?
this way please

299
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,100
"No need to open"

300
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,000
"It will be enough together"
"????"

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,700
"Bonnie hug"

302
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,300
"I rely on you"

303
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
"Cat Bomb Bomb"

304
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,500
Pause

305
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,600
Eh

306
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,700
Bonnie

307
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,200
it's okay no problem

308
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,000
In front of me, I sang very well.
Very delicate

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,900
It’s the place where the treble is, don’t use it.

310
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,800
Throat is easy to get hurt

311
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,900
I will try it later.

312
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,800
Lower abdomen output

313
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,700
Ass clamping

314

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,100

316
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
"Bonnie hug"

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
"I rely on you"

318
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,700
"Cat Bomb Bomb"

319
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Wait

320
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,000
Bonnie wants to change your dependence on me.
You are mine for ever

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
May I

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,100
can

323
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
How to change Bonnie love

324
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,000
What to change
Hey, Bonnie likes romance.

325
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,700
Where is romance forever?
There are pink bubbles.

326
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,500
What pink bubble

327
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,600
Isn’t it the attitude of this song forever?

328
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
What attitude?

329
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,700
Yeah, what attitude?
And what about

330
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,600
This song is given to Bonnie by Jige.
Bonnie wants to change, how to change

331
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
Ji Ge sees her.

332
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Miss

333
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,200
Change the lyrics
What are you yelling over there?

334
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
When is the time to get you talking?

335
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,500
Who said that I can't talk
No, I mean she...

336
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
This lyric is written by me.

337
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Why can't I talk?
Eh

338
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Bonnie? told Ji Ge that he can’t talk.
You just can't talk

339
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Who are you?

340
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,000
Do you have to change it?
Correct

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
Bonnie is going to change
I am going to help tampering

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Sorry

343
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,300
I ask again, I said, I have to change.

344
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,900
Hey this vocal lyricist
What do you say, who is arrogant?

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,200
All right

346
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
stop fighting

347
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,700
Ji Ge said not to fight.
Just hit me.

348
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Do not hit

349
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,500
I still really fight

350
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Is anyone at home?

351
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,400
Do not cry, don't cry
it's okay no problem

352
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,400
Nothing

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Come

354
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,600
Covered like this
I am getting married.

355
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Wow, sly face

356
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
How was it hurt?

357
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
What kitten female Bonnie

358
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,300
She has to change my lyrics forever.

359
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,000
Always very low

360
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,000
and then

361
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Then I will, ?

362
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,700
I am too impulsive

363
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,300
I helped you clearly.

364
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,500
Ji Ge still appreciates his talents.
But he took the flower of his beloved kitten face.

365
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,800
It’s time to apologize to her.

366
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,200
I do not want

367
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,600
I also spend it.

368
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,400
Look at my face

369
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
And my hand
I am also hurting.

370
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,200
Heard no

371
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,100
I will apologize

372
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,000
How is the lyrics changed?
No mood change

373
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,800
Losing his temper

374
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,500
Come
I am here, I am accompanying tampering

375
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,100
I don't like forever

376
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,100
Then don't ever

377
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,000
Change

378
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
Next life

379
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,600
I can accept my next life.

380
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,100
Next life

381
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,700
Next life

382
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Feels like an appointment

383
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,700
But never

384
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,500
As long as one of the two people is gone
It’s not forever

385
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,100
Then I ask you

386
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,100
If there is a next life

387
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,100
What do you want to be?

388
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,000
people

389
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,800
Who doesn't want to be a person
You are a pig

390
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,000
Ok, serious

391
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,300
If I have a next life, I want to be

392
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,400
Ring

393
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,900
Ring

394
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,700
or it could be

395
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,200
Wait a minute

396
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Ok, come

397
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Hi, I am K.

398
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,000
If there is a next life
I want to be

399
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Ring

400
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,200
glasses

401
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,500
bed

402
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,700
and also

403
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,700
notebook

404
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
What are you doing?
Can be around

405
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,700
You are disgusting, you are
What is disgusting?

406
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It’s inevitable that you will write a lyric.
right

407
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,000
Doesn't it mean to change to forever?
Why didn’t you change it?

408
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,500
Change to the next life

409
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,800
Is it not good

410
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,600
in fact
This change is not bad.

411
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,300
Quilt ring with glasses key

412
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,800
Expressed as companionship
Bonnie likes

413
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,700
Forever these two words
If there is one person missing

414
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,400
That can't be established
But next life

415
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Kind of like a kind

416
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,700
Agreement
If someone has not seen it before

417
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,800
But still can see the face

418
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,400
Bonnie feels so romantic

419
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
What I want to express is this meaning.

420
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I completely understand
really

421
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,100
Is Bonnie a great chance to become
Promising lyricist

422
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,400
I think it’s very talented.

423
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,600
It should be no problem
Lollipop

424
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
Bonnie happy
Meow meow

425
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,000
The last thing

426
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,500
Really sorry
It's fine

427
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Bonnie doesn't mind

428
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Bonnie forgives ?
Bonnie knows

429
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,200
Writing is a very difficult thing
But Yuan Yuanzhen really wrote very well.

430
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,200
I will call me afterwards.
Ok, Cream

431
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,000
Then it’s called Bonnie Chen Huijun.
Who

432
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,300
Chen Huijun

433
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,400
What is the name?
Bonnie is Chen Huijun

434
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,500
Chen Huijun is Bonnie

435
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,400
In order to make Bonnie a well-known lyricist in the future.
starting today

436
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Bonnie Chen Huijun wants to be friends with Cream
it is good

437
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,900
Bonnie's friends
Is my friend of Ji Ge

438
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Ji Ge and Bonnie’s friend
Is my friend of Abang

439
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,000
Ji Ge and Bonnie ? with Abang’s friends

440
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Is our friend

441
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,700
"The cat's tears are pearls."

442
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,900
Ok, then choose this love song as the first main hit.
what about you

443
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,200
What?

444
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,700
Kitty Bomb
I think Kitty Bomb is very good at the main event.

445
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,000
The first song is a quick song, but also has a memory.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,900
And the kitten is very suitable for singing

447
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,700
This song is very cute.

448
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,500
This is the word of Cream.
Ok

449
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,400
Yes
I haven't seen her work for a long time.

450
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
But I still think this word is a bit too jump

451
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,900
But Bonnie likes it very much.

452
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,200
Bonnie is going to walk very front
Meow ~

453
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,200
Oh, it’s really going too far.
I think this song is very good.

454
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,200
This song must shoot MV

455
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,400
Because this song has a very strong visual sense.

456
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
If the MV is good,
I believe young people will love it.

457
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,500
it is good
That song is the first major

458
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,500
What about the second main?
Do you have any opinions?

459
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,900
I have opinions ?
Bonnie is my baby

460
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,800
Every song has to pay big money to shoot MV

461
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,300
Bonnie feels moved

462
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,900
Bonnie is crying when she is moved.
clam

463
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,100
Cry

464
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,700
This can be used as a publicity point

465
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
how about it

466
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,100
First main hit

467
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,200
I should not be because of you.
I can be selected as the first major.

468
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,100
How many times have you told me?

469
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,500
This is your own strength

470
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,600
Regardless of the last face-to-face breakup

471
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,000
Still this time, okay?
Have nothing to do with me

472
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,700
I feel so too
I dare to beat me, you hit me first.

473
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,000
How are you going to fight you?

474
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Shameful face

475
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,100
Bonnie is not

476
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,400
Excuse me

477
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,000
No, no, no.

478
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,900
Oh

479
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,500
Ah, what are you doing?

480
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,200
Celebrate
Just the song of Cream

481
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Was selected as the main hit
Let's go and eat

482
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
Bonnie treats

483
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,900
Okay

484
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,500
Zhe Kai

485
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,000
I suggest you quit your job.
Take good care of your body at home

486
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,000
So my illness
Started to attack

487
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,100
The symptoms of you and your father
Is exactly the same

488
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,300
The biggest expectation now is bone marrow transplantation.

489
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Help him measure his blood pressure
Yes

490
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,500
Ask you ?

491
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
do you have

492
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,500
What do you want to say to me?

493
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,600
what's wrong
I am looking for the lyrics again.

494
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,000
Leave me alone
Say it

495
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
no
What am I going to say?

496
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,500
That is to say

497
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
You usually want to say
But only when there are no ones

498
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,900
The one you dare to say out loud

499
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
How can I be so handsome?

500
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,600
Not like this

501
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,700
Is that kind

502
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,900
If you go to church, you have to confess with the priest.
The kind you will say

503
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Then I won’t say it to you.

504
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,700
Oh, not god.
Leave me alone

505
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,400
I want to hear it.

506
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,300
Yes

507
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,800
I like ?

508
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,700
I already knew it.

509
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
I know you still ask

510
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,500
Then I still have a question.

511
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200
Oh, a lot of questions.
Leave me alone

512
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,700
What is your wish?

513
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,000
Longevity

514
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,700
Not like this

515
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,800
I am talking about
Kind

516
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,300
Do you have anything to do?
But you haven't done it yet.

517
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Have

518
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,000
I hope ?

519
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,700
Find a good man to get married.

520
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,700
You are not saying that you like me.

521
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,900
You are jealous of me.

522
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,900
I am not a good man.

523
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,000
What is the definition of a good man?

524
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,200
have a job
a little money

525
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,900
Kind and love home

526
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,800
then

527
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,100
Healthy body

528
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,000
what does it mean

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,100
It doesn't mean anything.

530
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,500
Hurry to eat, not hungry
Eh

531
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,000
Very delicious
Don't eat me, eat light

532
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,200
Cream
Do you like K?

533
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,400
Why do you suddenly say this?
Because Bonnie can see it.

534
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,500
? have a feeling for K
Did you tell him?

535
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,100
We are not that kind of relationship

536
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,700
Don't understand

537
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,000
We live together though
But we are not together

538
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,300
Cohabitation

539
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,000
How can this be
There is such a relationship in the world.

540
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,300
We are
I'm used to it

541
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,700
How long have you been like this?

542
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,600
High school to the present

543
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
For more than ten years
ten years

544
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,900
What are you doing in the past ten years?
What can I do at home?

545
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,700
Dry clothes, wash clothes, eat, cook rice
Did not go to bed

546
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,200
we…

547
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
several times

548
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,700
Five times
Five times in ten years

549
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,000
Not

550
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,700
0. 5

551
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,100
what does it mean

552
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
Is
only

553
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Kiss and hug
No one

554
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,500
what

555
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,000
We are not male and female friends.

556
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,500
Is it

557
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,300
Don't you like him?

558
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,000
Didn't dislike

559
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But we are not in contact

560
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,700
I don't want the relationship to be so complicated.
Does Cream want to keep doing this?

561
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,400
Don’t you want to tell him?

562
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,800
in fact

563
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,500
He told me to find a good man to marry.
are you crazy

564
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,800
I told you
Men are ?

565
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,200
Hey now?
Go with others right away.

566
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,900
If he knows
He will look back and find out.

567
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,300
Trust me

568
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,700
Behind

569
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,700
Go forward

570
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Gordon is going to vomit

571
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,900
Who is that man?

572
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,500
Vampire ?

573
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,000
That is my high school classmate.
Is a dentist?

574
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,200
Lisa, I am going to get a drink.
it is good

575
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Are you running out?

576
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,600
?No cup ?

577
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,500
Ok

578
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,600
Lend me

579
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,600
Thank you

580
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
This is not a kiss.

581
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Are you counting?

582
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
clam

583
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,900
Does not matter
I kissed each other.

584
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,100
Thank you

585
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,200
Gordon, playing

586
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,100
"Yang Youxian"

587
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Your teeth are very healthy
no problem

588
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,500
Dr. Yang

589
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,300
We have met for two consecutive days.

590
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,200
We will kiss the first time we meet.
Meet for the second time

591
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,500
I will show you inside my mouth.
What are we going to do for the third time?

592
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,600
I wanted to meet you

593
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,600
Do you want to know me?

594
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,000
Eh

595
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,400
I found a good man.

596
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,400
clam
What do you say?

597
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,800
I said, I found a good man.

598
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
He is a dentist

599
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,200
Is a high school student at Lisa.
That's very good.

600
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,500
I have been waiting for the bone marrow for seven years.
How much time do I have?

601
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,500
You come back regularly
If the situation is stable

602
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,600
Life can still last

603
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,300
Uncle

604
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,100
You don't have to comfort me.

605
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,100
My illness

606
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,900
It’s already in the acceleration period.

607
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,900
So how long can I live?

608
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,900
probably

609
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,900
No more than one year

610
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,500
Jige

611
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,800
I want to ask you to help me investigate a person.
survey

612
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,400
I am the best at this kind of thing.
But small K

613
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,800
I want you to do me a favor.

614
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,500
The money is a bit of a treat

615
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,300
Bonnie’s propaganda is up to you.

616
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
Mr. Chen at 4:30

617
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
34, 35
CT help me open

618
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,300
Other equipment to help me prepare

619
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,600
it is good
Thank you

620
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,100
give you

621
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,900
Thank you

622
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,000
I wrote it

623
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,500
? is a lyricist
Ok

624
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,800
so smart

625
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,100
What are you doing after work?
Didn't do it?

626
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,600
Please have a drink.

627
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,300
I will send you a CD

628
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,700
Okay

629
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,200
Is it okay?

630
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
Can you have a drink?

631
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,200
Ask you ?
Is it true that boys are very fond of heart?

632
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,600
Just like you obviously love someone
But only said that I like it a bit.

633
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,100
Is it really difficult to tell the truth?

634
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,500
Have you ever talked about love?

635
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,900
I am engaged.

636
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Lend me a bit

637
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,200
There are only two kinds of results in falling in love.

638
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,800
One kind of thing is like this

639
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,400
Falling into love

640
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,200
Another one?

641
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Is to take out the love that got stuck

642
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,100
I want to know me.
Ok

643
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,000
Then why is it me?

644
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
If love can explain

645
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
No one in the world will suffer from it.

646
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,300
Continued Cup

647

Yang Youxian
Doing business at home

648
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,200
First graduate of the Department of Dentistry

649
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,000

No previous record

650
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,500
No bad habits

651
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,800
No special disease
Very healthy

652
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,500
There is now a fiancée called Cindy.
Simply speaking, it is the victory group of life.

653
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,000
So next to him
Is his fiancee ?

654
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,500
Ok
She is still a very good photographer.

655
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,900
Many big stars have designated her to take pictures.

656
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,200
Then our Bonnie’s promotional photo

657
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,000
Just look for her to shoot
Yes, arrange it right away

658
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,500
So cold

659
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,500
I ran to drink alcohol.
Ok

660
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,200
with him
Ok

661
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,300
What do you like about him?

662
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,500
I do not know either

663
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,100
do not know

664
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,000
do not know

665
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Don't talk, sleep

666
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,200
right
left

667
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,700
Is that hand like this? K brother
Cindy is not simple for women.

668
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,500
I see Yang Youxian’s card.
I definitely don’t know my fiancée.

669
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,300
So popular outside

670
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,900
Give us some more time.

671
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,700
I can also take a film as evidence.

672
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,500
no thanks
This is enough

673
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,100
Ok
Small K

674
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,500
You say that you love someone
Why are you so hard?

675
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,500
Jige
What do you mean

676
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Hey Hey hey

677
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Where are your hands on, you are looking for death?

678
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,500
Jige

679
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,000
The teacher is teaching Bonnie to dance

680
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What are you doing?

681
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
He taught dance even if he

682
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Why do you want to touch your ass?

683
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,100
Lie me, I won’t jump, or I will teach

684
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,200
How do you teach Bonnie?

685
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
You are not professional

686
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,400
Don't worry so much about it.

687
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,500
What is professional?

688
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,800
Chop people, I am the most professional

689
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,400
He is very good, don’t hack him right away.

690
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,500
This teacher is not good, I am giving you a better one.

691
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Regardless of Bonnie, I want Michael.
But I don't care

692
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,900
Ji Ge, K brother fainted

693
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,500
Zhang Zhekai?

694
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,200
How did you suddenly faint?

695
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,200
I do not know either
The doctor seems to say what I have.

696
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,000
Congenital anemia

697
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,600
Congenital anemia
Ok

698
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,700
He will faint mainly because
Too tired

699
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,100
There is still a little calcium deficiency
Generally this anemia

700
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,900
Will not have much impact on life
Miss

701
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,200
Don't worry

702
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,300
It's fine

703
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,800
Really nothing
Calcium deficiency

704
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,400
Strange, I eat the same as you every day.

705
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,900
Why don't I have calcium deficiency?

706
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,600
Because you eat more
Eh

707
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,800
Oh, it’s a big food monster.

708
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,600
Anyway, I am not allowed to work overtime from today.

709
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,300
Every day, calcium is heard.
It's fine

710
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,500
Nothing

711
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,300
This will help me file it.

712
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,700
it is good
Doctors

713
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,800
This is your letter
Oh

714
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What?

715
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,900
Look at it

716
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,700
Shit

717
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,900
Premarital investigation
Not me to check

718
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,400
Someone sent it to me.

719
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,100
We are together for six years

720
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,100
I funded to become a photographer
I want to give you a home.

721
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,500
This is the response that I gave to me.

722
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,200
You Xian

723
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,700
Marriage is what you want to end up is not me.
We have discussed this issue very early.

724
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Love is not my first order.

725
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,400
Even if it is not the first order

726
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,100
Doesn't mean that you can take it for granted.
I don't want to explain so much to you.

727
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,800
In all the relationships I want to cherish

728
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,000
I have nothing to say.
Oh, this is just an irresponsible saying.

729
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
I need to create

730
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,900
So ? with me is also for the creation of ?

731
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,500
This sentence is too hurtful.
Then do these things without hurting people.

732
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,200
Is it for everyone who pays for it?
I have feelings

733
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,700
What do you mean by this sentence?
What does that mean?

734
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,900
I will not deny what I have done.

735
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,700
If you want my apology

736
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,400
I can tell you sorry.

737
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,800
You fucking, who do you think you are?
Why are you investigating me?

738
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,200
Do you think that there is no address, I will not adjust the monitor?

739
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Hey

740
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,600
What are you doing?

741
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,100
enough
You let me go

742
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,700
and also

743
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,200
Will my life shut you down?

744
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,000
Hey
Bring it

745
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,100
I am sorry

746
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,100
I just hope

747
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,600
You can break up with Yang Youxian.

748
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,700
are you crazy

749
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,800
I don't know what your intention is.
But if you dare to continue to find me trouble

750
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,500
I am ending with you.

751
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,200
Zhang Zhekai

752
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,400
K brother

753
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
I really don't understand what you are thinking.

754
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,600
You go to investigate that crazy woman

755
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,200
Then ask her to dissolve the marriage contract.

756
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,700
what does it mean
Are you crazy?

757
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,600
I am crazy.

758
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,400
I just want to find a good man for Cream.

759
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,500
How old is she
She won’t find it herself?

760
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,600
look at me

761
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,900
Do you think she will find it?

762
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,100
She won't, really won't

763
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,200
And I really have no time.

764
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,600
No time

765
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,700
I have no time soon.

766
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,700
Bonnie's record is on the market
Did not sell more than 10,000

767
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,100
Ji Ge wants me to walk

768
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,500
Abang

769
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,300
I don’t have to worry about anything at the time.

770
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,700
You just lost your job

771
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,100
Still you are dying

772
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,100
K brother, you look at me.
Just if I didn’t appear in time

773
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,800
You are really dead

774
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,300
Abang

775
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,700
Thank you very much.

776
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,200
Brothers

777
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,000
Own person
Three eight

778
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,100
Okay
Otherwise

779
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,200
I will accompany you to Cindy tomorrow.

780
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,300
Negotiate once
how about it

781
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,400
Remember to close the door

782
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,700
Drink a little?

783
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,700
No need to

784
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Hey, don’t you want to move that flower.
I took a week

785
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Oh

786
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,900
Eh

787
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,000
What are you doing?

788
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,900
This is the compensation for ?

789
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,200
I hope I can leave Yang Youxian.

790
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,800
Dismissed his marriage

791
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,200
You see that I have no studio

792
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,800
Photography is what he supports me to do.
I can go to this step today.

793
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,700
He has half the credit

794
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,700
If he is not active

795
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,400
I won't leave him.

796
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,900
Understand

797
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,900
I still ask ?

798
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,800
I only have less than a year left.

799
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,300
I am going to die.

800
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,900
"Diagnostic Chronic Myeloid Leukemia"
My father died of cancer in high school that year.

801
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,200
Unfortunately

802
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,700
When my mom also learned that I had inherited leukemia

803
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,500
She can't stand the blow

804
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,200
Left the money
The money

805
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,600
Left my life

806
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Should be enough for you to live to adulthood

807
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,800
You need to take care of yourself
do not leave me

808
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,900
mom

809
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,900
When I was the most lonely

810
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,900
Cream appears in my life

811
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
She became my family

812
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,000
And the person I love the most
One or two

813
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Come

814
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,000
birthday present

815
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
I don’t like rainy days.

816
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,300
Send a black cloud
Thank you, happy birthday too.

817
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,300
But today is not my birthday.
I have to have a few birthdays a year.

818
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,200
Your birthday is today.

819
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,400
But my leukemia has entered an accelerated phase this year.

820
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,100
I didn't have the courage to tell Cream.
What happened to me

821
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,300
She may not be like my mother.
Because of pain, leave me because of fear

822
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,300
But I don't know what kind of things Cream will do.

823
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,200
And such a blow

824
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,500
I really don't want her to bear

825
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,100
really sorry

826
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,200
The person I love falls in love with my fiance
I beg you

827
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,700
K brother

828
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,200
I am sorry

829
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,100
Maybe I am too anxious

830
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,900
this is my name card

831
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,800
If you change your mind
Please contact me immediately

832
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,700
I can promise you

833
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,000
But you have to promise me a condition

834
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,000
I promised ?

835
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,700
I am going to have a solo exhibition.
Topic about death and deadline

836
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,800
Since you said that you are going to die
Then you come to be my model.

837
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,600
Let me take pictures

838
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
When I exhibit works

839
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,200
I will break up

840
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,900
Will it be too exaggerated?
Anyway, my condition is like this.

841
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,500
Do you want me?

842
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,600
K brother is leaving.

843
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,700
Eat late at night

844
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,100
Why don't you eat?
It’s all cool

845
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,900
No la

846
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,900
Just suddenly thought

847
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,500
She never helped me to stay up late.

848
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,700
Why do you want so much?
Eat quickly

849
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,600
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

850
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,700
Send a message to me
I will help you again.

851
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,200
"No need to open"

852
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,700
"It will be enough together"
"????"

853
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,600
"Bonnie hug"

854
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,200
"The next life is going to be." Bonnie jumped very well.

855
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,900
"Bonnie Bonnie"

856
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,800
"????", smoke, smoke?

857
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,500
"You are with me."
"Never Let me go!"

858
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,400
Dance

859
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,600
"Bonnie hug"

860
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,000
"Spring flowers love the fireworks of the summer"
Come on, um.

861
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,300
Tell you about it

862
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,000
This is the dentist I mentioned to you.

863
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,600
Yang Youxian
Hello there

864
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,300
Hello, Zhang Zhekai

865
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,400
Welcome

866
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
I know, I often listen to Yuanyuan to mention you.

867
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,300
Come to cut

868
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,500
Can the director?
Very good, Give me five

869
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Give me five

870
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,200
Jige
How is Bonnie performing?

871
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,300
Not bad right
Very Good

872
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,700
Hey, Cream

873
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,600
What do you think Bonnie is jumping like?
Great

874
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,500
Oh, that's of course.

875
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,200
Bonnie is a small international star.

876
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,400
you are
? Xiaomei

877
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,600
He is the dentist I told you.

878
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,900
Hello

879
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,000
It turns out that you are Yang Youxian.
Correct

880
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,200
Not bad

881
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,400
Meow ~

882
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,600
Don't scare him, this, come back.
Are you okay, it doesn't look too comfortable

883
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,600
Nothing, don’t go for a drink after work.
I also can

884
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,000
Go together.

885
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,300
I almost have to go back to the company.
So disappointed

886
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,200
You don't have to look at the scene
on site

887
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,100
There is little beauty.

888
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,000
Ok, here is it for me.
Go ahead and hurry.

889
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,800
Bonnie people?
coming

890
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
I will go first.

891
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,100
Bye bye
Come on

892
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,300
Come to each group of Standby
going or not

893
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,800
Really busy

894
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,500
Nice to meet you, under the music
me too

895
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
I'm leaving
Goodbye

896
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,400
Ji Ge walks

897
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,300
Formally come

898
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,200
Action

899
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,100
Snow machine snowing

900
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,500
"????"

901
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,100
"Bonnie hug"

902
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,500
"The next life will be"
"Cat Bomb Bomb"

903
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,000
"Bonnie Bonnie ?? hug"

904
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,800
"You are with me."
"never let me go"

905
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,600
When did you first meet Song Yuanyuan?

906
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,700
High one
What is she like in high school?

907
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,700
lovely
Lively

908
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,300
Beautiful eyes

909
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,500
You obviously can cherish her now.
With her

910
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,900
Why don't you

911
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,600
Why don't you tell her the truth?

912
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,200
What is the truth?

913
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,600
Do you understand this pain?
We didn’t have a family after we were sixteen.

914
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,800
I am her only relative now.

915
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,600
I want to say how I say it.
I said then

916
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,500
Let her suffer another injury?

917
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,700
Still I said

918
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,900
Do you think she can hold on?

919
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,400
No one can't hold on

920
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,400
That is why you are too confident about yourself.

921
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,400
Song Yuanyuan, she is definitely stronger than you think.

922
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,700
Maybe

923
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,900
I am satisfied that you have this kind of big manism.

924
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,400
Anyway, don’t you just want to help her find a cash machine?

925
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,500
Yes
I am looking for a cash machine.

926
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,000
Then what happened?
I am rotten, I am selfish.

927
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,500
I am her only relative.

928
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,900
I hope she is good.
May I

929
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,200
You want me to leave Yang Youxian.

930
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,100
But you have to promise me another request.

931
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,500
any request

932
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,400
Everything belongs to me after you die.

933
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
No

934
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,600
Everything after my death is Cream's

935
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,600
Don't you think you are contradictory?
You want her to forget you

936
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,800
Not something should not stay

937
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,800
I am sorry

938
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,800
let's break up

939
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,400
These days together

940
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,200
I know that I don’t really love me so much.

941
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,400
Maybe it’s like saying

942
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,300
Love is not so important to you

943
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,000
But I can't keep it

944
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,000
But you still let go

945
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,000
Because I feel that I should be awake.

946
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,500
It’s because of the relationship between those photos.

947
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,700
We are not together because we love now.

948
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,800
Just getting used to

949
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,100
So for you

950
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,200
Our six-year relationship is not love

951
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,000
Anyway, you broke up.

952
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
I also came to break up.

953
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,400
I recently met a woman.

954
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,100
But there is no relationship with us.

955
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,700
I wish you happiness

956
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,500
I broke up.

957
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,100
Then I have something
I want to tell you

958
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,000
When I was a high school
Half to class

959
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,000
The class leader suddenly rushed in
Tell me with a very strange expression

960
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,600
I am going to the hospital right now.
I ask him why

961
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,800
He said because
My parents, my aunt, and my sister.

962
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,500
Car accident inside the tunnel
died

963
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,500
then

964
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,400
I lived with K.

965
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,400
K

966
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,000
K is Zhang Zhekai

967
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,000
Because I think his name is too vulgar.
So call him K

968
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,700
This person is really strange.

969
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,700
At home

970
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,100
Like mom

971
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
Working like a dad

972
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,000
Sometimes I feel depressed when he comforts me like a brother.

973
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,000
Sometimes

974
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,700
He is like a lover

975
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,200
But the key time

976
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,200
He is like a fool

977
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,500
Why are you so honest to me?

978
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,900
Because you didn't lie to me
So I don’t want to lie to you.

979
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,700
And I

980
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,800
I am afraid that you will care.

981
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,400
You said K

982
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,300
Ok

983
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,900
will not

984
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,000
That's good

985
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,500
Christmas gifts

986
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,000
Thank you

987
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,900
Why do people marry?

988
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
marry

989
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,100
Ok

990
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,000
When you are old

991
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,900
Or when you need to be taken care of

992
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,500
That person can be confident and always stay with him.

993
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,400
Then I am not married.
clam

994
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,000
You accompanied me from the age of sixteen to the present.

995
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,500
Don't you ignore me after I am old?

996
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,500
Idiot
Different

997
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Marriage is married
Marriage is a ritual

998
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,900
Married

999
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Yes

1000
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,500
Ok

1001
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,800
Forget it
forget about it

1002
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,500
The stomach is so hungry
Is there anything to eat?

1003
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,200
I don't want to eat this

1004
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,800
This is delicious

1005
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:18,700
really tasty

1006
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,400
Do not
I am going to cook noodles.

1007
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,300
Then don't help you cook

1008
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,500
"I don't envy the sun."

1009
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,200
"I don't shine you in the past"

1010
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,100
"Some dark"

1011
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,600
"we are the same"

1012
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,100
Have a little more fun
You are so sad.

1013
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:56,500
The more sad the song, the less you can sing like this
"I am too embarrassed."

1014
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:03,800
It doesn't have to be so happy.
"Can leave generous"

1015
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,200
"No need to open"

1016
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,700
You sing well

1017
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,000
"There is no need to hide."

1018
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,100
I think you sing a little

1019
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,900
Not serious

1020
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,700
I sing very seriously

1021
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,200
Do you think that if Bonnie learns to sing like this?

1022
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,900
What if the new song is not selling well?
Wait

1023
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,600
Dear lyricist

1024
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,500
I want to know because I am please.
So I only sang.

1025
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,000
Got it
Thank you

1026
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
thank you
So take care of Yuanyuan

1027
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,500
This is what I want to say.
Thank you for staying with her since childhood.

1028
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,600
Take care of her very well

1029
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,200
Then you should have heard of it.

1030
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,500
We live together
But don't misunderstand

1031
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,800
We are really just friends

1032
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,700
Yuanyuan told me
You are a good friend with her.

1033
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,700
To some extent, it’s like a family.

1034
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,200
So she is looking for you to help pick a wedding dress.

1035
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,500
I think it is very reasonable.

1036
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,900
Picking this thing, I
This is the hope of Yuanyuan.

1037
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,800
I want to do what she meant.

1038
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,200
And this is also your Yuanyuan
The last important thing to do

1039
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,300
You should understand what I mean.

1040
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,900
how about it
is it beautiful

1041
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,700
Looks great

1042
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,500
Do you want the groom to try the dress?

1043
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,200
I am not the groom
It doesn't matter, try it.

1044
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,600
I want to see

1045
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,400
Go

1046
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,800
Faster
I tried what I want to do, I want to see it.

1047
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,500
handsome

1048
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,400
Faster

1049
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,800
Full of handsome

1050
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,500
how is it going

1051
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
I helped take two photos.

1052
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,200
Okay

1053
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,500
Look here

1054
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,400
One two three, laugh one

1055
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,500
wait for me a while
I will change a suit again.

1056
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,500
Thank you

1057
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,800
I have already picked up the wedding dress.

1058
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,700
I will send you a photo again.
let me tell you

1059
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,900
My phone seems to be running out of power.
I am late

1060
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,700
Lend me a bit

1061
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,000
Hello, I just had no power on my phone.
Ok

1062
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,600
correct

1063
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,400
Ok, I will charge later.
Ok

1064
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,200
Then you go first

1065
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,800
I will call you again.
worship

1066
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,600
Where did you go yesterday?
You suddenly left and left me alone.

1067
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,300
I am so embarrassed

1068
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,400
Where did you go?

1069
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,400
Not going anywhere
Where did you go?

1070
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,600
Hey
Hello, Zhang Zhekai, go out.

1071
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,700
What are you doing?

1072
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,100
Why are you picking up my phone?

1073
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,200
No, I thought it was
Who do you think?

1074
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,900
baffling

1075
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,300
Cooked for dinner

1076
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,400
Where are you going?

1077
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,900
Go out

1078
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,400
I’m dating the girl on the phone.
Don’t do anything

1079
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,000
Then do you want to eat dinner?
Not eating

1080
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,400
You can't eat if you don't eat me and get married later.

1081
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,000
what are you worried about
She just heard my voice

1082
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,800
Don't guess who I am.

1083
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,400
She knows that she is Yang Youxian’s ex-girlfriend.
I don't want to take this risk

1084
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,800
Then you want me to call you.
Pretend to be your date

1085
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,100
Your heart chances are not too heavy
Must let her die

1086
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,400
Flower language

1087
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,700
Eternal love

1088
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,100
Lonely strong

1089
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,500
The next three years
Hey, let me send the cactus.

1090
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,500
This is what you want
Final step

1091
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,700
Give one year

1092
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,000
Three years after delivery
She won’t notice that I’m gone after a long time.

1093
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,400
You do this

1094
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,200
Is she really happy?

1095
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,100
She will be happy

1096
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,400
Even now it won't

1097
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,300
Will definitely be in the future

1098
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You are dying

1099
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,700
Can't you live a little more directly?

1100
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,700
I want to cry, cry

1101
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,100
I want to laugh and laugh.

1102
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,400
If you are angry, you will lose your temper.

1103
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,400
If you are hungry, you will eat.
If you are afraid

1104
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,100
Then ask for help.

1105
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,800
Some words, if you don’t say it, you won’t be too late.
do you know

1106
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,200
Or you just want to disappear in this world without any trace

1107
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,300
(I am sorry)

1108
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,900
(Have you eaten)

1109
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,900
Thank you

1110
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,900
Thank you

1111
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,000
Ask you ?

1112
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Why are people getting married?
When you are old

1113
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,500
Or when you need to be taken care of
That person can be confident and always stay with him.

1114
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,100
You are not saying that you like me.
You call me

1115
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,700
I am not a good man.

1116
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,800
You do this
Is she really happy?

1117
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,800
She will be happy

1118
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,100
Even now it won't

1119
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,100
Will definitely be in the future

1120
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,900
We didn’t have a family after we were sixteen.
I am her only relative.

1121
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,400
I hope she is good.

1122
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:33,000
Or do you want to be like this?

1123
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,700
Traceless

1124
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,000
Just disappeared in this world

1125
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,300
I thought I wanted to die.

1126
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:47,000
I thought I wanted to die like this.
Who doesn't want to have a good life

1127
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,700
Do you think I am possible?

1128
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,000
Do you think I still have time?

1129
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,700
I hope that the person she married is me.
Not marry him

1130
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,600
I hope that we can grow old together.
Take care of each other

1131
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,800
But this is just a delusion

1132
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,600
Is a sad dream

1133
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:13,200
I don't want to dream anymore.

1134
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:26,500
I really didn't expect K to have such a story.
Unfortunately, gone.

1135
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,100
A-Lin is given to ?
Thank you

1136
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:36,900
This is the last album of their two collaborations.
Give ? to commemorate

1137
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,000
correct
Record it tomorrow.

1138
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,000
real or fake
Ok

1139
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,700
Then I booked the studio?
but

1140
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,900
What I want to sing is
Have a sadness

1141
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,500
Yuanyuan, I am back.

1142
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,700
Yuanyuan

1143
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,500
You Xian

1144
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,600
I am sorry

1145
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,300
I am sorry

1146
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,200
Really sorry

1147
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,700
Human love

1148
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,200
I can touch it without using my hand.

1149
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,300
You can say it with your mouth

1150
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,500
You can see it with your eyes.

1151
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,600
my love

1152
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,100
Starting to know him

1153
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,300
Already exist in my life

1154
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,300
Can't be separated anymore

1155
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,400
I thought that I have been in my life.
No need to experience separation

1156
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,400
did not expect
From that day on

1157
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,800
K will leave me.

1158
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,600
Say that I am too vocal

1159
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,100
????????

1160
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,400
Meow meow meow

1161
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,900
pig

1162
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,700
The kitten’s audience should be boys.

1163
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:38,200
Boys, boys, boys
What do boys love, what do boys love?

1164
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,700
What is more important to them

1165
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,900
Excuse me
Hello

1166
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,300
What is the use of this medicine?

1167
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,500
Where does this medicine come from?
Home

1168
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,400
This Glivec is a treatment for cancer or leukemia patients

1169
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,700
There is also a strong amount of this painkiller.
If you need to use these two together

1170
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,200
His condition should be full of serious

1171
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,300
Bye bye
See you in Yuanyuan, Yuanyuan, look at home.

1172
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,600
Hey, let’s go

1173
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,900
Yuanyuan has a good family, and Yuanyuan worships.

1174
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,600
No

1175
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,100
do not go

1176
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,500
No

1177
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,200
You can't be here
do not go

1178
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,900
Can't go
Stop and stop

1179
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,200
Is anyone at home?

1180
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,400
I feel bad, K has held back the pain.

1181
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,500
Quietly accept everything

1182
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,400
I am very grateful to him

1183
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,500
Even if I am sick, I still think about it for me.

1184
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,400
Maybe in this life, I can’t go to the old with K.

1185
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:49,700
But I am looking forward to the next life.
We can meet again in the next life.

1186
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,400
That day

1187
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,800
I am worried about something happening
You really don't tell her

1188
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,800
I really can't tell her.

1189
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I really can't tell her.

1190
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,900
But now you need someone to take care of you.

1191
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,400
I am fine.

1192
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,100
I can take care of myself.

1193
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,100
How long are you going to marry her?

1194
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,600
I don't know how long I can stay.
But if she knows

1195
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,300
Everything is over

1196
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,100
Before you think about others

1197
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,400
Can you think about yourself first?

1198
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,800
I don't care

1199
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,600
But she is different
She has only one person

1200
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,400
She needs someone to accompany her

1201
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,300
You are also a person

1202
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,800
Not?

1203
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:08,100
When I saw K for the first time
It’s a month after my family’s death.

1204
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,000
Death took my family

1205
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,100
But K is alive and abandoned.

1206
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,000
That day

1207
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,200
Looks sad

1208
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,300
More than I need to hug

1209
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,400
since that day

1210
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,600
I decided to call him K.
And myself, it’s called Cream.

1211
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,500
After all, two lonely people

1212
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,500
There should be a name that is not so lonely

1213
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,000
Hey, K is dying.

1214
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,500
I feel

1215
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,500
Should I tell him that I already know it?

1216
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,500
If he doesn’t want to let ? know

1217
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,800
He should have his intentions

1218
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,300
Is it smashing him now?

1219
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:05,400
Can you change anything?
I only hope that K can be happy.

1220
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,800
No matter anything

1221
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,400
I will do my best to meet his wishes.

1222
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,900
Do you have any wishes?

1223
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,600
I hope ?

1224
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,900
Find a good man to get married.

1225
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,500
What is the definition of a good man?

1226
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,900
have a job
a little money

1227
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,200
I hope that K’s wish is to be with me.

1228
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,200
Then healthy

1229
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,200
But K is going to leave me.

1230
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,200
Even if I don't want to

1231
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,100
I will try my best to give him everything.

1232
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,100
Who is that man?

1233
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,500
Vampire ?

1234
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,400
He is my high school classmate.
Is a dentist?

1235
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,100
This is not a kiss.

1236
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,500
Are you counting?
I wanted to meet you

1237
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,600
I am engaged.

1238
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,300
therefore

1239
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,900
Sorry, You Xian

1240
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,800
I took advantage of you

1241
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,300
If it is with you

1242
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,400
I think K should be very at ease.

1243
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,000
I am sorry

1244
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I used your gentleness

1245
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,100
Your thoughtfulness

1246
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,200
I know that even if there are others in my heart

1247
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,800
You will still accommodate me.

1248
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,500
Quiet waiting time

1249
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,700
Impress me

1250
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,100
Why do people marry?

1251
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,600
Because when you are old
Or when you need to be taken care of

1252
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,500
That person can always stay with him.

1253
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,900
Then I am not married.

1254
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,800
Marriage is a ritual

1255
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,200
Married

1256
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
When can we get married?

1257
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,200
Just love me really.

1258
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,500
anytime

1259
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,300
please forgive me

1260
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,200
My most loved one is going to die.

1261
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,000
I really can't worry so much.

1262
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,800
Hi, I am K.

1263
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,100
If I have a next life, I want to be

1264
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,600
Ring

1265
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,200
glasses
I should not hate forever.

1266
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,200
bed

1267
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,800
I really want to stay with K forever.

1268
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,700
One two three, laugh one

1269
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,200
wait for me a while
I will change a suit again.

1270
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,000
Thank you

1271
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,000
I will contact you again.

1272
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,600
it is good

1273
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,200
I am sorry
It's ok

1274
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,300
I am suffering from great sadness

1275
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,100
I know K is the same.

1276
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,800
I made an appointment with myself.

1277
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,800
As long as he turns back
I will tell him everything.

1278
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,600
If he turns back

1279
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,900
I will embrace him deeply.

1280
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,500
(I love you)

1281
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,500
I want to say out loud that I love him.
(I want to be happy)

1282
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:41,200
But I know that I will shed tears when I open my eyes.

1283
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,700
Unable to support

1284
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,100
Thank you

1285
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,900
Let me practice the wedding process with me.

1286
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,200
Song Yuanyuan

1287
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,500
Whether poor or rich

1288
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,400
Health or disease

1289
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,800
I am willing to marry
Standing in front of the man

1290
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,500
As his wife?

1291
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:20,100
I am willing

1292
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,100
I and K become true couples

1293
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,200
The dream of my dream is realized.

1294
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:40,500
I used to think that we can keep going with you.

1295
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,600
Just did not expect

1296
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,600
In the real world

1297
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,900
But K personally handed me over to another person.

1298
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,500
My feelings for K

1299
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,900
From the age of sixteen to the present

1300
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,600
Has been buried too deep and too deep

1301
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,100
No way to fish out anymore.

1302
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,500
You Xian

1303
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,700
Thanks for everything you have done for me

1304
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,900
Thank you for falling in love with me.

1305
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,100
I have found K.

1306
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,500
I want to see him.

1307
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,300
Hi

1308
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,400
Are you here?
I am looking for you for a long time.

1309
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,000
Stupid

1310
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,500
You have a fever, do you know that?

1311
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,200
never mind

1312
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,600
Will be good soon

1313
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,300
I warn you ?

1314
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:57,200
I don’t want to eat any more from now.

1315
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,300
Not allowed to rain

1316
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,400
Not allowed to eat ice

1317
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,300
Not allowed to work overtime
Did you hear me

1318
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,600
K

1319
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,200
I will take care of you.

1320
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,800
We still have to go baseball together.

1321
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,700
You have to help me sing a hard demo.

1322
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:28,100
You are not allowed to let me have a birthday alone.

1323
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,300
We said it from the age of sixteen.

1324
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,700
Is it not to have a birthday together?

1325
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,400
I am here

1326
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,900
Will be fine

1327
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,600
Will be fine, will be good

1328
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,500
never mind

1329
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,100
I am with you

1330
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,200
This is a little better.

1331
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,200
Going home

1332
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,500
Going home will be fine.

1333
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,200
Sorry, Cream

1334
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,300
Did not get awkward consent

1335
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,500
Arranged love

1336
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,100
Like it

1337
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,600
Let's take another one.

1338
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,800
Remember, I asked me.

1339
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,900
Come
What is my wish?

1340
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:48,700
My biggest wish

1341
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,800
Come

1342
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,500
Is harmony

1343
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,200
together forever

1344
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,800
K

1345
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,800
With Cream

1346
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,500
We are a family

1347
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,800
Always been

1348
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,700
Take a photo

1349
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,600
long time no see

1350
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,600
Hi

1351
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,200
Why come so early?

1352
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,300
I am afraid I will be busy after I start.

1353
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:25,000
I will take you around.

1354
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,700
it is good

1355
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,800
Hi, I am K.

1356
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,700
If I have a next life, I want to be

1357
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,200
Ring

1358
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,800
glasses

1359
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,100
bed

1360
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:45,800
I still can't understand it until now.
An idiot like Zhang Zhekai

1361
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,300
Actually live in this world

1362
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,400
If love can explain

1363
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,500
No one in this world will suffer from it.

1364
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,500
I underestimated love

1365
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,600
I also told Zhang Zhekai before.

1366
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,500
Song Yuanyuan

1367
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,300
She is definitely stronger than you think.

1368
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,100
It is impossible to live because you are dead.

1369
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,500
But I was wrong

1370
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,200
It turns out the love in their eyes

1371
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,700
Is to make the other person happy for life.

1372
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:10,100
"There is no need to hide."

1373
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,200
"There is a kind of sadness."

1374
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:23,300
"Your name is in my past."

1375
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:29,100
"Companion with my breath, I decided to smile."

1376
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:35,000
"Cannot be forgotten"

1377
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,100
K

1378
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:40,400
do you know

1379
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,200
After my family left

1380
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:47,200
I thought happiness is also away with them.

1381
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,200
Until you met you

1382
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:54,100
I only understand two lonely individuals.

1383
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,300
Just stay with each other

1384
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,900
Can also have the right to happiness

1385
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,700
Our encounter is destined

1386
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,800
No one can replace it.

1387
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,300
do you know

1388
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,900
what I want

1389
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:17,300
Not someone who sent me hot coffee in the cold winter

1390
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,100
But accompany me to eat the ice together.
People who have a toothache

1391
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,100
what I want

1392
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,400
Not the person who guards me

1393
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,900
But the person who ventures with me

1394
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,800
what I want

1395
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,300
Not someone else

1396
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,900
It's you

1397
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,200
K

1398
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:47,000
Thanks for everything you have done for me
As long as you can stay with you all the time

1399
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,800
It is already the happiest thing for me.

1400
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,400
"Leave in my past"

1401
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:00,700
I am sorry
"Cannot be forgotten"

1402
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:02,100
I love you

1403
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,700
"There is a kind of sadness."

1404
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,200
"Zhe Kai Yuan Yuan's Tomb"
"It is you who turn your back and let love become"

1405
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:16,300
"The light on me"

1406
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:19,300
"Give me warmth"

1407
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,700
"But you are not allowed"

1408
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:25,200
I have been very curious
Why am I called K?

1409
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:29,300
Because my name is Cream.
that's it

1410
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,100
Because

1411
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:38,000
We two have no family since childhood
Live together

1412
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,500
K

1413
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,600
With Cream
All k pronunciations

1414
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,700
You don't feel like this sounds
Is it like a real family?

1415
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:50,900
"There is a kind of sadness."

1416
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:58,800
"I don't want to be separated from you."
"I miss you when you look back."

1417
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,800
"You are all"

1418
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,500
"You are a photo"

1419
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:11,400
"one"
