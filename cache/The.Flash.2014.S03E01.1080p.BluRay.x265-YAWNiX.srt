- No!

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,083
Finally at the place I can move on...

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,600
- No!

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,481
My father's taken from me.
I need to find some peace.

Whatever you need to do, do it.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,444
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,125

- No.

Today's the day.

13

Today's the day. I'm gonna talk to her.

15

<i>And some things happen

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,122
Okay. It's not a big deal.
I'm gonna do it.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,326
- I've talked to her a million times.
- Say something clever.

No. When I'm done

Excuse me. Hi. Sorry, is this yours?

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,367
I think maybe you dropped...

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,931
It was just right...
I don't know what happened, but...

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,122
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah, I didn't even realize I dropped it.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,601
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah? Yeah, it's okay.

Uh...

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,965
We actually went to
elementary school together.

You don't remember me? PS 23?

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,761
- Oh, my gosh! Right.
- Yeah!

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,167
- Yes, I remember! Gary, right?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,805
Uh, Barry.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,167
- Barry. Right.
- Barry Allen.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,521
- It's fine. No, it's fine.
- Sorry. Sorry.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,643
Yeah, yeah. No, we had Mister...

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,847
- Mr. Hinkley! Yeah, for Math.
- Yes!

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,963
Yeah, he used to always
hit the chalkboard with his...

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,282
His fists!
And all the dust would come flying off.

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,848
- He looked just like Pigpen from Peanuts!
- Pigpen from Peanuts. Yeah, that's...

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,646
Yes. How are you?

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,803
I'm really good.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,687
Yeah, I'm, uh, CSI.
I work over at, uh, CCPD.

55
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Yeah. My dad works there, too.
He's a detective.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,491
Yeah, I see him sometimes.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,331
I don't really know him,
but I, you know, see him in passing.

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,641
Cool. Yeah.

59
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,010
Um, well, thanks again.
I guess you're my hero today.

60
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,323
Glad I could be there for you.

61
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,563
You know what?
Would you wanna get a coffee?

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,610
I mean,
I know you're having a coffee right now.

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,002
I meant like, you know,
at a different time. With me.

64
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,321
Or it doesn't even have to be a coffee,

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,841
it could be any kind of beverage,
like a wine or beer...

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,168
Not that I wanna get you drunk.

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,050
We could get iced tea.
Do you like iced tea?

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,248
Would you wanna get an iced tea with me?

69
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,521
Um...

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,282
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah?

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,727
Yes, I would like to get an iced tea
with you.

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,046
Okay.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,401
Barry Allen, you're very cute,
you know that?

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,840
Uh, yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,567
Yeah, but you should
try talking just a little bit slower.

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,522
Speed has always been my problem.

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,291
I'll see you later.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,724
- What's up, Barry?
- Hey.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,400
You look a little less glum
this day's afternoon.

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,484
Captain Mendez,
I asked out a girl and she said "yes."

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,200
- Ah, there's no better feeling, is there?
- No better feeling.

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,129
Till the day she says, "I do."

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,289
Yeah, we got a ways to go
before that, I think.

84
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
Oh, great. Well, that'll give you
a lot of time

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,127
to catch me up
on where we are with The Rival.

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,926
Nothing substantive.

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,323
He hasn't left any hair or skin samples
at any of his attacks on the CCPD.

88
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,324
So, you're telling me
there's no way to ID this guy?

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,246
We'll figure out who he is
when The Flash stops him.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,284
Well, The Flash better hurry up.
Pun intended.

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,768
Okay. All right.

92
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,647
<i>Has anybody seen Detective West?</i>

93
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,971
You know, uh,
I think he had to stop by evidence.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,121
Uh-huh.

95
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,760
I don't know where he is, actually. Sorry.

96
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,811
Oh, Captain, is it okay
if I leave a little early today?

97
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,007
For your hot date?

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,604
No, I'm, uh, just meeting
a friend for dinner.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,761
<i>Barry! No!</i>

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,686
You're not gonna kill her this time.
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,486
It's okay, it's okay.

102
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,484
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're safe now, okay?

:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

104
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,011
Dinner.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,723
There better be curly fries in there.

106
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,006
You know, human beings can go
almost three weeks without food,

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,090
so I'd sound a little bit more grateful
if I were you.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,523
You wouldn't do that to me, Barry.
After all, you're the hero.

109
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,521
Or did you forget that?

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,929
Too busy leading your reverse
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

111
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,689
Reverse, huh? That's irony for you.

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,883
So...
What should we call

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,647
this, uh, brave new world
that you've whipped up for us?

114
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,884
I was thinking "Flashpoint."

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,201
So, you don't want this?

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,724
You may have figured out a way
to dampen my speed with this glass cage,

117
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,565
but I will get out of here
and I will destroy your life, Flash.

118
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,125
<i>One way or the other.</i>

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,131
No. You won't.

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,242
You're never getting out of here.

121
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,405
And you're never gonna
hurt anybody ever again.

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,920
I have everything back
that you took from me.

123
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,010
I have everything Zoom took.

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,162
I'm finally free. I'm home.

125
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,808
This isn't your home, Barry.

126
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,246
This is a mirage,
a fiction that will end us both

127
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,442
unless you let me
the hell out of this thing!

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,967
Wow.

129
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,970
<i>You're not listening, Thawne.</i>

130
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,844
Why would I wanna get out of here?

131
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,924
I'm whole here.

132
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,010
There's even a "Flash,"
so I don't have to be.

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,602
Yeah, and who is
this dashing young speedster, huh?

134
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,643
Do you know? You even care?

135
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,042
While you sit around and hide
like a lost, lonely little boy,

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,170
letting someone else risk their life
to protect this city,

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,761
our common enemy is coming for us both.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,002
What common enemy is that?

139
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,441
Time.

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,642
It's already screwing with you
and everyone you love,

141
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,451
and pretty soon, it's gonna
take me right down along with you.

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,727
Wow.

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,167
Wow.

144
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,842
You know, you've got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,645
Warning me
about messing with other people's lives.

146
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,846
You know the whole reason I did this
is because of what you did to my life.

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,645
To my family. To my mother.

148
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,083
Yeah, and one day soon, Barry,

149
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,007
you'll be begging me to kill her again.

150
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,249
<i>It would be really nice
to take</i> a <i>little trip there.</i>

151
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,010
<i>Can you hold this for me?</i>

152
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,486
<i>All right, yeah.</i>

153
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,007
<i>Oh, I wanted to tell you,
the car's making this noise,</i>

154
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,362
<i>kind of a clanking noise.
I think we probably should...</i>

155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,249
- Do you wanna drive?
- Whatever you want.

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,848
- Hey, slugger.
- There's my beautiful boy.

157
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,166
Is everything all right?

158
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,845
Yeah, everything's great.

159
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,681
Morning!

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,444
<i>- Morning, Barry.
- Morning.</i>

161
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,927
Ah...

162
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,531
- Looks good. Hey.
- Hey.

163
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,049
- What is up with you?
- What do you mean?

164
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,730
Well, lately you hug me every morning

165
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,405
as if it's the first time
you've seen me in months.

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,291
Well, I mean, I'll stop
if you really want me to.

167
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,766
Never. I love it.

168
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,286
Oh, Barry, I wanted to tell you,

169
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,000
I sold a house to a nice, older couple
a few weeks ago.

170
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,486
- The basement apartment.
- Mmm-hmm.

171
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,047
They emailed me this morning to tell me
they wanted to rent it.

172
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,651
- Cool.
- Very reasonably.

173
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,687
You want me to move out?

174
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,923
No, no. Son, come on.

175
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,889
It's just, you know,
if you ever thought about dating...

176
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,009
Oh, I forgot to tell you guys!
The girl that I've seen at Jitters...

177
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,089
This the girl you've been stalking
for the last three months?

178
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,486
Okay, I have not been stalking her.

179
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,045
I've been working up the courage
to ask her out.

180
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,571
- And?
- And I did.

181
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,207
And she said yes.

182
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,249
- All right! Good job!
- Oh!

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,807
This girl just got the best guy, huh?

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,764
- Mmm...
- Oh, honey.

185
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,890
- All right.
- Hey, Barr.

186
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,730
- Yeah?
- Have you seen Detective West?

187
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,445
- He's...
- I told him that if he was late again,

188
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,165
he'd be facing a 10-day rip.

189
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,722
Uh... Yeah, no, he mentioned something
yesterday, actually,

190
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,922
about running another canvas
on that Jefferson case.

191
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,446
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,246
Then I can see why
he hasn't answered me for the past hour!

193
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,401
Uh...

194
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,881
Maybe he's in a weird zone or something.

195
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,201
Are we...

196
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,368
Cell zone.

197
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,406
<i>Detective West?</i>

198
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,806
Detective?

199
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,251
Oh, no.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,641
Joe. Hey, Joe, you got to get...

201
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,609
on...

202
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,245
I'm sorry about this, Joe.

203
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,761
What the...

204
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,730
Afternoon, Detective.

205
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,687
Oh. Hey, Allen.

206
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,169
Hey. So, I told Captain Mendez you were
canvasing for the Jefferson case again.

207
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,407
Breath mint?

208
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,645
What... Why are you talking to Captain
about me?

209
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,687
Oh, well, you're just a little late again.

210
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,050
That's my business, not yours.

211
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,725
I was just trying to help you out.

212
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,882
Am I wearing a sign that says "help me"?

213
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
You might as well be.

214
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,531
Look, like they say in the movies,
we're not partners and we're not friends.

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,609
You don't know me, you don't know my life.

216
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,201
So, why the sudden interest
in me keeping my lousy job?

217
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,290
And what the hell
makes me so interesting to you, Mr. Allen?

218
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,084
- Tell me, I'd really like to know.
- I...

219
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,204
And remember, I have a hangover and a gun.

220
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,126
I...

221
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,926
- Oh, I get it.
- What?

222
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,886
No. I do not approve.

223
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,642
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey.

224
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,888
- Dad.
- Iris.

225
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,528
You think it's a good idea
dating somebody I work with?

226
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,760
It's just a lunch.

227
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,122
And, truthfully,
I wasn't even sure you still worked here.

228
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,689
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

229
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,081
Okay.

230
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,085
- This way?
- Yeah, I just got to grab my jacket.

231
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,566
I'm sorry about that mini-scene

232
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,404
- with my dad earlier.
- Oh, yeah.

233
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,765
Don't worry about it.
I just feel bad for him and you.

234
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,165
You barely even know us.

235
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,686
Feels like I do.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,287
Is that weird?
Is that a weird thing to say?

237
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,522
No. No, I mean, strangely,
I know what you mean.

238
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,046
I never say yes to guys
asking me out like that,

239
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,844
yet I said yes to you.

240
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,611
Why did I do that?

241
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,287
I don't know.

242
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,484
Some people are just
meant to be in your life, I guess.

243
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,403
So, tell me about you.

244
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,051
- Yeah.
- Mom and Dad?

245
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,804
Uh, alive and well.

246
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,488
- That's nice. Are you guys close?
- Mmm-hmm.

247
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,481
We are, yeah, very.
I couldn't imagine life without them.

248
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,002
They're, like, stupid in love.
I hope I have what they have some day.

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,685
You just haven't met the right girl yet,
is that it?

250
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,002
That's the thing about the right girl.
She's out there, waiting.

251
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,370
Just have to be lucky enough to find her.

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,490
Where'd you come from, Barry Allen?

253
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,361
I've always been here, Iris.

254
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,569
Are you okay?

255
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,560
Uh, sorry, yeah. That... I was just
thinking of something, and I lost it.

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,047
What's going on?

257
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,168
The Flash and The Rival are going at it
in the Werther building.

258
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,607
Everyone needs to evacuate this area.

259
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,404
I am so sorry, I have to go.

260
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,721
- Really? What...
- Yeah.

261
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,811
Yeah, there's something that I have to do.
This was... Rain check, okay?

262
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,201
Anytime.

263
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,401
Okay, come on.

264
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,962
Yeah, Cap. Come on, I got you.

265
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,130
No, no. Hey, hey, hey. No, no!

266
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,364
I thought I had him.

267
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,966
Wally?

268
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,487
Who the hell are you?

269
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,963
So, this is your base of operations, huh?

270
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,487
Yeah. What were you expecting, a fortress?

271
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,449
Uh, no. You know...

272
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,210
Just something a little more secure.

273
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,171
I mean, you never know who's gonna
come walking through that door.

274
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,641
Yeah, I was just about to say
the same thing.

275
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,921
- Iris! Hi.
- Hi.

276
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,724
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not, I'm...

277
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,082
He showed up
when I was fighting The Rival,

278
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,287
and he already knew who I was.

279
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,006
Is that why you asked me out?
Because my brother is The Flash?

280
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,085
No, no, this is a complete coincidence.

281
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,522
Okay, how'd you know
who I was under the mask?

282
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,442
Uh, I'm CSI, you know?
So, I just put it together.

283
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,041
So, what I don't know is
how you got your speed.

284
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,971
Oh, okay, so before I went on
the straight and narrow,

285
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,925
- I used to drive illegal cars.
- Uh-huh.

286
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,642
I was messing around with a new nitro
formula to get my engine revving faster.

287
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,047
Then, one night,
I'm racing in a thunderstorm,

288
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,651
my car gets struck by lightning!

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,528
And, then, it must have mixed
with the formula, because, boom!

290
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,484
I was in a coma for nine months.

291
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,011
Then when I woke up,
I was the fastest man alive.

292
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,361
The Flash.

293
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,887
More like Kid Flash.

294
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,362
- Don't call me that.
- I call you that.

295
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,483
Okay, how about no one calls me that?

296
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,126
- Hmm.
- So, how did you get involved?

297
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,004
- I'm a reporter for CCPN.
- Uh-huh.

298
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,362
Instead of just reporting on crimes
that are happening in the city,

299
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,846
I decided to do something about it.

300
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,690
Brother-sister crime-fighting unit.

301
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,050
So, does your dad know about you two?

302
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,650
You work with the guy, what do you think?

303
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,044
I think that we need to stop The Rival.

304
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,002
- Yeah.
- Well, we're open to suggestions.

305
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,884
I've been trying to
run him down for months.

306
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,686
No luck. He's fast. Maybe faster than me.

307
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,248
Well, if you're willing,
I think maybe I could help.

308
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,089
There's only one man who can help us now.

309
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,521
Cisco Ramon.

310
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,923
Didn't this used to be S.T.A.R. Labs?

311
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,967
Where have you been the past few years?

312
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,966
Running around.

313
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,448
Cisco Ramon made billions
with his tech apps. Bought the building.

314
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,085
- Billions?
- Yeah.

315
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,487
Cisco Ramon is the richest man in America.

316
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,127
Oh!

317
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,045
Is there a better way to get to work
than by helicopter?

318
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,123
Let me answer that.
Capital "N," little "O."

319
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,446
<i>Quite right, Mr. Ramon.</i>

320
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,529
<i>As for LogicFrame,
it's a relatively small start-up.</i>

321
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,484
The IP's expected to be in the low teens.

322
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,967
Offer them 20 mil.

323
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,727
Huh!

324
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,206
Babe.

325
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,885
I, um, have some business to attend to,
so we'll get on that other matter later?

326
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,764
Not if I get on it first, huh?

327
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,410
Independent woman. I like it. I like it!

328
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,162
Huh. Well.

329
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,209
I told you never to come back here.

330
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,040
I make you a friction-proof suit
so your clothes don't explode at Mach 2,

331
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,288
and you leave me out of your
brother-sister war on crime.

332
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,164
- That was the deal.
<i>- Okay, listen to me.</i>

333
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,010
<i>Mr. Ramon, we need your help!</i>

334
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,770
<i>I'm sure you've seen The Rival on TV.</i>

335
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
He is terrorizing the city
to prove that he's the fastest.

336
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,331
I mean, God only knows
what he's gonna do next.

337
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,205
- We have to stop him.
- Okay, so stop him.

338
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,051
Please, go with God, have fun.
But you know what?

339
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,890
You know what happens
when you mess with a speedster?

340
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,211
That! That's what happens.

341
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,602
You get a vibrating hand
going right through your rib cage.

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,088
No, thanks. My money needs me.

343
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,764
Wait, Cisco, you're not gonna help us?

344
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,522
Oh. That reminds me. Who the hell is this?
Huh?

345
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,123
You brought some stranger into my lab
and told him I helped The Flash?

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,081
- Cisco.
- Uh-uh.

347
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,680
I don't know you, string bean.

348
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,689
String... Mr. Ramon.

349
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,006
Oh. Yes?

350
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,521
I do know what kind of person you are.

351
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,807
Deep down you care
about helping other people.

352
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,406
Please, tell me more.

353
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,769
I heard a story about
how when you were 15,

354
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,248
your brother, Dante, owed a bookie
and he couldn't pay back what he owed,

355
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,284
so you gave him all the money
you earned that summer delivering pizzas

356
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,806
to help him.

357
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,205
How do you know about that?

358
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,084
I have a feeling that we would work
really well together as partners.

359
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Taking down meta-humans together,
I mean, it's what we're supposed to do.

360
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,327
We're a team.

361
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,287
We're friends.

362
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,447
Hey-

363
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,684
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay, I was just...

364
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,247
What was I... What was I just saying?

365
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,641
What is going on with you?

366
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,326
I'm not sure.

367
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,371
And here I was starting to think
you'd forgotten all about me.

368
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,245
But I am forgetting.
What's happening to me?

369
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,126
I was wondering when you'd notice.

370
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,689
It's like I'll be thinking of a
moment from my past and then it vanishes.

371
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,888
I can't get it back. Why?

372
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,128
Flashpoint, it's a side effect.

373
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,766
See, I told you before
you don't know what you're doing.

374
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,962
This new reality you've created

375
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,164
is starting to overwrite the reality
that you and I know.

376
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,609
So your original life,
your friends, your family...

377
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,644
Pretty soon,
all of that will just fade away.

378
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,846
- Why isn't it happening to you?
- Not sure.

379
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,366
Unless...

380
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,166
What?

381
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,407
What?

382
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,250
What the hell is so funny?

383
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,851
Your speed!

384
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,527
What?

385
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,530
The more you use it,
the faster you'll lose your memories.

386
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,046
No. No, you're lying.

387
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,086
You just want me to let you out of here.
That's never gonna happen.

388
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,682
The you I know from the future,
he's not this stupid.

389
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,565
Pretty soon, you won't even remember
that you're The Flash,

390
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,287
and when that happens,
this world will become permanent.

391
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,807
Time will set like concrete

392
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,004
and nothing will be able
to change it back to the way it was.

393
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,206
That's fine by me.

394
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,730
You know what you have to do.

395
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,524
You have to take me back to that night
and let me finish what I started.

396
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,001
You go to hell!

397
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,725
You're taking both of us there!

398
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,085
Now who's the villain, Flash?
Now who's the villain?

399
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,923
Unbelievable.
It's like I'm really there.

400
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,647
Don't do that,
I told you it freaks me out.

401
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,887
It wasn't me.

402
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,840
Who are you?

403
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,883
The man who's gonna help you
stop The Rival.

404
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,407
Barry?

405
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,810
Okay, so, I can tell from the
"I don't believe you" looks on your faces

406
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,644
that you don't believe me.

407
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,280
We believe you're a speedster

408
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,086
but you're gonna have to
explain that part about Flashpoint again.

409
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,046
All right, look.
This is as simple as I can put it.

410
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,969
I'm gonna use this glass, Mr. Ramon, okay?

411
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,167
What?

412
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,211
Imagine that this line is time, okay?

413
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,770
I went back in time, stopped the
Reverse Flash from killing my mom.

414
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,247
In doing so,
I created an alternate timeline,

415
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,484
a whole new existence
where you're Kid Flash...

416
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,569
- "The" Flash.
- Kid Flash.

417
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,807
And Cisco's a billionaire.

418
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,526
So you're saying there's a timeline
out there where I'm not rich?

419
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,609
Boy, that's a glitch in the universe.

420
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,963
No, not buying it. Um, my life is my life.

421
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,811
Didn't just start three months ago, okay?
I've always been me.

422
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,840
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you,
Wally, it's complicated.

423
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,601
Okay, look. Even if we did believe you,
why are you telling us this now?

424
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,289
Because I've been hiding here
for too long.

425
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,164
<i>The Rival needs to be stopped.</i>

426
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,646
I stop the bad guys,
and we can all take him down together.

427
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,080
I can get him myself.

428
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,567
Then why haven't you?

429
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,403
Well, I'm not interested.

430
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,728
I don't know how many times
I gotta tell you freaks,

431
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,684
I already did my bit
for queen and country.

432
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,365
Wait, we're missing something.

433
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,527
Excuse me.

434
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,803
What're you doing? Hey, don't touch that.

435
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,847
Got it...

436
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,327
Oh!

437
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,607
What just happened?

438
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,320
Stop bringing strangers into my lab!
Who is this?

439
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,364
This is Dr. Caitlin Snow.
In my timeline, she's a part of our team.

440
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,483
Did you... You just kidnapped this woman.

441
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,485
No, I didn't... Well, yeah, I guess, I...

442
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,529
She's a scientist, we need her.

443
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,087
I'm not a scientist.

444
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,242
- You're not a scientist?
- I'm an ophthalmologist.

445
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,289
- An eye doctor?
- A pediatric eye doctor.

446
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,721
And we're done.

447
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,366
Okay. Um...

448
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,927
Can I talk to you in private?

449
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,884
Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,246
- Excuse me?
- Hmm.

451
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,930
Have I been kidnapped?

452
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,481
Unclear.

453
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,882
Look, I'm sorry,
I know that this is hard to believe.

454
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,886
No, that's just it, Barry,
I do believe you.

455
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,082
You do? You believe me?

456
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,725
I have a good life.

457
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,929
I have a good job, I love my brother.

458
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,447
But something has been off,
something has been missing.

459
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,446
And that feeling that
something is not right with my life,

460
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,924
that went away the moment that I met you.

461
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,450
We're something else to each other
where you come from, aren't we?

462
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,887
Yes.

463
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,125
What?

464
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,323
It's... It's escaped definition.

465
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,451
But it's love?

466
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,008
Because this is what love feels like.

467
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,083
Since the day that I met you.

468
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,448
Hey... We got something.

469
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,925
Turns out kiddie eye doc here
actually had a good idea.

470
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,329
I have always wondered why no one
turned the speed cameras in the city

471
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,363
to register near-sonic velocities.

472
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,801
Seems like a
ready-built early warning system.

473
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,570
So I reprogrammed the cameras.

474
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,847
Babadook, there's your rival.
The old sawmill out by Williamson.

475
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,491
All right. Follow my lead?

476
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,011
The Flash doesn't follow anyone.

477
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,044
Listen to him, Wally. He's The Flash.

478
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,643
You know, you would be
an excellent candidate for Lasik.

479
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,211
You know how to flank?

480
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,964
People always say that in the movies.
Is that like a thing, "flanking"?

481
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,162
What're you talking about, flanking...
Yes, flanking's a thing.

482
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,365
All right, look. I'm gonna go at him
head on. You attack at a 90-degree angle.

483
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,847
<i>When he turns to fight you,
leaves himself vulnerable to me.</i>

484
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,809
- When he turns to fight me...
- I get him.

485
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,121
Exactly how it should be.

486
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,250
How'd you find this place, Flash?

487
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,283
I'm so gonna kick your ass.

488
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,411
There's two of you now?
Okay, is that supposed to scare me?

489
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,921
Little quaking in your boots
wouldn't be inappropriate.

490
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,885
Well, here's how scared I am of you.

491
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,446
My name is Edward Clariss.
Rivals should know each other's names.

492
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,761
I mean, you might as well tell me

493
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,928
since neither of you
are leaving this place alive.

494
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,167
Who are you?

495
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,928
Me? I'm The Flash.

496
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,251
That's all you need to know.

497
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,445
Well, after I rip that cowl
off your corpse, I'll know who you are.

498
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,082
Just another pretender
who thought they could take me on.

499
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,361
So who wants to meet the Speedforce first?

500
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,641
Hey, stay in position.

501
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,164
I can take him. I got this.

502
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,007
The Flash is taking on The Rival
at Prescott Sawmill.

503
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,243
Get down there, make sure the action
doesn't spill out into the neighborhood.

504
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,367
We can't leave The Flash out there alone.

505
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,361
Whoo!

506
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,043
Wally!

507
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,287
Wally!

508
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,761
Telemetry from the suit
says he's still alive.

509
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,287
Barely.

510
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,364
Hey, hey, hey.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

511
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,284
You're gonna be okay,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

512
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,370
<i>That one was never my rival.
You could be, though.</i>

513
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,251
You wanna find out?

514
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,725
Defeat me, and I'll let you
take your little friend for help.

515
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,603
No, you're the one who's gonna need help.

516
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,281
Goodbye, Flash.

517
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,281
Oh, my God. It's like Twister in there.
The movie, not the game.

518
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,006
Satellite's picking up
two distinct funnel patterns.

519
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,123
Tornados measuring F3
on the Fujita scale.

520
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,049
This guy's like a weather wizard
or something.

521
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,003
Guys, I can't stop him!

522
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,491
<i>Listen to me, Barry.</i>

523
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,322
You said we love each other
in that other life.

524
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,011
If I were your Iris from over there,
I am sure I would know exactly what to say

525
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,241
but I don't.

526
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,004
All I can say is I believe in you,

527
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,043
<i>and you can stop this guy.</i>

528
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,204
Be The Flash, Barry,
because that's who you are.

529
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,051
<i>You're The Flash.</i>

530
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,201
I'm The Flash.

531
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,971
That's impossible.

532
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,282
You really are the fastest man alive.

533
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,926
It's over.

534
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,250
Joe, it's Wally, he needs help.

535
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,763
Wally? Wally! Son!

536
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,681
Son, can you hear me?

537
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,011
<i>Wally's vitals are low,
and he's lost a lot of blood.</i>

538
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,441
He should be rapidly healing.

539
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,523
It's one of the gifts
of being a speedster.

540
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,968
He's not. I'm sorry.

541
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,644
- Am I free to go?
- Mmm-hmm.

542
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,323
This is why I didn't wanna get involved.

543
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,643
Crime-fighting sucks.

544
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,049
I thought I could just make things better,

545
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,326
but everybody's been
paying for my happiness.

546
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,207
Will you help me?

547
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,247
Do what?

548
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,331
Make things right.

549
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,490
Ah...

550
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,921
Oh, I need that.

551
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,844
You don't need that.

552
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,322
<i>- Yes, and this.
- You do not need that.</i>

553
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,727
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

554
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,001
Hey, slugger.

555
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,761
Who's this?

556
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,840
This is Iris.

557
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,769
- It's nice to meet you, Iris.
- Hi.

558
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,206
Can I get you something to drink?

559
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,004
Oh, no, I'm okay. Thanks, Mrs. Allen.

560
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,521
Are you okay, Barry?

561
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,520
Yeah, I just wanted to see you both
one more time.

562
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,364
What does that mean?

563
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,885
Nothing. Nothing. I, uh...

564
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,642
These last three months
have been the best.

565
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,488
Just getting to spend time with you.

566
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:36,570
I just wanted you to know how grateful
I am, to both of you, to be your son.

567
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,485
Barry, you're scaring me.

568
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,246
No. There's nothing to be afraid of.

569
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,281
Promise.

570
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,244
I just love you both.

571
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,807
Phew.

572
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,602
Hey, Barry! Are you okay?

573
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,486
It's getting worse.
We have to hurry before it's too late.

574
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,127
- Okay.

575
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,807
Hey!

576
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,124
<i>Having a bad day, Barr?</i>

577
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,842
Well, if it isn't the future Mrs. Allen.

578
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,282
Barry told me
not to listen to anything you say.

579
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,166
That's just bad advice.
'Cause I'm the answer man.

580
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,485
I am the answer to all your prayers.
All you need to do is ask me, Barry.

581
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,807
We need to go back in time, to that night.

582
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,361
To do what?

583
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,288
You know what I need you to do.

584
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,527
Yeah.

585
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,324
But I wanna hear you say it.

586
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,324
I need you to kill my mother.

587
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,727
With pleasure.

588
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,166
I hate you.

589
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,167
And I hate you. And I sometimes wonder
which of us is right.

590
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,444
It seems weird to wish you good luck.

591
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,530
I'm so sorry about all this.

592
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,210
Will I know when things change back?

593
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,601
Will I feel it?

594
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,529
It'll be like it never happened.

595
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,371
I'll see you soon.

596
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,205
- Barry!
- Get back!

597
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,202
God, I wish I could kill you.

598
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,043
But today, I get to be the hero.

599
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,881
No!

600
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,087
You're not gonna kill her this time.
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

601
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,843
It's okay, it's okay.

602
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,011
I'm not gonna hurt you.

603
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,240
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

604
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,963
You're safe. You're safe now.

605
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,448
Actually, she's not.

606
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,167
Please don't hurt me.

607
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,364
No. No!

608
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,281
No!

609
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,885
There we go.
Things are back to how they should be.

610
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,804
Well, for me, anyway. For you...

611
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,806
Well, I guess
you'll just have to wait and find out.

612
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,963
What? What does that mean?

613
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,164
See you sometime soon, Flash.

614
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,641
What's this for?

615
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,410
Just glad you're here.

616
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,207
Are you okay?

617
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,001
Whoa...

618
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,043
Yeah, I am now. Yeah.

619
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,845
You just lost your father, Barry,
you don't have to be okay.

620
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,207
Actually, I feel closer to my parents
than I ever have.

621
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,245
Well, good, son.

622
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,131
- To your pops.
- To Henry.

623
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,691
To my dad.

624
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,041
Where's Iris?

625
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,767
That ain't funny.

626
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,286
I'm gonna chalk that up to grief.
I'll see you both in the morning.

627
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,201
What was that about?

628
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,046
Are you kidding me?
You know Iris isn't here.

629
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,201
What?

630
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,131
They don't talk, Barry. You know that.

631
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,122
Oh, God, What did I do?

632
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,404
<i>Clariss. Clariss!</i>

633
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,090
Who's there?

634
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,687
<i>It's time to wake up.</i>

635
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:45,711
