1
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,460
There's only one here.

2
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,420
They were forged as a pair.

3
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:26,298
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

4
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:27,550
Elsewhere?

5
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,928
Like where?

6
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:48,822
Kamala! Are you
doing your homework, <i>beta?</i>

7
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,741
Yeah! Science!

8
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,210
Boom!

9
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,296
<i>Enter, Kamala Khan.</i>

10
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,631
<i>Ready for...</i>

11
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,551
{\an8}<i>Captain Marvel.</i>

12
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,845
<i>She needs my help.</i>

13
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,431
<i>Shine on, baby.</i>

14
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,145
Ugh! Why are hands
so hard to draw?

15
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:21,816
{\an8}<i>Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time,</i>

16
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,693
{\an8}<i>'cause even the Avengers
need backup, ya know?</i>

17
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,235
<i>Wham! Kapow!</i>

18
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:30,158
<i>This is my chance!</i>

19
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,162
<i>Pow!</i>

20
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,832
<i>Boom!</i>

21
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,543
Not bad, kid.

22
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:42,588
What's your name?

23
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,090
Ms. Marvel.

24
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,174
Dude.

25
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,342
Twinsies!

26
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,679
Hey, you wanna go party
with the Avengers?

27
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,514
Uh... Yeah!

28
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,975
Oh, uh, can you fly?

29
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:57,019
No, but, um, I can do this!

30
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,271
<i>Kamala!</i>

31
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,190
<i>Don't make me come up there!</i>

32
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,611
That does not sound
like science to me.

33
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:05,695
Okay.

34
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,640
<i>You don't remember anything?</i>

35
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,642
<i>I see...</i>

36
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:35,226
<i>flashes.</i>

37
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,522
<i>Little moments.</i>

38
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,733
<i>If I could just piece together
what happened that morning,</i>

39
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,986
<i>maybe it'll all make sense.</i>

40
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:56,750
<i>You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.</i>

41
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,084
Lieutenant Trouble.

42
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,003
Higher, further, faster, baby.

43
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,087
That's right.

44
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:04,175
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

45
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:06,844
<i>The war, the lies.</i>

46
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,847
- All of it.
- You can't do this.

47
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,557
I'll be back before you know it.

48
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,434
I could fly up
and meet you halfway.

49
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,977
Oh, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

50
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,181
Come here, Goosey.

51
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,435
<i>Incoming call from Nick Fury.</i>

52
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,980
Oh. You expecting a call?

53
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,566
Maybe we just send it
to voice mail.

54
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,154
Nick Fury,

55
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,824
<i>my favorite one-eyed man
of intrigue.</i>

56
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,033
<i>Carol Danvers.</i>

57
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,160
Prodigal child of the Milky Way.

58
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,371
How goes it out there?

59
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,123
Thriving.

60
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,167
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

61
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,293
- <i>Goose?</i>
- Yeah.

62
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,087
<i>What about you?</i>

63
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,338
How are you doing?

64
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,882
What do you know about the surge

65
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,925
in the jump point system
a few hours ago?

66
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,803
I didn't notice
anything unusual.

67
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,471
I'll take a look now.

68
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,765
<i>It rattled the whole system.</i>

69
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,432
We're trying to get a handle
on what happened.

70
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,976
<i>The entire network was affected?</i>

71
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,561
Yeah. End to end.

72
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,813
Thankfully,
our neural network team

73
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,901
was able to trace the origin
back to MB-418.

74
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,485
<i>You're in the neighborhood,
right?</i>

75
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,569
Yeah.

76
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,238
Can you check it out?

77
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,116
- I'm on it.
- <i>Appreciate you.</i>

78
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,162
<i>Monica and her team will send
more intel as they acquire it.</i>

79
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:51,746
Monica? Wha...

80
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,831
What's she doing there?

81
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:53,916
I thought that she was on Earth.

82
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,793
- <i>Is she okay?</i>
- Yeah.

83
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,796
And she's not
that little kid you remember.

84
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,774
<i>So, do we think that we can
finish this before dinner?</i>

85
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,651
<i>Yeah. I don't think
we're gonna fix it in time</i>

86
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,945
<i>to get a reading
on the jump point.</i>

87
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:25,615
<i>But I do know someone
with superpowers who could.</i>

88
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,076
<i>Oh.</i>

89
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,662
<i>Fine. I'll go.</i>

90
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:31,747
<i>You guys head in and check
the status of the network.</i>

91
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:34,875
<i>We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.</i>

92
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,252
<i>Aye, aye, Captain.</i>

93
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:07,619
Fury,

94
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,454
<i>I think I found something.</i>

95
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,664
Communications override.

96
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,001
Captain Rambeau. Spacewalk.

97
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:15,085
<i>Connected.</i>

98
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:16,795
Rambeau,

99
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,380
<i>what the hell are you doin'?</i>

100
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,924
<i>Seems the surge has had
some residual effect</i>

101
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,467
<i>on the jump point.</i>

102
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,219
<i>I'm gonna get you
some readings, Fury.</i>

103
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:25,345
<i>Mon...</i>

104
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:27,014
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Monica.</i>

105
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:28,181
<i>Hello?</i>

106
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,690
Was that Monica?

107
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,526
<i>Aunt Carol?</i>

108
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:39,611
Fury, was that Monica?

109
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:40,820
Why, you wanna talk to her?

110
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,490
<i>I... I don't think
I'm in the best...</i>

111
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,243
<i>position to... I... I don't...</i>

112
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,577
<i>I don't wanna...</i>

113
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,662
<i>Look...</i>

114
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,205
<i>I don't wanna
talk to her like this.</i>

115
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:52,291
- <i>Not after all this time.</i>
<i>- You know,</i>

116
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:53,834
eventually you're gonna
have to talk to her.

117
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:54,919
<i>I know.</i>

118
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,045
<i>I know, but</i>

119
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:58,339
<i>let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.</i>

120
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,434
I think I found
the source of the surge.

121
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:11,394
What are you seeing?

122
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:16,650
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

123
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:18,694
it's stuck.

124
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:19,861
<i>Danvers.</i>

125
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:34,920
Danvers.

126
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,130
Danvers!

127
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:45,305
<i>The jump point's
still leaking energy.</i>

128
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,932
<i>- Captain Rambeau?
- Hello?</i>

129
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,018
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Monica.</i>

130
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,195
<i>Beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:03,116
<i>Ah.</i>

132
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:04,493
<i>Ooh.</i>

133
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:35,275
<i>Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!</i>

134
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,824
<i>Stop spinning, stop spinning,
stop spinning, please!</i>

135
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,876
<i>It's Nick Fury! Hey!</i>

136
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,211
<i>How did you... Oh, wow.</i>

137
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,130
<i>I'm Kamala Khan.</i>

138
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,090
<i>No, sorry, I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.</i>

139
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:59,634
<i>But I'm from Jersey City and I...</i>

140
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,928
<i>Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.</i>

141
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,138
<i>Is this an Avengers test?</i>

142
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,849
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

143
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:36,422
Um...

144
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,507
Hi.

145
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,219
Really good living room.

146
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,221
Huh?

147
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:43,763
- Kamala?
- Kamala?

148
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:53,566
What did you do to me?

149
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,776
- What is Dar-Benn doing?
- It's too late.

150
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:58,029
The Supremor's
already on Tarnax.

151
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:00,824
You can't stop this.

152
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,075
Watch me.

153
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,050
Fury. It's the Kree.

154
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,011
They're going after
the Skrulls on Tarnax.

155
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:23,264
<i>Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.</i>

156
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:24,391
<i>This is a peace</i>

157
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:25,767
- <i>and reconciliation tour.</i>
- Fury.

158
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,727
- I got this.
- <i>Carol...</i>

159
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,900
So, I switched with
someone named Kamala Khan?

160
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:35,193
Yeah. She seemed to be
as confused as you are.

161
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:37,446
Well, there's nothing in her
power-set about teleportation.

162
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,614
Enough about her.

163
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:41,367
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

164
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,701
Yes, sir. Uh...

165
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:45,538
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

166
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:47,707
I did not break
my closet door, okay?

167
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,874
I was in space.

168
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:50,709
Oh, so it broke itself?

169
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,545
No, no, no, no, no.
See, I disappeared.

170
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:54,588
So maybe
Captain Marvel broke it.

171
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,465
- What?
- Yes,

172
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,176
your friend, Captain Marvel.

173
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,178
She was walking up and down
our living room,

174
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,388
and now you come back,

175
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,056
waltzing in with no apologies.

176
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,267
I'm sorry, Captain Marvel
was in our house?

177
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,312
Is Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way?

178
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,731
Look, I understand
that she's an important figure

179
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:13,276
and all that, but you don't
have to do as she says.

180
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,445
No, no, they're
clearly working together.

181
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,529
Look at her face.

182
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:17,613
- Look at her smile.
- Aamir, stop it.

183
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,698
She's being
super secretive as always.

184
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:19,783
Aamir,
stop picking on your sister.

185
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:20,867
- Look at her.
- Muneeba.

186
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,327
Kamala, are you lying again?

187
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,412
Just tell me
if you're involved or...

188
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,496
My daughter
has said she's not lying.

189
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,581
- Kamala.
- Looks like

190
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:26,664
- she's having so much fun.
- Muneeba...

191
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:28,374
- She's bad at keeping secrets.
- Oh, my God! It's happening!

192
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:38,677
<i>Approaching Tarnax.</i>

193
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:44,183
<i>Warning.</i>

194
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,810
<i>Kree ship detected.</i>

195
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,780
This is not what we agreed,
Dar-Benn.

196
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:37,073
Supremor Dar-Benn.

197
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:39,409
The Skrull have been scattered

198
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,662
to every corner of the universe.

199
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,914
Made refugees wherever we go,
and still,

200
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:49,794
we came into these
negotiations in good faith.

201
00:14:49,877 --> 00:14:51,712
I hear you, Dro'ge.

202
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,675
I, perhaps more than anyone,

203
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:57,135
understand what you and
your people have been through.

204
00:14:57,719 --> 00:15:00,055
After my predecessor
was destroyed,

205
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:02,975
heretics rose up
to fill the void.

206
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,771
The Civil War
has polluted our skies.

207
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:08,565
My people cannot breathe.

208
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,569
Our sun is dying.

209
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,238
Hala is out of time.

210
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:17,991
I hope we can rebuild together.

211
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,993
So much so that I'm willing to put

212
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,245
our ancient animosities behind us.

213
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,083
And give you a chance
to protect your people.

214
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,211
To stop running.

215
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,050
The Skrull will take their rightful place

216
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,344
in the Kree Empire.

217
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,389
And I will aid in their relocation.

218
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,225
- Relocation?
- What?

219
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,644
- What?
- What is the meaning of this?

220
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,273
I would hate
for your people to suffocate

221
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:50,025
when I strip the atmosphere.

222
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,213
It's the Annihilator!

223
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,647
Oh, my God!

224
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:38,450
What the hell is going on?

225
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:40,202
Yes, what the hell is going on?

226
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,079
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

227
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:43,331
I don't know
if that's my new power.

228
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:44,582
And then this freaking cat
ate a man.

229
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,708
How can a cat eat a man, Kamala?

230
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:46,793
I don't know.
It has tentacles

231
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:47,920
- and it ate a man.
- What tentacles, Kamala?

232
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,046
- I don't know.
- Where are the tentacles?

233
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,380
It comes out of his mouth,
and they're...

234
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:51,882
Oh, my God!

235
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:52,966
Oh!

236
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,885
Oh, my God,
it's happening again!

237
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,977
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Kamala, who are they?

238
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,106
Please run.

239
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:12,029
How did you get here,

240
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:13,530
and how're you involved in this?

241
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,115
The Kree jury-rigged
a wormhole on MB-418.

242
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,200
You mean like a jump point?

243
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:19,661
I don't know.
But I touched it and then I...

244
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:20,829
Why'd you do that?

245
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:22,581
Because it was glowing
and mysterious.

246
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:24,458
Okay, new rule,
no more touching shit.

247
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,001
Especially glowing, mysterious shit.

248
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,670
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you

249
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,129
and I don't like it.
That's not the point.

250
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,632
The point is, is that it was
siphoning off the atmosphere.

251
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:32,967
And it did this!

252
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,635
Scissors beat paper.

253
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,680
Fury! There was, like, energy
that went around my hand.

254
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:37,889
Focus.

255
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:39,475
Okay, maybe if I do this.

256
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,691
Annihilator.

257
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,901
I don't like that name.

258
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,354
- Friends of yours?
- Hi.

259
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:51,050
Annihilator!

260
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:12,864
Annihilator!

261
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:46,359
Aamir, get him!

262
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,861
Get him! Hit him!

263
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,628
Yusuf! Oh!

264
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,141
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

265
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,533
Kamala, are you okay?

266
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:39,915
Fury!

267
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,708
I think I'm getting teleported

268
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,128
whenever I channel
any kind of radiant ener...

269
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,799
I think I switch
when I use my powers.

270
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,050
Strong theory.

271
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,268
Strong theory.

272
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:01,855
Our tests keep
generating the same result.

273
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,815
With each new jump point,

274
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:06,359
this band becomes more unstable.

275
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:08,904
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

276
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,625
Oi.

277
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,045
Hi, again.

278
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,007
So sorry about earlier.

279
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,717
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

280
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,636
Did I get in?

281
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,472
Is this the new iPad?
I haven't seen it yet.

282
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:13,556
They wish!

283
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,724
- All right. Come on, let's go.
- I know.

284
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,268
Wait, if this is
all top secret information,

285
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:18,604
- why is it on a clear case?
- Uh, well...

286
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,229
...just swipe it

287
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:21,313
a little bit...
Whoa, whoa.

288
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:22,649
- Hi. Okay.
- Can you believe it?

289
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,651
They have intel on me.

290
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:25,860
On me!

291
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,780
I am intel.

292
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,783
Look at you!

293
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,910
Hey, what does, um,
S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

294
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:34,828
Uh, Strategic Aerospace
Biophysics

295
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:36,247
and Exolinguistic Response.

296
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,456
That's classified.

297
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:38,833
Sorry.

298
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,252
"Hard Light powers," yes.

299
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:42,336
- "Noor..."
- Okay,

300
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,880
but why do you have
intel on her?

301
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,757
Is there some sort
of surveillance on us?

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,050
"Surveillance" is a strong word.

303
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,218
Well, ma'am,

304
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:51,013
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

305
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,848
So, of course
we would have intel

306
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,517
on someone like her.
And you're also

307
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,101
electromagnetically altered.

308
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:57,394
What does that mean?

309
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,854
Oh, it just means
that we both have

310
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:01,690
light-based powers.

311
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:04,234
What's your...
What's your code name?

312
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,695
Oh, I don't have a code name.

313
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:07,279
- We'll workshop it.
- No, thank you.

314
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,240
Aunt Carol... Mmm.

315
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:11,992
Captain Marvel
also has light-based powers.

316
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:13,536
It's probably not a coincidence.

317
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,665
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact

318
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:19,000
with some malfunctioning
jump points.

319
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:21,503
I still cannot believe
that Captain Marvel was here

320
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:22,671
and I didn't even
get to meet her.

321
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:23,755
You know,
we're supposed to be all,

322
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,840
like, "twinsies!" you know.

323
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:27,134
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

324
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:28,427
I don't know, I would just
give her the letter

325
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,512
that I wrote for her

326
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:31,514
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

327
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,517
Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

328
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:38,187
I said that Captain Marvel

329
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,106
can absorb light energy.

330
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:41,524
I can see it.

331
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,860
And you, you can turn light

332
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:45,528
into physical matter.

333
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:46,988
Which I have never heard of.

334
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,698
- But my working theory...
- I could totally show you.

335
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,367
No!

336
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:54,413
What the...

337
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,459
Hi.

338
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:00,419
Hi.

339
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:04,423
Nah, they don't seem related.

340
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:05,675
Whatever, Yusuf.

341
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,220
- Families are complicated.
- Hmm.

342
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:11,306
Uh, Monica, you wanna fill Carol in

343
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,058
on your working theory?

344
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,726
Yeah. Um...

345
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,686
Hi, Captain Marvel.

346
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:20,982
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

347
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:22,234
You too.

348
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,903
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

349
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:27,114
Right. Sorry.

350
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:31,702
So, what's new?

351
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:33,163
- Where's my sister?
- Yeah.

352
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:35,957
I'm thinking that our joint exposure

353
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,583
to these unsteady jump points

354
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,754
and our susceptibility
to electromagnetic energy

355
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:42,964
has temporarily entangled our world-lines.

356
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,341
Yeah, that, right there.

357
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,760
- Uh...
- Entanglement.

358
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:48,971
Our light powers are entangled.

359
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,890
So, we switch places whenever
we use them at the same time.

360
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,975
- Which would mean Kamala...
- When did you get powers?

361
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:56,937
I walked through
a radiation shielding barrier

362
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:59,356
of a witch hex and now
I can manipulate and see

363
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,442
all wavelengths of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

364
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:02,526
I'm very happy for you.

365
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,945
Yeah.

366
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:06,364
- Where's our daughter?
- Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

367
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:07,615
Wherever you were.

368
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:08,991
- Where were you?
- Who's Kamala?

369
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:11,328
The third person we're switching with.

370
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:13,246
Light powers. Teenage girl.

371
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,915
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?

372
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:16,166
What are you doing?

373
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:17,793
I'm trying to switch.
Why isn't it working

374
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,044
- when I need it to work?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

375
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,129
- Danvers, Danvers!
- Hey!

376
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:21,464
- So confused.
- Please tell Kamala

377
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:22,798
that her <i>Abu</i> is very upset.

378
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,592
Where are we going
and why are we going there?

379
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:27,345
- Carol!
- Carol, where you going?

380
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:38,732
Oh, my God!

381
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,108
- Uh-oh!
- Monica...

382
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:41,568
- Mmm-hmm?
- ...you gotta fly.

383
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:42,944
No, no, no. I...

384
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:44,154
I mean, I know.

385
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,822
But technically,
I haven't done that yet!

386
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:47,366
Yeah, well, you got to now

387
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:49,660
or Kamala's not gonna graduate
from high school.

388
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,036
Come on! Use your core!

389
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:55,916
Oh, jeez.

390
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,878
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

391
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,860
I got you! I got you!

392
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:22,862
I got you!

393
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,446
Oops!

394
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,177
Hold on!

395
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:46,929
What is happening?

396
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,931
I can't hold on to you
while I'm flying.

397
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:53,686
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

398
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,229
- We're gonna die!
- Hold on!

399
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,190
Hold on! I'm thinking,
I'm thinking!

400
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:59,442
Wait, I have an idea.

401
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:00,652
Grab on to me!

402
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:06,033
This had better work!

403
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,912
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

404
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,670
Okay, no powers,
no powers. Just...

405
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,309
Who are they?

406
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:34,980
They are associates
of Captain Marvel.

407
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,235
The Annihilator is here?

408
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:40,569
Yeah, well, she was.

409
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:43,030
And then these two
just sort of appeared.

410
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,323
What about the band?

411
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:45,992
If she's meddling,
I need to strike now.

412
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,202
Yeah. I still can't
account for the instabilities

413
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:49,537
exhibited on MB-418.

414
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:51,581
This thing does much more
than just...

415
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:52,832
But it works?

416
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,961
Yes. Yes.
But if you give me more time,

417
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:57,796
- I can make it safer.
- No.

418
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,798
No. We do it now.

419
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,092
Before the Annihilator appears.

420
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:22,864
Uh, what should we do about...

421
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,741
these two?

422
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,340
You.

423
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:44,053
Hold that thought.

424
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,961
We gotta get
that band off of her.

425
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,379
It looks like mine.

426
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,089
Guys!

427
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,810
I can't fly.

428
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,439
Do you guys have a spaceship
I could borrow or...

429
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,023
Kamala, don't talk to them.

430
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,650
You know my name!

431
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,872
The Kree came here hopeful

432
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,375
that we could build
a covenant of peace.

433
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,501
What have you done?

434
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,337
But then you sic the Annihilator on us.

435
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,508
Like we're vermin.

436
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:05,139
Once again, the Skrull
have betrayed the Kree.

437
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,391
And for that...

438
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:35,045
Carol, we gotta get
these people out of here.

439
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,089
Emperor Dro'ge,

440
00:30:37,173 --> 00:30:39,383
you need to evacuate your people now.

441
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,012
We have nowhere to go.

442
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,164
Carol, the ships...

443
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:12,961
they're not gonna make it.

444
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,881
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

445
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:18,508
- But I can help.
- Now.

446
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:16,403
- Let's go.
- Where's Kamala?

447
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,158
Kamala!

448
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,296
No!

449
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,391
Let's go, let's go!

450
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:55,986
Come on!

451
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:57,488
Keep moving,

452
00:32:57,572 --> 00:32:59,157
please, please.

453
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:03,829
All these people, they're gonna...

454
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,163
- Come on, sweetie.
- No! How can you

455
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,332
- just leave them here?
- Kamala, now!

456
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:08,208
We need to save who we can.

457
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,459
<i>Transmission sent.</i>

458
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:57,593
Hey.

459
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,178
This peace treaty,

460
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,222
it was a good thing.

461
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:04,684
- It was a ruse.
- If it were,

462
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,437
your intervention failed.

463
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:11,108
We don't need your help anymore.

464
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:16,113
I called a friend.

465
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:17,657
She can find a safe place for you.

466
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,243
Is that okay?

467
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:22,662
We have no choice.

468
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,207
Incoming.

469
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,391
Are you all right?

470
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:48,731
Thank you again.

471
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:50,692
Always.

472
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:53,070
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

473
00:34:53,153 --> 00:34:54,237
It is unintentional.

474
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:56,531
Oh, I've been on some
unintentional teams myself.

475
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:59,117
- I know, but...
- You can stand tall

476
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:00,827
without standing alone.

477
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,622
Take it from me, Marv.

478
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:13,924
Hey.

479
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,885
Captain Marvel will fix this.

480
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,013
I promise.

481
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:34,697
Thank you.

482
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,494
May our next meeting be joyful.

483
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:23,540
Breathe.

484
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,680
Do you remember?

485
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:42,018
When the sun used to shine on Hala?

486
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:45,855
<i>How beautiful our home was?</i>

487
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,235
<i>Before her?</i>

488
00:36:56,407 --> 00:36:58,368
<i>Before the Annihilator.</i>

489
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:02,539
<i>I was there.</i>

490
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,006
<i>I heard her lies,</i>

491
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:14,010
<i>claiming she was there to set us free.</i>

492
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:18,724
<i>But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence,</i>

493
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,393
<i>she destroyed the Kree.</i>

494
00:37:28,484 --> 00:37:32,113
For 30 years, I have been
fighting alongside you.

495
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:35,115
Not only have
I brought you peace,

496
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:39,203
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

497
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:41,288
Supremor!

498
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,374
Supremor!

499
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,962
We need more power
than that band can provide

500
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:49,797
if we're to reignite our sun.

501
00:37:50,382 --> 00:37:51,716
That amount of energy...

502
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:53,218
Well, it would kill you.

503
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:55,721
If my life is the cost, so be it.

504
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,681
We will find the other
in time, Suprem...

505
00:37:57,765 --> 00:37:59,392
There is no more time.

506
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,104
Hala is out of time.

507
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,879
Need a hand?

508
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,717
Yeah.

509
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:45,774
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

510
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,529
Wow.

511
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,658
So you can do that because you
walked through a witch hex?

512
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:56,201
Yep.

513
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:57,494
When I got blipped back,

514
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:59,871
they weren't sending us
to space anymore.

515
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:03,084
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

516
00:39:03,668 --> 00:39:05,044
That must have been hard.

517
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:06,253
Your mom told me that you

518
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:08,256
always dreamed of going to space.

519
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,632
That you had something to prove.

520
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,718
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

521
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:13,971
What?

522
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:15,723
When you left,

523
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:19,477
you said you'd be back
before I knew it.

524
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:24,815
I meant what I said.
I just, I didn't know

525
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,651
what I was getting myself into.

526
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:30,237
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

527
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,158
A little girl that hung
on your every word.

528
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:39,581
If you knew...

529
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:42,792
I was going to come back.

530
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,127
I just...

531
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,796
There was people that needed me.

532
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:49,383
We needed you, Carol.

533
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:09,654
Hey.

534
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:10,738
I hope you don't mind.

535
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:12,073
I didn't have any other clothes.

536
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:13,784
It's totally fine.

537
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,326
Looks good on you.

538
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:19,206
I, um...

539
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:21,625
I'm really sorry

540
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:22,834
for the way I spoke to you.

541
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:25,797
Thank you.

542
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,302
I know that this situation isn't ideal,

543
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:33,221
but it is actually nice

544
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,891
having people on board again.

545
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:39,978
It gets pretty lonely out here.

546
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,189
Anytime you need company,
I will be there.

547
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,773
I will drop everything. I will...

548
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:45,233
I will drop high school.

549
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,819
Don't do that.

550
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,029
But can we start again?

551
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,492
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

552
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,579
I am Kamala Khan.

553
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,581
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City,

554
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,499
I go by Ms. Marvel,
and I hope that's okay,

555
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,793
like, copyright-wise.
Because, honestly,

556
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,086
I never thought
I'd ever get to meet you.

557
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,170
But now that it's happening

558
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,339
and we're, like, touching each other...

559
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,132
I've realized I should
have asked permission.

560
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:08,968
So,

561
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,595
twinsies.

562
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,515
Okay. All right.

563
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,476
Here's what we're gonna do.

564
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,560
Captain Marvel.

565
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,644
You need to stop calling me that.

566
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:19,729
I used to change your diapers.

567
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:20,813
Oh, that was once.

568
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,356
And then I was told you
proceeded to vomit everywhere.

569
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,234
First of all, it's my ship,
so I make the game plan.

570
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,319
Oh, I'm sorry. When's the
last time you led a team?

571
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,822
- As early as last week.
- Goose doesn't count.

572
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,282
Please. You try giving Goose orders.

573
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:32,367
Oh, my God, we're a team?

574
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,451
- We're not...
- Oh, no, no, no,

575
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,577
- we're not a team.
- We're not a team.

576
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,206
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City,

577
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,708
am on a team with Captain Marvel

578
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,585
and Captain Monica Rambeau,

579
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:44,171
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

580
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:47,299
- Professor Marvel.
- Oh!

581
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:49,301
Professor Marvel.

582
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:51,304
No. No, no, she...
she will not.

583
00:41:51,388 --> 00:41:53,097
- But thank you.
- The Marvels.

584
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:55,183
Now that we've got that
out of the way, team,

585
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,351
I've been trying to tell you,

586
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,436
I think I know how she's
making the weird jump points.

587
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:00,605
She has one of these.

588
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:02,982
It's my <i>nani's</i> bangle.

589
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:05,610
It started glowing really weirdly

590
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:08,238
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also,

591
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:11,324
it once traveled me
through space and time,

592
00:42:11,408 --> 00:42:13,118
so that's probably related.

593
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,913
What you're describing
is a Quantum Band.

594
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:17,706
I mean, I knew
there were two of these.

595
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,792
I just did not expect
the other one to be in space.

596
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:23,171
They're a pair? How do
you have a Quantum Band?

597
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,714
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

598
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:27,091
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.

599
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:28,885
It's an ancient artifact.

600
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:32,639
So this is what
Dar-Benn found on MB-418.

601
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:33,724
And then her and Kamala

602
00:42:33,808 --> 00:42:35,392
just happened to stumble into each other?

603
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:37,269
I mean, what are the chances?

604
00:42:37,352 --> 00:42:39,271
"What you seek is seeking you."

605
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:41,731
It's inscribed on the bangle.

606
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:43,775
If the Kree legends are true,

607
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,610
the Quantum Bands
were used to create

608
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:47,780
every jump point in the universe.

609
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:48,989
Teleportation network.

610
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:53,244
Two Quantum Bands working
in unison to connect the galaxy.

611
00:42:53,328 --> 00:42:54,620
So that would explain

612
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:56,790
our switch-y entanglement situation.

613
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:59,835
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

614
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:02,504
She must be overloading it
with the energy

615
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:04,047
from her space hammer thingy.

616
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:05,216
It's called the Universal Weapon.

617
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,718
Oh, really?
I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

618
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:10,012
Either way, she's using it to force

619
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:11,931
unstable jump points into the grid.

620
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:15,017
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

621
00:43:15,477 --> 00:43:17,686
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

622
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,106
Okay. To where?

623
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,984
- To the stars?
- Okay.

624
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:25,570
It's fine. Got a plan.

625
00:43:26,613 --> 00:43:27,614
We will use this.

626
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,867
- Is that...?
- A Skrull torture device.

627
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,244
And, wait, we put it on our heads?

628
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:36,081
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

629
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:38,000
I've been using it

630
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,461
to regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

631
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:42,713
Still?

632
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:44,173
Yeah.

633
00:43:44,257 --> 00:43:46,050
But, you know,
it has a lot of other uses.

634
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:47,886
It's safe.

635
00:43:48,387 --> 00:43:49,846
You might wanna get comfortable.

636
00:43:56,686 --> 00:43:58,855
<i>Whoa! This is weird.</i>

637
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:01,191
<i>Wait. Go back.</i>

638
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,196
<i>Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.</i>

639
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,700
<i>It's like you gave her power
to use against you.</i>

640
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:12,245
<i>Kamala?</i>

641
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:15,165
<i>Hmm. What about this?</i>

642
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:16,875
<i>There! Those coordinates.</i>

643
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,209
- <i>Can you read that?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

644
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:20,003
<i>The Magellanic Galaxy.</i>

645
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,173
All right,

646
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:24,341
the pilot seat's all you.

647
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:27,553
<i>Is that you, Monica?
You're so cute!</i>

648
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:30,056
<i>No, wait.</i>

649
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,223
<i>Carol, what are you doing?</i>

650
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:36,437
Why'd you ask me to come, Maria?

651
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:37,813
<i>Mom.</i>

652
00:44:39,606 --> 00:44:41,067
The cancer's back.

653
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,445
So I need you to take care of Goose.

654
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:47,699
- No.
- What do you mean "no?"

655
00:44:47,782 --> 00:44:49,576
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

656
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:50,743
Carol...

657
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:53,496
- I'm not taking the cat.
- It's not a cat.

658
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:57,418
It should've been you that day.

659
00:44:58,293 --> 00:45:00,296
That stupid race to the hangar.

660
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:02,673
I never wanted to be Captain Marvel.

661
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:05,844
Captain Rambeau suits me just fine.

662
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:08,930
And it's just until Monica gets back.

663
00:45:11,474 --> 00:45:12,725
She blipped.

664
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:14,227
<i>Carol, I don't wanna relive this.</i>

665
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,603
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

666
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:21,651
<i>Stop now, please, Carol!</i>

667
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:23,695
Remember why you're out there.

668
00:45:23,778 --> 00:45:25,030
I'm looking for a patient in room 104.

669
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:26,406
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

670
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,158
And remember to come home.

671
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,452
<i>Your mom, she died, honey.</i>

672
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:32,747
No. No, no, no!

673
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:38,586
Never do that again.

674
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,546
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

675
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,757
Wait, so your mom...

676
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,342
Passed away while I was blipped.

677
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:46,220
And when I came back,

678
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:48,138
no one was there.

679
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,937
Okay.

680
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:04,781
Thank you.

681
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,203
She seemed really cool. I'm sorry.

682
00:46:10,745 --> 00:46:11,954
She was.

683
00:46:12,455 --> 00:46:13,623
She was the best.

684
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:19,087
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

685
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:22,216
Here is what we do know.

686
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,343
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

687
00:46:24,427 --> 00:46:25,719
is a system of wormholes

688
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:26,845
through the space-time continuum

689
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:28,138
aka, jump points,

690
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:30,933
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

691
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:33,394
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

692
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:34,770
without rupturing the continuum.

693
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:37,982
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

694
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:40,276
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

695
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,736
and then... earthquake.

696
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:46,241
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

697
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,327
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

698
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,788
Question is, what does she want?

699
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:54,166
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

700
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:56,419
so maybe the attack was a warning?

701
00:46:56,502 --> 00:46:58,671
So, she could be after
another former colony?

702
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:00,340
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

703
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:02,050
At one point, the Kree colonized

704
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,635
25% of the galaxy, so...

705
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,721
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

706
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:09,349
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

707
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:10,475
Why a jump point?

708
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:12,310
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

709
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:13,644
they're means of transportation.

710
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:15,480
Every jump point has two sides,

711
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:17,941
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

712
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:20,777
- it had to go somewhere, or...
- Hala.

713
00:47:22,904 --> 00:47:23,906
The Kree Civil War

714
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,533
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

715
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:27,702
The air is barely breathable,

716
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:28,786
they're suffering from a drought.

717
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,871
A drought?

718
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:32,081
So, she could be after water next.

719
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:34,876
Okay. Where in the Magellanic
can we find...

720
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,378
Aladna.

721
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,090
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

722
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:43,009
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

723
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:46,388
Yeah.

724
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:48,098
Uh... Uh, yeah.

725
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:52,394
She said that really weird.

726
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:53,479
Yeah. Why are you being weird?

727
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:56,357
Okay. Consensus on Aladna.

728
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,153
- Aye.
- Yeah, I say we do it.

729
00:48:00,236 --> 00:48:03,114
Get to Aladna and separate
Dar-Benn from that bangle.

730
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,908
We have our heading.

731
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:09,538
<i>Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.</i>

732
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:12,374
<i>Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.</i>

733
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,459
It's just "Fury." God.

734
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:16,587
Wait. Where are you guys?
Where is <i>Abu?</i>

735
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:24,720
Hell?
So that means I'm the devil?

736
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:27,515
- <i>Really, Fury?</i>
- They insisted,

737
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:30,142
and your dad is not adjusting
very well to space travel.

738
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:32,770
Hey, babe, so I'm in
this crazy space elevator

739
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:34,022
and we're going up.

740
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:37,442
Or maybe we're going down. Uh...

741
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:38,860
<i>Are there directions in space?</i>

742
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:40,195
<i>Yes, there are.</i>

743
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:41,530
But no filming.

744
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:43,240
Oh. Okay.

745
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:45,284
Help me.

746
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:47,453
Whoa.

747
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:57,047
<i>Fury, everything okay?</i>

748
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,339
We've had another surge.

749
00:48:58,422 --> 00:49:00,424
Reports are coming in
across the network.

750
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:02,134
It seems everyone's been affected.

751
00:49:02,218 --> 00:49:04,929
<i>Well, we need to stop
her from making another one,</i>

752
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,473
and we can't risk
intergalactic body swapping

753
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:07,557
in the meantime.

754
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:09,309
<i>Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry,</i>

755
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:11,019
<i>but your daughter will have
to stay aboard my ship</i>

756
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:12,104
<i>until we can get to the bottom of this.</i>

757
00:49:12,187 --> 00:49:13,814
- Oh, no, no, no.
<i>- Yes!</i>

758
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:15,273
<i>You will let her go.</i>

759
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,694
Mrs. Khan, uh, it is not that simple.

760
00:49:18,777 --> 00:49:20,363
We need Kamala.

761
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,490
<i>Ammi, we found</i> Nani's <i>other bangle,</i>

762
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:23,574
<i>and there's this weirdly beautiful</i>

763
00:49:23,658 --> 00:49:24,659
<i>but kind of terrifying woman</i>

764
00:49:24,743 --> 00:49:25,744
<i>using the other one to hurt people.</i>

765
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:26,828
<i>And we have to stop her.</i>

766
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:28,162
<i>You're telling me
there's another bangle.</i>

767
00:49:28,247 --> 00:49:31,000
<i>And they're going to use
that bangle to hurt you?</i>

768
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,167
Monica will take care of her.

769
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:33,668
<i>We will. And we will make sure</i>

770
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,462
<i>she gets back home in one piece.</i>

771
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:36,671
<i>I promise.</i>

772
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:38,382
<i>Stay the course.</i>

773
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:40,925
<i>We'll figure out how to close
those jump points.</i>

774
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:43,553
Kamala, you listen to me.

775
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:44,972
<i>If anything happens to you,</i>

776
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:48,142
<i>You tell her that.</i>

777
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,479
<i>I love you,</i> beta.

778
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:52,563
I love you more.

779
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:53,814
Wait, what did she just say?

780
00:49:53,898 --> 00:49:54,941
Nothing.

781
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:58,695
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel,

782
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:00,238
and nobody gets more grief for it.

783
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:03,409
Trust me. Kamala is
in good hands with Carol.

784
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,165
What's wrong with that cat?

785
00:50:10,082 --> 00:50:11,626
It's acting very weird.

786
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,503
Also, Mr. Fury,
she's looking little pudgy.

787
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:16,755
I think you're overfeeding her.

788
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:19,508
Goose.

789
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:24,847
Goose!

790
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,226
Firefly? Night Light.

791
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,062
Countess Marvel. Mistress Marvel?

792
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:31,521
- Doctor Marvel?
- That's too much.

793
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:32,856
Doctor Bright.

794
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,108
Mmm... Professor Marvel.

795
00:50:35,192 --> 00:50:37,027
Nova, Supernova Girl...

796
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,362
- Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
- You're doing too much.

797
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:40,531
Vision! Oh, wait. No. Sorry.

798
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:42,658
How many times do I have to
tell you guys, I do not want

799
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:44,660
- or need a code name?
- Why?

800
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:47,413
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

801
00:50:47,497 --> 00:50:48,582
Wanna figure out
the switching thing?

802
00:50:51,168 --> 00:50:53,794
Powers stay activated
after a switch. Good to know.

803
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,964
Okay, everyone together on three.

804
00:50:56,047 --> 00:50:58,299
Ready? One, two, three, go.

805
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,303
Now, why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

806
00:51:01,386 --> 00:51:02,721
I'm aware.

807
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:09,979
Now.

808
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:11,731
Now.

809
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:12,815
Now.

810
00:51:13,232 --> 00:51:14,234
One, two, three!

811
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:17,904
She gave me eyes.

812
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:23,201
Now. Now.

813
00:51:23,284 --> 00:51:24,870
Can you hold on for one second?

814
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:26,913
Walk. And switch!

815
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:28,124
Ooh!

816
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,084
Switch!

817
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,960
Oh, oh, oh.

818
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:34,921
Hey, I got this!

819
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:43,430
Yes!

820
00:51:46,518 --> 00:51:47,519
And switch!

821
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:51,231
That's why you wanna
invest in index funds

822
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:52,732
rather than in individual stocks.

823
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:55,277
Of course, both a Roth IRA and 401k

824
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,362
are important for tax purposes.

825
00:51:57,445 --> 00:51:59,740
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

826
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:01,367
Hey, it's never too late.

827
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,576
And it's never too early,

828
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,869
like I say.

829
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:05,579
- How old are you?
- 306.

830
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:07,373
- Huh?
- Wow. Same age.

831
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:12,670
<i>Ya Allah!</i>
What was that?

832
00:52:12,753 --> 00:52:14,380
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please.

833
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,632
<i>Foreign object in sector K.</i>

834
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:18,927
- Sweet Svartalfheim.
- Don't touch it.

835
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,305
What is it?

836
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,140
I haven't the foggiest idea.

837
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,225
How did it get in there?

838
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,351
I don't know.

839
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,479
Should we tell Fury?

840
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,441
<i>Twenty seconds</i>

841
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:33,651
<i>to the jump point.</i>

842
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,278
Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

843
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,488
Like, I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

844
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,074
Also, is it too late
to go to the bathroom?

845
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,408
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

846
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,702
No one would believe me.
Like my...

847
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:43,787
Nakia, she would never... Whoa!

848
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:41,514
Okay. Here we go. Comms.

849
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,266
Wow!

850
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:44,476
I've always wanted one of these.

851
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,769
Thank you.

852
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:47,479
Testing.
Testing, one, two, three.

853
00:53:47,562 --> 00:53:48,730
Kamala. Kamala.

854
00:53:48,813 --> 00:53:50,983
We hear you, baby. Thank you.

855
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:55,154
So, uh, real quick
before we get sucked in...

856
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:56,280
What the hell is that?

857
00:53:56,864 --> 00:54:00,243
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

858
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:03,078
Well, you do know you're
famous everywhere, right?

859
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:04,496
This one's kinda different.

860
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,916
I helped the prince with a legal issue.

861
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:08,000
Okay.

862
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,335
Mmm-hmm. Let's go.

863
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:10,461
No matter what,

864
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:11,712
follow my lead.

865
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:14,049
Aladnean culture is very specific.

866
00:54:14,132 --> 00:54:16,551
So, there's gonna be a bit
of a ceremony we have to do,

867
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:18,011
but just... stay cool.

868
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:20,306

00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:39,284
<i>So excited that you're home</i>

<i>Our princess is home</i>

877
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:45,290
Princess?

878
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:52,047
It's a technicality.

879
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,215
Carol. What is happening?

880
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:54,592
Their language is Song.

881
00:54:54,675 --> 00:54:56,219
Most of them won't understand
you unless you sing.

882
00:54:56,302 --> 00:54:57,345
Come on.

894
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:22,913
I am dancing.

Wow.

899

Oh, my gosh, give me
some of what they're having.

900
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,725
- If you tell anyone about...
- What?

901
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:43,477
That you're a pretty, pretty princess?

902
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:45,896
So, that's what you meant

903
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,149
when you said "legal issue."

904
00:55:48,232 --> 00:55:49,566
Mmm. It is a marriage of convenience.

905
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:51,277
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

906
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,738
It's like, there was a power struggle.
Matriarchal society.

907

- We are friends.
- Mmm-hmm.

It's a long story.

909
00:55:57,574 --> 00:55:59,035
Maybe you could sing it.

910
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,245
Maybe not.

At best, a one-off pest problem.

At worst, an enemy plant.

970

Some kinda infestation bioweapon.

971
00:59:04,732 --> 00:59:07,151

{\an8}Oh, my God.

978
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,797
What about Lady of Light?

979
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:29,508
- Ooh. Frequency.
- No.

980
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:30,592
- Pulsar.
- No.

981
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:31,969
Pulsar Light Lady.

982
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:34,179
Absolutely not. These...
These are too much, right?

983
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:35,264
- Definitely.
- No.

984
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:47,818
We make this quick.
Nothing grandiose.

985
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:50,530
You three need to disappear.
But stay close.

986
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:51,614
My specialty.

987
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:59,790
This will work, Yan.

988
01:00:02,043 --> 01:00:03,044
Remember, we wanna keep

989
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:04,628
unintentional switching to a minimum.

990
01:00:05,379 --> 01:00:07,548
Entertain her as long as you possibly can.

991
01:00:07,632 --> 01:00:09,216
Monica and I will get the jump on her.

992
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,301
And we'll get the bangle.

993
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:15,140
It's time.

994
01:01:16,747 --> 01:01:19,791
Supremor, why have you come?

995
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,168
I've come here to pardon you

996
01:01:22,253 --> 01:01:24,546
for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

997
01:01:25,297 --> 01:01:26,382
Kneel.

998
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:27,800
To you?

999
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:29,927
Hmm.

1000
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:32,263
- I will never kneel.
- Okay.

1001
01:02:00,709 --> 01:02:01,836
Damn it!

1002
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,361
Use your scarf.

1003
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:45,716
Go!

1004
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:55,977
I found her.

1005
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:14,162
Monica, where are you?

1006
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:21,795
Monica, tag me in.

1007
01:03:21,879 --> 01:03:23,214
<i>One, two...</i>

1008
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:25,133
Don't do this.

1009
01:03:25,216 --> 01:03:26,635
You're too late.

1010
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,010
Where did you get that?

1011
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,056
My grandma,
she sent it to me in the mail.

1012
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,725
- Give it to me.
- Kamala, run.

1013
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,436
Get to the ship.

1014
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:31,995
With this,
your powers only make me stronger.

1015
01:04:56,312 --> 01:04:57,313
The surges are frying our systems.

1016
01:04:57,396 --> 01:04:58,982
Are we doing something about these?

1017
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:00,274
The space elevator's offline.

1018
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:01,735
You ever come in here with good news?

1019
01:05:03,194 --> 01:05:04,904
Half the evacuation pods just went down.

1020
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,116
That's not good news.

1021
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:41,986
<i>Are you guys in?</i>

1022
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:43,112
In.

1023
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:46,699
Redirect all fighters.

1024
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:59,672
Disengaging autopilot.

1025
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:07,637
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1026
01:06:11,725 --> 01:06:12,726
Monica?

1027
01:06:14,895 --> 01:06:16,772
Monica, we're going down,
Monica!

1028
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,485
I thought you could drive this thing!

1029
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:22,696
Carol! Get down here.

1030
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,197
<i>Hold that thought.</i>

1031
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,282
Can you believe this woman?

1032
01:06:31,914 --> 01:06:33,999
O, Captain! My Captain!

1033
01:06:42,675 --> 01:06:44,969
- No, no, no, no!
- Move over.

1034
01:06:54,187 --> 01:06:55,814
I'm activating a jump point.

1035
01:06:55,897 --> 01:06:56,898
No, I can lose her.

1036
01:06:56,982 --> 01:06:58,316
And what about the other 20 ships?

1037
01:06:58,399 --> 01:06:59,401
I can do this.

1038
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:06,325
<i>Missile lock.</i>

1039
01:07:06,408 --> 01:07:08,327
- Guys?
- <i>Missile lock.</i>

1040
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:19,882
<i>Incoming missiles.</i>

1041
01:07:19,965 --> 01:07:21,634
- <i>Impact in five...</i>
- We need to leave now.

1042
01:07:21,717 --> 01:07:22,717
I can't let this happen again.

1043
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,801
- It already has.
- <i>...four, three, two...</i>

1044
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:24,886
I can do this.

1045
01:07:24,969 --> 01:07:26,221
And you'll kill us trying.

1046
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:27,722
<i>Jump point activated.</i>

1047
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:49,954
We left Aladna
to fend for themselves.

1048
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:51,498
Dar-Benn was
gonna get my bangle.

1049
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:53,793
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

1050
01:07:53,876 --> 01:07:55,169
Don't try to be like me.

1051
01:07:55,252 --> 01:07:56,837
I messed this whole thing up.

1052
01:07:56,921 --> 01:07:57,963
If we weren't entangled,

1053
01:07:58,047 --> 01:08:00,049
if we weren't here, then
you could have beat Dar-Benn.

1054
01:08:00,132 --> 01:08:01,258
And I'm sorry.

1055
01:08:03,552 --> 01:08:05,971
No, you don't understand.

1056
01:08:06,055 --> 01:08:09,684
The Kree had been ruled
by an AI for a millennia

1057
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,143
that led them into a war.

1058
01:08:11,227 --> 01:08:14,480
And I thought the only way
to stop it was to destroy it.

1059
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:16,566
But I just

1060
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:18,777
made it worse.

1061
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,321
I'm the reason why

1062
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:22,906
the civil war started
in the first place.

1063
01:08:22,989 --> 01:08:25,826
I'm the reason why
they couldn't breathe the air.

1064
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:28,412
That's how I got the name Annihilator.

1065
01:08:30,164 --> 01:08:33,125
And I never wanted you to see
that version of me.

1066
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:38,590
Is that why you never came back?

1067
01:08:39,173 --> 01:08:40,632
I thought if I fixed it,

1068
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,969
then I could come home.

1069
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:44,846
Carol.

1070
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,976
That's not how family works.

1071
01:08:50,643 --> 01:08:54,356
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

1072
01:08:56,108 --> 01:08:57,651
I just wanted you.

1073
01:08:59,445 --> 01:09:00,779
My aunt.

1074
01:09:06,452 --> 01:09:08,204
I'm really glad that you're here now.

1075
01:09:15,295 --> 01:09:16,796
And you, too.

1076
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,424
I'm glad to be here.

1077
01:09:20,216 --> 01:09:21,676
I hope that goes without saying.

1078
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,138
And I am sorry

1079
01:09:24,221 --> 01:09:26,348
for coming on too strong at the beginning.

1080
01:09:26,431 --> 01:09:28,267
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

1081
01:09:33,564 --> 01:09:34,940
We have to find her.

1082
01:09:35,024 --> 01:09:36,651
I mean, but she could be anywhere.

1083
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:39,070
No, not anywhere.

1084
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,198
She's targeting the people
that I care about

1085
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:44,993
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

1086
01:09:45,786 --> 01:09:47,704
We have to warn Fury.

1087
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:55,837
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

1088
01:09:55,921 --> 01:09:57,798
<i>All S.A.B.E.R. personnel must report</i>

1089
01:09:57,881 --> 01:10:00,176
<i>to an evacuation pod immediately.</i>

1090
01:10:00,259 --> 01:10:01,343
<i>Walk. Do not run.</i>

1091
01:10:01,427 --> 01:10:03,012
We only have one evacuation bay online.

1092
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:04,263
Which means that all we have left

1093
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:06,724
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods

1094
01:10:06,808 --> 01:10:08,268
which seat five, 10, if we squeeze.

1095
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:10,187
- It's nowhere near enough.
- Well, fill the remaining ones

1096
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:11,688
with as many people as you can,

1097
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:13,065
then come up with a Plan B.

1098
01:10:13,148 --> 01:10:14,191
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

1099
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:15,275
<i>All S.A.B.E.R...</i>

1100
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:26,663
No, no, no.

1101
01:10:27,581 --> 01:10:29,373
- Aamir. Go help them.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1102
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:33,502
I got this.

1103
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:39,175
My living room.

1104
01:10:39,593 --> 01:10:41,177
Goose?

1105
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,067
Goose, how'd you...

1106
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,654
Come here. Come. Come on.

1107
01:10:58,738 --> 01:11:01,491
Yes. Yes. Come here. Look at you.

1108
01:11:02,242 --> 01:11:04,202
Oh. Look!

1109
01:11:04,786 --> 01:11:05,787
Oh, no, not my good eye!

1110
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,164
Whoa!

1111
01:11:07,998 --> 01:11:09,708
We only have
one escape pod left.

1112
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:11,292
We're doomed.

1113
01:11:12,961 --> 01:11:14,379
In the end,

1114
01:11:14,796 --> 01:11:17,215
none of us choose how
we transition from this life

1115
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:19,050
to the next.

1116
01:11:19,134 --> 01:11:20,927
What? No!

1117
01:11:21,012 --> 01:11:23,639
Get everyone
to the evacuation deck. Now!

1118
01:11:30,772 --> 01:11:32,565
Here, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1119
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:34,359
What are we doing?

1120
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:36,569
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1121
01:11:36,654 --> 01:11:38,030
Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1122
01:11:38,572 --> 01:11:40,699
- I can't. Can you?
- I got it.

1123
01:11:43,661 --> 01:11:45,413
What is going on, fam?

1124
01:11:45,914 --> 01:11:46,915
Kamala?

1125
01:11:47,498 --> 01:11:49,042
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

1126
01:11:49,124 --> 01:11:51,919
- <i>Ya Allah.</i>
- Kamala! Kamala!

1127
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:54,963
You're back safely, <i>beta.</i>

1128
01:11:55,047 --> 01:11:56,257
You're not dead.

1129
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,259
I've lost contact with Earth.

1130
01:11:58,342 --> 01:12:00,637
We're officially at abandon-ship phase.

1131
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:06,268
Spit him out.

1132
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:07,644
- Spit him out.
- No, no, no.

1133
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:09,271
No. That's the plan.

1134
01:12:10,564 --> 01:12:11,941
- That's the plan?
- It's much easier

1135
01:12:12,024 --> 01:12:15,486
to transport a family of cats
than hundreds of crew members.

1136
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:17,405
So, we're literally herding cats?

1137
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,161
Come here, kitty.

1138
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:26,247
<i>Attention, S.A.B.E.R. crew.</i>

1139
01:12:26,331 --> 01:12:29,250
<i>Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.</i>

1140
01:12:29,334 --> 01:12:31,752
<i>You will be fine.</i>

1141
01:12:42,139 --> 01:12:43,140
<i>S.A.B.E.R. crew.</i>

1142
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:46,185
<i>Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.</i>

1143
01:12:47,353 --> 01:12:48,771
<i>Stop running.</i>

1144
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:04,580
I'm sorry.

1145
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,463
<i>Stop running
and let the Flerkens eat you.</i>

1146
01:13:12,546 --> 01:13:14,923
<i>Stop running.</i>

1147
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:37,239
Guys, I found her.

1148
01:13:38,408 --> 01:13:40,618
- Come on. Come on, move.
- Hey! Come on.

1149
01:13:40,701 --> 01:13:41,827
Come on, come here.

1150
01:13:42,412 --> 01:13:43,412
Whoa!

1151
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:45,623
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

1152
01:13:45,706 --> 01:13:47,917
- Go to the spacecraft bay.
- Okay. Come on. <i>Chalo, Chalo.</i>

1153
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,127
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

1154
01:14:04,185 --> 01:14:07,146
Nope. No. No, no, no.
Thank you. No.

1155
01:14:08,147 --> 01:14:09,566
Come, come, come.

1156
01:14:17,282 --> 01:14:18,325
Don't you worry, little one.

1157
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:20,828
Here, go to Kamala. Go to Kamala.

1158
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:25,332
There you go, come, come.

1159
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:27,250
- I found Dar-Benn.
- What?

1160
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:29,419
She wants our sun.

1161
01:14:57,032 --> 01:14:58,075
<i>You leavin' again?</i>

1162
01:14:58,951 --> 01:15:00,034
Yeah.

1163
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:02,121
<i>Ammi,</i> the universe isn't safe.

1164
01:15:02,204 --> 01:15:03,288
And if the universe isn't safe,

1165
01:15:03,372 --> 01:15:04,373
that means you guys aren't safe.

1166
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:05,875
And if you guys aren't...

1167
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,584
Listen to me.

1168
01:15:08,293 --> 01:15:11,964
You are chosen
for a greater purpose, okay?

1169
01:15:12,047 --> 01:15:14,008
So, of course you must go now.

1170
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:17,720
But I will never let you go.

1171
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:20,306
You understand that, right?

1172
01:15:24,936 --> 01:15:26,772
- Yeah.
- Come back safely, <i>beta.</i>

1173
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,734
You better. I don't
wanna be an only child.

1174
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,111
Not again. Not with these two.

1175
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,617
You think it's wise taking
that bangle to the bad guy?

1176
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,952
Yes. Mr. Fury's right. Give it to me.

1177
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,037
I will take it home.

1178
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,122
Dar-Benn's opened another jump point,

1179
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,375
and we're gonna need
both bangles to close it.

1180
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,043
Then I guess you'd better
make damn sure

1181
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:48,503
she doesn't get her hands on it.

1182
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:50,630
Understood.

1183
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:10,277
Oh, God, Mr. Fury,

1184
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,986
you are going in the wrong direction!

1185
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,488
Mrs. Khan, I know!

1186
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:19,619
- You did it, Mr. Fury!
- I didn't do anything.

1187
01:16:23,373 --> 01:16:24,499
Are you praying?

1188
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:27,544
Don't stop! We need
all the help we can get!

1189
01:16:28,838 --> 01:16:29,839
Amen!

1190
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:32,174
Amen!

1191
01:16:32,257 --> 01:16:33,634
Holy cow!

1192
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:35,970
- Mr. Fury!
- Whoa!

1193
01:17:28,568 --> 01:17:29,694
There she is,

1194
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,488
the Annihilator herself.

1195
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:34,031
It's over, Dar-Benn.

1196
01:17:34,407 --> 01:17:35,658
No, not yet.

1197
01:17:35,741 --> 01:17:38,286
I know that you would do
anything to protect Hala.

1198
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:40,622
This will be the end of the Kree.

1199
01:17:40,705 --> 01:17:42,248
It will be the end of everything.

1200
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:45,627
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

1201
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:49,714
Now, give me the band.

1202
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:52,134
You're forgetting something.

1203
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:54,053
- What?
- Me.

1204
01:18:08,444 --> 01:18:11,446
This could have been so much easier.

1205
01:18:12,113 --> 01:18:14,700
I don't know. I like our odds.

1206
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,704
You're living up to your name again.

1207
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,248
I didn't want this.

1208
01:19:40,332 --> 01:19:42,125
Death seems to follow you.

1209
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,052
It doesn't have to end
like this, Dar-Benn.

1210
01:19:51,135 --> 01:19:52,387
Please, just give us the bangle.

1211
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,471
I won't!

1212
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:57,851
Hala's sun died because of you.

1213
01:19:57,935 --> 01:19:59,519
Why shouldn't you repay us?

1214
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:02,731
Maybe she should.

1215
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,194
The reaction in your
sun's core has slowed.

1216
01:20:07,277 --> 01:20:09,654
It needs an incredible amount
of energy to jump-start it,

1217
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:11,573
and that's what you have, Carol.

1218
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:15,494
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1219
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:18,998
But I've never done anything
like that before.

1220
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:20,166
In the last couple of days, I have done

1221
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,085
a lot of things I have never done before.

1222
01:20:23,795 --> 01:20:25,004
You got this.

1223
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:31,887
For Hala.

1224
01:20:36,684 --> 01:20:38,060
For Hala.

1225
01:20:55,954 --> 01:20:57,956
Try anything and I'll kill her
faster than you can move.

1226
01:21:01,377 --> 01:21:03,629
Carol!

1227
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:08,968
No!

1228
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,402
You won't survive this.

1229
01:21:25,485 --> 01:21:28,071
Dar-Benn, listen to me.

1230
01:22:12,201 --> 01:22:13,328
Are you okay?

1231
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:15,663
Yeah.

1232
01:22:17,123 --> 01:22:18,583
I didn't switch.

1233
01:22:19,084 --> 01:22:20,085
One, two, three.

1234
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,780
I'm so glad you're okay.

1235
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:49,866
You got the bangles.

1236
01:22:52,244 --> 01:22:54,329
We're gonna need those.

1237
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,498
Ooh...

1238
01:22:56,582 --> 01:22:58,792
Okay, come on, Princess.

1239
01:23:04,382 --> 01:23:06,300
So, what are we looking at?

1240
01:23:06,384 --> 01:23:09,178
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass

1241
01:23:09,262 --> 01:23:10,889
and non-Newtonian topology.

1242
01:23:12,766 --> 01:23:15,768
She tore a hole in space-time.

1243
01:23:18,354 --> 01:23:21,775
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

1244
01:23:22,233 --> 01:23:23,485
Can we even fix that?

1245
01:23:23,568 --> 01:23:25,320
In theory, you and Carol

1246
01:23:25,404 --> 01:23:26,947
can reproduce
the same amount of energy

1247
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:28,073
that was used to open it.

1248
01:23:28,157 --> 01:23:29,992
I will absorb it and then release it,

1249
01:23:30,075 --> 01:23:31,493
but from inside the tear.

1250
01:23:31,577 --> 01:23:33,203
But what about the switching?

1251
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:35,790
Our, um, powers
aren't entangled anymore.

1252
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:37,708
Oh.

1253
01:23:39,252 --> 01:23:41,672
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1254
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,675
But, wait. You want us to blast you

1255
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:46,176
with the same amount of power

1256
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,804
that punched a hole
in the fabric of space-time?

1257
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:52,141
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

1258
01:23:53,266 --> 01:23:54,267
Monica...

1259
01:23:55,936 --> 01:23:57,145
You're gonna need this.

1260
01:24:05,613 --> 01:24:06,864
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1261
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:11,035
These bangles traveled
through space and time.

1262
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:12,412
To find me.

1263
01:24:14,581 --> 01:24:15,833
I was born for this.

1264
01:24:20,045 --> 01:24:21,589
It has to be now.

1265
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:26,469
<i>Bismillaah.</i>

1266
01:25:03,967 --> 01:25:05,511
Your mom would be proud.

1267
01:25:06,428 --> 01:25:08,054
Higher, further, faster.

1268
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,308
Higher, further, faster.

1269
01:26:09,953 --> 01:26:12,039
It's closing, Monica.
You've got to get out of there.

1270
01:26:12,122 --> 01:26:14,792
I can't leave, Carol.

1271
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,251
<i>What? What do you mean?</i>

1272
01:26:16,335 --> 01:26:17,503
I can't leave.

1273
01:26:17,587 --> 01:26:18,963
I have to finish the job.

1274
01:26:19,046 --> 01:26:20,923
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

1275
01:26:21,549 --> 01:26:22,675
It's okay.

1276
01:26:40,235 --> 01:26:41,487
Come on.

1277
01:26:45,282 --> 01:26:47,201
Always knew I would have to stay.

1278
01:27:55,315 --> 01:27:57,108
Ka... Kamala. <i>Beta.</i>

1279
01:28:02,823 --> 01:28:04,616
Kamala, you saved the world.

1280
01:28:09,872 --> 01:28:11,583
- Why are you crying?
- <i>Beta?</i>

1281
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:12,917
Why are you crying?

1282
01:28:17,422 --> 01:28:18,590
What happened?

1283
01:28:19,924 --> 01:28:21,467
We lost Monica.

1284
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:26,973
She got stuck on the other side.

1285
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:28,891
And Carol?

1286
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:34,272
<i>She went to fulfill a promise.</i>

1287
01:29:58,946 --> 01:30:00,155
How are things?

1288
01:30:00,573 --> 01:30:02,741
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

1289
01:30:03,534 --> 01:30:05,203
And a team of scientists
are being sent to Hala

1290
01:30:05,286 --> 01:30:06,412
to try and help their people.

1291
01:30:06,495 --> 01:30:08,039
That's not what I meant.

1292
01:30:31,438 --> 01:30:32,439
This says "Kitchen,"

1293
01:30:32,523 --> 01:30:34,734
but there are all these
hot sauce packets...

1294
01:30:34,817 --> 01:30:37,987
And then there's this
very bizarre-looking tray,

1295
01:30:38,071 --> 01:30:41,074
which I will say is
a very good quality, though.

1296
01:30:41,157 --> 01:30:43,243
- Oof. You can keep it.
- Oh, no, no, Carol, I just...

1297
01:30:43,326 --> 01:30:44,327
Where else would they go?

1298
01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:46,287
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

1299
01:30:46,372 --> 01:30:48,290
The vastness of it just gives you

1300
01:30:48,374 --> 01:30:50,626
a whole new perspective on life.

1301
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:52,543
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1302
01:30:52,627 --> 01:30:54,004
And it was surprisingly cool.

1303
01:30:57,048 --> 01:30:59,885
This place is amazing.

1304
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,553
Yeah, it is.

1305
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:04,431
Hey, do you still fly that thing?

1306
01:31:05,266 --> 01:31:06,517
- You wanna check it out?
- I do.

1307
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,644
All right.

1308
01:31:07,727 --> 01:31:08,853
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1309
01:31:08,936 --> 01:31:10,980
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1310
01:31:11,063 --> 01:31:14,192
Oh, I'm so happy that
you're home safe, <i>beta.</i>

1311
01:31:14,276 --> 01:31:15,277
Okay.

1312
01:31:21,158 --> 01:31:22,159
Aamir,

1313
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,287
this would be a lovely house

1314
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:25,955
to raise a family in, you know?

1315
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:28,833
Aamir.

1316
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:30,959
This is so cool.

1317
01:31:31,043 --> 01:31:32,545
Pilot seat's all you.

1318
01:31:42,055 --> 01:31:43,389
Let's fly this thing.

1319
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:45,809
I actually don't have the key.

1320
01:31:45,892 --> 01:31:47,727
I'm just looking after it.

1321
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:51,356
Just until Monica gets back?

1322
01:31:52,316 --> 01:31:53,483
Yeah.

1323
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:56,946
Just until Monica gets back.

1324
01:31:57,488 --> 01:31:59,031
I really miss her.

1325
01:31:59,657 --> 01:32:01,742
We were good together.

1326
01:32:01,826 --> 01:32:04,204
Which got me thinking...

1327
01:32:15,924 --> 01:32:18,719
Pizza delivery.

1328
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:21,054
Whew!

1329
01:32:22,264 --> 01:32:23,390
Okay.

1330
01:32:29,647 --> 01:32:31,273
Can I help you?

1331
01:32:31,358 --> 01:32:32,734
Kate Bishop.

1332
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:38,073
Did you think you're the only
kid superhero in the world?

1333
01:32:39,908 --> 01:32:41,368
- Well, I'm 23.
- Oh, I know.

1334
01:32:42,536 --> 01:32:43,662
I've been reading up on you.

1335
01:32:44,747 --> 01:32:45,747
Where did you get that?

1336
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:47,332
I found it in my couch.

1337
01:32:47,707 --> 01:32:48,708
Okay.

1338
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:50,878
You've just become part
of a much larger universe.

1339
01:32:52,337 --> 01:32:56,049
Which, at the moment,
is just me, mostly.

1340
01:32:56,133 --> 01:32:57,134
I do have feelers out, though.

1341
01:32:57,218 --> 01:32:58,219
Did you know Ant-Man
had a daughter?

1342
01:32:58,302 --> 01:32:59,303
What do you want?

1343
01:32:59,387 --> 01:33:01,014
I'm putting together a team.

1344
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,891
And I want you on it.

1345
01:33:04,475 --> 01:33:05,477
Hmm.

1346
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,981
Please?

1347
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,139
Mom?

1348
01:36:21,392 --> 01:36:22,728
Mom?

1349
01:36:24,395 --> 01:36:26,231
- Mom!
- "Mom"?

1350
01:36:26,315 --> 01:36:28,317
I've missed you so much!

1351
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,651
You missed me?

1352
01:36:29,735 --> 01:36:32,363
- I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
- Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1353
01:36:32,446 --> 01:36:33,530
Hey, hey, look at me.

1354
01:36:33,614 --> 01:36:35,031
It's okay. You're okay.

1355
01:36:35,115 --> 01:36:36,825
Hey.

1356
01:36:36,908 --> 01:36:39,119
How's our mysterious visitor?

1357
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:41,455
She seems a little disoriented.

1358
01:36:41,538 --> 01:36:44,166
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1359
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:46,460
We were hoping you could tell us.

1360
01:36:47,378 --> 01:36:49,797
All we know is that Binary found you.

1361
01:36:49,881 --> 01:36:54,219
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1362
01:36:54,302 --> 01:36:57,014
You are now in a reality
parallel to your own.

1363
01:36:57,765 --> 01:37:00,267
Which is, of course, impossible.

1364
01:37:03,187 --> 01:37:05,731
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1365
01:37:05,814 --> 01:37:07,734
Confusion is but the first step

1366
01:37:07,817 --> 01:37:09,068
on the journey to knowledge.

1367
01:37:09,152 --> 01:37:11,738
Okay. I'll take it from here.

1368
01:37:11,821 --> 01:37:14,114
Charles asked for an update.

1369
01:37:15,574 --> 01:37:17,285
I'll come by and check on you later.

1370
01:37:28,547 --> 01:37:29,840
Who are you?

1371
01:37:31,216 --> 01:37:33,177
Oh, shit.
