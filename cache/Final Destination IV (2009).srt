1
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,999
Tell me again, why we chose
this over seeing the movie.

2
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,414
If these guys lose focus
for even a millisecond

3
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,278
you have to scrape them off the fence
with a shovel.

4
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:22,198
A shovel.

5
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,704
You come hoping to see a crash?

6
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:26,971
No, I would like to see them complete...
Of course it's to see a crash.

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,702
You're sick, ok.

8
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:29,864
Come on!

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,557
Look, here comes Nick with our stuff.

10
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:42,004
Hey, bud.
There he is.

11
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:45,064
Hi, babe.
Hey.

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,854
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,934
Time to lay off the Funyuns, Nicky boy.

14
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:53,862
Oh, thanks, buddy.

15
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:55,603
Great.

16
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,689
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:58,278 --> 00:01:59,811
Here. Want a drink?

18
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,067
Is that straight up Jack?

19
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:02,671
It's his buddy Jim.

20
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:04,529
Maybe later, yeah?

21
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,766
Hey, sport.

22
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,394
Can my girl use your binoculars?

23
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,008
Well, they're not really binoculars exactly.
They're more...

24
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,359
Drink as much as you like.

25
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:20,874
Go, go, go.

26
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,097
Hey.

27
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:33,145
Thanks for making me
take a study break.

28
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:34,763
I really, really needed this.

29
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,414
Excuse me. Pardon me.

30
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:49,430
That was a close call.

31
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,255
Well, great. What did I just miss?

32
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,746
Can you see, madam?

33
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,169
I'm sorry, not really.

34
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,375
Would you like me to move down a bit?

35
00:02:58,739 --> 00:02:59,739
Would you mind?

36
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,513
Be glad to.
Thanks, man.

37
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,462
Thank you.

38
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,540
And I thought chivalry was dead.

39
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,591
That's not true.

40
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,352
I have my cowboy right here.

41
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,384
Get a room, guys.

42
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:17,519
Hey.

43
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,344
Put these in.

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,911
Oh, Mom, not tampons.
Put these... Put them in.

45
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:22,399
Nick.

46
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:23,729
Nick.

47
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,174
This tickles.
Mom.

48
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:30,174
No, no, no.
She put tampons in their ears.

49
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:32,079
That's just wrong, man.

50
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:33,344
I can't see now.

51
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,077
Hey! Down in front, asshole.

52
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,967
Approaching the halfway point.

53
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,080
There goes the neighborhood.

54
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:50,970
Sir.

55
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,763
I need you to move your foot.

56
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:54,797
Thank you.

57
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,112
Hey, how old is this place?

58
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,119
You got me.

59
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:15,869
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.

60
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:17,662
Tire up.

61
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,156
What's that?

62
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:55,852
Is it safe to sit here?

63
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,697
Of course. There's a fence there.

64
00:04:57,722 --> 00:04:58,442
We're fine.

65
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,168
Relax.

66
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,092
Did you feel that?

67
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,843
Just now, right here.

68
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,736
You ok?

69
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,171
I...

70
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,078
felt something touch me.
Something...

71
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:53,885
strange.

72
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,421
On your tires, go, go.

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,855
Come on, come on, come on.

74
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:10,525
Two's good.

75
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,317
Go, go, go.

76
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,395
No, no, no, wait!
The screwdriver! Shit!

77
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,597
Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!

78
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,411
Come on.

79
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:10,962
Move!

80
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,429
Go. Get the fuck out of here.

81
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:26,559
Come on.

82
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,914
Boys, wait!

83
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,020
Come on, Mom.

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,867
Mom!

85
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,709
Hey!

86
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,722
Hey! There's an exit this way!

87
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,736
Come on, move.

88
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:11,896
Hunt!

89
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:12,793
Janet!

90
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:15,858
Let's move.

91
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:17,610
Come on.
There's an exit over here!

92
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:18,543
Come on!

93
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,965
Come on, come on!
This way!

94
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:22,709
Run!

95
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,960
Lori!
Move!

96
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,957
Come on! Lori come on!

97
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,830
Get out of here!

98
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:36,942
Move! Push through!

99
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,638
Come on!

100
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,605
Hey? What the hell?

101
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,425
Are you ok?

102
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,849
Nick, is there something wrong?

103
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,822
Oh, my God, is that straight-up Jack?

104
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,782
No, no, it's his...
His buddy Jim.

105
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,842
You have been in my stash.

106
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:10,569
You snake.

107
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:13,396
A cowboy in a hat. He sits here.

108
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:14,208
Excuse me.

109
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:15,608
Pardon me.

110
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,267
Cowboy.

111
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,009
Tampons. She gets tampons.

112
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:24,026
She puts them in her kids' ears.

113
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:24,677
Who?

114
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,301
Her, right there.

115
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,180
Hey?

116
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:28,400
Put these in your ears.

117
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,152
Oh, Mom, not tampons.
Put them in your ear.

118
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
Hey, how did you know
she was gonna do that?

119
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,282
That's a lot of tampons for one woman.

120
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,026
Nick?

121
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,441
Nick?

122
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,025
What's going on?

123
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:43,279
Down something. Down.

124
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,571
Down in... Down in front, asshole.

125
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,531
Down in front, asshole.

126
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,711
There goes the neighborhood.

127
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:55,541
Sir.

128
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:57,851
I need you to move your foot.

129
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,538
Thank you.

130
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,893
Let's go.
Move it.

131
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,239
Go. Pick up the tire.

132
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,454
That's the car that's gonna crash.

133
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,306
We have to get out of here.

134
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:11,711
Thank God.

135
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,284
What? No, no. I got $500 on this race.
No one cares about...

136
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,394
We got to get the fuck out of here.

137
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,104
Ok. There's something going to happen.
We're all gonna die, alright.

138
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,006
There's gonna be a crash.

139
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,698
Hey, kid, that ain't funny.

140
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,686
We gotta go right now.
We gotta move.

141
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:23,063
Relax, Nick.

142
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:24,825
Nick, calm down.
Oh, my God.

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,293
Come on, man.
What's your problem, bro?

144
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,660
Get off of me, man.

145
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:32,794
Come on, let's go.

146
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,387
Wait. Boys, wait!

147
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm gonna kick your little ass, you pussy!

148
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:40,661
Goddamn it!

149
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,807
God, you little punk.

150
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,128
Andy.
Stay there.

151
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,972
Come back here, kid!

152
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:52,233
Hey, you little prick!

153
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:55,129
Are you out of your mind, man?
I saw the whole thing.

154
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,185
There's gonna be a huge crash.

155
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,530
Of course there's a crash.

156
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,907
There's always a fucking crash.

157
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:00,982
What crash?

158
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:05,513
That fucking crash.
That's what crash I'm talking about.

159
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:08,756
Are you shitting me?

160
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,194
That's the reason I come
to these stupid redneck things.

161
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,309
No offense.

162
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,662
Sir. No, no, no, no, no, no...

163
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,257
But my wife's in there, asshole!

164
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,540
No, you can't.
Let me go!

165
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:18,703
I gotta find her!

166
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,709
Dude, relax.

167
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:20,762
That's my wife!

168
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,463
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

169
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,196
Have you all lost your fucking mind?

170
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,941
Here you go.
Thanks.

171
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,966
Just a second.
That's ok.

172
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,715
Nick, was it like a dream,

173
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,605
or like a voice in your head?

174
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,136
I just. I just saw it.

175
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,431
Can we just try to forget about it?

176
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,493
Are you kidding?

177
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,912
I am never gonna get that image
out of my head.

178
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,645
I mean, that girl's face just...
Janet.

179
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:46,555
Look, I know it's difficult.

180
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,399
We're all a little freaked out, ok?

181
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:50,549
Why are we still alive?

182
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:51,736
Who cares why?

183
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:52,957
Ok?

184
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:53,946
If we made it,

185
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,302
we deserved it.

186
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,786
Hunt, will you give the lucky-coin
shit a rest, please?

187
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,273
Guys, look.

188
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,178
I think we should go to the memorial.

189
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:18,675
I can't.

190
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,222
I can't go back there, Lori.

191
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:21,090
Yeah, screw that.

192
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,420
I mean, at least we can do is pay
our respects to those people.

193
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,381
What people?

194
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,042
People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with
them to tell them to get out of the way?

195
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,062
People who didn't have one of these?

196
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,736
Go ahead, Janet.

197
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:34,988
Kiss it.

198
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,781
It's your choice, heads or tails but...

199
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,133
you know I like head.

200
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:40,117
Can't believe I ever went out with you.

201
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:42,086
Can't believe you were so lucky.

202
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,413
Guys look.

203
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:46,439
We're here.

204
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,125
Alright?

205
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,909
Something gave us a second chance so...

206
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,302
let's be thankful and just...

207
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:53,675
try to make the most of it.

208
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,600
Ok?

209
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,855
Come on, let's go.

210
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,103
You ok?

211
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:49,928
Yeah.

212
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,095
Ok.

213
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:52,848
Hi.

214
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:55,622
Hi, I was hoping you'd come.

215
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,570
I wanted to thank you.

216
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,349
You're a hero.

217
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,657
Because of your warning we're alive,

218
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:03,202
and our two sons are safe.

219
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:04,622
Look.
Ok.

220
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:07,565
I'm not a hero, ok?
I... I didn't...

221
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,416
You knew.

222
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,302
How did you know
it was gonna happen?

223
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,331
I'm not sure.

224
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,904
Look, we're just glad you all are ok.

225
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,752
Take care.

226
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,572
Thank you.

227
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,499
I'm glad you're safe.

228
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,661
Thank you.

229
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,274
Excuse me.

230
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:32,688
I'm the security guard.

231
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:33,688
George.

232
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,955
Nick.

233
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,741
Lori.

234
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:37,995
Hi.
Hi.

235
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,909
I was pretty freaked out about that
back there.

236
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,509
I just wanted to ask you how you...
You killed my wife.

237
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,948
I wanted to go in there after her but...

238
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,857
you.

239
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,189
I'm sorry for your loss.

240
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,109
Well...

241
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:03,224
nobody lives forever, nigger.

242
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,804
Hey, there's no need for that, man.
Back off, you fucking freak.

243
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,824
It's time for you to leave, sir.

244
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,524
Time?

245
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,392
Your time's coming, chocolate.

246
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:56,961
What's wrong?

247
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,726
I just had a really bad nightmare.

248
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,431
It's ok, it's just a dream.

249
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,471
It seemed real.

250
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,060
Just try to relax and go back to sleep.

251
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm right here.

252
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,653
Son of a bitch.

253
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:02,791
Hey, Ma.

254
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,073
It's late. What are you doing up?

255
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,007
Ok.

256
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,133
No, no, no, everything's fine.

257
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:11,822
Yeah, it's fine.

258
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,822
Ok.

259
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,168
Time's up.

260
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,072
Goddamn it.

261
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,444
I'll burn you.

262
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,981
She probably wasn't.

263
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,583
No, no, no, no, no, no!

264
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:03,529
Fuck!

265
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,299
Help me! Help!

266
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:11,852
Wake up, please, anybody!

267
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,355
Please, I'm on fire! it's burning!

268
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,513
Oh, my God.

269
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,108
<i>My ass is on fire!
My ass is on fire!</i>

270
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,336
<i>Oh my God! My ass is on fire!</i>

271
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:38,559
Hey, babe, what's up?

272
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:39,328
Hey, Lori.

273
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,326
Turn on Channel 7 right now.

274
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,653
You remember that redneck
from the racetrack?

275
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,375
He's dead.

276
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:46,139
What?

277
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:48,659
Yeah, hold on.

278
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,946
<i>From the freak accident.</i>

279
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,713
<i>Although the investigation
is still ongoing</i>

280
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,456
<i>paramedics pronounced Daniels dead
on the scene.</i>

281
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,565
Nick, get in here.

282
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,034
<i>A member of local PTA and NRA chapters</i>

283
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:02,570
<i>Carter Daniels lived quietly
in Fort Wayne.</i>

284
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:05,145
<i>Details are sketchy
on how Daniels was killed.</i>

285
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:09,876
<i>All that is known at this time is that a tow
truck dragged him down a residential street,</i>

286
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:11,153
<i>before the truck exploded.</i>

287
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,413
Wanna hear something freaky?

288
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:15,244
I've seen that door before.

289
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,085
<i>More to come on our nightly news.</i>

290
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,922
<i>And now we'll check in
with our eye in the sky.</i>

291
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,738
Hey, hey, I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

292
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,265
Ok, bye.

293
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:40,056
What is it? What's wrong?

294
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,570
Remember that dream I had last night?

295
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,355
I... I don't think it was a dream.

296
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:49,674
It was like...

297
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,952
It was like a vision.

298
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:55,623
I mean there were flames,

299
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,688
and... there was a hook

300
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,368
and that red door.

301
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,214
And now that racist guy is dead.

302
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,521
It was like I saw clues
as to how he was gonna die.

303
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,865
Just now I saw another one.

304
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,644
Wait, you, you saw how another person
was gonna die?

305
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,051
Who was it?

306
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:19,281
I don't know.

307
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,034
It doesn't make any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.

308
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,933
Ever since I left the racetrack, I feel
like...

309
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:26,569
there's something in the room with me.

310
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,069
What is happening to me?

311
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,914
Hey, look. Come here.

312
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,266
Bet you can't hit that sign with a rock.
Ok.

313
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:10,409
Yeah.

314
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,184
Ok, ok, knock it off.

315
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:15,570
Yes!
Hey.

316
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:16,412
Nice one.

317
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,575
Hey, what are you kids,
stupid or something?

318
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,122
Get out of here.

319
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,471
Ok, come here, guys.

320
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:28,252
You know what, I want you to go play video
games and come back in an hour. ok.

321
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:29,839
Alright!
You're welcome.

322
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:31,010
Thanks.
Thanks, Mom.

323
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,581
I'm first on Atomic Destroyer.
No, I am.

324
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,394
Hi, Cheyenne, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a 500 with Richard.

325
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:39,408
You didn't get our message?

326
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,662
Richard's out today.
What?

327
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:43,678
Someone got killed on his block.

328
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,790
Dragged down the street on fire.

329
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,140
Isn't that terrible?

330
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,128
That's awful.

331
00:24:50,715 --> 00:24:52,771
So my appointment?

332
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,408
Is there someone else that can see me?

333
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,359
It's 10 to 6 and...

334
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,608
we close at 6, so.

335
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:03,351
I understand, I know but the soccer game
ran late and it's girls' night out tonight

336
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,869
first time in months,
and I'm so looking forward to this.

337
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:06,952
Please.

338
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:08,194
Please.

339
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,746
Look at this.

340
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,136
You're killing me.

341
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,082
Thank you.

342
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:13,644
Thank you so much.

343
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:21,986
Excuse me, that's...

344
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,800
That is a little... That's a little tight.

345
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:27,934
Sorry.
That's ok.

346
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,810
So, Dee Dee,

347
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,645
thank you for staying late.

348
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,383
How long have you been cutting hair?

349
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,683
Long enough.

350
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:41,075
Goddamn chair.

351
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:45,109
I've only told them to fix it
like a million times.

352
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:26,114
Oh, Dee Dee?

353
00:26:26,304 --> 00:26:27,052
Yeah?

354
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,066
Could I please get some water?

355
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,152
Ok No problem.
Thank you.

356
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,349
How's it going?

357
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,704
Ok. Almost done.

358
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:02,901
I love the color. It's exactly...

359
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,222
honey.

360
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,145
Do you think?

361
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:00,213
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

362
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,519
It won't happen again.

363
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,233
It's ok.

364
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:11,801
Hi, Mom.
Hey.

365
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,109
Oh, my God, are you ok?
Cut it out.

366
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,844
Thanks, Dee Dee.
You're welcome.

367
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:32,770
Hope you have fun.

368
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,118
Stop.

369
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:37,089
Ok, guys, knock it off.

370
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,828
I am so sorry about this.

371
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:43,095
These guys aren't gonna leave my sight
until I ship them off to college.

372
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,396
Maybe military school?

373
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:45,886
Yeah maybe.

374
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:48,019
Alright boys, come on.

375
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,760
Let's go. Get in the car.

376
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,939
I've got my eye on you two.

377
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:05,323
Oh, my God!

378
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:13,990
It's that lady with the kids,

379
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,414
from the racetrack.

380
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:20,299
We just lost a really hot MILF.

381
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,426
Dude, this is serious.
Yeah.

382
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,945
Don't you think it's just a little weird that
two of the people Nick saved are now dead?

383
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,753
Weird?

384
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:28,672
Is putting tampons in your kids' ears.

385
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:30,951
That's weird. She was bound
to die sooner or later.

386
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,343
That's actually why we asked
you guys to come over.

387
00:29:34,332 --> 00:29:35,878
The night before it happened,

388
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:37,459
Nick had a really strange dream.

389
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,014
Great.

390
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:39,240
I'm glad I...

391
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:40,802
canceled my golf game for this, good.

392
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:41,887
But it wasn't a dream.

393
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,067
It was like these...

394
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:45,735
random sounds and images.

395
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:46,974
They really didn't make any sense.

396
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,685
And then I read what killed them

397
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,945
and I realized that I'd seen how
the next person was gonna die.

398
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,378
Wait, what do you mean,
the next person?

399
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,425
Ok.

400
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:56,738
Don't laugh but,

401
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,146
we stayed up Googling premonitions

402
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,620
visions, signs,

403
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:01,844
things like that,

404
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,820
just to see how much
information we could get.

405
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,011
There are tons of articles about people

406
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,852
who had a premonition about a disaster

407
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:09,492
they saved themselves,

408
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:12,112
and then they died.

409
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:14,258
Ok, so people died. So what?

410
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:16,529
Every survivor died.

411
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:19,163
In the precise order they were meant
to die in the accident.

412
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:21,509
Well, we survived.

413
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,189
So now does that mean we all die?

414
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:28,441
Well, who's next?

415
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,168
I don't remember.

416
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,566
But there might be an out.

417
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,584
Some say the chain can be broken.

418
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,002
Like if you were to intervene
into someone else's death

419
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,217
that would end it.

420
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:43,024
But others say unless
the chain is broken completely

421
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,445
then you're just changing the batting order
and sooner or later...

422
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:47,452
you're up.

423
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,216
That is some spooky psycho babble shit.

424
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:53,192
Shut up please. This is not funny.

425
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,010
I am just saying he could be
watching a ton of TV.

426
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:56,712
You know what this stuff does to me.

427
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:57,677
Janet it's ok.

428
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,598
All we're trying to do
is figure out what's going on.

429
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,608
Ok, you guys are gonna have
to figure that out without me.

430
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,908
Maybe you can call
me later, but I gotta go.

431
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:05,006
Hope you have fun.

432
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,208
Janet, come back. Don't leave.

433
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,146
No, Lori. No.

434
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:09,844
You guys are freaking me out.
What's with that?

435
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,352
She went from uptight but normal
to uptight and totally insane.

436
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:16,118
Why you gotta be a prick all the time?
She saw somebody die right in front of her.

437
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,340
So did we.
Yeah, and we're all freaked out.

438
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,586
Would it kill you to be sensitive?

439
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,186
I don't know.

440
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:25,494
I've never tried it.

441
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:27,781
Where are you going?

442
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:29,417
If you're...

443
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:31,054
right about
this whole crash thing,

444
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,308
then I'm going to make the most
of every moment I have left.

445
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,715
So I'm gonna do what I do best,

446
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:37,433
I'm gonna go get laid.

447
00:31:38,632 --> 00:31:40,073
If I'm dying, I'm trying.

448
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,030
Keep up the good fight, guys.

449
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,104
And if I happen...

450
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:52,749
to bump into Janet,
I will check on her.

451
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,275
Thanks.

452
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,928
Well, that went well.

453
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:14,482
Yeah, our friends think we're crazy.
It's great.

454
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,835
Well, maybe we are.

455
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,775
Look, they're probably
just some weird coincidences.

456
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:23,348
You think?

457
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,937
I hope so.

458
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,530
Nick?

459
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:42,501
What did you see?

460
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,076
I think we can stop it.

461
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,019
How?

462
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:48,728
We gotta go to the racetrack.

463
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,062
Oh, my God.

464
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,042
Look at this place.

465
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,282
All those people just...

466
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:05,249
I don't wanna be here.
I know, I know.

467
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,570
But this is the only thing that I can think of
to help me remember the order.

468
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:11,636
It's over here.

469
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,480
This is where we were.

470
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,903
Let's see if this works.

471
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,177
The mechanic's girlfriend dies first.

472
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,681
Then that racist and his wife.

473
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,061
That with the kids,

474
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:54,287
she was next.

475
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,778
Let's go.

476
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:03,818
We shouldn't be here. Let's go.

477
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:13,360
I can't remember who dies when.

478
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,166
It's ok.

479
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,880
I don't know what to do. I can't...

480
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,833
Maybe this was a really bad idea.

481
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,245
No.

482
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,752
I gotta try.

483
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:28,746
You better have a damn good reason
for trespassing.

484
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:30,879
I just need to remember the order.

485
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,686
Young man, that sounds crazy, but...

486
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:35,795
maybe this will help you.

487
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:44,452
Now, this will bring up
all our video cameras right here.

488
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:55,996
There.

489
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,270
That's where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies.

490
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:02,964
So he's next, then...

491
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,482
I think so.

492
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,587
That collapse kills and Janet.

493
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,486
And that's when you die.

494
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,794
And then Lori.

495
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,134
Then me.

496
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:32,409
Maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed, we can break the chain...

497
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,262
and the rest of us will be safe.

498
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,034
But how?
I mean, we don't even know his name.

499
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:38,249
We know nothing about him.

500
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:39,125
But we do know...

501
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:41,080
where he works.

502
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,801
Grandstate Customs.

503
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,754
Hey, can you give me a hand
with this test probe?

504
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:32,845
Hey!

505
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,048
Are you ok?

506
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,935
Who's the fucking moron?

507
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,975
You. What are you doing here?

508
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:41,975
Trying to find you.

509
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,214
Look man, I'm sorry for being blunt, but...

510
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,369
your life's in danger,
I think you're gonna die.

511
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,388
Three of the people who left that stadium
before that accident happened,

512
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,062
they're now dead.

513
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:54,295
I'm sorry, but we think that
you're gonna be next.

514
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,422
You're serious?

515
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,108
Andy.

516
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,037
You know you can't have these people here.
Take them outside alright.

517
00:37:01,276 --> 00:37:02,640
No visitors in here.

518
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:03,755
Let's go.

519
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,563
Look man,

520
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,897
I'm trying to put my life
back together, ok?

521
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,151
I mean,

522
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:30,910
watching Nadia die like that
in front of me...

523
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:34,497
Hey, I know exactly how you feel.

524
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,754
I lost my wife and my daughter
in a car accident.

525
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:40,660
I was driving and I was drunk.

526
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,540
Every day, I ask myself how come
it couldn't be me instead of them.

527
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,520
For a long time,
I carried so much pain and anger

528
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:59,359
it was actually destroying their memory.
So now I try to live each day in their name.

529
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,576
Hey, guys, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm getting a really bad feeling.

530
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,517
Look, kid,

531
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,847
I'm around dangerous
equipment every day.

532
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:13,857
If I was meant to die,
it would've happened by now.

533
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,429
Look out!

534
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,169
Holy shit.
You ok, Andy?

535
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,276
Yeah, I'm ok.

536
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,091
Well, I guess it's not my turn to die.

537
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:32,931
You all take care.

538
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,029
Holy...! You alright?

539
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,488
Show us 20 at the body shop.

540
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,902
Honey, I mean,
if you can stop the next death

541
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,422
I'm seeing clues,
but I can't piece them together.

542
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,497
You gotta think. Who's next?
I don't know.

543
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:54,065
We have to warn your friends.

544
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:54,987
How?

545
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:56,257
Well, which one is next?

546
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:58,157
They both die in the collapse. I don't know.
Nick?

547
00:38:58,775 --> 00:38:59,450
Think.

548
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:00,452
Focus.

549
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:04,090
One of them had to be first, even if it
was one second before the other one.

550
00:39:05,317 --> 00:39:06,290
Was it Hunt,

551
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:07,703
or was it Janet?

552
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,029
You gotta find Janet.

553
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:13,631
I'm gonna find Hunt.

554
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:15,049
Ok?

555
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,648
Oh, God. Faster, go faster.

556
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,815
Go faster, go faster. Pick it up, pick it up.
Don't be lazy. Faster, faster.

557
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,871
Stop moving, stop moving, stop moving.

558
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:47,068
Move.

559
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,047
No, come on. Wake up.

560
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:52,128
No, we're not done. I'm not done.

561
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,147
Come on.

562
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,851
No, no.

563
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,184
Are you fucking kidding me?

564
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,091
I finished like four minutes ago.

565
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,806
Ever play Donkey Punch?

566
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:05,377
Dick.

567
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,968
Excuse me, miss,
but could you help a struggling artist?

568
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,509
Sure.

569
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,433
Thanks.

570
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,846
Have a nice day.

571
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:51,633
Let's see what we got here, Browning.

572
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,732
A penny?

573
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:56,827
That's some bullshit.

574
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,741
Oh, damn it.

575
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:09,408
Great.

576
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:26,264
Come on, you custom piece of shit.

577
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:34,081
Come on, pick up the phone.
Come on.

578
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:35,615
Where are you at? Come on.

579
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:03,715
<i>This is Hunt. You know what to do.</i>

580
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,302
Hunt, listen to me buddy, listen.

581
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:07,721
No water, ok? Stay away from water.

582
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,959
<i>You have three messages marked urgent.</i>

583
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,721
That's funny?

584
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,662
Give me the gun.

585
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:32,867
No.

586
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,759
Give me the fucking gun.

587
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:36,960
No.

588
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,068
Fucked up my phone.

589
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,388
Shit.

590
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,471
Perfect.

591
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:21,407
Hey Lori, I'm at the car wash.
I'll call you back in five.

592
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,481
Janet wait.

593
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:23,721
Wait. Shit.

594
00:44:24,215 --> 00:44:25,861
Do you know if there's a car wash
around here?

595
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,987
Yeah, there's one on 18th.
We gotta go there.

596
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,576
Yes.

597
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:36,854
I own you machine.

598
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,649
Lori?

599
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,238
What's so important?
<i>Don't go near water.</i>

600
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:12,932
What?

601
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,358
Hey what water?

602
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:15,732
What?
<i>Don't go near water!</i>

603
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:16,886
Water? Lori?

604
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,306
Wait. Lori?

605
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:35,308
Shit.

606
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,297
No service.

607
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,391
Shit.

608
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,984
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

609
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,647
Come on.

610
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,509
Lord, no.

611
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:12,989
Close!

612
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,429
Oh, stop it!

613
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:19,703
Oh, my God! No!

614
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:24,522
Help me!

615
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,323
Please!

616
00:46:36,533 --> 00:46:37,858
Somebody, please!

617
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:45,042
Pick up the phone, Janet.

618
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,125
Oh, God!

619
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:47,429
Help!

620
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,961
Oh, my God!

621
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:50,669
Oh, my God!

622
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,026
We're almost there.

623
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,021
Oh, shit.

624
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:09,211
Score!

625
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,306
No, no, no.

626
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,600
There it is.
Hurry.

627
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,856
Go around back, George.
She's in there.

628
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,578
No!

629
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,305
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

630
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:52,668
Lori!

631
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:54,470
Get me out of here!

632
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,963
Shit. I'm coming!

633
00:48:55,987 --> 00:48:57,767
Just hold on.
Come on, get her out.

634
00:48:57,808 --> 00:48:59,049
Help me!

635
00:48:59,073 --> 00:49:00,855
I'm trying!

636
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,388
Come here, I got you. I got you.

637
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,309
Hunt.

638
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,968
So do you have insurance?
Yeah.

639
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,723
What are we supposed to do now?

640
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,519
I mean, what's gonna happen to us?

641
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:24,273
You know saving Janet
either destroyed Death's list

642
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,117
and all of us are home free,
or it skips her for now and then...

643
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,750
And I'm next.

644
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,124
George you can't give up.

645
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,938
No, it's ok.

646
00:50:37,508 --> 00:50:38,928
What do you mean, it's ok?

647
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,567
I mean...

648
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:43,039
maybe if we all stick together...
No I'm at peace with it.

649
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:43,945
And...

650
00:50:44,281 --> 00:50:45,778
my family's waiting for me.

651
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,618
I'm ready to go.

652
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:51,505
When we're done in here, we need to
make sure to safe-proof the bedroom next.

653
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,811
I don't understand
how George can be so calm about things.

654
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,897
Maybe he was in shock.

655
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,605
No, that's not it.

656
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:04,491
It was very clear.

657
00:52:05,864 --> 00:52:07,289
It's, it's like he just accepted it.

658
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:09,223
I think he's given up.

659
00:52:12,022 --> 00:52:13,409
If he dies, I'm next.

660
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,110
And when that happens,
maybe you should just keep your distance.

661
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,237
Babe, what are you talking about?
Come on.

662
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,915
I don't want anything to happen to you.

663
00:52:24,865 --> 00:52:27,801
And if we're together, it makes it easier
for Death to take both of us.

664
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,843
I don't care what happens.

665
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,338
We are in this together.

666
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:39,994
Look.

667
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,495
Maybe no one else has to die.

668
00:52:47,348 --> 00:52:48,555
We should go tell George.

669
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:53,322
Hello?

670
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,947
George.

671
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:04,027
We think saving Janet broke the chain.

672
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,962
George?

673
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,530
George?
George?

674
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:39,454
Oh, my God.

675
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,333
Oh, my God.

676
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:44,668
Are you crazy?

677
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:46,305
After everything that we've been through.

678
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:48,573
What the fuck are you doing man?
Why are you trying to kill yourself?

679
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:50,559
I just try to give God
what I thought he wanted.

680
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,993
I've been trying to kill myself all day.

681
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:57,022
Took a bottle of painkillers.
I just threw them up.

682
00:53:57,418 --> 00:53:58,723
Then I went to the garage,

683
00:53:58,747 --> 00:54:00,428
hooked a hose from the tailpipe...

684
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:02,662
stuck it inside the car,
the car kept stalling.

685
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,268
Then...

686
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:09,893
So wait.

687
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,077
Saving Janet must have
destroyed the list then...

688
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,952
I think congratulations are in order.

689
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:23,486
To breaking the chain.

690
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:24,962
Apple cider?

691
00:54:25,149 --> 00:54:26,343
Thank you.

692
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,014
Thank God.
And a toast.

693
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,172
To life.

694
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:32,479
To life.
To life.

695
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,930
We've been given a second chance.

696
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:40,567
So, what are you guys gonna do with it?

697
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,430
I have a few plans for us.

698
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,996
Lots of traveling,

699
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:48,276
like Paris, maybe some beaches, St.-Tropez.

700
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,620
I'm just thankful we have our whole lives
ahead of us, you know?

701
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:52,288
Yeah.

702
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,237
Now this is over,

703
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:56,714
I'm not gonna
take another day for granted.

704
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,514
Ever.

705
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,362
You know, maybe it's time to stop talking
about doing stuff and actually start doing it.

706
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,707
You only live once, right?

707
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:07,989
That's what I'm talking about.

708
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,556
Let me get the cookies.

709
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,061
We made it.

710
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,147
We did.

711
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,572
Hey.

712
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:38,559
Hey, babe.

713
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,016
<i>Did you get the traveler's checks?</i>

714
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,396
Yes, I did.

715
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:42,829
<i>Need anything from the mall?</i>

716
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:44,630
No, I think we're good.

717
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,706
You sure you don't wanna come
to the movie?

718
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,044
It's in 3-D.

719
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,495
Love Lays Dying?

720
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,986
Yeah, I think I'll be alright.
Sounds like a chick flick.

721
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,050
But, I'll have everything packed
by the time you get home.

722
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:57,170
<i>Amsterdam, here we come.</i>

723
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,070
I can't believe we're actually going.

724
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:01,024
I'm...

725
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,556
You know Janet is so incredibly jealous.

726
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,904
<i>Speaking of, she's walking up right now.
I'm gonna run, ok?</i>

727
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,617
Tell her I said hi.
<i>I will.</i>

728
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:10,567
Love you.
Love you too. Be home soon.

729
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:11,604
<i>Bye.</i>
Bye.

730

<i>Jonathan Groves was rescued

734
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:02,603
George, how fast can you meet me
at the hospital?

735
00:57:03,656 --> 00:57:05,146
Look man, we got the order wrong, alright.

736
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,489
Remember that guy who sat
in front of me, the cowboy?

737
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,436
He didn't die, which means he's next.

738
00:57:09,722 --> 00:57:11,827
Look, just be there in five.
Alright I'm on my way.

739
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:24,875
You feeling ok, Mr. Suby?

740
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:26,902
Why do you care?

741
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,321
You know how many of your kind
I killed in Korea?

742
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:32,937
I'm Chinese, sir.

743
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,157
Ha, same difference.

744
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:36,177
I need you in PT 3 right now.

745
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:38,164
Ok.
And I do mean now.

746
00:57:38,189 --> 00:57:39,695
Ok.
Thank you.

747
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:41,874

Help.

00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:40,954
Where's Lori?

759
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:43,688
I've been calling and texting all afternoon.
She's not picking up.

760
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:45,941
Maybe it won't matter. Come on.

761
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,156
How can there be someone else on the list?

762
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:08,420
He didn't leave the racetrack with us.

763
00:59:08,513 --> 00:59:11,636
Yeah but if I would've asked him to move
like in the premonition, he would've died.

764
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:14,038
Instead, he survived.
That's why you couldn't kill yourself.

765
00:59:14,146 --> 00:59:15,331
You weren't next, he was.

766
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:16,940
It wasn't destined at all.

767
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,397
So if he dies, I'm next again.

768
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,657
Great, man.

769

01:00:21,864 --> 01:00:23,580

01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:24,936
What the hell?

774
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:35,031
Hey. Stop...

775
01:00:44,884 --> 01:00:47,198
That's genius.
Someone could get killed.

776
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,721
I'm feeling something.

777
01:00:53,745 --> 01:00:54,858
Don't lose hope.

778
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:58,108
I think we just keep an eye out for any signs
of danger, I think we got a shot. ok.

779
01:00:58,149 --> 01:00:59,519
Let's just go find Lori and Janet.

780
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:00,728
No, no, no, not that.

781
01:01:00,752 --> 01:01:02,076
It's like déjà vu.

782

My wife said that déjà vu
is like God's way of...

Oh, my goodness. Hurry, let's go.

784
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:09,329
Ok.

785
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,958
Oh, thank you very much.
Ok, thanks.

786
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,891
Hi. Do you have these in a six?

787
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,352
Yes, we bring them in fresh every day.

788
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,780
Hello.

789
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,589
Cool, let's go.
What do you think?

790
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,180
Well,

791
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:38,455
they're cute yet functional.

792
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,129
I like them.

793
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:43,642
They say, I'm getting older,
but I still like to party.

794
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,402
Doesn't matter, I didn't buy them
for you, I bought them for Nick.

795
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,245
He likes me in sneaks.

796
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,087
Yeah, just get a 2-by-48.

797
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,588
Right off the corner brace?

798
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,382
Check the measurement.
It's not fitting.

799
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,985
Those windows won't pass.

800
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,325
Yeah, 90 on that.

801
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,811
Yeah, that looks fine.

802
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,647
Go ahead and nail it off, it's level.

803
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,151
Yeah, around the corner.

804
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,200
Lunch, boys.
Ok.

805
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,453
Back in an hour.

806
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,176
Hey, is that yogurt place still open?

807
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,655
Yeah, I think they're still here.
Wait.

808
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,636
Wait a second.
My shoelace is caught here.

809
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,163
What?
My shoelace is stuck.

810
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:40,416
Just help me get it out.

811
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:43,041
Look, I'm gonna grab your...
it's not coming out thougt Janet.

812
01:02:43,716 --> 01:02:45,425
Don't freak out. It's ok.
Pull my leg harder.

813
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:47,646
Help me try to get it out.
Lori, you need to pull.

814
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,836
No it's not coming loose.
I am trying.

815
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,366
It's twisting my ankle.
I'm pulling.

816
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:56,166
Fuck.

817
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,081
I should've seen that one coming.

818
01:03:00,346 --> 01:03:02,074
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm ok.

819
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,322
Here's two for Love Lays Dying.

820
01:03:16,346 --> 01:03:17,501
Enjoy the show.

821
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:19,226
Thank you.
Thanks.

822
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:22,850
Hi, ladies.
Hello.

823

Thanks.

825
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,666
Where the hell you going?

826
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,616
<i>Go. Go now. Cut him off.</i>

827

01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,220
<i>We'll be there in no time.</i>

830
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,354
That's really cool.

831
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:07,975
Down in front, asshole.

832
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,906
Sir, move your feet.

833
01:05:17,053 --> 01:05:19,028
<i>Put these in your ears.</i>

834
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:20,582
<i>It's gonna get loud.</i>

835
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,833
<i>What do you mean?</i>

836
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,366
Look,

837
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:24,909
don't get mad at me but...

838
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,631
do you remember when Nick said
that he could see signs,

839
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:29,054
before something bad
was gonna happen?

840
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,927
Well, now I think I'm seeing them.

841
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,461
Lori it's over.

842
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:37,432
Nothing is gonna happen.

843
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,127
Now can we please watch the movie?

844
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:13,296
Are you kidding me?

845
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:26,039
<i>Everybody off this bridge.
We will never make it.</i>

846
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,997
<i>It's gonna blow. Move it, now!</i>

847
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:29,944
Lori. Lori.

848
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:32,351
Lori!

849
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:33,689
Shut up, man.

850
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,267
<i>Bye-bye, suckers.</i>

851
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,488
Dixieland.

852
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,581
Something's wrong.

853
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:55,624
Yeah, no kidding.
The person next to me won't shut up.

854
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:57,398
No, I'm serious. Something's wrong.

855
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,638
Things are happening
just like at the track.

856
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:15,732
Lori, you in here?
Nick.

857
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,148
It's not over.

858
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:19,810
What?

859
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:20,704
George is dead.

860
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,266
Janet, come on.
We have to leave right now.

861
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:26,322
No.

862
01:07:26,452 --> 01:07:28,946
No, I can't keep doing this, ok?
You're both nuts.

863
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:30,409
Janet, we gotta go. Come on.

864
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:32,535
No. Don't you see?

865
01:07:32,733 --> 01:07:35,939
This is where I was supposed to be
in the first place, not that race.

866
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:36,893
Come on.
Wait.

867
01:07:36,939 --> 01:07:39,773
I was meant to see this movie.

868
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,608
<i>Bye-bye, suckers.</i>

869
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,300
Janet!

870
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,857
Lori, come on!

871
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,957
Find the way to the exit. Remain calm.

872
01:08:07,982 --> 01:08:09,427
Everything's gonna be ok.

873
01:08:16,908 --> 01:08:18,408
Let's go! Let's go!

874
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,404
I got you.
Pull me up! Pull me up!

875
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,378
Nick! Nick!

876
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,106
Help me! Help me!
Hold on!

877
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,618
Hold on!
Help!

878
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,996
Climb up my arm!
Don't let me go!

879
01:08:47,063 --> 01:08:48,183
Climb up my arm!

880
01:08:48,331 --> 01:08:49,111
Lori!

881
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,365
No! Hold on, I got you.

882
01:08:51,389 --> 01:08:52,555
I got you.

883
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,823
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

884
01:09:06,887 --> 01:09:08,640
No, no, Lori!

885
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,396
No!, no! Lori! No!

886
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:19,380
I mean, it's déjà vu.

887
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,965
My wife said that déjà vu is God's way...
Look out!

888
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,744
Hurry.
Get some help!

889
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:27,745
Help.
Over here!

890
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:29,379
Lori.

891
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:37,891
Hey, watch it.

892
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,691
Down in front, asshole.

893
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:46,949
Hey, come on, man.

894
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:48,696
Watch out.
Hey.

895
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:50,936
Hey, come on.

896
01:10:05,216 --> 01:10:06,383
Janet, something's wrong.

897
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,140
Come on.

898
01:10:40,164 --> 01:10:41,331
Come on, come on.

899
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:43,197
Come on. Damn it.

900
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,152
Fuck! Oh!

901
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:40,503
Look, we were wrong about the order before.
What if we're wrong about breaking the chain?

902
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:42,056
Then we wouldn't be here at all.

903
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,746
And yet here I am,

904
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:44,739
trying to watch a movie...

905
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:46,806
despite my best friend going crazy
next to me.

906
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,264
Oh, fuck.

907
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,481
Oh, shit. Shit.

908
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:48,541
<i>It's gonna blow. Move it!</i>

909
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:57,748
Come on. Come on.

910
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,821
<i>Bye-bye, suckers.</i>

911
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:20,668
<i>I guess this is how
I'm gonna be remembered.</i>

912
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,001
<i>Thanks.</i>

913
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,675
Try to tie it off right there.

914
01:13:45,685 --> 01:13:46,455
That's good.

915
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,757
Just this side of the Union City.

916
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,206
Hey, man, excuse me.

917
01:13:51,985 --> 01:13:53,265
Is this thing supposed to be this way?

918
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:55,544
Isn't it supposed to be screwed tighter?

919
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,341
You're right.

920
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,088
Tell you what,

921
01:13:58,112 --> 01:13:59,316
we'll get somebody on that.

922
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:00,841
Pays to be safe, man.

923
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:02,611
Trust me.
Yeah.

924
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,271
Small mint tea.
Thanks.

925
01:14:23,851 --> 01:14:25,745
Small latte for you.
Thank you.

926
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,525
And for me...

927
01:14:30,227 --> 01:14:31,507
what the hell is that?

928
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:35,415
It's a giant chococcino with whipped cream,
chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles.

929
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:36,821
That looks disgusting.

930
01:14:37,221 --> 01:14:39,956
Yeah. I'm going into a diabetic coma
just looking at it.

931
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:41,869
Well, what can I say ladies?
It looked good.

932
01:14:45,954 --> 01:14:46,678
Yeah but...

933
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,318
it tastes totally disgusting.

934
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:54,547
Say you're the guy
who stopped that mall fire, aren't you?

935
01:14:56,478 --> 01:14:58,431
You saved a lot of lives, man.

936
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,764
I was just at the right place
at the right time.

937
01:15:03,723 --> 01:15:05,644
Sometimes that's all it takes.

938
01:15:10,394 --> 01:15:12,318
Ok, that was really weird.

939
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,122
Hey, don't knock my fan base.

940
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:15,560
Hey, God.

941
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,140
I love your bag by the way.

942
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:19,169
Oh, thanks. I actually just got it.
Yeah.

943
01:15:19,193 --> 01:15:20,014
Did you? Where?

944
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:21,964
Yeah. There's a place
right next to Brevig's.

945
01:15:21,988 --> 01:15:22,987
It just opened.

946
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:23,799
Brevig's?

947
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:25,353
Yeah, it's in that shopping center.

948
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:28,463
It's there's a grocery store and a card shop,
and then there's a...

949
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,150
it's like a little accessories store.
Oh, yeah.

950
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,804
It's super cute. If you want one
of these purses, they have it in plaid.

951
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:38,324
Is that the only other one?
Yeah.

952
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,524
They only made two?

953
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,150
Well, what do you think, babe?

954
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,883
Hey, space cadet, you wanna
come back down to Earth?

955
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,372
What if we didn't change anything?

956
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,427
What are you talking about?

957
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:09,779
What are you doing?

958
01:16:09,804 --> 01:16:10,888
What if us being here...

959
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:12,077
right now...

960
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,430
was the plan from the beginning?

961
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:41,176
