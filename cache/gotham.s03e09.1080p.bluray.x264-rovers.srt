1
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:05,063
- Previously on Gotham...
- Watch out!

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:06,180
Ivy's missing.

3
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:07,214
She'll turn up somewhere.

4
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:09,450
It was a long way down into water.

5
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,318
What's your name? My name's Ivy.

6
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,188
- Who the hell are you?
- Not yet.

7
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:15,923
This is too fun.

8
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,826
He loves me and I love him.

9
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,261
I am telling you one last time,

10
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,163
let Ed go.

11
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,598
- No.
- Very well.

12
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,933
Don't say I didn't warn you.

13
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,401
Oh, no.

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,905
Somebody help!

15
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:32,573
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

16
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,808
Welcome back, Detective.

17
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,143
Captain, I'm so glad you came.

18
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,178
I came to congratulate you.

19
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,682
If a person comes into contact
with my blood, it changes them.

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,183
You and I are gonna
make a difference in this city.

21
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,251
We're gonna clean it up.

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,325
Sentence served.

23
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,994
Symon.

24
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:55,129
Who did this?

25
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:56,964
Barnes.

26
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,439
So, seems anyone
could have gotten access

27
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,707
to that bathroom, not just the guests.

28
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,075
Suspect pool's wide open.

29
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,143
All right, start with statements

30
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,578
from everyone at the party.

31
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,276
Someone saw Symon go into that bathroom.

32
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,604
Okay.

33
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:17,985
I still can't believe it.

34
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm sorry things went down this way.

35
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:21,822
Don't apologize; you were right.

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,857
Did you give your statement already?

37
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,492
I'm afraid I wasn't very helpful.

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,928
Till about an hour ago,
I couldn't pick Symon

39
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,029
out of a crowd.

40
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:31,465
Did you talk to Barnes at the party?

41
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,701
A little. We had a drink.

42
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,237
Symon died around 10:30.

43
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,705
The attack happened just before.

44
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:40,140
What time did you talk with Barnes?

45
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,375
9:00.

46
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:43,844
What is this about?

47
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,748
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Really?

48
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,483
I can't talk about it.

49
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,451
No.

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,853
Lee, I cannot talk about it.

51
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,055
Jim, I hope you know what you're doing.

52
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,324
Me, too.

53
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,892
Barnes? No. No, no, no, no, no.

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,394
I asked Symon who attacked him,

55
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:01,695
and he said Barnes.

56
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,363
Symon was a psychopath

57
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,365
who gave face transplants to the mob

58
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,733
using stolen faces.

59
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,135
Hardly a credible witness.

60
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,269
And this guy, Barnes?

61
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,771
If he so much as jaywalked,

62
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,140
- he would write himself a ticket.
- I know.

63
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,209
"And now you're saying
he went to Lee Thompkin"

64
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,778
engagement party, and out of
nowhere, busted some guy's face

65
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,147
and chucked him through a wall?
- I know, Harvey.

66
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,783
- What's the motive?
- I don't know, maybe he...

67
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,151
He saw Symon,

68
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,252
he got pissed he was released,

69
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,787
and he lost control.

70
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,488
Okay. So, you're saying

71
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,691
that a man with a
spotless 20-year career,

72
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,759
just went ape. Is-is that your theory?

73
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:34,761
Something's been off about him recently.

74
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,064
You yourself said he
nearly beat Tetch to death.

75
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,733
And what's with him
insisting on running point

76
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,335
- in the Paulie Pennies case?
- Look,

77
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:43,537
I don't know, but that
does not make him a killer.

78
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,472
So where is he now?

79
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,708
Home. He spent the
better part of yesterday

80
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:50,010
chasing down Symon, maybe he's tired.

81
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,778
That doesn't mean he's guilty.

82
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:55,115
The last thing I want is
for Barnes to be guilty.

83
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:56,316
I look up to the man.

84
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,019
But if there is even a
chance then we have to know.

85
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,954
And something doesn't feel right.

86
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:04,057
Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna help you.

87
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,360
But just so you know,
I'm doing it to prove

88
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,061
he's innocent, not guilty.

89
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,997
That's fine. All right, so
I'll go back to the scene,

90
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,699
see if forensics can pull
some prints from the bathroom.

91
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,635
Barnes's should already be on file.

92
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:17,771
Jim. I know how to do my job.

93
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:21,208
I hope I'm wrong.

94
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:24,611
Yeah. Me, too.

95
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,127
It starts as a whisper.

96
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:42,095
You have to strain to hear it.

97
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:48,201
And then it grows louder and louder,

98
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,605
till it becomes a roar.

99
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:55,509
It's everything you can
do to just shut it out.

100
00:03:57,178 --> 00:03:58,712
And just like that...

101
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,682
you suddenly realize it's your voice.

102
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:04,451
The one you've been denying.

103
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,386
Telling you who you are.

104
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,190
What you have to do.

105
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,426
And then you stop fighting.

106
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,897
And this calm comes over you.

107
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,644
Sex trafficking.

108
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,513
Drugs.

109
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,216
Murder.

110
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:40,320
I've kept files on all
three of you for years.

111
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,089
Waiting for the proof we needed

112
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,825
while you sneered at the law.

113
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,460
Not tonight.

114
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,430
Tonight, I am the law!

115
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,202
And you are hereby tried.

116
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,806
Found guilty.

117
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,745
And sentenced.

118
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,957
Justice is served.

119
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,558
So what's an antiquities dealer?

120
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,495
I buy and sell rare
and beautiful objects.

121
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,233
I like to think I have
an eye for beauty.

122
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,237
Is this a bug?

123
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,839
An Egyptian scarab.

124
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,441
More than 3,000 years old.

125
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,122
It's priceless.

126
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,232
Everything has a price.

127
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,047
What's upstairs?

128
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,849
The bedroom.

129
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,384
Hmm.

130
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,920
And the vault.

131
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,022
Vault?

132
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,692
It's where I keep my most
valuable acquisitions.

133
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,594
Can I see?

134
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,196
Ivy,

135
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,165
you are very beautiful.

136
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,201
But we've only just met.

137
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,304
We haven't had time to
get to know each other.

138
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,005
Who are you?

139
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,941
Where do you come from?

140
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,776
What do you do?

141
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,378
Well, I'm from Gotham.

142
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,280
And I meet men.

143
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,082
Like you.

144
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,350
They give me things.

145
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,187
And what do you give them?

146
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,223
Nothing.

147
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,674
I also like plants.

148
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:37,095
I've always been able to
get them to grow for me.

149
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,568
Lately, I've been using
them to make perfume.

150
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:42,701
Plants are so much more
powerful than people imagine.

151
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,403
They can poison you, heal you,

152
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,725
make you fall in love.

153
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:50,842
I made this from a strain
of cananga odorata.

154
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,879
Smell.

155
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,153
Now, open the vault.

156
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,394
COMPUTERIZED WOMAN'S
VOICE: Access granted.

157
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,540
Did they send you? You lying schlampe!

158
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,075
Did they?

159
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,714
Come back here!

160
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,617
You hear me? I'll find you!

161
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,729
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

162
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,800
You've been checking
your watch all morning.

163
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,002
You expecting... A call from Isabella.

164
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,371
She's at her librarian conference.

165
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,973
Ah.

166
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,841
Probably just busy.

167
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,343
Most likely.

168
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,111
I can imagine librarian conferences

169
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,113
can be hectic affairs.

170
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,349
- Not so much.
- Well,

171
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,551
I'm sure she'll call soon.

172
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,193
Hello.

173
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,030
This is Edward Nygma.

174
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,934
Why?

175
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,304
Very well.

176
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,043
That was the GCPD.

177
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,101
They want to see me. Wouldn't say why.

178
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,012
Oh?

179
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,934
You don't think that
something happened...

180
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,770
No!

181
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:47,166
The officer said Isabella
blew through a red light

182
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,569
and crashed into a train.

183
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,605
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

184
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:57,209
Yours was the last number in her phone.

185
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:01,347
I am... so, so sorry, Ed.

186
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,284
Did she suffer?

187
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,355
No.

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,028
Anything you need, Ed,

189
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,830
anything at all,

190
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:19,665
I am here for you.

191
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,223
Breakfast!

192
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,997
Still collecting strays?

193
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,766
Lady,

194
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,268
you got two seconds to get out of here

195
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,937
before I gut you like a fish.

196
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,839
You really don't recognize me?

197
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,475
Selina, it's me.

198
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,478
Ivy? Hey, you got anything

199
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,013
to eat around here?

200
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,682
I'm starving.

201
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,181
Yeah.

202
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,155
Jim, I'm outside the
scene. Forensics found tons

203
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:18,758
of prints inside the bathroom
where Symon was attacked.

204
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,159
Barnes?

205
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,527
That just means he was in there.

206
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,195
- It puts him at the scene.
- Listen,

207
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,665
I've been thinking. You got to
tell Barnes what Symon said.

208
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:29,001
Give him the right to defend himself.

209
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,970
I will.

210
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,972
When I'm ready.

211
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,722
Help you?

212
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,857
Captain.

213
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:56,328
I was, uh, looking for
the Paulie Pennies file.

214
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,432
Thinking the cases might be related.

215
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,541
Thanks.

216
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,983
Fill me in.

217
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:16,086
Nothing hard yet, but we'll get there.

218
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:17,454
Uh-huh.

219
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:20,124
I was reading through some
of the witness statements.

220
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:22,960
The couple from the alley...
They say when they found

221
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:24,628
Symon, he was still alive.

222
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,997
You were first on the scene.

223
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:30,134
- Did he say anything to you?
- No.

224
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:33,003
He didn't ID the killer?

225
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,441
No.

226
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,144
Ah. 'Cause one of the
witnesses seems to think

227
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,812
that you were talking to him.

228
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,848
He tried, sure.

229
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,883
But he couldn't speak. He died

230
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,459
almost right away.

231
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,953
Uh-huh.

232
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,988
Well, for what it's worth, I called

233
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:57,625
an old C.I. of mine with
deep ties to the mob.

234
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,094
He says that

235
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,497
once I collared Symon,
the higher-ups got jumpy.

236
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,966
You're saying the mob had him killed?

237
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,102
He was giving these guys new faces.

238
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,905
He's probably the only
one who can ID them.

239
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:14,508
That's a lot to protect. Makes sense.

240
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,810
My C.I. also had a name.
Mid-level enforcer,

241
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,946
goes by "Sugar," works
out of the East End.

242
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,815
- Says he actually did the killing.
- I'll have a team pick him up.

243
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:24,318
I'd rather you kept this
between us. Mob still has

244
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,354
their fingers in most
of these guys' pockets.

245
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:30,391
You never know who you can trust. So,

246
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,660
you ready to ride with the old man?

247
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:34,929
Sure. Just let me run
it by my, uh, partner.

248
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,196
Why bother him?

249
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:38,565
We'll be there and back
before you know it.

250
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:44,696
So where are we headed?

251
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:49,294
Sugar works out of an old
foundry at 133rd and 6th.

252
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,736
Oh, that reminds me.

253
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,308
It's Harvey. Leave a message.

254
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm with Barnes, heading
to 133rd and 6th.

255
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,109
Get there.

256
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:14,492
You never know what's gonna go down.

257
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,332
I have to say, Jim,

258
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,501
I'm disappointed with you.

259
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:37,770
Oh, yeah? How's that?

260
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,973
Lead detective for a
high-profile murder,

261
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,302
and you don't collect statements
from everyone present?

262
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:46,596
Me.

263
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:49,351
Well, let's do it now.

264
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,869
And for the record, I
waive my right to counsel.

265
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,079
- Captain...
- Ask your questions, Gordon.

266
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,963
Did you see Symon at the party?

267
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,440
Yes.

268
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,213
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I did not.

269
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:08,821
Did you see him go into the
bathroom before he was attacked?

270
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,007
Unfortunately, no.

271
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,409
Were you ever in it?

272
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,544
Yes.

273
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,287
Before it was a crime scene, obviously.

274
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:24,820
So, Detective, am I in the clear?

275
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,389
For now.

276
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,596
This city's a cesspool.

277
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:36,465
Don't you ever want to
do something about it?

278
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,068
I thought I was.

279
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,170
What, as a cop?

280
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,639
I would think that you, of all people,

281
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,708
would find that limiting.

282
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,977
Not anymore.

283
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:50,946
Came back to the GCPD
to do things right.

284
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,182
Like you.

285
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,352
- Like me?
- Last year,

286
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,187
at Galavan's, when we were attacked,

287
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:02,058
you told me the law shows
you where the line is.

288
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,692
That stuck with me.

289
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,362
Some would say that our
job, first and foremost,

290
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,298
is to protect the citizens of this city,

291
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:11,300
even if it means bending the laws.

292
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:14,103
No. We break the law, we're
no better than the criminals.

293
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,306
Is that what you were thinking

294
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,275
the night that Galavan was killed?

295
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,843
The first time.

296
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:24,113
This city's at a crossroads, Gordon.

297
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:28,551
Question is... Will
good men fight for it?

298
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:31,587
Will they do what's necessary?

299
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,824
The decision is yours to make.

300
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:44,066
You passed our stop. 133rd and 6th?

301
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,469
Did I say that?

302
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,605
136th and 3rd.

303
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:52,508
It's an honest mistake.

304
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,413
- Mmm.
- I don't believe it.

305
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,515
- Mmm.
- Well, I should have known.

306
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,151
I saw what that freak Marv could do.

307
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:04,220
How he could age people, and when

308
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:07,356
he told me that the girl wearing
her sweater was older, I...

309
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:10,025
I should have realized.

310
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,393
That's really Ivy.

311
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:12,695
Trust me.

312
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:15,297
She came, and literally ate all my food.

313
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,199
Immediately ate all my food.

314
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,534
It's her.

315
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,770
So why is she back here?

316
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,639
Good question.

317
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,576
Ow! What was that for?

318
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,546
For being alive and not telling me!

319
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,352
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,593
I was just having fun.

321
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,838
Why did you come back?

322
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,464
I don't have to answer your questions.

323
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:49,698
Why'd you call him anyway?

324
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:51,333
'Cause you freaked me out!

325
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:53,736
Where have you been, and

326
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,738
why are you dressed like that?

327
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:58,207
Oh, it's so crazy, Selina.

328
00:17:58,275 --> 00:17:59,808
When you look like this,

329
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:02,545
guys just come up to
you and give you stuff.

330
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,980
Half the time, you don't
even have to steal it.

331
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,916
Hmm. And what do you give them?

332
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,352
Hmm. I have ways of getting what I want.

333
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,508
- I'll bet.
- You do look nice.

334
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,663
So why did you come back?

335
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,032
And don't say it's 'cause you missed me.

336
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,934
It's true.

337
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:28,270
You may be ten feet tall, but
you're still a crappy liar, Ivy.

338
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:30,372
What's... going... on?

339
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:34,376
Well, I might be in trouble.

340
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:36,612
- I knew it.
- There was this guy...

341
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,848
- What was his name?
- Like I learn their names.

342
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,450
So I was at his place last night.

343
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:44,053
Total creep. Anyway, I stole a necklace.

344
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,623
I was surprised he noticed
'cause he had so much crap.

345
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,825
But he caught me, and
he totally freaked out.

346
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,560
If only Marv's power
had made you smart, too.

347
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:54,063
- You steal all the time.
- Yeah, well,

348
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,798
- I don't get caught.
- Shh.

349
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:57,366
Rude.

350
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:58,667
No. Be-be quiet.

351
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:01,403
I hear something.

352
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:12,982
We have to go.

353
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,118
Someone's here.

354
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:17,620
Ivy, in.

355
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,558
Bruce! Seriously?

356
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:38,240
So who is this guy again?

357
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,309
Just follow my lead.

358
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:42,244
GCPD!

359
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:44,580
- Don't move!
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa.

360
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:47,049
- Hiya, Sugar.
- What the hell is this?

361
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,917
We're here about the gas bill.

362
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,352
You're delinquent.

363
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,820
- Huh?
- Where were you

364
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,422
last night, say about 10:00 p.m.?

365
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,424
At your mama's, like always.

366
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:56,616
Answer the question.

367
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,192
I was at the fights.
A dozen people saw me.

368
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:01,297
A dozen of your lying,
bottom-feeding friends?

369
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:03,599
The name Symon mean anything to you?

370
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,768
- No.
- No?

371
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,937
Plastic surgeon? Face
man for your mob buddies?

372
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,007
Wait... No.

373
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:17,546
Like I said, so whatever the
hell you think I did, I didn't.

374
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,081
I was at the fights!

375
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:20,883
People saw me!

376
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,437
- I'm innocent, man!
- You know what?

377
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,534
I think he's telling the truth.

378
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:28,128
He didn't kill anyone.

379
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:33,146
But you're not innocent.

380
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,248
I think we lost them.

381
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,884
Is that who you stole the necklace from?

382
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,586
Uh, no. I-I don't think so.

383
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,922
Then who were they?

384
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,957
I don't know. Maybe they work for him.

385
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:03,760
Oh, great, Ivy! Now my squat is burned,

386
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,029
and masked weirdoes
are trying to kill us.

387
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,998
So glad you came back.

388
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:11,155
You have to return it.

389
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:13,870
What? No way.

390
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,438
Ivy, he's right.

391
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,325
That dumb necklace almost got us killed.

392
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:19,476
It's mine. I worked for it.

393
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,111
And it's super valuable.

394
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,680
- How much?
- Wait. Bruce, don't.

395
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:27,050
If I buy it, you get paid,
but we can still return it,

396
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,352
and those men will have
no reason to harm us.

397
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,720
How much?

398
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,860
- One thousand dollars.
- Fine.

399
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:37,994
Idiot.

400
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,147
- Two thousand.
- Fine.

401
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:44,201
Five... No. Ten!

402
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,936
Well, how much should I ask for?

403
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,183
I'll get you
$5,000 in cash today.

404
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:51,174
Or you can try to avoid
those men on your own.

405
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:55,478
That's my offer.

406
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:07,257
Now, where does this man live?

407
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,997
Now, just raise your chin a mite higher.

408
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,727
Would you excuse me for a moment?

409
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,815
Ed.

410
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,483
Yes.

411
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:35,552
The music!

412
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,889
It's too loud. I'm sorry!

413
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,360
Isabella always loved Vivaldi.

414
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:46,467
So you are just going to sit here.

415
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:48,698
- Yes.
- All by yourself.

416
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:50,433
Correct.

417
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,370
Okay then.

418
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:02,679
Apologies.

419
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,958
Ed, I, as much as anyone,

420
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,693
know how hard it is to lose someone.

421
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,496
Even if

422
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:22,165
you've only known them
for, like... a week.

423
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,468
But this is not healthy behavior.

424
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:27,003
It is depressing

425
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,506
and, if I'm being honest,

426
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:31,207
a bit scary.

427
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,611
Less scary.

428
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,879
Check.

429
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,747
No, you're not...

430
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,084
Ed, you need to heal.

431
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:43,286
And healing is about moving on.

432
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,291
No doubt you're right.

433
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,328
Of course I'm right.

434
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:00,136
I'll go to where she was taken from me

435
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,339
and say good-bye.

436
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:11,263
Isabelle would want you to be happy.

437
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,451
Isabella.

438
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,355
Of course.

439
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,667
That's good.

440
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,702
That's far enough.

441
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,440
I know what you're thinking, Jim.

442
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,175
You're thinking,

443
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:41,745
"Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes,

444
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,346
"Mr. By-the-book, blow a hole

445
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:46,316
"in this unarmed scumbag?

446
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,452
Could it be that he
actually killed Symon, too?"

447
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,289
You see, I know that you've
been investigating me, Jim.

448
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,393
- Did you kill Symon?
- Is that

449
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,962
what he told you? I know he said
something to you before he died.

450
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,264
Yes, he did.

451
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,967
Probably the truest words
that bastard ever uttered.

452
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,971
And Paulie Pennies?

453
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,372
He chopped up bodies for murderers.

454
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,874
You gonna tell me he didn't deserve it?

455
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,609
That's for the law to decide.

456
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,577
Open your eyes, Jim.

457
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,346
I am the law.

458
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:18,915
What happened to you?

459
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:20,650
How did you become this?

460
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,318
This...

461
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:25,055
is who I've always been.

462
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:29,225
I just needed something to unlock it.

463
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:30,693
What are you talking about?

464
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:33,897
You're just gonna say that I'm sick.

465
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,765
Well, I'm not.

466
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,668
I have never been so clear,

467
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:41,871
so strong in my life.

468
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:44,040
Alice Tetch's virus.

469
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,609
The files on your desk. You're infected.

470
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:49,712
Oh, you are a detective after all.

471
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,414
Don't you see?

472
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,017
This means you're innocent. We c...

473
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,085
we-we can get you help.

474
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:56,386
Can we just skip the part

475
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,288
where you try to get
me to give myself up?

476
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,557
This isn't you. This is the virus.

477
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:02,892
No! I'm not insane.

478
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,628
And you are not seeing the big picture.

479
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:11,056
You're gonna frame me
for Sugar's murder.

480
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:12,969
That's up to you.

481
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,839
I deal in absolutes.

482
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:17,874
Black and white.

483
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,742
Innocence

484
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,211
and guilt.

485
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,048
Gotham, the people of this
city, need men like me,

486
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,783
men who can see what needs to be done

487
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,618
and have the courage to do it.

488
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:31,488
You have it within you

489
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,089
to be one of those men.

490
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,458
You want me to join you?

491
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,228
- Be a part of this?
- Oh, don't be so high and mighty.

492
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,830
You shot Galavan in cold blood.

493
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:42,432
And every day I wish I hadn't!

494
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,601
Thought I didn't have
a choice, but I did.

495
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:48,004
I lost my freedom.

496
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:49,939
I lost Lee.

497
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,008
I'd give anything to take it all back.

498
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:53,877
I didn't say it was easy,

499
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:55,445
Jim.

500
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,147
I said it was right.

501
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:58,848
Day after day, criminals

502
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,850
thumbing their nose at the law.

503
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:03,753
Well, today, I draw a line in the sand.

504
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,455
Only question is...

505
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,026
where do you stand?

506
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,401
Against you.

507
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:23,506
Well, I'm disappointed.

508
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,441
Good-bye, Jim.

509
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:27,210
Hey, Sugar! I got a... Whoa!

510
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,793
The time I knew you
feels like a dream.

511
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:53,953
And now I'm awake.

512
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:57,990
I wish I'd gone on sleeping.

513
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:02,261
I will never forget you, my love.

514
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:12,171
Good-bye, Isabella.

515
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:24,656
We are four blocks from her apartment.

516
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:30,095
Spare some change, sir?

517
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm sorry,

518
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,391
you weren't, perchance, in this
area at 11:00 p.m. last night?

519
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,704
Uh-huh.

520
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:41,163
So d... You saw the accident?

521
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,642
Haven't seen nothin' for 20 years.

522
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,943
But I heard it.

523
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:47,479
Girl screaming, "Help! Help!"

524
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:50,516
- Then bang!
- I'm sorry,

525
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,885
she was screaming before the crash?

526
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:54,720
Well, she were dead after.

527
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:56,147
But you d... you
definitely heard screaming?

528
00:28:56,184 --> 00:29:00,292
Yep. Blood-curdling.

529
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,409
How... odd.

530
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,468
I'll give him the necklace

531
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:12,304
and explain there's no
need for further violence.

532
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:15,774
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

533
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:18,250
I kind of hit him over
the head with a vase.

534
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,978
'Course you did.

535
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:22,648
Door's open.

536
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:30,040
I did not do that.

537
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:31,621
We really got to go.

538
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,694
- Bruce.
- It was the men that came after us.

539
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:37,162
He was killed by the same weapon.

540
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,897
- I thought they worked for him.
- Oh, looks like

541
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:41,066
you were wrong again, Ivy.

542
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:43,235
Can we leave now?

543
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,370
Why is this necklace so important?

544
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:46,705
What'd make someone kill for it?

545
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:48,473
Who cares?!

546
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:52,878
Are you crazy? That's worth $5,000.

547
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:55,380
Whoa.

548
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,950
What is it?

549
00:29:58,017 --> 00:29:59,284
A key.

550
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:08,694
We should really go, Bruce.

551
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:12,931
Oh, my God.

552
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,233
You two are a couple now?

553
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,203
- No.
- Yes.

554
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:20,639
We're not?

555
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:23,075
I'm not talking about this right now.

556
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:25,177
We need to go somewhere right now.

557
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:27,379
And my place is toast,
thanks to this dimwit.

558
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,615
We'll go to my house.

559
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:32,432
You just had to come back.

560
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,064
Alvarez, hey,

561
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:48,100
- what is all this?
- Barnes called in.

562
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,168
Gordon went loco. Shot
an unarmed suspect,

563
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:51,870
then tried taking out Barnes, too.

564
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:53,805
No, no, no, no. This is not right.

565
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:55,273
Harvey, if I was you,

566
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,943
I'd find your partner,
have him come in quiet.

567
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:59,945
Otherwise, he's going down.

568
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,485
Jim? Hey.

569
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:08,954
Where the hell are you? Half
the precinct's looking for you.

570
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:11,289
Barnes killed Symon and Paulie Pennies.

571
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:13,358
And he just murdered someone
right in front of me!

572
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:16,161
What? I was
gone for, like, an hour.

573
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,163
He's infected with Alice Tetch's blood.

574
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,759
He's lost his mind.
He's trying to kill me.

575
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:23,769
- Oh, sweet gentle virgin...
- I need your help, Harvey.

576
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:27,005
- Okay, where are you?
- The old foundry.

577
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:33,211
Jim? Jim?

578
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,213
J...

579
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:40,986
Harvey, what's going on?

580
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:44,356
- They said Jim killed someone?
- It's a lie. It's Barnes.

581
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:47,159
It's Barnes. He's infected
with the Alice Tetch virus.

582
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:49,394
Oh, my God.

583
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:50,829
He was there when she died.

584
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,330
Yeah, and I figure we
got, like, ten minutes

585
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,633
before those trigger-happy
kill-bots find Jim

586
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:55,801
and take him out.

587
00:31:55,868 --> 00:31:56,968
Harvey, you have to tell them.

588
00:31:57,036 --> 00:31:58,770
Come on, they're not gonna believe me.

589
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:01,106
But they will believe
the medical examiner.

590
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:04,943
- What are you asking me to do?
- I need you to trust Jim.

591
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:06,244
Because right now,

592
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,413
you and I are all he has.

593
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,232
Stop!

594
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,303
Sorry, Jim.

595
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:10,709
End of the line.

596
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:32,280
Just as I suspected.

597
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:34,115
The brake lines are cut!

598
00:33:34,183 --> 00:33:35,817
How is it...

599
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,753
that not one single
ignoramus from the GCPD

600
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:40,522
noticed that the brake lines were cut?

601
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,957
I don't know.

602
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,527
Someone paid 'em off.

603
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:47,035
The question is, who?

604
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:49,697
Who has that kind of
money and influence?

605
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:51,738
You don't know.

606
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,435
But I do.

607
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:01,175
End of the line.

608
00:34:03,746 --> 00:34:05,313
No more running.

609
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:10,685
Just in time. In a few moments,

610
00:34:10,753 --> 00:34:13,354
your brothers in arms are
gonna come up those stairs

611
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:15,790
and find your dead body,
and they'll believe me

612
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:19,096
when I tell them that
Jim Gordon is a killer.

613
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:20,895
It's a shame, really.

614
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:23,031
Could've made a great team.

615
00:34:23,098 --> 00:34:25,600
Doesn't have to be this way.

616
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:26,768
You need help.

617
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:29,304
Are those really gonna
be your last words?

618
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:33,141
Nothing to say to Lee?

619
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:37,645
Go to hell.

620
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,150
Captain Barnes!

621
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,985
This is Detective Bullock.

622
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:45,753
You're under arrest.

623
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:47,422
Throw down your weapons

624
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,058
and come out with your hands up.

625
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,626
We know you killed Symon.

626
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:53,628
We know you killed Paulie Pennies.

627
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:57,198
We know you killed the
suspects in the East End.

628
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:59,100
You're infected with the Tetch virus.

629
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:02,070
The M.E. has proof.

630
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:03,705
Now, we don't want any bloodshed, Cap.

631
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,406
It's up to you.

632
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:06,841
No.

633
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:08,276
Thompkins and Bullock.

634
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:11,112
They lied for you.

635
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,881
They turned the whole
damn GCPD against me!

636
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:17,418
We're going in. Come on!

637
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,977
Don't.

638
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,014
You're under arrest.

639
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,916
Drop it.

640
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:50,351
No.

641
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:54,956
Don't make me do this.

642
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:56,958
I'm not making you do anything.

643
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,394
Stand down, Jim. Let me go.

644
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:03,698
If the cops want to hunt me, fine.

645
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:05,433
But you...

646
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:06,768
let me go.

647
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:09,203
I won't do that.

648
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:11,639
You would condemn this city

649
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,007
when I would save it.

650
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:15,977
You've got it all wrong.

651
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:18,279
You're just the same as I am.

652
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:20,014
I just have the guts to admit it.

653
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,916
No.

654
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:23,818
And I'll decide who I am.

655
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,422
Stand down.

656
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:31,693
No.

657
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:36,631
Then it is you that is guilty.

658
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:51,579
Jim, you okay?

659
00:36:53,682 --> 00:36:55,049
Yeah.

660
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:56,751
I'm okay.

661
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:10,950
Holy cow. Don't get any ideas.

662
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:12,318
Okay, Mom.

663
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:14,253
Tomorrow we'll look into
what this all means.

664
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:16,322
Who those men in masks were.

665
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,291
For now, I'll have Alfred
make up beds for you both.

666
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,494
There's food in the
kitchen if you're hungry.

667
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:22,895
I could eat.

668
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:24,497
Surprise.

669
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:31,737
I hope I didn't mess things
up with your boyfriend.

670
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:35,274
I told you, he's not my boyfriend.

671
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,697
What happened?

672
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,699
Are you okay?

673
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:36,302
Yeah.

674
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,504
I'm fine.

675
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:43,476
And Barnes?

676
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:46,112
He's alive.

677
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:49,515
Bullock told me what you did.

678
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,418
- It was nothing.
- No.

679
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:54,553
You could've done nothing.

680
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:56,589
You didn't. I suppose I did

681
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:59,058
fabricate a blood test
stating that my superior

682
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,560
had a psychosis-inducing virus.

683
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:06,632
And I'm glad I did.

684
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,167
Me, too.

685
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,779
I suppose I better get going.

686
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:20,946
Lee?

687
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,187
Thank you.

688
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,703
Oswald!

689
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:47,239
Oswald. I need to speak with you.

690
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:49,143
Yes, but I have to show
you something first.

691
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,544
- This is important.
- So is this.

692
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:56,949
I was not compassionate this morning,

693
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:58,484
and I regret that.

694
00:39:58,552 --> 00:40:02,221
What you are going through is terrible.

695
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:04,423
So...

696
00:40:15,368 --> 00:40:16,602
You put me in your painting.

697
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,804
The artist went off a photograph,

698
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:21,907
but I think it's an excellent likeness.

699
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:25,878
Isabella was murdered.

700
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:28,447
What?

701
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:30,349
I went to the intersection
where she died.

702
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:34,320
It is four blocks from her apartment.

703
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:36,722
Who falls asleep four blocks
from their home? No one.

704
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,825
Also, a very fragrant homeless man

705
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,293
said that he heard her
scream before the crash,

706
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:42,695
so definitely not asleep. Now,

707
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:45,130
if she were awake, why didn't she brake?

708
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:48,467
- Why are there no skid marks?
- E-Ed, you are exhausted,

709
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:49,969
you are, you are emotional...

710
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:52,371
Her brake lines were cut!

711
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,607
Which leaves one conclusion.

712
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,775
Murder.

713
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:58,444
- No.
- Yes.

714
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,980
And I know who did it.

715
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:03,983
Who?

716
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:07,286
Butch.

717
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:11,064
- Butch?
- In retaliation.

718
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,427
For exposing him as the
leader of the Red Hood gang.

719
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,066
That makes perfect sense.

720
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:23,435
I swear to you, Ed, we will

721
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:26,305
find him and make him
pay for what he has done.

722
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:28,440
Thank you.

723
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,744
I knew I could count on you.

724
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:44,890
I feel like this office is cursed.

725
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:47,126
You think Barnes'll be all right?

726
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:49,828
I don't know.

727
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:54,099
I'm sorry I doubted you.

728
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,501
You didn't.

729
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:57,770
Not when it mattered.
