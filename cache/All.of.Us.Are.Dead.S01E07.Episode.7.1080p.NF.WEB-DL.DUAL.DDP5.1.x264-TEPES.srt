1
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,354
<i>Jae-jun,
are you still at the base?</i>

2
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,083
- <i>You're not going anywhere, right?</i>
- Put on your gas masks!

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,776
I won't go there, Mom. Don't worry, okay?

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,860
<i>They said on TV that all
the soldiers were being sent there.</i>

5
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,030
<i>That must include you too.</i>

6
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,241
Why would it? I'm almost discharged.

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,243
When you're about to be discharged,

8
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,245
they don't have you stand guard
or even train.

9
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,580
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,915
<i>Then why did they cancel your last leave?</i>

11
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,501
<i>Do you have any idea how worried I am?</i>

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,378
- <i>You didn't even call...</i>
- Mom.

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,713
<i>Yes? What?</i>

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,797
I gotta go.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,842
<i>Did you go somewhere else
instead of coming home?</i>

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,718
<i>Where are you going?</i>

17
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,471
To play soccer. Bye, Mom.

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,389
<i>Jae-jun!</i>

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,281
<i>What are you doing
playing soccer? What if you get hurt?</i>

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,497
I mean, what do you want me
to do all day? Hmm?

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,290
I'm tired of playing video games.

22
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,584
<i>All you did before
was play video games.</i>

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,859
- Status.
- Clear.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,092
Clear.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,385
Report.

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,138
<i>Control, this is Shadow Gamma.</i>

27
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,641
<i>We cleared all the infected
on the ground floor.</i>

28
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,017
<i>No survivors founded.</i>

29
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,686
<i>We're moving to the third floor.</i>

30
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,694
<i>I can tell you're lying.
You're not playing soccer, are you?</i>

31
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,321
Promise, I am.

32
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,923
Come out. You're safe.

33
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,485
We're saved! Come out.

34
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,611
- Hurry.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,196
- Slowly. Walk. Slowly.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,347
Walk in a single file.
It's safe out there.

37
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,483
<i>Zone three secured.</i>

38
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,609
<i>Two infected sighted.</i>

39
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,737
<i>Copy. Take them down.</i>

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,875
<i>Just please don't go
anywhere that's too dangerous.</i>

41
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,942
<i>Okay? For me?</i>

42
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>I love you, son.</i>

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>You know that, right?</i>

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,698
I love you too, Mom.

45
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,619
I'll see you later, okay?
When I'm discharged.

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,953
<i>Jae-jun.</i>

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,372
<i>Get back safely.</i>

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,791
<i>Make sure to call me later.</i>

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>I'll be waiting, okay?</i>

50
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,936
<i>There's hope.</i>

51
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,981
A small number of white blood cells
were detected in the blood.

52
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,526
Even after full transformation,
the white blood cells remained,

53
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,945
and they were fighting like warriors.

54
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,073
If I raise the body temperature,
I can activate these cells.

55
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,534
Twenty-nine degrees now.

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>In case blood isn't flowing,</i>

57
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>I'll raise the temperature
both internally and externally.</i>

58
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,959
You guys can leave a message
as well if you want to.

59
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,173
I don't really have anything to say.

60
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,342
You?

61
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,187
We trust you.

62
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,315
You can untie it now.

63
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,488
Su-hyeok, I don't know
why you're doing this.

64
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,074
Because the others are really scared.

65
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,412
And you're not scared?

66
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,790
Mm-mm.

67
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,793
Why?

68
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,876
Because...

69
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,504
I'm just not.

70
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,554
You know how I said
I wanted to bite you earlier?

71
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,888
It's okay.

72
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,681
It's in the past now.

73
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,605
It felt like I was dreaming.

74
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,402
You were just giving off
such a beautiful scent.

75
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,654
What kind of scent?

76
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,534
I'm not sure.

77
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,037
It was something
that I had never smelled before.

78
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,251
All I could think about was eating you.

79
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,881
How much I wanted to bite you.

80
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,259
Bite you and eat you.

81
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,222
I only thought...

82
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,771
Then I heard your voice suddenly saying...

83
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,817
<i>Nam-ra.</i>

84
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,199
It was your voice that woke me up.

85
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,037
You know you never called me by my name.

86
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,706
It was always "Hey," or "Prez."

87
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,506
It was the first time you said my name.

88
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,391
I know.

89
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,771
I was afraid you'd know...

90
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,398
if I said your name.

91
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,776
What?

92
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,988
That I like you.

93
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,663
I don't get good grades,

94
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,291
and I used to hang out
with bullies before.

95
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,711
But you, you're a perfect student.

96
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,797
You get good grades.

97
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,427
And you're so pretty.

98
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,071
Su-hyeok.

99
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,908
I like you.

100
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,817
I'm glad...

101
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,196
to know before I die.

102
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,638
NIGHT DUTY ROOM

103
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,518
Hello, sir.

104
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,397
Shit. You scared me.

105
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,442
You're...

106
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,236
You're Seon-yeong, right?

107
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,737
Eun-ji.

108
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,991
Right. Eun-ji, right.

109
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,372
Are you all right?

110
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,748
I am.

111
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,586
Except that I'm starving.

112
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,380
It's driving me crazy.

113
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,424
What?

114
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,926
Hey.

115
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,178
Hey.

116
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,863
Are... are you all right?

117
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,491
You were bitten?

118
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,618
Yeah.

119
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,243
I was.

120
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,172
Okay.

121
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,510
Wow, you must have been so hungry.

122
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,552
Eun-ji.

123
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,265
Jeez. That must have hurt a lot.

124
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,099
Huh?

125
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,312
Guess you should go to the infirmary!

126
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:48,452
Remember what you said
when I said I was an outcast?

127
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,832
"Don't tell me about it.

128
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,335
Go tell your homeroom teacher."

129
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,925
'Cause you didn't want them
to have a committee.

130
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,971
"You're an outcast
because you're so dense."

131
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,724
Do I still seem dense?

132
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,728
Okay, I get it. So get out.

133
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,275
Get out. Please, get out.

134
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Stay there.

135
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,323
Stay back.

136
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,163
Get out.

137
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,208
Get out.

138
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,992
What?

139
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,744
I heard something strange.

140
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,266
- What if she's finally starting to turn?
- Huh?

141
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,510
What if half-bies don't turn?

142
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,936
Oh, my gosh.

143
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,270
My bad.

144
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,483
I hear it.

145
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,861
- What?
- What do you hear?

146
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,908
I think someone is puking.

147
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,250
It stopped.

148
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,799
What stopped?

149
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,802
The sound of puking.

150
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,196
Stop it. You're scaring me.

151
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,825
Don't you hear it?

152
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,952
I'm not hearing anything.

153
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,083
What?

154
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,853
What?

155
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,129
Are you scared?

156
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,212
Stop that.

157
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,799
It's just...

158
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,801
...you're the one breathing the loudest.

159
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,858
I hate this fucking school.

160
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,779
Do you hear that?

161
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,615
All I hear is that zombie.

162
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,693
What?

163
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,503
We should go. It's weird here.

164
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,379
We can't just leave.

165
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,840
There are zombies out there.

166
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,219
We should've gone to the roof
when the music was playing.

167
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,720
Shit.

168
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,804
Music.

169
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,557
Wait a minute. We have music.

170
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,185
What? What music?

171
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,034
<i>Shit.</i>

172
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,841
This is insane.

173
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,392
Oh, what the fuck!

174
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,072
What are you doing
you stupid piece of shit?

175
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,939
You scared me.

176
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,152
Hey, get down. Get down.

177
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,945
Come on, come on. Move your ass.

178
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,531
Get in here. Hurry up.

179
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,908
Get in here.

180
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,410
Get in, you asshole.

181
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,335
- So, you okay?
- Huh?

182
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,588
Where the fuck have you been?

183
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
Me?

184
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,216
Well, obviously, you.

185
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,510
What happened to your eye?

186
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,014
What? My eye?

187
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,101
Get it together, idiot.

188
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,645
What are you looking at, moron?

189
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,647
Listen.

190
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,191
Look. You see that car?

191
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,569
- You're gonna go run in that way.
- Why should I?

192
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,946
Shut up. You run if I say,
you little shit.

193
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,019
You want me to lure the zombies?

194
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,369
Mm-hmm. You go that way and lure them.

195
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,914
I'll go over that way and scream.

196
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,499
Then we run to the snack shop
while they're confused.

197
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,210
Got it?

198
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,920
I'll be going away from the snack shop.

199
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,173
That's why you should run like hell
and circle around.

200
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,966
Okay, come on. Run.

201
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,635
No way.

202
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,553
You chicken shit.

203
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,180
All right, go. Go, come on...

204
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,308
Don't talk to me that way.
I'm not your gopher now either.

205
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,519
Hey. Are you fucking out of your mind?

206
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,272
Snap out of it, will you?

207
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,399
Look at me.

208
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,817
It's me.

209
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,902
Do it.

210
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,284
Fine. I'll go.

211
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,535
Go now.

212
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,997
Hurry the fuck up.

213
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,210
Come with me.

214
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,169
What?

215
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,553
Quiet.

216
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,554
They'll hear you.

217
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,768
Watch this.

218
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,103
Look at it.

219
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,648
You're nothing to me now, got it?

220
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,527
Ah, you stupid chicken shit.

221
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,529
Beg for your life.

222
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,824
Come on.

223
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,869
"Save me." Come on.

224
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,415
Save me. Please, please save me. Please.

225
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,666
No way.

226
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,509
Gwi-nam! Save me, you fucking asshole!

227
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,396
Cheong-san.

228
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,066
I'll gouge your eye out.

229
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,285
We're going to have to build
a tall barricade here,

230
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,203
and then we lure them in with music.

231
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,413
Use the instruments too.

232
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,958
If we leave the door open,
they'll follow the music in.

233
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,336
Once it's clear,
we take the back door up to the roof.

234
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,129
In other words, what you're saying is

235
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,175
we stack desks, chairs, and whatever else
we could find in the middle here.

236
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,387
Open the front door
and run out through the back door, right?

237
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Not here. Farther back.

238
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,017
We need more room on this side.

239
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,227
And why is that?

240
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,772
There aren't that many of us,
but there are lots of zombies.

241
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,397
Ah...

242
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,776
She sucks at school,
but she's pretty smart.

243
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,943
Hey.

244
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,403
It's a compliment.

245
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,824
Let's give it a shot.

246
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,659
We can figure out the rest later.

247
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,745
We have a TV too.

248
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,307
We should be able to connect it
and make it louder.

249
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,249
I will have to look for the cord though.

250
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,252
- Hey, can you help me look, Ji-min?
- Sure.

251
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,633
- Me too.
- It should be over here.

252
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,048
Let's give it a shot.

253
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,009
Guys.

254
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,970
We should untie that.

255
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,889
We should build
a frame first.

256
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,225
I'll do the moving.
You guys work on the frame.

257
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,310
It's okay.

258
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,104
Su-hyeok.

259
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,873
Keep it down.

260
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,399
She'll never be able to get close
to the others this way.

261
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,485
And no one will approach her.

262
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,532
Hatred is contagious.

263
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,660
But so is trust.

264
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,750
Nam-ra.

265
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,557
You should've been the class president.

266
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,723
Come on, let's help out.

267
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,409
Let's go.

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,334
One, two, three.

269
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,052
POLICE

270
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,325
RESTRICTED AREA

271
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,013
Hey. Be quiet.

272
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,096
Keep it down, okay?

273
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,897
They're gonna swarm all over it.

274
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,483
Make sure to build a strong foundation.

275
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,567
Well...

276
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,362
There. Right there. Empty spot.

277
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,748
Fix it down there first.

278
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,460
Maybe that's too big.

279
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,590
Wait, what?

280
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,860
It's looking great.

281
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,748
Ow. Ow, ow!

282
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
Ow, it hurts.

283
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,087
Suck it up.
You're supposed to be a senior.

284
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,215
Why do seniors have to put up
with everything?

285
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,884
I'm not smoking,
and you can't handle that?

286
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,595
- You'll die if you don't smoke?
- Yes, of course.

287
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,478
I feel like I'm going to fucking die,
so you suck it up too, all right?

288
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,432
We'll take the trail.

289
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,850
The one behind the building.

290
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,977
Once we get past the tennis courts,

291
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,872
we can go through the construction site
and up the mountain.

292
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,649
Do you think we can make it?

293
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,360
I'm not sure.

294
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,820
Motherfucker.

295
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,362
Min-jae.

296
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,991
If you don't think he'll make it,
drop him and shoot, okay?

297
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,952
Okay.

298
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,287
Are you talking about me?

299
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,958
- Let's go.
- Up, on three.

300
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,795
Ready? One, two, three!

301
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,630
Hold on. Wait.

302
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,298
Hold on.

303
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,426
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

304
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,514
Hey. If you drop this.
You pick them up, okay?

305
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,559
Let's go.

306
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,270
One, two, three.

307
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,914
Oh, he's so heavy!

308
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,898
Shit.

309
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,951
Hold on.

310
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,917
Ow. Wait. Hold on.

311
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,464
Hey. Look, it broke! What do we do?

312
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,883
- Get back in. Hurry! Get back!
- Back in?

313
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,884
- Back! Get back!
- Back. Damn it!

314
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,388
They're coming! Hurry.

315
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,602
Oh, shit.

316
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,482
Hey. Go without me. Okay?

317
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,565
Idiot.

318
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,860
You can't take me anyway.

319
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,697
You'll post about it on Facebook
if we leave you..

320
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,948
I won't.

321
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,074
I don't trust you.

322
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,160
Stop pretending to care.

323
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,412
You killed Ha-lim.

324
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,502
You don't care about anyone.

325
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,045
You're such a dick.

326
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,675
Let's try once again. Stronger this time.

327
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,385
Okay.

328
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,774
What the hell do you want from me anyway?

329
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:22,028
It hurts like crazy.
Do you know what dying feels like?

330
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,197
Yeah.

331
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,616
I feel that way every single time
I take a test.

332
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,910
But...

333
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,622
I can only take so much of your pain.

334
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,583
Shut up and be quiet, all right?

335
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,964
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

336
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,472
You're okay? Doesn't hurt?

337
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,519
Sergeant...

338
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,064
you know...

339
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,817
I'm thinking that
we should probably use our skills

340
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,861
to get ourselves out of here first.

341
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,464
And then they can send
the army in for the kids after, you know?

342
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,073
I think that makes more sense.

343
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,615
Sergeant?

344
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,120
If we all die,

345
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,265
who's going to tell them
about the important laptop...

346
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,832
Ho-seong.

347
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,958
Ho-cheol.

348
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,042
Ho-cheol.

349
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,422
Do you know why some people run
to safety when they are in danger?

350
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,177
Because there are others
who are running into danger for them.

351
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,055
Why put ourselves in danger
if there's no reason to?

352
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,641
You're so frustrating.

353
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,768
I ought to just...

354
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,314
If you die,
I'll put in a request with the higher-ups

355
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,983
for a statue of you as big as the one
of Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

356
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,318
Okay? Happy?

357
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,987
What's with this guy?

358
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,699
If you're feeling scared,
you could just stay here.

359
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,869
Goodness. Very well put. Yes.

360
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,749
Okay, listen.
We're gonna leave together now.

361
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,627
We're gonna go zoom on the motorcycle, hm?

362
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,795
What about Mommy?

363
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,304
Well, your mommy...

364
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,099
Let's just come back for her later, okay?

365
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,649
My son is about your age.
He's very handsome.

366
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,484
I can introduce you to him if you like.

367
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,445
I already have a boyfriend though.

368
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,326
Uh... Hey, what did I say to do
once we go out?

369
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,413
You said to keep my eyes shut tightly
and hold onto you.

370
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,249
That's right. Good girl. Very good.

371
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,335
Are you ready?

372
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,294
Uh, no.

373
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,675
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

374
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,971
Go faster! Faster!

375
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,098
- Speed up! Speed up!
- Shut up!

376
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,742
You're drawing them to us,
you fucking idiot!

377
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,310
Shut up, I say!

378
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,854
Quiet, asshole!

379
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,232
Watch it. Oh, my god!

380
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,298
- They're coming!
- Oh, they're right behind us!

381
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,240
Look ahead, dipshit!

382
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,662
Turn! Turn, turn!

383
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,414
Go!

384
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,374
- Turn! Turn!
- Where? Where?

385
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,297
Just go this way, sir. This way. Go.

386
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,152
Watch out! Watch out! Careful!

387
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,302
Right! Go right!

388
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,140
Oh, a dead-end!

389
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,267
- What do we do?
- Wait.

390
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,767
Wait, no! There's a way!

391
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,955
- Oh, my god. There is?
- There is!

392
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,980
Let's go.

393
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,606
Hey, what are you...

394
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,775
Stop doing that.

395
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,279
Right here you fuckers!

396
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,572
Go!

397
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,162
Yeah!

398
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,726
Se-bin, we're saved!

399
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,793
Pipe down
unless you want more of them.

400
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,377
Help me!

401
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,796
Huh? What?

402
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,232
- Here, over here!
- What's that sound?

403
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,050
- Please help.
- Hear that?

404
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,133
Here!

405
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,510
Look up! Over here!

406
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,178
Over here.

407
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,990
- Help me!
- What is that?

408
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,432
Hey, you idiot!

409
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,476
Idiot, asshole.

410
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,414
- What the?
- What took you so long?

411
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,000
- All right, hang on.
- Sergeant, let's just go. Come on.

412
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,651
- Huh?
- Let's just go. Come on, please.

413
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,975
Please help me.

414
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,321
Just go. Let's go.

415
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,007
Do you have
something to drink?

416
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,115
Ooh. There's more, look.

417
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,492
What? Where?

418
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,162
Ah, there's nothing.

419
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,290
Can you climb down?

420
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,084
No. I hurt my leg.

421
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,252
- I can't get down.
- Let's just go.

422
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,254
Come on, please. Let's go.

423
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,236
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

424
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,398
- What are you gonna do?
- There.

425
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,180
- Here, take the baby.
- Huh?

426
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,307
Hurry, sir. Please.

427
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,643
- Hold on.
- What are you gonna do?

428
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,726
Stay still.

429
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,938
Stay right here.

430
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,357
Bring the bike close. Shit.

431
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,040
Yeah, climb up that way.

432
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,361
Bring it close. Asshole.

433
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,363
Come here. Hurry. Hurry.

434
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,739
Fuck this.

435
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,450
Ho-cheol! Ho-cheol!

436
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,409
- Where is he going?
- Stop it!

437
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,661
Ho-cheol! Wait!

438
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,097
Where the hell
is he going?

439
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,374
- College boy! Stop!
- Get back here, you moron.

440
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,729
All right. I think this is good enough.

441
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,439
Okay.

442
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,068
Aren't you guys coming?

443
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,320
We left a gap over there for you.

444
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,656
Let's go.

445
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
Why aren't you coming over?

446
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,423
Well, someone has to stay
to open the door.

447
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,386
Couldn't you have come up
with a better plan?

448
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,387
It's okay.

449
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,807
- I'll come over right away.
- Wait.

450
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,142
I'll come.

451
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,643
It's fine.

452
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,312
It is not fine.

453
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,229
Here.

454
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,995
What happened with you and Gwi-nam?

455
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,372
He said he was gonna kill you.

456
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,836
Shit.

457
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,506
It's because I saw him
killing the principal.

458
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,178
I said I was going to tell the cops,
so he tried to kill me.

459
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,597
Prick.

460
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,108
Gwi-nam's dead.

461
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,944
Yeah?

462
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,153
Mm-hm.

463
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,114
He fell from up high
when I was fighting him.

464
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,203
- And I'm in love with Nam-ra.
- Huh?

465
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,248
I've liked Nam-ra for a while now.

466
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,331
You have?

467
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,751
You be good to On-jo, okay?

468
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,546
Don't treat her like she's a guy, moron.

469
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,926
You ready? I'll do it.

470
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,554
Go. Get over there.

471
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,681
Go.

472
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,211
Oh, shit.

473
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,881
Dae-su, you got to make some noise!

474
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,425
Die, zombies!

475
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:10,848
Fucking die!

476
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,393
Do it one more time.

477
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,603
Shit.

478
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,606
Stupid zombies.

479
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:25,446
Motherfuckers!

480
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,670
Wu-jin!

481
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,715
We can't go yet! Not yet.

482
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,315
Nam-ra!

483
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,374
It's not going to hold up!

484
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,836
Shit.

485
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,550
How much longer is it gonna take?
Let's go!

486
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,805
A little more. Not yet!

487
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,170
We need to study him
to create a treatment or a vaccine,

488
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,589
but we don't have equipment or scientists.

489
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,175
We'll have to take him to the KDCA.

490
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,471
He cannot leave the quarantine zone

491
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,234
under any circumstances,
do you understand?

492
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,226
Find scientists and build the facility.

493
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,354
We will airlift all necessary equipment.

494
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,609
- What's his name?
- Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun.

495
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,363
A week away from discharge,
but he volunteered for the operation.

496
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,950
Get his parents consent to do research.

497
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,496
We're under martial law,
we don't need his parent's consent.

498
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,957
If you decide to give consent,

499
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,502
we can begin the experiment
or autopsy right away.

500
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,587
I said call his parents.

501
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,715
Even under martial law,

502
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,301
that's our duty
for taking away their child.

503
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,262
Yes, sir.

504
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,610
Commander, sir.

505
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,321
There's assemblywoman awaiting testing.

506
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,282
She has to follow rules.

507
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,034
It's Park Eun-hee
from the National Defense Committee.

508
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,953
Damn it.

509
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,589
I'm the commander here.

510
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,217
Nice to meet you. I'm...

511
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,469
Even if you are
an assemblywoman,

512
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,014
around here you're not going
to get any special treatment.

513
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,600
That's all I came to tell you.

514
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,352
Don't bother these people
trying to do their jobs.

515
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,231
I'd appreciate it
if you'd stay quiet and follow the rules.

516
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,610
That's fine. I have a favor to ask though.

517
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,112
Please send a chopper
to Hyosan High School.

518
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,032
There's a firefighter on his way there.
He's by himself.

519
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,826
Commander. Hey. Wait!

520
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,163
You got to send the helicopter
to the high school.

521
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,956
We have to save the children!

522
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,127
Even wars can't rid of schools.

523
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,505
Even if you win,
if the schools are gone, we've lost.

524
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,729
How many students
have we saved so far?

525
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,066
So far, zero sir.

526
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,234
We don't think anyone got out

527
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,612
because all the students
were in class at that time.

528
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,657
Are choppers available?

529
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,159
No, sir. They've all been sent
on missions.

530
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,417
Request a Black Hawk immediately.
Have them scan high schools in Hyosan.

531
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,003
Absolutely, sir.

532
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,131
MAP OF HYOSAN

533
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,812
Gangha-dong as well?

534
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,275
Isn't that where your mother's house is?

535
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,408
Once he's named in the rescue zone,
we can check there.

536
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,327
Okay, sir.

537
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,180
Clear. We have to go now!

538
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,478
Hurry!

539
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,316
Hey, let's go!

540
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,404
- Go!
- You go first.

541
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,457
I'm gonna shit my pants. Go!

542
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,006
- Come on.
- Let's go.

543
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,404
Hurry.

544
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,205
Move!

545
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,140

00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,109
<i>I'll go to Hyosan High.</i>

550
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,332
Come on.

551
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,675
Over here! Over here!

552
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,176
Here! I'm here!

553
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,304
Over here!

554
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,771
Come on, open it.

555
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,357
It's locked.

556
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,817
What?

557
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,944
Move.

558
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,661
Wait. Get back. Move.

559
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,250
Shit.

560
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,338
Is anyone there?

561
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,173
Anyone?

562
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,176
Is anyone there? Anyone?

563
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,885
Open the door!

564
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,639
Of course not! Get back.

565
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,184
One, two, three!

566
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,310

THE ROOFTOP IS OFF LIMITS TO STUDENTS

568
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,819
Fuck.

569
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:13,992
Hear that?

570
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,327
What?

571
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,918
<i>We're outcasts again.</i>

572
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,753
And this is still hell.

573
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,672
I really hope everyone dies.

574
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,964
All of them.

575
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,561
<i>Mom.</i>

<i>Dad, you're okay too, right?</i>

578
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,984
I'm...

579
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,530
I'm doing good.

580
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,157
<i>Mom.</i>

581
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,704
Cheongsan Chicken
still sounds stupid, by the way.

582
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,791
If it were Cheongsan Auto, Cheongsan Group
or Cheongsan Air

<i>that be different,</i>

Throw this over!

591
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,814

Where are the others?

597
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,513
Isn't there anyone else?
