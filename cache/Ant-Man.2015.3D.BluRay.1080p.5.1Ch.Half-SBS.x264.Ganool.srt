
1
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:20,896
Stark!

2
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,980
He doesn't seem happy. Hello, Hank.

3
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:29,153
- You're supposed to be in Moscow.
- I took a detour...

4
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,323
through your defense lab.

5
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,270
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

6
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:39,529
That depends if you think it's a poor
attempt to replicate my work.

7
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:42,799
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

8
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:45,549
You were instructed to go to Russia.
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,

9
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:47,770
- that you're a soldier...
- I'm a scientist.

10
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:52,108
Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the
most revolutionary science ever developed.

11
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:55,745
- Help us put it to good use.
- I let you turn me into your errand boy,

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,148
and now you try to steal my research?

13
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:02,219
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

14
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:08,925
Easy, Hank.

15
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:15,115
You mention my wife again
and I'll show you ferocity.

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,683
Don't look at me. You said it.

17
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,525
- I formally tender my resignation.
- We don't accept it. Formally.

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,675
Hank... we need you.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,480
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.
Don't let your past determine the future.

20
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:33,583
As long as I am alive,

21
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:37,087
nobody will ever get that formula.

22
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:45,862
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

23
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:47,998
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

24
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,799
Yes.

25
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:52,752
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

26
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,838
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

27
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:58,321
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,645
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.
He's no security risk.

29
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:05,582
Unless we make him one.

30
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:47,107
You like that? You like that?

31
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:49,566
Come get you some now.

32
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:02,923
- You didn't even move.
- Nah.

33
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:06,476
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here. You see this right here?

34
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:18,822
- I'm gonna miss you, Scott.
- I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

35
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:22,458
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,797
- All right, break it up.
- Break it up! Break it up!

37
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:46,983
Scotty! What's up, man!

38
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:51,121
- Damn! Hey.
- Hey, man.

39
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,390
Hey, what's up with your eye?

40
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:57,127
Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

41
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,362
Oh, yeah. I still got my scar
from a year ago.

42
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:01,698
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:04,434
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

44
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,597
Well, I definitely didn't.

45
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:08,763
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

46
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:11,337
Bro, you think I'm gonna
miss my celly getting out?

47
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:13,944
- Hey, how's your girl, man?
- Oh, she left me.

48
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:16,880
- Oh.
- Yeah, my ma died, too.

49
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:19,733
And my dad got deported.

50
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,718
But I got the van!

51
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,953
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

52
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:26,389
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

53
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,558
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

54
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:31,127
- You're gonna be on your feet in no time.
- I hope so.

55
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:34,430
Yeah. And I gotta introduce you
to some people. Some really skilled people.

56
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,032
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

57
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,568
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

58
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:42,305
I got a daughter to take care of.

59
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,174
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

60
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:47,411
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

61
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,345
I'm gonna be fine.

62
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,500
<i>Y la verdad se acabó. Se quedó.</i>

63
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:56,442
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins. Would you like
to try our Mango Fruit Blast?

64
00:04:56,567 --> 00:05:00,693
No, thanks. I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

65
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,926
Oh, we don't... we don't make that.

66
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:06,229
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

67
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:08,198
It's ice cream. Baskin-Robbins.

68
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,768
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

69
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,171
- Dude.
- Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.

70
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,440
Sure thing, Dale.

71
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,711
Darby, could you just...
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

72
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:27,584
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in. Pull up some chair.

73
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,589
- Three years at San Quentin?
- You found out.

74
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:35,825
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

75
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,962
Look, I'm sorry, all right? But I...
No one would hire me.

76
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:42,365
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

77
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,269
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't do it anymore. I just...

78
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:49,639
Respect. I couldn't be happier about it.

79
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,687
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,076
Thank you. Thank you.

81
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,745
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

82
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,464
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

83
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,836
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?
I'm in charge of this guy?"

84
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,920
Well, I'm very happy in this job, and...

85
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:10,552
- I really just appreciate the opportunity...
- Well, you're fired, of course.

86
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,379
I can't really keep you on.

87
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,749
- Wait, what? Fired?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,451
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

89
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,354
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

90
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,992
I'll tell you what, though. This'll be
totally off the books, off the records,

91
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:30,363
but if you want to grab one of those Mango
Fruit Blasts on your way out the door,

92
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:32,999
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

93
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:14,941
Hey, Scotty. What's up? I thought
you were supposed to be at work.

94
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:18,778
- I was. I got fired.
- Damn. They find out who you are?

95
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:21,814
- Yeah.
- Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.

96
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,716
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

97
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,053
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

98
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:31,724
Oh. That's Kurt. He was Folsom for five
years. He's a wizard on that laptop.

99
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:35,075
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,731
- Who are you?
- Dave.

101
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,267
Nice work on the Vista job.

102
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:45,355
Vista job, yes. No, no.
I have heard of this robbery.

103
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,875
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,544
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

105
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,347
- You mean you're a pussy.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:57,784
They were overcharging the customers,
right? And it added up to millions.

107
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,587
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.
And what does he do?

108
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,523
He hacks into the security system

109
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:06,159
and transfers millions back to the people
that they stole it from.

110
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,328
Posts all the bank records online.

111
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:11,754
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

112
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,526
What are you doing?

113
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:21,006
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys? What do you want?

114
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,914
Okay. My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago...

115
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,479
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

116
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,815
No, no, no. Wait! This guy...
This guy fits your M.O.

117
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,252
No! I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

118
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,587
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

119
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:38,651
- It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!
- I don't care. I'm out.

120
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:01,240
- Dr. Pym?
- Yes. I'm still alive.

121
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,045
ID?

122
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,156
Perhaps that will suffice.

123
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,389
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

124
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,443
Is that Hank Pym?

125
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,865
Good morning, Hank.

126
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:32,278
Hope. Would it kill you to call me Dad?

127
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:35,581
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that you
could find the time to join us today.

128
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:38,418
More like "thrilled."

129
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:42,622
I was surprised to receive any kind
of invitation from you, Darren.

130
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:47,151
- What's the occasion?
- Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

131
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,257
We're ready for you inside.

132
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,926
Ouch.

133
00:09:55,393 --> 00:10:00,765
I guess some old wounds never heal?
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

134
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,570
You're in for a treat.

135
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:11,110
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

136
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,378
How's your face?

137
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,350
After you.

138
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:29,001
Now, before we start, I'd like
to introduce a very special guest.

139
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:32,998
This company's founder and my mentor,
Dr. Hank Pym.

140
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:52,892
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,
I immediately started researching a particle

141
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:55,761
that could change the distance
between atoms,

142
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:59,098
while increasing density and strength.

143
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:03,871
Why this revolutionary idea remained
buried beneath the dust and cobwebs

144
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,606
of Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

145
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,508
But just imagine,

146
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:13,205
a soldier the size of an insect.

147
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:18,010
The ultimate secret weapon.

148
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,490
An Ant-Man.

149
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,327
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

150
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:41,140
Silly, I know.

151
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:44,837
Propaganda. Tales to astonish!

152
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:50,964
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.
Hank... will you tell our guests

153
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,481
what you told me
every single time I asked you,

154
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,725
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

155
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,627
Just a tall tale.

156
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:05,891
Right. Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

157
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,845
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

158
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,748
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

159
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:26,244
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

160
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,047
Could that be done?

161
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:33,252
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

162
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:40,750
Distinguished guests, I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

163
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,627
The Yellowjacket!

164
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:49,386
Oh, no.

165
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:53,112
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

166
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,048
capable of altering the size
of the wearer

167
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:58,410
for the ultimate combat advantage.

168
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:02,772
<i>We live in an era in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

169
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:05,458
<i>are undermined by constant surveillance.</i>

170
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,110
<i>It's time to return to a simpler age.</i>

171
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:11,652
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

172
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,533
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

173
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,901
<i>An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,</i>

174
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:19,892
<i>the Yellowjacket can manage any conflict
on the geopolitical landscape</i>

175
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,075
<i>completely unseen.</i>

176
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,179
<i>Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.</i>

177
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:31,784
<i>Practical applications include
surveillance, industrial sabotage,</i>

178
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:36,188
<i>and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.</i>

179
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:38,504
<i>A single Yellowjacket offers the user</i>

180
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:42,128
<i>unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.</i>

181
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:45,097
<i>And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets</i>

182
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:50,242
<i>will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.</i>

183
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,364
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

184
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,632
So, it's a suit?

185
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:03,015
Don't be crude, Frank.
It's not a suit, it's a... it's a vessel.

186
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,987
- What's the matter? You're not impressed?
- No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

187
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:11,056
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

188
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:13,426
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

189
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,920
I really value your opinion.

190
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,831
Thank you for coming. Hope?

191
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:22,694
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now. Thank you.

192
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:28,976
- You seem a bit shocked.
- Darren...

193
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,777
there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

194
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:34,647
So you finally admit it!

195
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:38,918
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

196
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,519
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

197
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:43,022
Don't do this.

198
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,550
Dr. Cross?

199
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,195
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

200
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,824
- I can have the cash here in two weeks.
- Deal.

201
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,342
We have to make our move, Hank.

202
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:07,113
- How close is he?
- He still can't shrink a live subject.

203
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:09,948
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

204
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:13,052
- No.
- I have Cross' complete trust.

205
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:15,755
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

206
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,907
Well, that's not entirely true.

207
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,720
I think I found a guy.

208
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,756
Who?

209
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,971
- Daddy!
- Peanut!

210
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,239
Happy birthday!

211
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:37,076
I'm so sorry I'm late. I didn't know
what time your party started.

212
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:38,677
It was on the invitation.

213
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:42,081
He didn't get an invitation.
But he came anyway!

214
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:45,150
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

215
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,653
- I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.
- Oh, you don't...

216
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:50,623
What are you doing here, Lang?
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

217
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,659
- Right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.
- It's good to see you too, Paxton.

218
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,021
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

219
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,333
Hey, look what I have for you.

220
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,563
- Can I open it now?
- Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

221
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,727
- <i>You're my bestest friend.</i>
- What is that thing?

222
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:16,115
He's so ugly! I love him!

223
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,719
- Can I go show my friends?
- Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

224
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:21,987
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

225
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:25,913
The child support is coming. It's just hard
finding a job when you have a record.

226
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:28,928
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

227
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,529
- It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

228
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,082
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

229
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:36,752
- You can't just show up here. You know that.
- It's a birthday party.

230
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:39,305
- Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.
- She's my daughter.

231
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,240
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

232
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:45,344
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

233
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,214
- Your fiance is an asshat.
- He's not an asshat.

234
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,383
- Watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat."

235
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,311
Stop it.

236
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:56,255
Really, Maggie? That guy?

237
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,358
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

238
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:01,052
At least he's not a crook.

239
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,893
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight. I had a job and...

240
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:13,338
I wanna provide. I had a lot of time
to think about it and I love her.

241
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:18,009
So much. I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

242
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:19,570
What do I do?

243
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:23,949
Get an apartment, get a job,
pay child support.

244
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:27,186
And then we will talk
about visitation, I promise.

245
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,622
You're her hero, Scott.

246
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:34,886
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

247
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:01,513
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

248
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,123
Yeah. Well...

249
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:09,020
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

250
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,488
It'd be nice though, right?

251
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,534
- But there are laws.
- What laws? Of man?

252
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,070
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

253
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,265
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

254
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:26,638
Darren, I don't think you understand...

255
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,580
We still haven't worked out
all the bugs.

256
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:42,457
Goodbye, Frank.

257
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,835
Thank you.

258
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,749
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about gratitude lately.

259
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:07,619
And today, during my morning meditation,
an interesting thought occurred to me,

260
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:10,256
- and I think it might apply to you, too.
- How's that?

261
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,517
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

262
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,329
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

263
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:20,199
I devoted my genius to him.

264
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,477
I could have worked anywhere.

265
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,204
I chose my mentor poorly.

266
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,436
You didn't even have a choice.

267
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:30,068
He never believed in you.

268
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:35,500
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

269
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:39,118
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

270
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,738
Because his failures as a mentor,

271
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:44,941
as a father,

272
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:48,553
forced us to spread our wings.

273
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,666
You're a success, Darren.

274
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:57,261
You deserve everything coming your way.

275
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:19,917
Stop cheating.

276
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,353
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

277
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,130
Maybe he didn't hear you.

278
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:27,270
How was the party?

279
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,591
- Tell me about that tip.
- What?

280
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:40,079
- I wanna know about that tip.
- Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

281
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:44,108
Calm down, all right? I just need to know
where it came from. It's gotta be airtight.

282
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:48,353
Okay. I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

283
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,622
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds.

284
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,958
But there was a rose that saved
the day. It was delightful.

285
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,561
<i>And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.</i>

286
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,963
<i>It was actually the first pair
of boobs I ever touched.</i>

287
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:02,335
It's the wrong details. It's the wrong...
It has nothing to do with the story. Go.

288
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,738
<i>So... he tells me that she's working
as a housekeeper now, right?</i>

289
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:10,176
<i>And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.</i>

290
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:13,378
<i>And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.</i>

291
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,847
<i>Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

292
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,950
<i>that is all retired now,
but he's loaded.</i>

293
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:21,787
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

294
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:23,422
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

295
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:27,025
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

296
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,996
<i>"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."</i>

297
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,265
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

298
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,500
Of course, I ask him...

299
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:38,003
<i>"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"</i>

300
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:41,774
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.
All she said is that it's super-legit</i>

301
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:44,035
<i>"and whatever's in it,
it's gotta be good."</i>

302
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:50,608
- What?
- Old man have safe.

303
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,243
- And he's gone for a week.
- All right.

304
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,921
There's an old man, he's got a safe,
and he's gone for a week.

305
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:58,716
- Let's just work with that.
- You know what I'm saying?

306
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:52,911
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed. No one
will be making for distress call tonight.

307
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:53,979
Comm check.

308
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:55,414
- Check.
- Check.

309
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,649
If the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

310
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:01,245
Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.

311
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,350
I love it when he gets cocky.

312
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:12,590
Damn!

313
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:42,520
- Alarm is dead.
- Nice.

314
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:47,175
<i>All right, I'm moving through the house.</i>

315
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:15,143
- There's a fingerprint lock on the door.
- <i>It's got a what?</i>

316
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:19,030
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing
about that. Man, are we screwed?

317
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,125
Not necessarily.

318
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,232
I'm in.

319
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:13,444
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

320
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:20,959
- Oh, man.
- <i>What is it?</i>

321
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,929
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

322
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:26,197
<i>How serious are we talking, Scotty?</i>

323
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:29,418
It's a Carbondale. It's from 1910.

324
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:32,253
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

325
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:36,490
- Can you crack it?
- Well, here's the thing.

326
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:39,928
It doesn't do so well in the cold.
Remember what that iceberg did?

327
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,848
- Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.
- Killed everybody.

328
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:46,711
Did not kill the old lady. She still
throw the jewel into the oceans.

329
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:39,956
<i>What are you doing?</i>

330
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:43,508
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

331
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,011
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

332
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,529
- <i>What are you doing now?</i>
- Waiting.

333
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:51,865
Waiting.

334
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:01,177
Nice.

335
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:06,290
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

336
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,581
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

337
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:13,171
- It's a suit.
- What?

338
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:15,433
It's an old motorcycle suit.

339
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:19,821
- There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?
- No.

340
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:24,315
- It's a bust.
- I'm really sorry, Scotty.

341
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,144
I know you needed to score.

342
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,248
- I thought we were using mice.
- What's the difference?

343
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:11,029
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

344
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,431
Darren, maybe we should think...

345
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,966
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

346
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,728
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

347
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:45,808
Experiment 34-C results,

348
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,874
negative.

349
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,899
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

350
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,545
Why would you lock this up?

351
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,835
This is so weird.

352
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,563
Scotty, what's up, man?

353
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,243
I wonder... what is this?

354
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:46,584
<i>The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?</i>

355
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:49,646
What? Who said that?

356
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,295
Luis, down here!

357
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,249
<i>It's a trial by fire, Scott.</i>

358
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,810
<i>Or, in this case... water.</i>

359
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:29,052
<i>Guess you're tougher than you thought.</i>

360
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:32,723
Oh, I don't want to see this!

361
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:35,397
Luis!

362
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:40,697
Son of a...

363
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,210
What the hell?

364
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:02,620
<i>Not bad for a test drive.</i>

365
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:04,889
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

366
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,118
No, no. No. No thank you.

367
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:22,355
Get down on the ground!
You are under arrest!

368
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,976
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

369
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:30,874
Don't move.

370
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:38,189
You know, you almost had us convinced
that you were gonna change your ways.

371
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:41,018
They were really rooting for you.

372
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:44,655
It's gonna break their hearts.

373
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:48,940
You got a visitor.

374
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:51,228
- Who?
- Your lawyer.

375
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:53,965
My lawyer?

376
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:59,229
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

377
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:03,407
I'm starting to think that you prefer
the inside of a jail cell.

378
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:07,474
- Man.
- Sit down.

379
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:13,324
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

380
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:17,588
- I don't even wanna know why you have it.
- Maggie was right about you.

381
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:19,646
How do you know...

382
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:23,007
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

383
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:26,797
The moment things get hard,
you turn right back to crime.

384
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:31,509
The way I see it, you have a choice.

385
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,779
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison...

386
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:37,415
or go back to your cell...

387
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,951
and await further instructions.

388
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:43,388
- I don't understand.
- No, I don't expect you to.

389
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:48,972
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly, neither do I.

390
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:52,964
Why do you think I let you steal
that suit in the first place?

391
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,191
What?

392
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,712
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

393
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:10,615
So, next time you think
you might see one,

394
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,346
I suggest you take
a real close look at it.

395
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,400
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

396
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:31,569
Are you sure you don't want
a different toy?

397
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:34,138
No, I love this one.

398
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:37,475
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

399
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,077
Mommy?

400
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:41,779
Is Daddy a bad man?

401
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:44,775
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

402
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:47,585
No.

403
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,881
Daddy just gets confused
sometimes, you know?

404
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:45,302
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

405
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,428
<i>Under the door.</i>

406
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:53,918
Okay, where to now?

407
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:56,246
- <i>Hang tight.</i>
- Oh, God.

408
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,024
What... what?

409
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:02,293
- Where the hell did he go?
- I have no idea. He just vanished.

410
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,295
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

411
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,933
- Get back! Get back! Get back!
- <i>Scott, these are my associates.</i>

412
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:12,336
What? Is that a camera on an ant?
Yeah, sure. Why not?

413
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:16,667
- Where's the car?
- <i>No car. We've got wings. Incoming!</i>

414
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:28,987
<i>Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.</i>

415
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:32,721
- Are you ki... How safe is...
- <i>Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

416
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,772
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

417
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:50,641
<i>So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.</i>

418
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,212
- All right. Now, what's the next move?
- <i>Hang on tight.</i>

419
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:57,882
This is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

420
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:01,152
- <i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>
- Wait, his name is 247?

421
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:03,154
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

422
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:06,006
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

423
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:10,962
- <i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>
- No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

424
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:13,130
<i>No, I think it's 247.</i>

425
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:15,366
- Wait.
- <i>Hang on tight!</i>

426
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:18,334
- I think I'm getting the hang of this.
- <i>I am controlling 247.</i>

427
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,272
- <i>He is not listening to you.</i>
- What?

428
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:24,033
- Can I make one little request?
- <i>No.</i>

429
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:27,278
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

430
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:28,746
Time out.

431
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,950
All right, hold on. Just wait!

432
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,152
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

433
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:37,521
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

434
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:40,091
Let's set her down, all right?
I'm getting light-headed.

435
00:38:40,216 --> 00:38:41,859
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

436
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:46,080
I'm getting a little light...
I need a snooze button.

437
00:38:46,355 --> 00:38:48,959
Hit me in 5 minutes.

438
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,812
Hello.

439
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:13,383
Who are you?

440
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:18,229
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep this whole time?

441
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:21,232
- Yes.
- Why?

442
00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:24,494
Because the last time you were here
you stole something.

443
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:28,472
Hey, look...

444
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,750
Paraponera clavata.

445
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,984
Giant tropical bullet ants,
ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index.

446
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:42,987
They're here to keep an eye
on you when I can't.

447
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,689
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

448
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:47,384
Who?

449
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:51,508
Hey!

450
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,524
Whose pajamas are these?

451
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,365
How am I supposed to do this?

452
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:11,065
All right, just one step at a time.

453
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:20,850
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

454
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,297
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

455
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:27,895
We don't need this guy.

456
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,401
I assume that you've already met
my daughter, Hope.

457
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:32,870
I did. She's great.

458
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:36,861
- She doesn't think that we need you.
- We don't. We can do this ourselves.

459
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:42,780
I go to all this effort to let you steal
my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.

460
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:45,883
Okay, we can try this
and when he fails, I'll do it myself.

461
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:47,852
She's a little bit anxious.

462
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:52,056
It has to do with this job, which, judging
by the fact that you're sitting opposite me,

463
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:55,393
- I take it that you're interested in.
- What job?

464
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,647
Would you like some tea?

465
00:40:57,772 --> 00:40:59,196
Sure.

466
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:03,694
I was very impressed with how you managed
to get past my security system.

467
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:07,992
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

468
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:12,777
- Were you watching me?
- Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

469
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:15,205
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

470
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,510
Excuse me. "Burgled" Vista Corp.

471
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,923
Vista's security system was one
of the most advanced in the business.

472
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:29,727
It was supposed to be unbeatable.
But you beat it.

473
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:33,356
- Would you like some sugar?
- Yeah, thanks.

474
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,095
You know what? I'm okay.

475
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,975
How do you make them do that?

476
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,878
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

477
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:51,482
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

478
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,910
Right. But how do you make them do that?

479
00:41:55,845 --> 00:42:01,351
I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate
their olfactory nerve center.

480
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,575
I speak to them.

481
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,542
I can go anywhere, hear anything,
and see everything.

482
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,951
And still know absolutely nothing.

483
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:13,434
I'm late to meet Cross.

484
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:20,178
- Dr. Pym?
- You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

485
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:23,247
Sorry, I just have one question.

486
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:27,298
Who are you, who is she, what the hell's
going on, and can I go back to jail now?

487
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,669
Come with me.

488
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:34,050
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

489
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:38,796
I learned how to change the distance
between atoms. That's what powers the suit.

490
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,524
That's why it works.

491
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:52,802
But it was dangerous.
It was too dangerous.

492
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:56,245
So I hid it from the world.

493
00:42:56,505 --> 00:43:00,384
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

494
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:03,321
- Pym Tech.
- Yes.

495
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:07,491
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

496
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:09,794
Darren Cross. He's a big deal.

497
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:12,396
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

498
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:16,734
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

499
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,103
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

500
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:22,973
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

501
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:26,814
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

502
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:29,998
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

503
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:33,027
But I wouldn't help him.
So he conspired against me

504
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,187
- and he voted me out of my own company.
- How could he do that?

505
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:39,857
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

506
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:41,401
She was the deciding vote.

507
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:48,791
But she came back to me when she saw
how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

508
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,702
The process is highly volatile.

509
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:54,768
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

510
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:57,650
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

511
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:00,644
I don't think Darren realizes this,
and, you know,

512
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:03,648
he's not the most stable guy
to begin with.

513
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:06,476
So what do you want from me?

514
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:13,343
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption. Do you?

515
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,744
- I do.
- If you can help me,

516
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:20,791
I promise I can help you
be with your daughter again.

517
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,194
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

518
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,099
Absolutely. My days of breaking
into places and stealing shit are done.

519
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:32,209
What do you want me to do?

520
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:35,999
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

521
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:41,259
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

522
00:44:41,877 --> 00:44:45,723
- Yeah. I'll pick something up. Text me.
- Okay. Good news?

523
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:50,854
- I don't know. It's news.
- Are you trying to find my daddy?

524
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:54,457
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

525
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:59,696
- I just want your daddy to be safe.
- Hope you don't catch him.

526
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,088
This isn't the first time these guys
have tried to get their hands

527
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,127
on game-changing weaponry.

528
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:53,724
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

529
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,860
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

530
00:45:56,985 --> 00:45:58,996
He always wanted my tech.

531
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:05,169
And now, unless we break in and steal
the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data,

532
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:10,733
Darren Cross is gonna
unleash chaos upon the world.

533
00:46:13,068 --> 00:46:17,473
I think our first move
should be calling the Avengers.

534
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:23,454
I spent half my life trying to keep this
technology out of the hands of a Stark.

535
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,991
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

536
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:30,828
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

537
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:33,456
This could change
the texture of reality.

538
00:46:35,257 --> 00:46:39,503
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

539
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:41,998
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

540
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:44,708
Scott, they are ants.

541
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:48,805
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

542
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,552
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

543
00:46:54,677 --> 00:46:58,322
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

544
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:00,491
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

545
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:03,161
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

546
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:07,331
I was against using him when we
had months, and now we have days.

547
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:09,834
- I'm wearing the suit.
- Absolutely not!

548
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,870
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

549
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:15,622
- I know this mission better than anybody.
- We need you close to Cross.

550
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:19,142
- Otherwise, this mission cannot work.
- We don't have time to screw around!

551
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:21,411
- Please, listen to me...
- He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

552
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:23,206
No!

553
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:04,805
She's right, Hank. I'm not your guy.

554
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,412
Why don't you wear the suit?

555
00:48:07,683 --> 00:48:11,321
You think I don't want to? I can't.

556
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:15,390
I spent years wearing it,

557
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:17,649
and it took a toll on me.

558
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:27,503
You're our only option.

559
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,462
Before Hope lost her mother,
she used to look at me like...

560
00:48:36,587 --> 00:48:39,215
I was the greatest man in the world.

561
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:43,853
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

562
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:49,525
It's too late for me,

563
00:48:50,392 --> 00:48:54,104
but not for you. This is your chance.

564
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:57,958
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

565
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:01,862
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

566
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:05,041
It's not about saving our world.

567
00:49:05,908 --> 00:49:08,735
It's about saving theirs.

568
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,091
Damn. That was a good speech.

569
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:16,118
Scott...

570
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:20,090
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

571
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:27,505
In the right hands, the relationship
between man and suit is symbiotic.

572
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,591
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

573
00:49:31,716 --> 00:49:35,546
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all, you need to be fast.

574
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:39,049
You should be able to shrink
and grow on a dime.

575
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:43,079
So your size always suits your needs.

576
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:46,056
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

577
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:50,053
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

578
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,095
Useless.

579
00:50:01,196 --> 00:50:04,608
When you're small, energy's compressed,
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

580
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,798
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.

581
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,816
You're like a bullet.
You punch too hard, you kill someone.

582
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,983
Too soft, it's a love tap. In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

583
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:14,918
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

584
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:16,820
Show me.

585
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:19,056
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

586
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,016
Show me...

587
00:50:22,016 --> 00:50:23,527
That's how you punch.

588
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:26,230
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

589
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:28,999
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

590
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,234
By "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

591
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,270
We lost her in a plane crash.

592
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:36,856
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she
died. Could you stop telling me that lie?

593
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:38,718
We're working here.

594
00:50:41,703 --> 00:50:44,247
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

595
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:46,543
Were you going for the hand?

596
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:57,494
- I think this regulator is holding me back.
- Do not screw with the regulator.

597
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:01,231
If that regulator is compromised,
you would go subatomic.

598
00:51:01,656 --> 00:51:03,600
What does that mean?

599
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:06,571
- It means that you'd enter a quantum realm.
- What does that mean?

600
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:11,942
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

601
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:16,122
become irrelevant as you shrink
for all eternity.

602
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:19,316
Everything that you know...

603
00:51:19,441 --> 00:51:21,377
and love...

604
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:23,779
gone forever.

605
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:27,624
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

606
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:32,321
You've learned about the suit, but you've
yet to learn about your greatest allies,

607
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:37,827
the ants. Loyal, brave,
and your partners on this job.

608
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:46,710
<i>Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

609
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:49,597
<i>They're lightning fast and can conduct
electricity, which makes them useful</i>

610
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:53,309
- <i>to fry out enemy electronics.</i>
- You're not so crazy.

611
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,685
Hey!

612
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,835
You're cute.

613
00:52:05,587 --> 00:52:07,789
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

614
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:20,761
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

615
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,613
There's a security guard
posted around the clock.

616
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:25,512
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

617
00:52:25,837 --> 00:52:28,577
Okay, who's next?

618
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:32,823
- Paraponera clavata.
- I know. Bullet ants, right?

619
00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:34,891
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

620
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:37,554
Hey, guys. Remember me from the bedroom?

621
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:42,157
The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed,
and the only access point

622
00:52:42,282 --> 00:52:45,735
is a tube we estimate to be
about 5 millimeters in diameter.

623
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,340
- Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?
- The tube is protected by a laser grid,

624
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,575
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

625
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,380
You're gonna need to signal the crazy ants
to blow the servers, retrieve the suit,

626
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,515
and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

627
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,885
<i>Camponotus pennsylvanicus.</i>

628
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,120
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

629
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:07,817
- Ideal for ground and air transport.
- Wait a minute, I know this guy.

630
00:53:08,883 --> 00:53:11,028
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

631
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:14,769
That's good. That's very good.
Because this time...

632
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:17,367
you're really gonna have
to learn how to control him.

633
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:20,329
Tell them to put
the sugar in the teacup.

634
00:53:23,564 --> 00:53:25,815
You okay? Did I hurt...

635
00:53:36,011 --> 00:53:37,721
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

636
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:40,676
The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.

637
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,695
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

638
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:44,604
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

639
00:53:46,655 --> 00:53:48,699
<i>Solenopsis mandibularis.</i>

640
00:53:48,824 --> 00:53:52,970
<i>Known for their bite, the fire ants
have evolved into remarkable architects.</i>

641
00:53:53,095 --> 00:53:56,566
<i>They are handy to get you in
and out of difficult places.</i>

642
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:08,129
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

643
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:15,258
- They're not listening to me.
- You have to commit. You have to mean it.

644
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:17,327
No shortcuts, no lies.

645
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:22,065
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

646
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:26,032
- We don't have time for coddling.
- Our focus should be on helping Scott!

647
00:54:26,157 --> 00:54:27,885
Really?

648
00:54:28,563 --> 00:54:30,166
Is that where our focus should be?

649
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:56,334
Hope!

650
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:07,403
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

651
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:18,614
We can't do this without her.

652
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,529
- Oh, God.
- You gotta lock your doors.

653
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:28,618
I mean, really, there's some
weird folks in this neighborhood.

654
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,387
Do you think this is a joke?

655
00:55:31,476 --> 00:55:33,903
Do you have any idea
what he's asking you to risk?

656
00:55:34,028 --> 00:55:36,473
- You have a daughter.
- I'm doing this for her.

657
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:40,243
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

658
00:55:40,368 --> 00:55:42,646
- He was in grief.
- Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

659
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:46,283
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

660
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:48,877
He just sent me off to boarding school.

661
00:55:49,677 --> 00:55:52,889
You know, I thought...
with all that's at stake,

662
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:56,142
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

663
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:58,114
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

664
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:00,930
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

665
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:04,560
- Then why are you here?
- It proves that he loves you.

666
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:08,230
Hope... look at me.

667
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:11,708
I'm expendable.

668
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,235
That's why I'm here.

669
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:17,047
You must have realized that by now.

670
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,341
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

671
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:23,546
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

672
00:56:25,613 --> 00:56:27,356
Anyway...

673
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:31,027
You know, I didn't know
you had a daughter...

674
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:33,289
when I called the cops on you.

675
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:39,273
What's her name?

676
00:56:39,398 --> 00:56:40,863
Cassie.

677
00:56:41,663 --> 00:56:43,365
It's a pretty name.

678
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,512
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

679
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:51,841
That's how it works.

680
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,773
Think about Cassie.
About how badly you want to see her.

681
00:56:55,898 --> 00:56:58,380
And use that to focus.

682
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:11,260
Open your eyes and just think
about what you want the ants to do.

683
00:57:33,848 --> 00:57:35,217
That's good!

684
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:54,643
Your mother...

685
00:57:54,768 --> 00:57:59,616
convinced me to let her
join me on my missions.

686
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:01,884
They called her the Wasp.

687
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:04,446
She was born to it.

688
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,654
And there's not a day that goes by
that I don't regret having said yes.

689
00:58:15,957 --> 00:58:18,551
It was 1987.

690
00:58:18,676 --> 00:58:23,065
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk...

691
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:27,570
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

692
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:37,987
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

693
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,282
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

694
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:54,204
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

695
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:58,733
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

696
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,204
<i>Your mother, she didn't hesitate.</i>

697
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:05,975
Janet! No!

698
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,417
She turned off her regulator...

699
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,586
and went subatomic...

700
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:21,757
to deactivate the bomb.

701
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,794
And she was gone.

702
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:31,333
Your mom died a hero.

703
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:36,312
And I spent the next 10 years

704
00:59:36,437 --> 00:59:41,276
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

705
00:59:44,412 --> 00:59:46,882
You were trying to bring her back.

706
00:59:47,982 --> 00:59:50,013
But all I learned...

707
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,801
was we know nothing.

708
00:59:56,758 --> 00:59:58,586
It's not your fault.

709
01:00:00,595 --> 01:00:02,823
She made her choice.

710
01:00:07,935 --> 01:00:11,001
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

711
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:15,169
I was trying to protect you.

712
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,706
I lost your mother.

713
01:00:20,248 --> 01:00:23,411
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

714
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:25,913
I'm sorry.

715
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,700
This is awesome.

716
01:00:30,825 --> 01:00:35,538
It's awesome, you know? You guys are
breaking down walls, you're healing.

717
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:37,492
It's important.

718
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:43,464
- I ruined the moment, didn't I?
- Yes, you did. Yes.

719
01:00:44,589 --> 01:00:46,817
I'm going to make some tea.

720
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,274
Nailed it!

721
01:01:02,456 --> 01:01:05,085
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

722
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:37,100
The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

723
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:41,304
It's freezing! You couldn't make
a suit with a flannel lining?

724
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:44,581
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

725
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:47,043
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

726
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:50,156
We need it to counteract the transmission
blockers that Cross installed

727
01:01:50,281 --> 01:01:51,881
in the Futures vault.

728
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:55,879
It's currently collecting dust in one
of Howard Stark's old storage facilities

729
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:59,342
in upstate New York.
Should be a piece of cake.

730
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:03,680
You're over the target area.
Disengage now, Scott!

731
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:06,314
Squadron A, go! B, go!

732
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:10,717
C, go!

733
01:02:10,992 --> 01:02:13,337
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

734
01:02:14,162 --> 01:02:17,073
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

735
01:02:17,198 --> 01:02:18,626
Stay calm.

736
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:22,311
Guys? We might have a problem.

737
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:25,815
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

738
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,784
It's not!

739
01:02:27,909 --> 01:02:30,171
You son of a bitch!

740
01:02:32,346 --> 01:02:35,458
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort! Abort now!

741
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:38,394
No, it's okay. It doesn't look
like anyone's home.

742
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:40,748
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

743
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:44,018
- He's gonna lose the suit.
- He's gonna lose his life.

744
01:02:49,897 --> 01:02:52,560
All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.

745
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,695
Somebody's home, Scott.

746
01:02:57,939 --> 01:03:00,417
- <i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>
- It's the Falcon!

747
01:03:00,992 --> 01:03:03,187
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

748
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:06,756
- Wait a second.
- Abort, Scott! Abort now!

749
01:03:06,881 --> 01:03:08,357
It's okay. He can't see me.

750
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:10,845
- I can see you.
- He can see me.

751
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,799
- Hi. I'm Scott.
- Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

752
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:20,003
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

753
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,590
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

754
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,041
- I'm Ant-Man.
- "Ant-Man"?

755
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:27,410
What? You haven't heard of me?

756
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:30,914
- No, you wouldn't have heard of me.
- You wanna tell me what you want?

757
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,162
I was hoping I could grab a piece
of technology. Just for a few days.

758
01:03:34,287 --> 01:03:37,021
I'm gonna return it.
I need it to save the world.

759
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,674
- You know how that is.
- I know exactly how that is.

760
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,694
- Located the breach. Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

761
01:03:47,188 --> 01:03:49,083
What the hell are you doing?

762
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:54,755
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

763
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:11,671
Sorry! Look, I'm sorry
about this. Sorry.

764
01:04:11,796 --> 01:04:13,327
That's enough!

765
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:37,798
Ant-thony! A little help!

766
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:51,045
I've lost visual.

767
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:02,690
- He's inside my pack!
- Sorry!

768
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:06,293
You seem like a really great guy.

769
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:34,455
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

770
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:41,229
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

771
01:05:41,736 --> 01:05:44,165
You jeopardized everything!

772
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:01,666
You got it.

773
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:05,884
Well done.

774
01:06:06,009 --> 01:06:08,279
Wait a minute.
Did you just compliment me?

775
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:11,541
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

776
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:15,094
I was good, wasn't I?

777
01:06:15,703 --> 01:06:19,082
Hey, how about the fact that I fought
an Avenger and didn't die?

778
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:21,751
Let us not dwell on the past.

779
01:06:21,876 --> 01:06:24,371
We gotta finish our planning.

780
01:06:26,347 --> 01:06:29,577
Don't mind him. You did good.

781
01:06:36,757 --> 01:06:38,648
Darren.

782
01:06:40,594 --> 01:06:42,856
How the hell did you get in here?

783
01:06:43,564 --> 01:06:45,938
You left the front door open, Hank.

784
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:48,446
It's official. You're old.

785
01:06:48,903 --> 01:06:50,964
The plans.

786
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:53,267
He will kill him.

787
01:06:56,327 --> 01:06:59,123
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

788
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:03,243
- I have good news.
- Really?

789
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:07,114
- What's that?
- Pym Tech...

790
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:09,832
the company you created,

791
01:07:09,957 --> 01:07:13,966
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

792
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:17,792
We're anticipating $15 billion
in sales, tomorrow alone.

793
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:26,635
You're welcome.

794
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:32,355
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

795
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,092
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

796
01:07:36,217 --> 01:07:39,547
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I'll be there.

797
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:57,717
What did you see in me?

798
01:07:58,806 --> 01:08:01,150
I don't know what you mean.

799
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:05,439
All those years ago, you picked me.
What did you see?

800
01:08:07,581 --> 01:08:09,658
I saw myself.

801
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:12,386
Then why did you push me away?

802
01:08:13,921 --> 01:08:17,271
Because I saw too much of myself.

803
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:31,080
He knows. He's baiting you.
We have to call it off.

804
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:33,716
- We're all taking risks.
- What if he saw me here?

805
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:37,303
- He didn't. There's no way.
- How do you know that?

806
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:49,517
- Darren, hi.
- Hope, where are you right now?

807
01:08:50,057 --> 01:08:51,200
I'm at home. Why?

808
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:54,737
<i>I just saw Hank. I still get nothing
but contempt from him.</i>

809
01:08:54,862 --> 01:08:58,691
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

810
01:08:58,816 --> 01:09:00,810
<i>We need to start everyone
working around the clock.</i>

811
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:04,487
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.
And I'm tripling security.</i>

812
01:09:04,612 --> 01:09:09,952
Full sensors at all entrances and exterior
air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

813
01:09:10,077 --> 01:09:11,791
Great. Good idea.

814
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:15,726
<i>Thank you, Hope. I'm so lucky
to have you on my team.</i>

815
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:22,965
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

816
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,801
But he is not onto you.

817
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:29,371
He's adding full body scanners to all
entrances and closing exterior vents.

818
01:09:29,496 --> 01:09:31,385
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

819
01:09:33,133 --> 01:09:35,244
The water main.

820
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,496
You can't add security to a water main.

821
01:09:37,621 --> 01:09:40,900
The pressure is too strong, but if we
can decrease it, that's how I get in.

822
01:09:41,025 --> 01:09:44,703
Somebody would have to reach the building's
control center to change the water pressure.

823
01:09:44,828 --> 01:09:47,406
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

824
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:50,910
So we expand our team. What do we need?

825
01:09:51,035 --> 01:09:54,180
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

826
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:56,282
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

827
01:09:56,407 --> 01:09:59,486
and kill the laser grid,
and a getaway guy.

828
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:04,207
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three wombats. No way.

829
01:10:04,732 --> 01:10:06,292
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

830
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:09,895
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

831
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,982
Because we just robbed you.

832
01:10:13,457 --> 01:10:17,069
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

833
01:10:17,194 --> 01:10:18,355
Two smoothie machines.

834
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,557
- Are you sure they can handle this?
- We can handle it. We're professionals.

835
01:10:21,682 --> 01:10:25,277
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled
with confidence.

836
01:10:25,402 --> 01:10:29,378
Hey, everybody just kick back and relax
a little bit, man. We know our business.

837
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:31,884
We broke into this
spooky-ass house, didn't we?

838
01:10:32,009 --> 01:10:33,221
I let you.

839
01:10:33,346 --> 01:10:36,755
Well, one could say
that I let you let me.

840
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,876
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

841
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:41,969
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

842
01:10:42,094 --> 01:10:44,513
- I'm in the system?
- You're in the system.

843
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:48,350
- The system?
- Yeah, we're doomed.

844
01:10:48,475 --> 01:10:51,069
All right. There's something
you guys need to see.

845
01:10:51,394 --> 01:10:55,808
When you get to this corner, there's gonna
be three offices on your left side.

846
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:57,961
Damn!

847
01:10:59,794 --> 01:11:01,614
That's so cool, bro!

848
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:04,383
Now, look, this is gonna
get weird, all right?

849
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:07,690
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

850
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:10,123
- Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.
- Really?

851
01:11:10,248 --> 01:11:12,776
- Yeah.
- Good.

852
01:11:18,956 --> 01:11:22,424
- This is the work of gypsies.
- That's witchcraft.

853
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:25,814
Wow, that's amazing.
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

854
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:28,117
- That's some kind of wizardry.
- This is sorcery!

855
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:31,395
- How'd you do that, bro?
- Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

856
01:11:33,004 --> 01:11:37,334
- Get off! Get off...
- Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

857
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:43,755
I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank
explained the science of the suit to them.

858
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,258
They fell right asleep.

859
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:50,963
- Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...
- No, please don't.

860
01:11:51,088 --> 01:11:53,699
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

861
01:11:53,824 --> 01:11:57,503
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

862
01:11:57,628 --> 01:12:00,923
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

863
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:05,281
You know, the honest truth is, I actually
went from despising you to almost liking you.

864
01:12:05,406 --> 01:12:06,980
You really should write poetry.

865
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:12,902
Get some sleep, Scott.

866
01:13:02,526 --> 01:13:05,404
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

867
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:07,005
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

868
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,474
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

869
01:13:08,599 --> 01:13:10,369
- Luis?
- Man, you know it. You know what?

870
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:13,045
- I get to wear a uniform. That's what's up.
- Luis.

871
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:16,410
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm just excited.
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

872
01:13:16,535 --> 01:13:19,136
So, that makes me nervous, too.
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

873
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,753
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

874
01:13:20,878 --> 01:13:23,690
You know what? I was thinking
of a tactic, like when I go undercover.

875
01:13:23,815 --> 01:13:26,731
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To, like, blend in.

876
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:31,048
Don't whistle. No whistling. It's not
The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

877
01:13:48,706 --> 01:13:50,100
All clear in Sector One.

878
01:13:55,345 --> 01:13:57,206
Step out.

879
01:13:59,016 --> 01:14:00,877
All clear.

880
01:14:05,822 --> 01:14:08,919
- We're set.
- Wish me luck.

881
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:22,032
Utilities online.

882
01:14:34,585 --> 01:14:36,929
Hey! What are you doing?

883
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:41,468
Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

884
01:14:42,959 --> 01:14:44,136
I'm the boss.

885
01:14:44,961 --> 01:14:46,710
Utilities 1.3...

886
01:15:00,077 --> 01:15:02,299
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

887
01:15:30,707 --> 01:15:34,004
- <i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>
- All right, I see it.

888
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:45,482
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

889
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:51,922
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

890
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:58,637
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

891
01:16:08,746 --> 01:16:11,056
The Ant-Man is in the building.

892
01:16:11,181 --> 01:16:13,977
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

893
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:19,131
- Got a Crown Vic right outside there.
- This is problem?

894
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:23,268
Considering the Crown Vic's the most
commonly used car for undercover cops,

895
01:16:23,393 --> 01:16:24,988
yes, this is problem.

896
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:30,260
That's Pym.

897
01:16:32,703 --> 01:16:33,846
Oh, no.

898
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:36,976
I'm deploying the bullet ants.
Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...

899
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:40,087
I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.

900
01:16:41,144 --> 01:16:43,406
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

901
01:16:52,322 --> 01:16:55,867
See? That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

902
01:16:55,992 --> 01:16:58,188
in a very serious operation.

903
01:17:07,387 --> 01:17:11,951
Signal decoy in place.
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

904
01:17:13,773 --> 01:17:15,487
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

905
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:19,609
- Scott, we have problem.
- <i>Problem? What's the problem?</i>

906
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:22,594
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

907
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,296
Listen to me.

908
01:17:24,421 --> 01:17:28,485
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

909
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:30,553
That's awfully dramatic.

910
01:17:33,363 --> 01:17:35,693
Are you kidding me?

911
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:40,864
Problem solved.

912
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:57,314
Well...

913
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:00,667
How do I look?

914
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,165
There he is.

915
01:18:12,869 --> 01:18:15,761
Just in time. Come on.

916
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:26,892
<i>12-point verification.</i>

917
01:18:27,017 --> 01:18:28,827
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

918
01:18:28,952 --> 01:18:32,064
- <i>Confirming authorization...</i>
- Well, you can never be too safe.

919
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:34,308
<i>Access granted.</i>

920
01:18:40,597 --> 01:18:42,941
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

921
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:46,981
- You really did it.
- And you only know the half of it, Hank.

922
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:14,758
Arriving in second position.

923
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:18,828
All right, top speed, Ant-thony.
Let's go!

924
01:19:29,646 --> 01:19:31,008
Proceeding to command position.

925
01:19:48,699 --> 01:19:50,927
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

926
01:19:52,335 --> 01:19:56,247
All right, guys. I'm in position.
I'm gonna signal the ants.

927
01:19:56,372 --> 01:19:58,585
No, no, no, no, no!

928
01:19:59,843 --> 01:20:01,837
Did you see that?

929
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:08,894
Assume formation.

930
01:20:09,019 --> 01:20:12,916
All right, you cute little crazies,
let's fry these servers!

931
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:27,197
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

932
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:42,944
Servers are fried.
Data backup completely erased.

933
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:44,581
Heading to the particle chamber.

934
01:20:50,961 --> 01:20:53,456
Hello, Dr. Cross.

935
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:59,377
My associates have agreed to your terms.

936
01:20:59,502 --> 01:21:03,048
Wonderful. Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

937
01:21:03,173 --> 01:21:06,451
They're representatives of Hydra.
They're not what they were.

938
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:08,787
They're doing some interesting work.

939
01:21:08,912 --> 01:21:11,547
And I'm enjoying myself.

940
01:21:12,115 --> 01:21:16,412
You tried to hide your technology from me.
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

941
01:21:23,914 --> 01:21:27,976
I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,
but I figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

942
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:29,626
Well, you figured wrong.

943
01:21:30,533 --> 01:21:32,062
I know this van.

944
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,330
Anybody home?

945
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,471
All right, guys. I'm here.

946
01:21:46,282 --> 01:21:48,544
I'm setting the charges.

947
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:09,974
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

948
01:22:18,915 --> 01:22:21,478
Good boy, Ant-thony.

949
01:22:22,252 --> 01:22:23,547
Final position.

950
01:22:31,995 --> 01:22:34,239
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

951
01:22:34,364 --> 01:22:35,874
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

952
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:37,627
- I'm getting close!
- No, you're not.

953
01:22:42,272 --> 01:22:46,384
San Francisco P.D.! Out of the van!
I know you're in there!

954
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:48,738
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

955
01:22:54,384 --> 01:22:58,396
- Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?
- So close.

956
01:22:58,521 --> 01:22:59,631
- Freeze!
- Wait a minute!

957
01:22:59,756 --> 01:23:02,000
There was a black guy that looked
exactly like me who attacked us

958
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,428
- and put us in the back of this van.
- Get out of the van!

959
01:23:04,553 --> 01:23:06,538
- Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.
- Take it easy!

960
01:23:06,663 --> 01:23:09,025
No, I will not move! Go now!

961
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:13,263
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

962
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,825
What? What?

963
01:23:26,532 --> 01:23:27,761
Hey, little guy.

964
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,308
I always suspected you had a suit
stored away somewhere.

965
01:23:43,433 --> 01:23:46,911
Which begs the question,
who is the new Ant-Man?

966
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:51,334
Who is the man that my beloved mentor
trusted even more than me?

967
01:23:53,176 --> 01:23:55,805
Scott Lang.

968
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:01,259
A martyr... who took on the system
and paid the price,

969
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:05,029
losing his family and his
only daughter in the process.

970
01:24:05,154 --> 01:24:08,250
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

971
01:24:09,425 --> 01:24:14,123
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

972
01:24:14,733 --> 01:24:18,149
And then he disappears magically,

973
01:24:19,169 --> 01:24:21,346
despite having no money to his name.

974
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:24,184
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

975
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:30,321
The only thing...
that can rival my creation.

976
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:33,725
Darren... don't do this.

977
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:37,395
If you sell to these men,
it's gonna be chaos.

978
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:42,200
I already have.
And for twice the price, thanks to you.

979
01:24:42,525 --> 01:24:45,937
It's not easy to successfully
infiltrate an Avengers facility.

980
01:24:46,062 --> 01:24:48,226
Thankfully, word travels fast.

981
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:52,028
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

982
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:57,420
They don't run on diesel. If you want
the fuel, you'll have to come to me.

983
01:24:58,508 --> 01:25:03,489
What do you call the only man who can arm
the most powerful weapon in the world?

984
01:25:03,914 --> 01:25:06,765
The most powerful man in the world.

985
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:10,212
- You proud of me yet?
- You can stop this, Darren.

986
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:14,918
- It's not too late.
- It's been too late for a long time now.

987
01:25:15,992 --> 01:25:17,721
Darren!

988
01:25:19,395 --> 01:25:20,539
What are you doing?

989
01:25:20,664 --> 01:25:23,708
He wasn't any more capable
of caring for you than he was for me.

990
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,643
This is not who you are.

991
01:25:25,768 --> 01:25:28,998
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

992
01:25:36,746 --> 01:25:38,974
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

993
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:43,296
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

994
01:25:45,788 --> 01:25:47,150
Here we go.

995
01:25:48,558 --> 01:25:51,755
Drop your gun.

996
01:25:54,164 --> 01:25:58,547
You know, I came to the house the other
night to kill him, but you were there.

997
01:25:58,672 --> 01:26:01,947
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

998
01:26:02,072 --> 01:26:04,452
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

999
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:08,653
- but I think I am now!
- Drop your gun now!

1000
01:26:08,778 --> 01:26:11,850
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1001
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:26,223
Dad!

1002
01:26:34,804 --> 01:26:37,950
Hank, no. No, Hank.

1003
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:42,071
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1004
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,676
Take the suit off, or I'll blow
your brains out and peel it off.

1005
01:27:12,308 --> 01:27:15,920
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.
Request immediate backup!

1006
01:27:16,045 --> 01:27:18,206
Go, go, go!

1007
01:27:30,026 --> 01:27:31,869
Get me to the roof.

1008
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:36,107
And radio ahead. I want to make sure
the helicopter is ready to take off.

1009
01:27:36,232 --> 01:27:40,181
You two... kill anything
that comes out of that vault!

1010
01:27:40,306 --> 01:27:43,450
Dad... can you move?

1011
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:48,253
We need to get him out of here.

1012
01:27:48,378 --> 01:27:51,107
Go get that suit.

1013
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:35,553
Hey, Scotty.

1014
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:37,326
Hey, did I save your life?

1015
01:28:38,261 --> 01:28:41,124
Scotty? Scotty?

1016
01:28:43,366 --> 01:28:45,109
Thank you, Luis.

1017
01:28:45,234 --> 01:28:46,544
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

1018
01:28:46,669 --> 01:28:49,547
- We're the good guys, right?
- Yeah, we're the good guys.

1019
01:28:49,672 --> 01:28:53,351
- Feels kinda weird, you know.
- Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1020
01:28:53,476 --> 01:28:55,605
Get out of here before this place blows!

1021
01:29:02,652 --> 01:29:05,782
Damn it! That guy.

1022
01:29:06,656 --> 01:29:08,918
Hey! We're getting out of here!

1023
01:29:13,196 --> 01:29:16,574
The charges are set. We've gotta find
a way out of here and fast.

1024
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:18,576
Don't worry.

1025
01:29:18,701 --> 01:29:21,212
I'm not gonna die.

1026
01:29:21,337 --> 01:29:22,699
And neither are you.

1027
01:29:23,773 --> 01:29:26,269
It's not a keychain.

1028
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:33,208
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1029
01:29:43,025 --> 01:29:44,988
And there's a tank.

1030
01:29:54,337 --> 01:29:56,532
A little help!

1031
01:29:57,307 --> 01:29:59,217
I got it.

1032
01:29:59,342 --> 01:30:01,604
We need a doctor!

1033
01:30:02,178 --> 01:30:04,239
We've got him.

1034
01:30:05,481 --> 01:30:07,310
Thank you.

1035
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:10,113
Let's go!

1036
01:30:26,002 --> 01:30:28,030
Ant-thony!

1037
01:30:40,916 --> 01:30:42,745
Go!

1038
01:30:43,053 --> 01:30:44,714
You're gonna regret that.

1039
01:30:54,764 --> 01:30:56,474
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

1040
01:30:56,599 --> 01:30:58,042
- What?
- Get out of that van!

1041
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:00,196
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1042
01:31:01,137 --> 01:31:03,800
Hey! Hey!

1043
01:31:08,711 --> 01:31:10,755
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

1044
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,875
The windows!

1045
01:31:16,386 --> 01:31:19,264
Did you think you could stop
the future with a heist?

1046
01:31:19,389 --> 01:31:22,420
It was never just a heist!

1047
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:45,408
Put the gun down!

1048
01:31:53,523 --> 01:31:55,952
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1049
01:32:12,408 --> 01:32:14,237
We gotta set her down somewhere.

1050
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:46,052
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1051
01:32:46,177 --> 01:32:49,204
<i>Playing Disintegration by the Cure.</i>

1052
01:33:26,516 --> 01:33:27,943
Call 911!

1053
01:33:46,102 --> 01:33:48,064
It's okay.

1054
01:33:52,308 --> 01:33:55,362
Freeze! Put your hands up! Get them up!

1055
01:33:57,146 --> 01:33:59,708
- Scott?
- Paxton, you have to listen to me!

1056
01:34:27,443 --> 01:34:31,623
- Paxton, turn around. Take me back.
- I am taking you back... to prison.

1057
01:34:31,748 --> 01:34:34,258
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1058
01:34:34,383 --> 01:34:36,178
In the bug zapper. There...

1059
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:40,698
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1060
01:34:40,823 --> 01:34:45,102
<i>All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.</i>

1061
01:34:45,227 --> 01:34:46,722
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

1062
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:05,541
Don't be scared.

1063
01:35:06,348 --> 01:35:07,758
Paxton, let me help!

1064
01:35:07,883 --> 01:35:09,130
- Don't move.
- Let me help!

1065
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:11,665
- Maggie! What's going on?
- He's got Cassie!

1066
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:15,017
- Who's got Cassie?
- That thing. I don't know! I don't know!

1067
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:25,761
Are you a monster?

1068
01:35:27,003 --> 01:35:29,232
Do I look like a monster?

1069
01:35:30,172 --> 01:35:31,834
I want my daddy!

1070
01:35:33,309 --> 01:35:35,703
I want your daddy, too.

1071
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,110
- There you are.
- Daddy, is that you?

1072
01:35:42,818 --> 01:35:44,529
Hi, peanut.

1073
01:35:44,654 --> 01:35:46,916
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

1074
01:36:00,036 --> 01:36:02,965
Now, where did you go, little guy?

1075
01:36:07,843 --> 01:36:09,837
There you are.

1076
01:36:13,015 --> 01:36:15,010
Not just me!

1077
01:36:25,194 --> 01:36:26,804
Damn it!

1078
01:36:26,929 --> 01:36:28,624
Go! Go!

1079
01:37:22,451 --> 01:37:25,915
Scotty needs us, you know what I'm saying?
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1080
01:37:28,757 --> 01:37:31,869
- Back it up. Back it up, slow.
- Yeah.

1081
01:37:31,994 --> 01:37:33,204
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

1082
01:37:33,329 --> 01:37:34,790
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1083
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:37,375
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

1084
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,009
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1085
01:37:39,134 --> 01:37:40,177
Backin' up?

1086
01:37:40,302 --> 01:37:43,332
- Yep, just backin' up.
- No, no. Just back it up.

1087
01:37:49,945 --> 01:37:52,174
You insult me, Scott.

1088
01:37:56,385 --> 01:38:00,209
Your very existence is insulting to me.

1089
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:05,488
You know, it'd be much easier
to hit you if you were bigger.

1090
01:38:07,196 --> 01:38:08,891
Yeah, I agree.

1091
01:38:30,669 --> 01:38:31,564
Cassie!

1092
01:38:38,361 --> 01:38:42,691
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

1093
01:38:43,615 --> 01:38:45,911
Cassie! I'm coming!

1094
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,290
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1095
01:39:00,415 --> 01:39:03,245
I'm gonna destroy everything you love.

1096
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:06,448
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1097
01:39:14,463 --> 01:39:16,140
I can't break through.

1098
01:39:16,265 --> 01:39:18,894
It's titanium, you idiot!

1099
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,669
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1100
01:39:28,076 --> 01:39:31,388
Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help
Daddy pay for his mistakes.

1101
01:39:31,513 --> 01:39:34,243
You stay behind me, okay?
Stay behind me.

1102
01:39:35,718 --> 01:39:38,295
I'm gonna have to shrink between
the molecules to get in there.

1103
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,749
Get away from us!

1104
01:39:42,224 --> 01:39:45,287
- Daddy, help!
- I love you, Cassie.

1105
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:17,084
Daddy, where are you?

1106
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:20,037
<i>You could go subatomic.</i>

1107
01:40:20,162 --> 01:40:21,457
<i>...go subatomic.</i>

1108
01:40:22,031 --> 01:40:23,659
Oh, no.

1109
01:40:35,477 --> 01:40:40,942
<i>You would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space...</i>

1110
01:40:42,318 --> 01:40:47,282
<i>All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.</i>

1111
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:52,423
<i>...time and space become irrelevant.</i>

1112
01:40:56,598 --> 01:40:59,243
<i>Come back, Daddy!</i>

1113
01:40:59,368 --> 01:41:03,021
<i>...as you shrink for all eternity.</i>

1114
01:41:07,709 --> 01:41:10,570
<i>Everything that you know...</i>

1115
01:41:12,214 --> 01:41:14,142
<i>and love...</i>

1116
01:41:14,884 --> 01:41:17,228
<i>gone forever.</i>

1117
01:41:17,353 --> 01:41:19,881
<i>Daddy, where are you?</i>

1118
01:41:37,539 --> 01:41:39,527
<i>Where are you?</i>

1119
01:41:41,043 --> 01:41:43,071
<i>Where are you?</i>

1120
01:41:43,479 --> 01:41:45,574
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Cassie.

1121
01:41:53,055 --> 01:41:54,917
<i>Come back, Daddy!</i>

1122
01:41:58,628 --> 01:42:01,557
<i>Do not mess with the regulator!</i>

1123
01:42:32,027 --> 01:42:34,089
Daddy!

1124
01:42:36,999 --> 01:42:39,176
I love you so much.

1125
01:42:39,301 --> 01:42:42,497
I love you, too. So much.

1126
01:42:46,708 --> 01:42:49,637
You know,
there's a big hole in the roof.

1127
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:52,908
Sorry.

1128
01:42:55,684 --> 01:42:58,246
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1129
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:00,766
Mommy!

1130
01:43:03,425 --> 01:43:05,120
She's fine, she's fine.

1131
01:43:14,303 --> 01:43:16,113
Scott, please.

1132
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:18,432
You don't remember anything?

1133
01:43:18,607 --> 01:43:22,338
- Hank, I don't.
- There must be something else.

1134
01:43:24,145 --> 01:43:27,413
Well, I suppose the human mind just...

1135
01:43:27,538 --> 01:43:31,612
can't comprehend the experience, but...

1136
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:33,797
you made it.

1137
01:43:33,922 --> 01:43:36,117
You went in...

1138
01:43:36,925 --> 01:43:39,121
and you got out.

1139
01:43:40,929 --> 01:43:42,566
It's amazing.

1140
01:43:43,032 --> 01:43:44,841
Scott,

1141
01:43:44,966 --> 01:43:46,962
I'll walk you out.

1142
01:43:50,839 --> 01:43:53,034
Get some rest.

1143
01:44:00,715 --> 01:44:03,078
Is it possible?

1144
01:44:20,869 --> 01:44:23,480
- When did this happen?
- Nothing's happening.

1145
01:44:23,605 --> 01:44:25,582
Hold on. Something's kind of happening.

1146
01:44:25,707 --> 01:44:29,226
Well, if that's the case,
shoot me again.

1147
01:44:29,611 --> 01:44:32,056
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1148
01:44:32,181 --> 01:44:35,200
I'm a little surprised myself.
I have to get somewhere.

1149
01:44:35,325 --> 01:44:38,280
I'll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope.

1150
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,464
- Scott.
- Yeah?

1151
01:44:40,789 --> 01:44:42,851
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1152
01:44:44,059 --> 01:44:45,749
Scott, I met with my captain today.

1153
01:44:45,874 --> 01:44:48,973
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1154
01:44:49,298 --> 01:44:54,329
Something happened with the cameras.
Some circuits got fried.

1155
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:57,281
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1156
01:44:57,406 --> 01:44:59,902
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

1157
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,688
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1158
01:45:04,813 --> 01:45:08,336
Thank you, Paxton. I'm blown away.

1159
01:45:09,017 --> 01:45:11,802
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1160
01:45:11,927 --> 01:45:13,725
That's my pleasure.

1161
01:45:13,855 --> 01:45:17,285
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1162
01:45:19,428 --> 01:45:21,773
- This is awkward.
- Yeah.

1163
01:45:22,028 --> 01:45:24,207
I mean, what do we even
talk about after all of that?

1164
01:45:24,332 --> 01:45:25,676
- Oh, I know.
- What?

1165
01:45:25,801 --> 01:45:28,312
- I did my first cartwheel today.
- What?

1166
01:45:28,437 --> 01:45:32,282
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.
But today was the magic day.

1167
01:45:32,407 --> 01:45:34,702
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1168
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:38,489
- No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.
- Yeah, it is.

1169
01:45:38,614 --> 01:45:41,191
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1170
01:45:41,316 --> 01:45:43,369
Yeah, that's her.

1171
01:45:43,494 --> 01:45:45,209
Good boy.

1172
01:45:46,788 --> 01:45:49,884
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1173
01:45:52,561 --> 01:45:54,255
Sorry.

1174
01:45:55,330 --> 01:45:57,159
It's work.

1175
01:45:57,632 --> 01:45:59,261
Yeah.

1176
01:46:00,602 --> 01:46:01,645
All right.

1177
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:05,066
- Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.
- Just the facts. Only the facts.

1178
01:46:05,191 --> 01:46:08,519
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1179
01:46:08,644 --> 01:46:10,521
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1180
01:46:10,646 --> 01:46:13,123
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1181
01:46:13,248 --> 01:46:15,316
<i>And there was this abstract
expressionism exhibit.</i>

1182
01:46:15,441 --> 01:46:17,695
<i>But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy.</i>

1183
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:20,597
<i>But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!</i>

1184
01:46:20,722 --> 01:46:22,833
- Luis.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1185
01:46:22,958 --> 01:46:25,706
You know, I just get excited
and stuff. But anyway...

1186
01:46:25,831 --> 01:46:29,432
<i>Ignacio tells me, "Yo, I met this crazy-fine
writer chick at the Spot last night.</i>

1187
01:46:29,557 --> 01:46:33,078
<i>Like fine-fine. Like crazy-stupid fine."
And he goes up to the bartender and goes,</i>

1188
01:46:33,203 --> 01:46:35,815
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.
She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"</i>

1189
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:38,958
<i>The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

1190
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,770
<i>So this writer chick tells Ignacio,</i>

1191
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:43,584
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss in the world
of guerrilla journalism,</i>

1192
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:46,456
<i>"and I got mad connects with the peeps
behind the curtains."</i>

1193
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:49,594
<i>Ignacio's like, "For real?"
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,</i>

1194
01:46:49,719 --> 01:46:52,597
<i>I can't tell you who my contact is,
because he works with the Avengers."</i>

1195
01:46:52,722 --> 01:46:54,158
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

1196
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:57,533
And this dude sounds like a badass, man.
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1197
01:46:57,658 --> 01:46:59,756
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,</i>

1198
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:03,540
<i>who's flashing his fresh tack, "who's got,
like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"</i>

1199
01:47:03,665 --> 01:47:06,756
<i>And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.</i>

1200
01:47:06,881 --> 01:47:10,235
<i>"We got a guy who swings, a guy who crawls
up the walls. You gotta be more specific."</i>

1201
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,513
<i>And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."</i>

1202
01:47:12,638 --> 01:47:16,120
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1203
01:47:16,245 --> 01:47:17,373
So I asked Ignacio,

1204
01:47:17,498 --> 01:47:20,582
<i>"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine
writer chick to tell you to tell me,</i>

1205
01:47:20,707 --> 01:47:23,311
<i>because I'm tight with Ant-Man,
that he's looking for him?"</i>

1206
01:47:23,785 --> 01:47:26,448
And? What'd he say?

1207
01:47:29,624 --> 01:47:31,953
He said, "Yes."

1208
01:49:26,341 --> 01:49:29,036
There's something I want to show you.

1209
01:49:30,645 --> 01:49:34,592
I realized you can't destroy power.

1210
01:49:35,517 --> 01:49:40,014
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1211
01:49:46,027 --> 01:49:48,138
This is an advanced prototype

1212
01:49:48,263 --> 01:49:51,726
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1213
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:55,435
She never got to use it.

1214
01:49:55,971 --> 01:50:00,564
But now I realize that we were...
we were working on it for you.

1215
01:50:07,082 --> 01:50:09,811
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1216
01:50:16,257 --> 01:50:18,887
It's about damn time.

1217
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:20,482
Hey, Cap!

1218
01:56:34,001 --> 01:56:37,180
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

1219
01:56:37,305 --> 01:56:39,082
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1220
01:56:39,207 --> 01:56:43,170
- Even if he did...
- Who knows if the Accords will let him help.

1221
01:56:43,611 --> 01:56:45,073
We're on our own.

1222
01:56:46,447 --> 01:56:48,475
Maybe not.

1223
01:56:50,084 --> 01:56:51,513
I know a guy.
