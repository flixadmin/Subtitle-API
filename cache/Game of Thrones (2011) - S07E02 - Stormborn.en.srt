00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,897
(THUNDER CRASHING)

4
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,688
TYRION: On a night like
this, you came into the world.

5
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,979
VARYS: I remember that storm.

6
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,729
All the dogs in King's Landing

7
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,729
howled through the night.

8
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,355
I wish I could remember it.

9
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:40,271
I always thought this
would be a homecoming.

10
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:42,063
Doesn't feel like home.

11
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:44,397
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

12
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,689
Good.

13
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:48,938
DAENERYS: Not so many lions.

14
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,854
VARYS: Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

15
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:54,146
The lords of Westeros despise her.

16
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,021
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

17
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:00,522
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

18
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:03,146
They drink secret toasts to my health?

19
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,105
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

20
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:07,147
and he was stupid
enough to believe them.

21
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,979
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

22
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,979
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

23
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,563
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

24
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,980
But you're not here to
be queen of the ashes.

25
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,729
No.

26
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,979
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

27
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,854
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

28
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,438
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

29
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,522
the game is won.

30
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,979
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

31
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,146
we have powerful allies in the south.

32
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,729
I never properly thanked you for that.

33
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,480
They joined our side, my queen,

34
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,021
because they believe in you.

35
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,356
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

36
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:53,979
I did.

37
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,313
And then you served the
man who overthrew him.

38
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,063
I had a choice, Your Grace...

39
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,188
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

40
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,522
But you didn't serve him long.

41
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:02,980
You turned against him.

42
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,146
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

43
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,230
There have been few rulers in history

44
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,313
as cruel as the Mad King.

45
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,771
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

46
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:17,313
He simply had no interest in being king.

47
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:20,021
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

48
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,230
Your Grace,

49
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,230
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

50
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,271
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

51
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:30,189
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

52
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,896
All your spies, your little birds,

53
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:38,564
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

54
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,994
Would those qualities
have made for a good king

55
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:45,188
in your learned opinion?

56
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,854
Until your marriage to
Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

57
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,355
I knew nothing about
you, save your existence

58
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,688
and that you were said to be beautiful.

59
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,397
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

60
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,397
Which you turned to your advantage.

61
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,439
Who gave the order to kill me?

62
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,480
King Robert.

63
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,230
Who hired the assassins?

64
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:12,397
Who sent word to Essos to
murder Daenerys Targaryen?

65
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,938
- Your Grace, I did what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

66
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,230
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

67
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,021
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

68
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:24,729
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

69
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,146
What kind of a servant is that?

70
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,271
The kind the realm needs.

71
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:32,647
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

72
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,606
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

73
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:39,313
I wasn't born into a great house.

74
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:41,896
I came from nothing.

75
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,854
I was sold as a slave and
carved up as an offering.

76
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:48,688
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

77
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,271
You wish to know where
my true loyalties lie?

78
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:54,480
Not with any king or
queen, but with the people.

79
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:58,438
The people who suffer under
despots and prosper under just rule.

80
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,814
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

81
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:06,522
If you demand blind allegiance,

82
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,271
I respect your wishes.

83
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:13,271
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

84
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,854
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

85
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:19,146
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

86
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,647
because I choose you.

87
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:25,189
Because I know the people
have no better chance than you.

88
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:35,648
Swear this to me, Varys.

89
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,605
If you ever think I'm
failing the people,

90
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,813
you won't conspire behind my back.

91
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,771
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

92
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,606
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

93
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,606
I swear it, my queen.

94
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,854
And I swear this...
if you ever betray me,

95
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,564
I'll burn you alive.

96
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:11,314
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

97
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:16,355
Forgive me, my queen.

98
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,523
A red priestess from
As'shai has come to see you.

99
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,721
_

100
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,659
_

101
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,489
_

102
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,493
_

103
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:44,717
_

104
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,789
_

105
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:50,419
_

106
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,238
_

107
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,342
_

108
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:59,605
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

109
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:03,522
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

110
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,188
No, it didn't.

111
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,021
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

112
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,896
We've just decided to pardon those

113
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:13,564
who once served the wrong king.

114
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,896
The Lord of Light doesn't have
many followers in Westeros, does he?

115
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:24,563
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

116
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,063
can serve his cause.

117
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:27,980
What does your lord expect from me?

118
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,314
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

119
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,605
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

120
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,188
MISSANDEI: Your Grace, forgive me,

121
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:44,146
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

122
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,896
That noun has no
gender in High Valyrian,

123
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:49,854
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

124
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:54,230
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

125
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,397
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

126
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,939
No, but I like it better.

127
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,480
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

128
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:04,271
Prophecies are dangerous things.

129
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:07,605
I believe you have a role to play.

130
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:09,480
As does another...

131
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,980
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

132
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,688
Jon Snow?

133
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,480
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

134
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:20,647
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

135
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:24,771
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

136
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,480
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

137
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:30,397
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

138
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,647
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

139
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,729
to protect them from grave danger.

140
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,313
As King in the North,

141
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,146
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

142
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:41,647
so together they may
face their common enemy.

143
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,771
He sounds like quite a man.

144
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,146
Summon Jon Snow.

145
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:47,813
Let him stand before you

146
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,438
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

147
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:53,064
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

148
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:56,230
I can't speak to prophecies

149
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:58,854
or visions in the flames,

150
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,647
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

151
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,146
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

152
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,605
If he does rule the North,

153
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,356
he would make a valuable ally.

154
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,605
The Lannisters executed his father

155
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,771
and conspired to murder his brother.

156
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,980
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

157
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,146
Very well.

158
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:24,938
Send a raven north.

159
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,938
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

160
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,938
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

161
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:31,689
and bend the knee.

162
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:38,398
(CHATTER)

163
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:44,230
Gather round. Come here.

164
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,729
SANSA: You think it's really Tyrion?

165
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,230
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

166
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,771
Read the last bit.

167
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:56,397
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

168
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,146
What does that mean?

169
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:01,064
It's something he said to
me the first night we met.

170
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:04,231
You know him better than any of us.

171
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,398
What do you think?

172
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,480
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

173
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:16,271
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

174
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,271
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

175
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,771
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

176
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:21,938
Join us.

177
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,772
Together, we can end her tyranny."

178
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,938
Sounds like a charmer.

179
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,146
Of course, the casual
mention of a Dothraki horde,

180
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:35,105
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

181
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:36,648
a bit less charming.

182
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:39,813
What?

183
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:43,063
Fire kills wights, you told me.

184
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,231
What breathes fire?

185
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,438
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

186
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,854
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

187
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,813
But if the Army of the
Dead makes it past the Wall,

188
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,314
do we have enough men to fight them?

189
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,021
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

190
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,939
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

191
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,188
Some of you are
bannermen of House Tyrell.

192
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:12,313
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

193
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,522
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

194
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:19,021
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

195
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,850
mindless Unsullied soldiers

196
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,813
who will destroy your
castles and your holdfasts,

197
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:26,979
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

198
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,188
rape and enslave your women,

199
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:32,105
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

200
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:36,979
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

201
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,813
- (PEOPLE MURMURING)
- CERSEI: You all remember the Mad King.

202
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:43,355
You remember the horrors he
inflicted upon his people.

203
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,355
His daughter is no different.

204
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:48,146
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

205
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:52,438
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

206
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,105
And when she grew bored of that,

207
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,355
she fed them to her dragons.

208
00:12:57,356 --> 00:13:00,938
It is my solemn duty to
protect the people, and I will.

209
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,105
But I need your help, my lords.

210
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,897
We must stand together, all of us...

211
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:10,105
if we hope to stop her.

212
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,814
(ALL MURMURING)

213
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,523
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

214
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,688
The same as Aegon when he conquered

215
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:24,188
the Seven Kingdoms.

216
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,564
How do you propose to stop them?

217
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:34,356
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

218
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,356
(CHATTER)

219
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,231
Lord Tarly.

220
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,979
Ser Jaime.

221
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,688
I believe you know my son.

222
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:48,689
Ser Jaime.

223
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,188
Rickard, isn't it?

224
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,896
Dickon.

225
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,438
That's it.

226
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,438
Thank you for coming.

227
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,264
The other lords of the Reach
look to you for guidance,

228
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,355
now more than ever.

229
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,063
They might not have come if you hadn't.

230
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,355
If my queen summons
me, I answer the call.

231
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,147
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

232
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,397
You ride for Horn Hill today?

233
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:15,105
I have an army to mobilize.

234
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:17,438
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

235
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,897
And which side will you be fighting for?

236
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:24,230
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

237
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,146
Not even Rhaegar
Targaryen could do that.

238
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:29,105
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

239
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:32,063
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

240
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:34,188
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

241
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:37,188
and I want you to help
me destroy her enemies.

242
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,021
All her enemies.

243
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:41,064
Including Olenna Tyrell.

244
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:46,313
I'm a Tarly.

245
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,814
That name means something.

246
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,854
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

247
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:54,313
We don't stab our rivals in the back

248
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:57,147
or cut their throats at weddings.

249
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:02,188
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

250
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,523
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

251
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,313
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

252
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,938
She was a great woman once.

253
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,313
Now she's broken.

254
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,438
She wants revenge so badly,

255
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,688
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

256
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:22,606
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

257
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,522
I know you don't like my sister,

258
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,688
but you have to make a choice.

259
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,729
Do you fight with us

260
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,855
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

261
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,355
When the war is won,

262
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,522
the queen will need a
new Warden of the South.

263
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:48,355
I can think of no better man

264
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,189
than Randyll Tarly.

265

EBROSE: The infection

266
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,980
You should have cut off your
arm the moment you were touched.

267
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:01,814
How long?

268
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,688
It'll be years before it kills you.

269
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,271
Could be 10.

270
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:09,938
Could be 20.

271
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,689
But how long until...?

272
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,188

273
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,064
Six months, maybe fewer.

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,855
Um...

00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:36,563
Pardon, Archmaester.

277
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:39,563
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

278
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,021
She had the greyscale

like a baby to you?

00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,729

282
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,771

284
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,814
No.

00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:02,939
This is quite advanced.

And beyond our skills, ser.

289
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,397
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

290
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,938
to live out your life
with the stone men.

291
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,772
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

Come, Samwell.

00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,356
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

295
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
Jorah.

296
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,313
Jorah Mormont.

297
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,355
Mormont?

298
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,105
There's no need.

299
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,689
I've been dead to them for years.

QYBURN: Have you ever
been down here, Your Grace?

302
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:13,398
No, I can't say I have.

303
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:17,538
I haven't seen these since Robert

304
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,105
had them removed from the throne room.

305
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:23,063
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

306
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,230
They were his trophies.

307
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,438
He couldn't keep them around.

308
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,355
They would have made him look small.

309
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:31,897
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

310
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,064
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

311
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,189
Balerion the Dread.

312
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,605
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

313
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,522
His flames forged the Iron Throne

314

and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

315
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:58,730
Powerful...

316
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:01,272
but not invincible.

317
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,063
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

318
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,730
was wounded by spears in
the fighting pits of Meereen.

319
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:16,563
And if they can be wounded,

320
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:17,939
they can be killed.

00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:23,230

00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:26,064
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

323
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,106
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

324
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,106
YARA: If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

325
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:59,271
We have an army, a
fleet, and three dragons.

326
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,938
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

327
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,438
The city will fall within a day.

328
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,078
If we turn the dragons loose,

329
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,355
tens of thousands will
die in the firestorms.

330
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:09,938
It's called war.

331
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,938
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

332
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,271
I know how you wage war.

333
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:17,021
We don't poison little girls here.

334
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,313
Myrcella was innocent.

335
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,688
She was a Lannister.

336
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:22,313
There are no innocent Lannisters.

337
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,605
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

338
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:27,480
DAENERYS: That's enough.

339
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,063
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

340
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:30,481
You will treat him with respect.

341
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:37,481
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

342
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,896
That's very nice to hear.

343
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,854
Of course, I can't remember a queen

344
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:45,813
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

345
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,771
The common people loved her.

346
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,522
The nobles loved her.

347
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:51,271
And what is left of her now?

348
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:54,105
Ashes.

349
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,813
Commoners, nobles,

350
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,688
they're all just children, really.

351
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,314
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

352
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,563
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

353
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm grateful to all of you.

354
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,105
But you have chosen to follow me.

355
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:12,480
I will not attack King's Landing.

356
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,313
We will not attack King's Landing.

357
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,979
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

358
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,314
By asking nicely?

359
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,854
We will lay siege to the capital,

360
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:25,563
surrounding the city on all sides.

361
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,355
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

362
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,729
but no food for her army or the people.

363
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,647
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

364
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:34,688
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

365
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:36,355
by appealing to their loyalty,

366
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:38,021
their love for their country.

367
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,938
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

368
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,647
we prove her point.

369
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,271
Our army should be Westerosi.

370
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:45,563
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

371
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:46,854
You are.

372
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,231
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

373
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,230
And her Iron Fleet will
ferry the Dornish army

374
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,230
back up to King's Landing.

375
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:01,063
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

376
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,105
alongside the Tyrell army.

377
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,771
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

378
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:10,896
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

379
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:14,272
Forgive me for asking, but why
did you bother to bring your own?

380
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,771
The Unsullied will
have another objective.

381
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,355
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

382
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:26,522
And the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

383
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:28,438
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

384
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,314
will sail for the Rock and take it.

385
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:51,481
Do I have your support?

386
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,648
You have mine.

387
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,314
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

388
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:03,980
Thank you all.

But I swear to you, she
will pay for what she's done.

393
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:27,271
And we will bring
peace back to Westeros.

394
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,313
Peace?

395

Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

Peace never lasts, my dear.

He's a clever man, your Hand.

When Unsullied are young,

one boy hates high places,

one is frightened of the ocean.

They throw him in the water.

If you're going to

You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

Drink this.

00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,397
- What is it?
- Rum.

494
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:36,314

No.

- The lady knight?

You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,772
- Whose?
- Yours.

647
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,271
You are my sister.

648
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:48,355
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

649
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:52,272
Until I return, the North is yours.

his bones myself.

651

Presented them to Lady Catelyn

652
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:23,064
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

653
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:25,897
Seems like a lifetime ago.

654
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:30,231
Do give Lord Tyrion my
best when you see him.

655
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:35,605
I was sorry when he died.

656
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:39,314
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

657
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,523
So did I.

658
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,980
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

659
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:52,939
Well, it appears she
vastly underestimated you.

660
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:56,397
