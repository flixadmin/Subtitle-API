1
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,265
They ave broken through the front lines!

2
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,808
I have lost contact with the capital!

3
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,310
There is too many of them!

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,484
Stand fast!

5
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:06,984
Finish them!

6
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,316
Where is B-127?

7
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,831
Sorry I am late. I hit a little traffic.

8
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:37,761
Get down! Incoming!

9
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,192
Optimus.

10
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,757
Decepticons,

11
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,633
attack!

12
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,970
Autobots, fall back!

13
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:48,859
Get to the tower!

14
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,808
Destroy the launch pad!

15
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:53,850
Let none escape!

16
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,985
Cybertron has fallen.

17
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,624
Get to the escape pods.

18
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,711
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

19
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,355
We must reach them
if we hope to survive.

20
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,882
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

21
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,434
We will fight on.
But we must find refuge first.

22
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,049
I found a planet that's well hidden.

23
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,181
Earth.

24
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,123
You will travel there
and establish a base for us.

25
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,693
Once we have gathered the others,
we will join you.

26
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,842
You must protect the planet.

27
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,851
If the Decepticons find it,

28
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:37,533
then our people are truly finished.

29
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,076
Now go!

30
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,955
Good luck, soldier.

31
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,643
I will buy you some time.

32
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:01,681
No!

33
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,962
Ok, ok!
I am dead already, man!

34
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:09,478
Not just you.

35
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:11,352
Being the overachiever that you are,

36
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,401
you managed to get your
whole squad killed, Danny.

37
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,522
Bravo.

38
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:15,910
Come on, man. Those things sting.

39
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:17,246
What things? These things?

40
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,855
You know, I would not know.
I have not been hit yet.

41
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,416
Ok, you know what?

42
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:23,601
That's too close man.
You could have taken out an eye.

43
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,808
I got a date tonight man.
This ain't sexy!

44
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,643
You are right. I am sorry.

45
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,644
That one was on me.

46
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,463
That's a malfunctioning trigger.

47
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,178
This weapon is just faulty.

48
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,831
Someone is going to get a talking to...
Man, would you stop?

49
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,715
Alright just, just stop.

50
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,990
I should have let you die in Grenada.

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,918
If you did, we would not be able
to come to the forest,

52
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,718
run around and play
these awesome games.

53
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,911
Exactly.

54
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,831
I hate you.

55
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,987
Man, that hurts.

56
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,168
Because I love you.

57
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,845
But you refuse to let it in
because you got intimacy issues.

58
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,859
A therapist will probably tell you,
you were not hugged enough as a kid.

59
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,203
Look man.

60
00:04:58,227 --> 00:04:59,796
Danny, I know I look stupid but...

61
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,553
Hey yo, take cover!

62
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,399
Danny.

63
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,312
You ok?

64
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,188
Yeah man.

65
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,034
This is Agent Jack Burns.

66
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,736
I need medical up here now.

67
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,329
We have a projectile strike

68
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,157
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

69
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,915
Multiple injuries.

70
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:36,478
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

71
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,243
<i>Negative.</i>

72
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,538
<i>There are no live fire drills
in the northwest sector.</i>

73
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,510
What the hell hit us, then?

74
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,899
Target on your right!

75
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:16,085
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

76
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,256
Drive!

77
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:27,508
There!

78
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,434
What the hell?

79
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,894
Take it down!

80
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,442
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

81
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,611
There it is!

82
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,238
<i>Target has been located sir.</i>

83
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,125
Light it up!

84
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,928
Damn it!

85
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,061
Oh, no.

86
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,902
It's going for the mine! Cut it off!

87
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,374
Move, move!

88
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,736
Please.

89
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,313
This is a mistake.

90
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,908
Stay cool. Hold your fire.

91
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,993
I don't want to hurt anyone.

92
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,919
Who called in the Air Force?

93
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,170
That's not the Air Force.

94
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:34,592
Run.

95
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,748
Did you think you could hide?

96
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,468
Now you will die screaming.

97
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,025
Like your friends!

98
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,584
Tell me where your friends are hiding.

99
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,218
I will never talk.

100
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:54,826
Is that right?

101
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,851
Then let's make it official.

102
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,713
B-127...

103
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,966
As a member of the Autobot resistance,

104
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,290
you are a traitor to Cybertron

105
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,405
and are hereby sentenced

106
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,014
to death.

107
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,022
No!

108
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,866
No!

109
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,301
Shut up.

110
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,230
Morning Dad.

111
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,512
No!

112
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,042
Don't tickle.

113
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,434
Caught.

114
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,023
Gross, Ron.

115
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,162
Excuse me.

116
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,517
What? Are those your diving trophies?

117
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:55,264
Taking up too much space in my room.

118
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,045
You are gonna regret doing that.

119
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,237
Where is breakfast?

120
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,218
Breakfast is conveniently located
in the cupboards and the fridge.

121
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:04,790
Try to help out...

122
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,971
Yeah.
A little.

123
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,543
Since I am such a big kid now,

124
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,362
making my own breakfast
and what have you,

125
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,755
you know how I could be,

126
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,472
an even bigger help around here Mom?

127
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,646
If I had a car.

128
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,714
Charlie.

129
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:17,604
What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

130
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,852
perfect timing for a large cash gift.

131
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,779
You know 500 bucks is really
all I need to finish the Corvette.

132
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:26,396
I don't have 500 bucks.
You know how much nurses make.

133
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,653
Half as much as doctors
for twice the work, right?

134
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:30,872
Tell you what kiddo...

135
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,587
I got another job interview tomorrow.

136
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:34,708
If all goes well,
I will have you swimming in car parts.

137
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,407
I prefer cash, Ron.

138
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,377
Don't be rude. Feed the dog.

139
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,549
Conan is Otis's dog. Make him do it.

140
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:41,625
What?

141
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,792
You look so grown up in your karate suit.

142
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,887
My baby boy is becoming a man.

143
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,266
Shoot, I am gonna be late.

144
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,611
Can you drop your brother at karate
on your way to work, please?

145
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,024
I could if I had a car.

146
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,439
Just let him follow you on your
bike so nobody abducts him.

147
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,847
Abducts him?

148
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:03,779
You just said he's a grown man now.

149
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,101
If anyone tries anything,

150
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,199
I will rupture their freaking spleen.

151
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,776
That's two for you guys.
Thanks bro.

152
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,562
Alright. Have a good one.

153
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,363
Eat safe.

154
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:55,644
Excuse me. Hi.

155
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,226
We have never actually met...
Sorry, I can't right now.

156
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:57,903
Yeah.

157
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,024
Ok.

158
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,170
Hey, hot dog girl!

159
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,516
Oh, my God!

160
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:05,870
I am so sorry.

161
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:07,622
Oh, God.

162
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,770
Someone is getting fired.

163
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:14,199
If I had to wear that,
I would pray to be fired.

164
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,581
Good one Tina.

165
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,355
Let's go.

166
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,644
Come on.

167
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,038
Hey Uncle Hank.

168
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,381
Are you still working on that damn car?

169
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,686
You still working on that damn personality?

170
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,641
What have you got for me?

171
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:09,625
Whatever you want.

172
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,254
Russians are gonna blow us
all to hell anyway.

173
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,784
That's the spirit.

174
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,512
Hey kid.

175
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,913
Hand me the three-eighths, would you?

176
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,488
You working on the carburetor?

177
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:24,740
You need the half-inch.

178
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,392
I said the three...

179
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,580
Thanks kid.
Yep.

180
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,946
Where is Optimus Prime?

181
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,587
He survived the fall of Cybertron.

182
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:34,408
And no rebellion is truly dead
until the leader is vanquished.

183
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,218
So where is he?

184
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,041
My name is Cliffjumper,

185
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,167
lieutenant in the Autobot resistance.

186
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,236
My safe return will be considered...

187
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,643
Wrong answer.

188
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,808
We know he is planning
to establish a base.

189
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:52,000
Tell us where it is
and we will let you live.

190
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,315
My name is Cliffjumper, lieutenant...

191
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,031
<i>♪ Sometimes you want to go... ♪</i>

192
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,375
No.

193
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,203
That's B-127's signal.

194
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,274
Can you trace it?

195
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,041
Already did.

196
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,737
If you won't tell us where Prime is,

197
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,252
perhaps your young friend will.

198
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,236
Never.

199
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,159
You are a brave warrior.

200
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,313
You deserve a better death.

201
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,780
But then again...

202
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:27,291
Set course for Earth.

203
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,981
I will give you thirty bucks for all of it.

204
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,077
I can get twice that much
for the coil alone.

205
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,162
From who?
I am the only one that comes in here.

206
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,752
I don't even know how you are still open.

207
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:50,163
Just take it. Go. Go.
My show is on.

208
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,314
Hey, where did you get that Beetle?

209
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,274
I swear to God, ever since they
put up that dumb-ass tower,

210
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,802
I can't get a signal to watch my shows.

211
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,025
I have got to see what happens
to Alf this week.

212
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,483
Come on!

213
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,041
Are you kidding me?

214
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,327
Damn it.

215
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,434
I give up.

216
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,512
I can't do this without you.

217
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,354
<i>Nice to meet you.
Interested in a new Buick?</i>

218
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,025
<i>Nice try.
Alright, I touched. But I didn't eat.</i>

219
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,486
<i>And I am supposed to believe
one of these steaks</i>

220
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,735
<i>just got up and walked away on its own?</i>

221
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,470
<i>I have seen stranger.</i>

222
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,617
<i>No dinner for you tonight.</i>

223
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,157
<i>But I am starved!
I have been fasting since lunch!</i>

224
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,079
<i>Well, I did eat that pumpkin.</i>

225
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,074
Happy birthday.

226
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,611
I miss you Dad.

227
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,891
I think it's too low honey.

228
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,417
No. No. I think it goes to that button.

229
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,864
Yeah?
Yeah. I don't...

230
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,324
know about...

231
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:01,079
Fix it.
Hey.

232
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:03,567
Good morning, birthday girl!
Hi.

233
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:04,797
You look...

234
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,002
Nice.

235
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,525
Happy birthday, baby.

236
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,768
I love you. Come on, open your present.
I am gonna be late for work.

237
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,854
Thanks Mom.

238
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,730
Helmet with...

239
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,861
Daffodils.

240
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,404
So, I keep hearing

241
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,660
about people on mopeds getting
run over and their brains smashed in.

242
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,554
You got to wear this from now on.

243
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,331
I don't care if it's not the law.
It's our law.

244
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,375
Plus, look how cute it is.

245
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,662
Yeah.

246
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,092
Happy birthday.

247
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,592
I actually got you a little gift too Charlie.

248
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,370
I mean it's small, but...

249
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,869
it's from the heart.

250
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,311
A smile is a powerful thing.

251
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,054
It releases endorphins.

252
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,976
It says to the world,
I am fun and approachable.

253
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:08,756
You know, there is a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often,

254
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:10,447
actually have more friends.

255
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,467
That's unbelievable.

256
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,682
I really think it's gonna
change your whole outlook

257
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:15,987
if you smile more often.

258
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:34,570
I want the Beetle.

259
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,852
What?
The yellow Beetle, I want it.

260
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,229
I will make you a deal.
If I get that thing started, it's mine.

261
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,635
That's no deal.

262
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:43,316
That's just you taking my car.

263
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:47,095
If I get it started, I keep it and
I work here every day for a year.

264
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,070
I will scrub the grease off the floors, ok?

265
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:52,140
I will pick up and organize
every scrap of paper in this place.

266
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,064
I will even detail your horrible,

267
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:55,953
disgusting toilets.

268
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,166
Please. It's my birthday.

269
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,293
Sorry, no deal.

270
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,044
Because we ain't hiring.

271
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,619
It's yours kid.

272
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:09,344
Happy birthday.

273
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,245
Thank you.

274
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

275
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,435
And my toilets are gorgeous.

276
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,625
Oh, God, please.

277
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,005
Come on.

278
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:00,442
Oh, my...

279
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,106
Oh, my God!

280
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,455
Oh, my God, thank you so much!
I love you!

281
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,311
That thing ain't even safe to drive.

282
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:15,844
It's a deathtrap.

283
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,328
She is happy though.

284
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:43,206
Man.

285
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,503
Looks amazing.

286
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:58,934
What?

287
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,195
Oh, my God.

288
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,024
Charlie, what was that noise?
Nothing! I am fine.

289
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:25,577
Mom, you should go back to bed.
Everything is fine.

290
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,938
What the hell is that?
It's...

291
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,211
What is that car doing in our garage?

292
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:32,362
Car?

293
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,889
That ca... car?

294
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:38,451
Is my car.

295
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,636
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

296
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,803
It runs. Yeah.

297
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,432
Those are not safe.

298
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:47,178
I wish you would have told me
before you brought it home.

299
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,871
Ok. Sorry.

300
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,426
I am in the middle of some stuff,

301
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,544
Mom.
Ok, I will get out of your hair but...

302
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,278
Tell me things, sometime.
Ok.

303
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,755
I am your mother.
Ok.

304
00:28:59,217 --> 00:28:59,998
Ok.

305
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:01,772
Good night.

306
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:03,730
It really runs?
Yeah, it really...

307
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:05,995
it really runs.
Cool.

308
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,515
You still in there?

309
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,396
Ok.

310
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,681
A little jumpy. I am sorry.

311
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,018
Ok.

312
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,576
Hi.

313
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,870
Oh, God, are you...

314
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,738
Do you speak?

315
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,669
I won't hurt you.

316
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,321
Can you understand me?

317
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:10,959
What are you?

318
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,540
Where did you come from?

319
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,124
Ok. It's ok.

320
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,598
You like my shirt?

321
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:29,728
You a metal fan?

322
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,932
No, wait...

323
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,158
Oh, who? Me?

324
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,812
Who am I?

325
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,228
I am...

326
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,048
Charlie.

327
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,806
Charlie Watson.

328
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,838
I am... 18.

329
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:48,401
Today.

330
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,160
Actually, it's my birthday today.

331
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,455
What's your name?

332
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,294
You don't, you don't know
or you don't have a name?

333
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,083
You sound like a little bumblebee.

334
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,251
I am gonna call you that from now on.

335
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,435
Bumblebee.

336
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,022
Matches your outfit, too.

337
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:48,711
I want a divorce, Roy!

338
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:50,469
Come on Amber.
Give me one good reason.

339
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,491
You tried to sleep with my sister!

340
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,122
Unsuccessfully!

341
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:56,392
Yeah, you are unsuccessful at everything.

342
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,061
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

343
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,648
How stupid are you Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

344
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,888
Now, just settle down for one second just...

345
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,413
hear me out.

346
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,345
What the hell is that?
What?

347
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,662
Oh, God, Roy,
that thing is coming right for us!

348
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,587
No, no, no, no, no...

349
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:20,474
Not my car. Not my car.

350
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,858
Please, God, no, not my car!

351
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,180
Oh, thank God, my car.

352
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,592
Yeah, I am ok.

353
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:41,020
That's good, baby. That's good.

354
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,772
Run. Run!

355
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,261
God!

356
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,543
Is that my car?

357
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,391
Hello...

358
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,104
Jeez!

359
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,063
Earth.

360
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,141
Roy!

361
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,193
How underwhelming.

362
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,251
The indigenous life is even more
primitive than I expected.

363
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,199
Hey...

364
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,694
I like the way they pop.

365
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,248
Focus, comrade.

366
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,990
B-127's distress signal

367
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:47,576
came from the western coast
of this continent.

368
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:48,992
For now,

369
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,466
we head west.

370
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,832
When do they start
letting you use nun-chucks?

371
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,691
I don't know, but I hope soon.

372
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,263
Morning! See you guys later.

373
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,551
Where you off to so fast?

374
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,497
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

375
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,598
Morning Bumble...

376
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,229
Bee?

377
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,416
Bee, where are you?

378
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,005
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

379
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:31,926
Bee?

380
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,621
Where did you go?

381
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:40,592
Otis!

382
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,041
Have you seen my car?

383
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,617
Unfortunately, yes.

384
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,799
No, have you seen my car today?

385
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:48,805
It was in the garage. Someone stole it!

386
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,761
No, idiot.

387
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:50,750
Mom took it.

388
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,228
She had to bring Conan to the vet

389
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:54,314
because he swallowed like
a rubber glove or something

390
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:55,816
and Ron needed the station wagon.

391
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,893
Thank God.

392
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,690
Wait.

393
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,839
Hi. Excuse me. It's me again.

394
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:11,082
We never officially met but...
Yeah, I can't right now. Sorry.

395
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,231
Nope. Yep.

396
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,457
Ok. Ok.

397
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,025
I know buddy. Hang in there.

398
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,141
You can't eat everything you see.

399
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:27,394
Just let this be a good life lesson for you.

400
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,232
Oh, my God. Stop it! Don't do that!

401
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,015
Bee, no!

402
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,536
Mom?

403
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,079
Jesus! Charlie, what are you doing?

404
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:49,385
Mom, you got to pull over.

405
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,294
What the hell is going on?
Just pull the car over.

406
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,658
Ok, ok.

407
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:55,158
Alright.

408
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,289
Would you put that robot junk away?

409
00:37:00,313 --> 00:37:01,792
What are you thinking?

410
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,584
You almost gave me a heart attack.

411
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:04,877
I thought I was being carjacked.

412
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:06,658
I am taking the dog to the vet.

413
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,756
I can't believe you would
take him without me.

414
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,604
Mom, I am so worried about him!

415
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,314
He's my dog too, you know.

416
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,883
What happened to Conan being Otis's dog?

417
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,805
Mom,

418
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,304
you are being hysterical, ok?

419
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:19,129
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

420
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,948
I know how you get during emergencies.

421
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,950
I am a nurse.

422
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,120
Not of animals.

423
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,836
Ok. I am happy for you to drive.

424
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,175
You were not wearing your helmet,
by the way.

425
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:37,717
I saw that.
Oh, shoot.

426
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,136
Keep it together, Bee.

427
00:37:49,677 --> 00:37:50,532
Sir?

428
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:52,844
Sir.

429
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,188
I thought you would want
to see this immediately.

430
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,415
They sure?
Yes sir.

431
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,498
Two of them just made contact in Texas.

432
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,577
Intel says they are heading west fast.

433
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,108
Saddle up Simmons.

434
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,608
We are going to Texas.

435
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:13,780
Ok, Bee.

436
00:38:13,904 --> 00:38:15,524
We need to go over a few things.

437
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,218
Ok. We are all clear.

438
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,759
Alright. I am re-thinking the beach.

439
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:32,623
I am good.

440
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,980
No I am good, thanks.

441
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,903
People can be terrible about things
they don't understand.

442
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,785
If they find you, they will probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

443
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,978
and cut you into tiny little pieces.
It will be...

444
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,079
bad, trust me.

445
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,278
The only person you can show
yourself around is me,

446
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:55,874
ok?

447
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,530
So let's practice. You ready?

448
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,176
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

449
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,457
Great. Perfect.

450
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:07,731
Come back now.

451
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,156
Ok, so let's say we are driving,

452
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,548
alright we are driving and all of a sudden...

453
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,062
Oh, shoot! Somebody is here, hide!
Hide Bee, hide!

454
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,788
You serious?

455
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,249
Bee, it's too late. You are already dead.

456
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,359
It's alright.

457
00:39:41,118 --> 00:39:42,368
That's why we are practicing.

458
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:43,969
You will get it.

459
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:48,137
<i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

460
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,699
The goal sir, should be
to communicate with them.

461
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,785
First contact with an alien species.

462
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,372
I have spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

463
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:17,194
If they make one wrong move,

464
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:18,751
we put them down.

465
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,880
The humans are multiplying.

466
00:40:36,046 --> 00:40:38,299
Please let me kill them.
Not yet.

467
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,330
B-127's signal has gone silent.

468
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,734
I have an idea.

469
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:46,879
Listen up! I am Agent Burns and this is...

470
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:48,591
Dr. Powell.

471
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,394
We currently have 100 guns,

472
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:52,113
pointed right at your head!

473
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,036
So state your business.

474
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,876
People of Earth,

475
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,501
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

476
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:01,860
What are you doing?

477
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,087
This is humiliating.

478
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,674
We believe a dangerous
criminal from our world

479
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,785
is hiding somewhere on yours.

480
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,512
How is it you think we can help?

481
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:16,961
We need your eyes.

482
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,180
Wait.

483
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,812
You want access to our satellites?

484
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,273
Our scanners' range is limited.

485
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,693
Your infrastructure is, primitive.

486
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,391
But combined,

487
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,686
they could be quite powerful.

488
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,374
No way! Out of the question!

489
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:35,194
We have a common enemy, Agent Burns.

490
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,704
There is a war raging on our planet.

491
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:40,194
If B-127 isn't found,

492
00:41:40,218 --> 00:41:42,459
that war may find its way here.

493
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,695
Perhaps...

494
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,888
We can find a way to help one another.

495
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,871
We will talk it over with our superiors.
In the meantime,

496
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:52,861
if you could follow us.

497
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,263
Very well, friend Powell.

498
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,265
Take us to your leader.

499
00:42:07,974 --> 00:42:10,490
Must suck being cooped up
in a VW all day?

500
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,662
Is there anyone that can help you?

501
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,091
Do you have a family?

502
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,356
You know like a...

503
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,233
mom, dad, siblings?

504
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:20,840
You all love each other?

505
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,363
Or drive each other,

506
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:27,343
crazy and you can't wait to get
away and start a whole new life.

507
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,595
Do you want me to see if I can fix it?

508
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,516
I will be gentle, I promise.

509
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:55,907
You lay down, ok?

510
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,651
Hold still.

511
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,333
I think maybe there is something...

512
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,959
<i>B-127,</i>

513
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:21,868
<i>I pray this message finds you.</i>

514
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:25,787
<i>Our war rages on.</i>

515
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:27,522
<i>Planet Earth...</i>

516
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:29,983
<i>survival...</i>

517
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,594
Ravage, eject!

518
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,655
<i>Your mission...</i>

519
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,365
<i>soldier...</i>

520
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:19,483
<i>I...</i>

521
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,202
Are you ok?

522
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,606
Who was that?

523
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,046
That voice said something about a war.

524
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:35,824
Do you remember anything?

525
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,250
Is the VW Beetle,

526
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:42,334
some kind of...

527
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,073
disguise?

528
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,625
Are you hiding from something?

529
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,189
Are you scared?

530
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,120
It's broken.

531
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:08,178
It's ok.

532
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,108
I think I can help.

533
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:13,222
Let's go home.

534
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,199
<i>And a basket case,</i>

535
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:21,870
<i>a princess...</i>

536
00:45:22,063 --> 00:45:23,315
<i>And a criminal.</i>
Alright, I am almost done.

537
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,473
<i>Does that answer your question?</i>

538
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,530
No way. Are you actually watching it?

539
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,494
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

540
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,731
<i>Don't, don't, don't...</i>

541
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,463
You can pop in another one if you want.

542
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,585
<i>Come on, sweetie!</i>

543
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,164
<i>You got this Charlie girl!</i>

544
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,904
<i>Alright, Charlie girl!</i>

545
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:58,369
<i>Hello, Brighton Falls.
This is Charlie Watson,</i>

546
00:45:58,393 --> 00:45:59,855
<i>future Olympic gold medalist.</i>

547
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,967
<i>That was so perfect.</i>

548
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,386
<i>Thanks Dad.
How do you feel?</i>

549
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:05,107
<i>You are amazing...</i>
No, no, why would you play this?

550
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,060
Sorry. I just...

551
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,354
I finished.

552
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,902
Let's see if we got something.

553
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,017
Ok.

554
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,580
Ok.

555
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,979
Alright.

556
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:43,802
Oh, my God, yes!

557
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,463
It worked!

558
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,889
Look at you go.

559
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,456
You got some moves.

560
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:00,719
You know Bee, music can help
you say what you are feeling.

561
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:05,978
You are gonna love this.

562
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:07,682
It's brand new.

563
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:15,571

00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:24,888
Ok.

568
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:27,846
Here.

569
00:47:28,756 --> 00:47:29,848
Try this.

571
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,064
Fine.

572
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,040
Ok, where is my Stevie Nicks?

573
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,704
Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.

574
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,075
Stones.

575
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,662
Hey, hey, please don't touch those.
Please.

576
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,603
They belonged to my dad.

577
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:20,738
Do you want to hear it?

578
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,507
We used to listen to this
while we would work on the Corvette.

579
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,462
It was his favorite.

580
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,063
He used to say it would make
the car feel better.

581
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:12,994
We used to work on this car
every weekend together.

582
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:19,338
It was our thing.

583
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:25,566
That tape...

584
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,053
That was the last time I saw him.

585
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,017
He died of a heart attack.

586
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,230
I never got to say goodbye.

587
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,291
You know,
I always thought if I could just...

588
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,643
finish fixing this car...

589
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,101
If I could just get it to start up again,

590
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,836
he would hear me.

591
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,927
He would hear me.

592
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:46,201
I say this with all due respect.

593
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,213
Have you lost your damn mind?

594
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:51,257
That was with all due respect?
The man is got a point Doctor.

595
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:54,986
Our satellite network is at the forefront
of our national defense.

596
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,132
Sir, please.

597
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:58,522
It could be a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

598
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:02,546
Can you imagine the advances an alliance
with these creatures might bring?

599
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:03,882
I imagine the advances.

600
00:51:03,906 --> 00:51:05,563
An advance on Washington.

601
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,011
New York. An advance on Chicago!

602
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:10,055
That's not gonna happen.
They literally call themselves...

603
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,261
Decepticons.

604
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,850
That doesn't set off any red flags?
Enough!

605
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:15,406
From both of you.

606
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:16,410
Sir.

607
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:18,105
We are talking about,

608
00:51:18,129 --> 00:51:21,045
the most advanced
robotic system ever seen.

609
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,498
If we tell them no...

610
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:26,773
they will just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

611
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:32,348
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the Cold War?

612
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,828
Fine.

613
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,389
We will help them find their fugitive.

614
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,724
And when it's done,

615
00:51:42,117 --> 00:51:44,036
you can do all the experiments you want.

616
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,981
Yes sir.

617
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,178
Gentle...

618
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,245
Rob... Robots.

619
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,948
Welcome to Sector 7.

620
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:59,641
How kind of you to finally allow us in.

621
00:51:59,704 --> 00:52:01,273
We are very happy to have
you here,

622
00:52:01,499 --> 00:52:02,470
as friends.

623
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,360
Thank you, friend Powell.

624
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:08,524
My superior has agreed to grant you
limited access to our satellites.

625
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:09,781
In addition,

626
00:52:09,953 --> 00:52:11,472
you are welcome to use...

627
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,868
all of our technology here.

628
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:16,926
It's the largest super-array
of Crays on Earth.

629
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,262
We thank you for your hospitality.

630
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:24,225
Tell me, those vocal
communication devices you use,

631
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,377
do they function worldwide?

632
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:27,633
The telephones?

633
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,250
Yes, why?

634
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:38,380
You got to pick a station, man.
I know there is a lot of choices.

635
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,124
You want to go on a date with me, maybe?

636
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:42,619
Ok.

637
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,346
What are you trying to do?

638
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,497
Here we go. Here we go.

639
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,721
You are not a nerd. You are not a nerd.
You are not a nerd. You are not a nerd.

640
00:52:50,746 --> 00:52:53,248
Just ok, you are a nerd,
but just don't let her see that you are nerdy.

641
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,298
Excuse me. Sorry to barge in, I just...

642
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:01,353
Do you just...

643
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:03,097
No, no, it's fine!
Just, just you know...

644
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:05,021
Just sit down, sit down, please.

645
00:53:05,045 --> 00:53:06,493
Don't scream, ok?

646
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:08,364
What is that?

647
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:10,099
It's ok, ok?
Just breathe. Breathe.

648
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,022
First of all, hi.
Hi.

649
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:14,936
I am Charlie.

650
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,625
I am Memo, hi.

651
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:17,829
Hi, Memo.

652
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,063
It's nice to meet you.

653
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,147
Pleasure... Pleasure...

654
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,357
Look, I know what you saw
was a little crazy.

655
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:26,621
I can explain.

656
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,516
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here is the deal.

657
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,270
If you tell anyone what you just saw,

658
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:34,130
I am gonna have to run
you over with my car.

659
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:37,786
Jeez.

660
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:38,734
That was...

661
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:40,956
I don't mean that in a mean way. Ok?

662
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:42,016
What I am saying

663
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,083
is no one,

664
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:45,589
can know what you just saw, ok?

665
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:48,997
You promise?

666
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,300
Yeah.

667
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,325
Ok.

668
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:58,849
Bumblebee, you can...

669
00:53:59,146 --> 00:54:00,302
you can come out now.

670
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:07,950
What?

671
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,456
It's...

672
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,125
He.

673
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,093
He is been going up and down on that dial
all day today and I don't know why?

674
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:26,956
Hey, check out his reflexes.
What?

675
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:29,089
Oh, God!

676
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:31,587
Yo, give me your shirt.

677
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:32,993
Give me your shirt.

678
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,564
You mean, you mean
the shirt that I am wearing?

679
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:36,132
Yes, yes! Come on.
I will give it back to you.

680
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:36,716
Ok.

681
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:39,380
Come on! Give me your shirt!

682
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:46,623
Alright.

683
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,191
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no!
You-you-you don't need to do this.

684
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:56,614
Yes I do.
No.

685
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:57,728
But you-you know...

686
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,046
Come here!
No, I-I-I get it.

687
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,173
Come on!
I get it!

688
00:55:07,848 --> 00:55:08,931
Sorry.

689
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:12,215
I know I promised you but,
yeah you are not getting that back.

690
00:55:33,186 --> 00:55:34,538
It's incredible!

691
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:38,428
They are combining
our technology seamlessly.

692
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,983
Satellites, phones, computers.

693
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,760
<i>They are creating an interconnected
web of information.</i>

694
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,471
Volumes of data at their fingertips.

695
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,556
It's revolutionary.

696
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,934
He is a weird guy.
You ever notice that about Powell?

697
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:56,437
They are tracking fluctuations
in Energon levels.

698
00:55:56,521 --> 00:56:00,128
It's like a heat signature
specific to their species.

699
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:01,572
<i>It's astonishing.</i>

700
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,694
<i>It's beautiful. It's...</i>

701
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:05,738
Hello? Hello?

702
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,726
You have given them our satellites,

703
00:56:08,357 --> 00:56:09,980
our comms, God knows what else.

704
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:10,771
Yet...

705
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:13,439
in the space of a day
they ave given us a way

706
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:16,236
to not only hunt down B-127,

707
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,341
but all of them.

708
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,922
Let them finish what they are doing.
Let them find B-127.

709
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,242
And then I will give you permission
to destroy them all.

710
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,498
Use them for spare parts.

711
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,222
Sir, yes sir.

712
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,059
So you have no idea where he came from?

713
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,310
No idea.

714
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,559
You thought about calling the cops?

715
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:42,137
What are they gonna do Memo?
They are just...

716
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:45,104
gonna send him away to a lab
and do weird science experiments on him.

You are getting pretty good
with that radio dial, Bee.

720
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:54,319
Yeah, D.J. Bumble in the house!

722
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,574
Is that why you are always
messing with the dial?

723
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,798
You are trying to teach yourself
how to talk, are not you?

You are an actual genius!

727
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:26,069
What is going on here?
That's Jim from sixth period.

728
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:28,291
He said he was busy this week.

729
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,464
You want to check it out?

730
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,550
This is pretty cool.
Ok.

Hey everybody, come watch!

734
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:43,961

You are off your nut.

Don't do it dude, you are crazy.

Come on, it's not that big a jump.

737

God, is that Tripp Summers?

738
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,177
You know, you know Tripp?

739
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:54,156
I mean, yeah.
I-I spilled a gallon of lemonade on him once.

740
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:57,101
Doesn't anyone have the balls
to jump off this thing with me?

No, sorry about that. It...

You were on the dive team
with my little sister.

749

780

This is Tina's house.

809
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,301
You see these right here?

810
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,639
You grab one of these, like so.

811
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:09,101
And that right there, that's your target.
That's right.

812
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,883
Alright? Just throw it like this.

813
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:16,164
I think we could just hand it to him...
He could maybe, yeah and then...

814
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,240

What...

836
01:04:36,284 --> 01:04:39,823
<i>♪ When I drive that slow, ♪
♪ you know it's hard to steer ♪</i>

837
01:04:42,853 --> 01:04:44,619
We got a yellow vehicle,

838
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:47,316
driving its damn self
through the Pico Tunnel.

839

842
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,470
Good night.

843
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:36,809
Good night.

844
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:47,986
Good night Bee.

845
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,280
Morning, buddy.

846
01:06:02,304 --> 01:06:03,833
I got to go to work, ok?

847
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:08,290
Bee. Listen to me.
You need to stay in this garage.

848
01:06:08,391 --> 01:06:09,912
Ok? After what happened last night,

849
01:06:09,936 --> 01:06:11,802
I am pretty sure
the cops are looking for you,

850
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:12,790
and...

851
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:14,513
you don't exactly blend in.

852
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:17,252
I will be back, alright?

853
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:21,871
Here.

854
01:06:24,392 --> 01:06:25,769
You can have my Pop-Tart.

855
01:06:36,975 --> 01:06:41,045
I need you to go to the frozen
banana stand and steal some sticks.

856
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,750
We are out of sticks.

857
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,211
Can't we just sell the hot dogs
without the sticks?

858
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:47,838
No.

859
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:28,415
What's happening here?

860
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,225
We got a hit, I think.
Where is that location?

861
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,655
Near San Francisco.

862
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,503
A coastal town named Brighton Falls.

863
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,358
You have a personal call.

864
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,989
Hello?
<i>Charlie, Charlie hey, it's-it's Memo.</i>

865
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,575
You got to come home right now.

866
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,168
It's bad. It's really, really bad.

867
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,925
Where is Bumblebee?

868
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,111
Bumblebee,

869
01:10:27,404 --> 01:10:29,184
what have you done?

870
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,144
What were you thinking? What...

871
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,231
I told you to hide in the garage!

872
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,202
Great.

873
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,486
Helpful shame spiral Bee.

874
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,507
I am not mad, ok? This is...

875
01:10:43,752 --> 01:10:44,866
all my fault.

876
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,677
I never should have left you.

877
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,625
Hey, ok, maybe don't transform all the way?

878
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:55,673
We have still got to get you
through the door.

879
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,130
Come on, buddy.

880
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,513
It's ok.

881
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,445
I am so screwed.

882
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,482
And now you are crippled for life.

883
01:11:37,507 --> 01:11:39,518
Honey, watch the hair.

884
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,858
Go. Now. But be quiet.

885
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:49,176
Mom, wait!

886
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,059
Oh, my God!

887
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,731
Mom...
What happened?

888
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,833
I am sorry. This is all my fault.

889
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:01,560
What'd you do to my TV?

890
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:03,069
Look, Mom, I can explain.

891
01:12:03,094 --> 01:12:05,102
We will talk about this
we will talk about this later, alright?

892
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:07,023
Now, I have to go.
Are you kidding me?

893
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:08,703
No. You are not going anywhere.

894
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,606
It's about my car. It's really important.

895
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:11,703
About your car?

896
01:12:11,778 --> 01:12:14,358
That you spend all day and night shut
in that garage,

897
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:16,677
doing God-knows-what with?
Mom, I can't.

898
01:12:16,826 --> 01:12:18,529
I really can't right now.
Oh, no,

899
01:12:18,554 --> 01:12:20,370
you really can, Charlie.

900
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:22,208
You really can.

901
01:12:22,233 --> 01:12:23,381
I have had it!

902
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:26,276
Your attitude, your always sulking around.

903
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:29,763
You brought home that piece of crap
without even asking me!

904
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,807
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

905
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,310
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

906
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,312
You know Mom,
just because you have moved on

907
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,148
and you are happy with your
new life, doesn't mean I have!

908
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,653
You have found a replacement for my dad
and I have not, ok, and I never will!

909
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,934
So I am sorry if that makes things harder,

910
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,573
but in ten months from now you...

911
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,534
you won't even have to deal with me!

912
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,504
Charlie!

913
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:04,666
Hey, you ok?

914
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,853
Yeah.

915
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,806
I just feel like ever since my dad died,

916
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,850
I have become this drain on everyone,
and I hate it.

917
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:20,981
It's like everybody expects me
to act like nothing ever happened and they...

918
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,997
it's impossible to do that.

919
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,057
About your dad I am...

920
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,066
I am really sorry.

921
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:30,378
Thanks.

922
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,146
You know there is...

923
01:13:32,857 --> 01:13:34,433
there is this quote that I like.

924
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,848
The darkest nights produce
the brightest stars.

925
01:13:43,545 --> 01:13:44,755
That's nice.

926
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,674
My mom got it from Weight Watchers.

927
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,233
Get out and move away from the vehicle.

928
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:07,986
Stay cool Bee.

929
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:18,455
What's going on?

930
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:20,453
Hey!

931
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,242
Come on! Come on!
Stop it!

932
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,461
Let go of me!

933
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,148
Weapons now! Take it down!
Run!

934
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:29,924
No, don't run. Do not run!

935
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:34,846
She ran.

936
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,080
Please tell me they are on our side.

937
01:15:12,928 --> 01:15:14,596
No more running.

938
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:16,805
No more hiding.

939
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:23,007
B-127,

940
01:15:23,031 --> 01:15:25,355
you are a traitor and a coward.

941
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,740
Tell us where Optimus Prime is hiding.

942
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:32,287
Bee, look out!

943
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:36,282
Why isn't he fighting back?

944
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,284
Why don't you fight?

945
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,161
Leave him alone! Please!

946
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,166
Again.

947
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,921
Hit it again!

948
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:52,966
Stop! Stop it!

949
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,290
Your daughter stole government
property, Mrs. Watson.

950
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,624
She is been having trouble adjusting but...

951
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,335
we had no idea it was this serious.

952
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:32,217
I...

953
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:34,232
Charlie. Honey.

954
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,968
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

955
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:38,639
He?
Ma'am.

956
01:16:38,664 --> 01:16:40,125
I can assure you that it,

957
01:16:40,173 --> 01:16:41,281
is an it.

958
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:43,460
It is a highly dangerous war machine.

959
01:16:43,514 --> 01:16:45,066
No, he isn't, ok Mom?

960
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:47,132
He is not some war machine.
I...

961
01:16:47,156 --> 01:16:49,246
I don't know what he is, but...

962
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,336
He is my friend.

963
01:16:52,011 --> 01:16:54,514
Ma'am, your daughter had
a traumatic experience today.

964
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,738
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she has seen.

965
01:16:56,905 --> 01:16:58,262
She is disoriented.

966
01:16:58,287 --> 01:17:01,121
No, I am fine, Mom.
I am completely fine, ok?

967
01:17:01,146 --> 01:17:03,732
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

968
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:05,926
Stop! Just go to your room.

969
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,135
When I was going through puberty,

970
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,967
I stole things too.

971
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:21,311
Stole a box of Mallomars once.
Yeah we know.

972
01:18:04,741 --> 01:18:05,742
Boom.

973
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:08,090
Caught you.

974
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:10,574
Mom is gonna love this.

975
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:12,330
Alright, look Otis,
you need to go home and...

976
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,898
Mom!

977
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:16,894
No, Otis, stop it!
Why would you do that?

978
01:18:16,919 --> 01:18:19,035
Let go of me!
You are touching my buttocks!

979
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:22,082
Look. I will tell you a secret
if you shut up.

980
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:24,771
Ok, so...

981
01:18:24,795 --> 01:18:26,148
this is my...

982
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:27,328
room.

983
01:18:27,471 --> 01:18:29,222
Just make yourself at home.

984
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:31,200
These are actually my sister's stuff.

985
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,349
She likes playing pranks,
like putting her stuff over here.

986
01:18:34,374 --> 01:18:36,543
Can I sit down?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

987
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:38,286
<i>Residents of Brighton Falls
have been witness</i>

988
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:40,592
<i>to an unusual sight this evening.</i>

989
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:43,970
<i>Armed Forces pouring into town

<i>setting up camp at our own

992
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:52,218
If Bumblebee is still alive,
that's where they are keeping him.

993
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,981
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

994
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,691
Count me in. I will take point.

995
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,560
No, you won't.
Come on.

996
01:18:59,585 --> 01:19:00,625
No, Otis.

997
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:03,297
But I can help. Master Larry says I...
I need someone here.

998
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,103
I need someone reliable,

999
01:19:05,127 --> 01:19:07,076
to make sure that
Mom and Ron don't know that I am gone.

1000
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:09,031
I am someone reliable.

1001
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:12,081
Hell, yeah, you are.

1002
01:19:16,823 --> 01:19:17,810
Good luck.

1003
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:19,584
You too.

1004
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,587
Get over here.

1005
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,102
Let's do this.

1006
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:35,049
Tell us where Optimus Prime
and the rebels are hiding,

1007
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:37,721
and we can end this war.

1008
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:41,027
Talk!

1009
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,250
Who is Optimus Prime?

1010
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:45,617
This doesn't concern you, human Powell.

1011
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,242
Last chance.

1012
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,292
Are you sure this is a good idea?

1013
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,177
It's a terrible idea,
but I have got to try it.

1014
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:00,907
You can't get... Well, stop...

1015
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:05,093
How would you know the power was off?
I didn't. Let's go.

1016
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,018
Can I?

1017
01:20:12,043 --> 01:20:14,129
His memory cells are fried.

1018
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,338
Finish him.

1019
01:20:22,678 --> 01:20:24,308
<i>We will fight on.</i>

1020
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:27,859
<i>Regroup, rebuild, and retake our home.</i>

1021
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:30,118
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

1022
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,120
<i>You will travel to Earth.</i>

1023
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:34,747
<i>Once we have gathered the others,
we will join you.</i>

1024
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,250
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

1025
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,323
<i>If the Decepticons find it,</i>

1026
01:20:39,347 --> 01:20:42,318
<i>then our people are truly finished.</i>

1027
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,549
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

1028
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,135
<i>I am coming.</i>

1029
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,222
Prime is coming here?

1030
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,599
They are all coming here.

1031
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:57,979
This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

1032
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:01,149
We will burn the whole planet to cinders.

1033
01:21:01,816 --> 01:21:04,027
We must get word to Cybertron immediately.

1034
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,194
<i>This is Burns.</i>

1035
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:07,155
Tell them to bring an army.

1036
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:10,133
Burns, we made a terrible mistake.

1037
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:11,250
Powell?

1038
01:21:11,323 --> 01:21:14,034
And thanks to our human allies,

1039
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:16,817
I know just how to get the message home.

1040
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:18,543
They are using our satellites.

1041
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,460
<i>They are calling an army.</i>

1042
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,003
They are gonna kill us all.

1043
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,327
Thank you for your hospitality,

1044
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:27,168
friend Powell.

1045
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,230
He is all yours.

1046
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,864
No.
<i>Powell?</i>

1047
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:33,391
<i>You have to stop them!</i>
Powell!

1048
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,479
Where is the Krazy Glue?

1049
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,856
What, did she cut the wire to the TV?

1050
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,315
Ron.

1051
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:45,862
Charlie!

1052
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,320
Charlie!

1053
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,659
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

1054
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:52,992
Where is your sister?

1055
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:57,914
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in her
bedroom for the rest of the evening.

1056
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,528
She wishes not to be troubled.

1057
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,292
Keep clear of her chambers.

1058
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,585
What?

1059
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,499
Charlie has fallen ill

1060
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:11,219
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

1061
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,521
She wishes not to...
Otis!

1062
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:14,982
Are you on drugs?

1063
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:17,509
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

1064
01:22:17,534 --> 01:22:19,324
Please stop. Stop!
Charlie!

1065
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:21,270
Mom, there is no reason to go...
Where is she?

1066
01:22:21,295 --> 01:22:23,294
Mom, stop!
Quit it, Otis.

1067
01:22:29,237 --> 01:22:30,259
Where is she?

1068
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,493
Otis?

1069
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:40,331
I found a tower to transmit our message.

1070
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:41,833
It's close.

1071
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,380
B-127.

1072
01:22:45,717 --> 01:22:47,355
I almost forgot.

1073
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,673
I didn't.

1074
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,426
No! Don't shoot!

1075
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,471
No!

1076
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:11,942
Bee!

1077
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:16,367
Talk to me Bee, talk to me.

1078
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,029
I can fix this.

1079
01:23:24,465 --> 01:23:25,833
I can fix this.

1080
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:30,731
Charlie.

1081
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:31,912
You got to wake up Bee.

1082
01:23:32,232 --> 01:23:33,685
You got to wake up.

1083
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,344
Please.

1084
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:38,973
Charlie, we got to go.

1085
01:23:40,021 --> 01:23:40,943
Charlie.

1086
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,086
The gun.
What?

1087
01:23:45,111 --> 01:23:46,571
The electric gun. Get it.

1088
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:49,868
I can fix you.

1089
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:53,985
Come on, Bee.

1090
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:55,493
Come back to me.

1091
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:03,295
Come on, give me the other one.

1092
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:11,136
Bee, come on.

1093
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,527
I can't lose you too, Bee.

1094
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,178
Please, Bee!

1095
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:32,443
I am sorry.

1096
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,548
Oh, my God.

1097
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,472
Come on Bee,
we have got to get you out of here.

1098
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:14,806
Charlie,

1099
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:16,801
there is like a million guys out there!

1100
01:25:17,595 --> 01:25:18,846
We got to move now.

1101
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,325
Come on Bee, you have got to get up.
Can you get up?

1102
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,730
There is a door in my way.
Move! Move! Move!

1103
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:27,839
They ave got bombs!

1104
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,511
We got to go.
Bee come on.

1105
01:25:31,419 --> 01:25:32,294
Charlie!

1106
01:25:32,469 --> 01:25:33,833
You have got to get up, come on.

1107
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:35,848
Three.
Charlie!

1108
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:37,629
Two.
Come on.

1109
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:38,872
One.

1110
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:40,386
Charlie!
Come on.

1111
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:58,499
Memo?

1112
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:02,729
Memo?

1113
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,523
Memo, wake up.

1114
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,424
Easy.

1115
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,198
Easy.

1116
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:15,930
Hold your fire!

1117
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,653
Get the kid out of here.

1118
01:26:19,398 --> 01:26:21,051
Memo! Wake up, Memo!

1119
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,387
Come on, kid.
Hey! No!

1120
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:26,729
Bee!

1121
01:26:26,825 --> 01:26:27,868
Run!

1122
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,058
Bee!

1123
01:26:32,753 --> 01:26:33,511
Run!

1124
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:34,803
Let go of me!

1125
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:36,189
You need to get away from that thing.
No!

1126
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,634
Take it down!
No, stop!

1127
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:45,050
Stop it!
Contain it and dismantle it!

1128
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:46,722
Strip it down to parts!

1129
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,900
Leave him alone!

1130
01:26:48,924 --> 01:26:50,289
You don't understand.

1131
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,042
Fight back, Bee!

1132
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:55,795
Bee!
Kid, stop! It's a machine!

1133
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,214
He is more human than you will ever be!

1134
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:00,341
That is enough!

1135
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:24,365
Oh, shit.

1136
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,794
Open fire!

1137
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:52,074
Fall back! Take cover!

1138
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,492
Bee!

1139
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,006
Bee!

1140
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:16,249
Bee, stop!

1141
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:38,355
You remember, don't you?

1142
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:44,463
They are coming back.

1143
01:28:49,919 --> 01:28:50,989
Oh, God.

1144
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:53,245
Are you ok?

1145
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:56,098
Yeah. Yeah, I am fine.

1146
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:58,700
We, we need to get out of here.

1147
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,587
We have got to get you someplace safe.

1148
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,884
Bee stop. They will kill you!

1149
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,637
<i>If the Decepticons find Earth,</i>

1150
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:12,902
<i>then our people are truly finished.</i>

1151
01:29:14,377 --> 01:29:15,088
Ok.

1152
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,254
Then we fight.

1153
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,544
Let's go, get in.

1154
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,408
Go on. I will buy you
some time with these guys.

1155
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:43,757
You just kiss me?

1156
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,288
On the cheek.

1157
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:47,718
Still counts.

1158
01:29:54,348 --> 01:29:55,349
Still counts.

1159
01:30:05,244 --> 01:30:06,127
Halt!

1160
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:08,846
Stop.

1161
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:15,373
Well, that didn't work.

1162
01:30:22,258 --> 01:30:23,342
Move, move!

1163
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,353
Faster Bee, faster!

1164
01:30:44,516 --> 01:30:46,017
We should really look 
into getting seat-belts.

1165

Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1166
01:30:47,259 --> 01:30:48,973
It's ok. She is gonna steal the robot back,

1167
01:30:48,997 --> 01:30:51,764
fight off the police, kill two bigger
robots and come right back home.

1168
01:30:51,789 --> 01:30:52,865
Shut up Otis.

1169
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:54,680
<i>This just breaking news.</i>

1170
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:57,286
<i>There appears to be
a high-speed chase underway</i>

1171
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,272
<i>just outside McKinnon Air Base.</i>

1172
01:30:59,297 --> 01:31:00,507
Go right! Go right!

1173
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,220
Closer. Closer.

1174
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:18,432
You lose that car,
I will personally rip your face off.

1175
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,132
Oh, God!

1176
01:31:23,156 --> 01:31:24,477
It's all under control.

1177
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,436
Charlie!
Mom?

1178
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:32,745
You pull that car over right this second.

1179
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:34,934
This is very unsafe, what you are doing.

1180
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:36,833
Mom, you got to get out of here, ok?

1181
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:41,955
Mom...

1182
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:44,041
You have to trust me, please!

1183
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:46,669
Charlie!

1184
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:48,879
We got to help her, Ron!
Hang on.

1185
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,425
Oh, my God! Ron!

1186
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,013
Get out of the way!

1187
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,599
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing?

1188
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,343
I saw this on Miami Vice.

1189
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:06,622
God!

1190
01:32:08,114 --> 01:32:10,161
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Oh, my God!

1191
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:36,076
Nice driving, Ron.

1192

Is everyone ok?

1193
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:43,552
Ron! We have a kid in the car!

1194
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:46,432
I was trying to save the other kid!
What was I...

1195
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,175
It was a lose-lose.

1196
01:32:48,298 --> 01:32:49,218
Otis?

1197
01:32:49,562 --> 01:32:50,995
Otis, are you alright?

1198
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,556
That...

1199
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,581
was radical.

1200
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:25,476
Preparing satellites
to transmit our message.

1201
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:46,538
Ok. What's the plan?

1202
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:52,740
This is the plan?

1203
01:33:53,379 --> 01:33:54,659
I hate this plan.

1204
01:33:54,683 --> 01:33:56,089
Bee, I want to help.

1205
01:33:57,007 --> 01:34:01,743
<i>I would hate anything
To happen to her</i>

1206
01:34:02,179 --> 01:34:05,728
You are actually talking.
And you are listening to The Smiths.

1207
01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:17,389
Be careful.

1208
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:27,608
Handle him!

1209
01:34:27,633 --> 01:34:29,541
And finish the job this time!

1210
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:47,307
Oh, shit!

1211
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,503
How the hell am I gonna get up there?

1212
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:53,834
There. The one on the tower.

1213
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:56,881
You think these little chains can hold...

1214
01:38:09,176 --> 01:38:10,285
Ok.

1215
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:36,624
Hold on!

1216
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:58,558
What are you doing?

1217
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:38,812
Come on.

1218
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:45,342
Come on.

1219
01:40:05,593 --> 01:40:06,594
No.

1220
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,638
After I kill you,

1221
01:40:31,242 --> 01:40:32,711
I kill her.

1222
01:40:32,736 --> 01:40:33,698
Bee, no!

1223
01:40:37,941 --> 01:40:39,136
You missed.

1224
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,250
You will kill us both!

1228

You need to get out of here.

1230

1235

I am here. I made it.

For making me feel like me again.

Goodbye, Bumblebee.

1256

No way.

1257
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:12,550
You kidding me?

1258
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:17,238
Are you telling me you could have been
a Camaro this whole time?

1259

Oh, my God!

Otis.

1267
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,536
They forced me to tell.

1268
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,169
I am glad they did.

1269

1272
