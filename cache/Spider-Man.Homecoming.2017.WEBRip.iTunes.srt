1
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,959
Things are never gonna be
the same now.

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,169
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,380
You got aliens.

4
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,800
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,262
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,974
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,935
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,521
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,438
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,483
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,443
Yeah, well...

12
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,737
...we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,513
No, hey!

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,099
You can't saw through that stuff.

15
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,102
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,229
You gotta use the stuff they use.

17
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,234
-See? All right.
-All right.

18
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,738
Oh, hey!

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,199
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

20
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,618
-Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
-Yeah, your alarm.

21
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,495
Look, just go stack
that armour plating like I asked you.

22
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,456
This is a huge deal for us.

23
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,082
Attention, please!

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,085
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...

25
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,797
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

26
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,050
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

27
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,510
Who the hell are you?

28
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,136
Qualified personnel.

29
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,641
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so--

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,769
I apologise, Mr Toomes,
but all salvage operations...

31
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,395
...are now under our jurisdiction.

32
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,857
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...

33
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,359
...or you will be prosecuted.

34
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,486
Ma'am, what am--?

35
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,531
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

36
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,282
Look...

37
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,952
...I bought trucks for this job.

38
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,495
I brought in a whole new crew.

39
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,164
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

40
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,458
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.

41
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,962
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

42
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,256
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.

43
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,467
What'd you say?

44
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,012
Yeah.

45
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,849
He's right. I overextended myself.

46
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,685
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Don't do it.

47
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,354
Put them down.

48
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,442
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.

49
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,404
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

50
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,198
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...

51
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,951
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...

52
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,162
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.

53
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,124
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.

54
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,542
Yeah, it's all rigged.

55
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,296
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...

56
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,464
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.

57
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,300
Hey, chief!

58
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,970
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

59
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,180
I ain't hauling it.

60
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,556
It's too bad.

61
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,642
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,938
I tell you what.

63
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,191
Let's keep it.

64
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,360
The world's changing.

65
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,950
It's time we change, too.

66
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,163
There you go, Mason.

67
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,170
Business is good.

68
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,296
New York. Queens.

69
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,089
It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.

70
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,924
Who you talking to?

71
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,260
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.

72
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,846
-You know you can't show it to anyone.
-Yeah, I know.

73
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,848
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?

74
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,601
-Because it's fun.
-Fun.

75
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,770
So why do they call you Happy?

76
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,609
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.

77
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,694
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?

78
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,029
There's a bathroom on it.

79
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,323
No pilot? That's awesome.

80
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,075
-Is that where you're gonna sit?
-Yeah.

81
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,244
This is your first time
on a private plane?

82
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,954
My first time on any plane.

83
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,874
Should it--? Should it be--?
Should it be making that noise?

84
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,845
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

85
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,224
Something about
Captain America going crazy.

86
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,184
-This is you.
-Oh, we're neighbours?

87
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,436
We're not roommates. Suit up.

88
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,938
Okay, Peter, you got this.

89
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,191
-What the hell are you wearing?
-It's my suit.

90
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,151
-Where's the case?
-What case?

91
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,903
What? I thought that was a closet.

92
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,321
-This is still my room?
-Go.

93
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,281
-My room is way bigger than--
-There.

94
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,200
I found the case. I found the case.

95
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,953
"A minor upgrade"?

96
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,039
Oh, my God.

97
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,415
-Put it on.
-What the--?

98
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,501
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--

99
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,003
-Let's go.
-But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.

100
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,548
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

101
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,592
This is insane. Insane.

102
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,886
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.

103
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,347
-This is the greatest day of my life.
-Let's go.

104
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,516
Okay, there's Captain America,
Iron Man...

105
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,643
...Black Widow. Who's that new guy?

106
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,980
-Underoos!
-Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

107
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,941
Hey, everyone.

108
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,861
The craziest thing just happened.

109
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,698
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--

110
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:31,034
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,540
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

112
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,043
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

113
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,837
And then-- Hey, just a second!

114
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,714
Coming!

115
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,300
Hey.

116
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,260
We have thin walls here.

117
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,222
What are you doing, a little video diary?

118
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,183
-Yeah.
-It's all right.

119
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,893
-I'd do the same thing.
-I told him not to.

120
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,102
He was filming.

121
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,438
-I'm gonna wipe the chip.
-Okay. Hey. You know what?

122
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,941
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

123
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,527
-An alibi? Sure. Okay.
-We rolling? Get in the frame.

124
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,406
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

125
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,118
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.

126
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,204
Three, two, one. Hey, May.

127
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,876
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...

128
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,922
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.

129
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,715
Everyone was impressed.

130
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,009
Come on! It's a freaking merge.
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,719
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.

132
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,889
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.

133
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,683
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

134
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,809
That was a private conversation.

135
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,355
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.

136
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,983
-No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
-Here we are. End of the line.

137
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,321
-Can you give us a moment?
-Want me to leave?

138
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,948
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

139
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,159
I can keep the suit?

140
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,411
Yes, we were just talking about it.

141
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,582
Do me a favour, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

142
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,918
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

143
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,003
I've seen his cardiogram.

144
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,755
-All right?
-Yes.

145
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,300
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

146
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,428
There's a little grey area in there.
That's where you operate.

147
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,722
-Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
-No.

148
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,975
-This it?
-Seventh floor.

149
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,561
-I can take that. You don't have to.
-You'll take it?

150
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,105
-Yeah, I can take that.
-Thank you.

151
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,067
So when's our next--?
When's our next "retreat," you know?

152
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,862
-What, next mission?
-Yeah, the mission. The missions.

153
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,864
-We'll call you.
-Do you have my numbers?

154
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,240
No, I mean, we'll call you.

155
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,576
Like, someone will call you. All right?

156
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,995
-From your team.
-Okay. All right.

157
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,999
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

158
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,711
Bye.

159
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,634
They're gonna call me.

160
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,727
What's up, Penis Parker?

161
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,441
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.

162
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,568
Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.

163
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,362
Do you have a date for homecoming?

164
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,656
Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.

165
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,783
-Okay.
-Yeah.

166
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,543
Damn it. You, in my office right now.

167
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,480
Join me, and together...

168
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,941
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

169
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,861
-What?
-So lame.

170
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,612
That's awesome. How many pieces?

171
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,614
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

172
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,034
-That's insane.
-I know. You want to build it tonight?

173
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,120
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--

174
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,955
-Stark internship.
-Yeah, exactly.

175
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,373
Always got that internship.

176
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,459
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

177
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,128
-That would be so sweet.
-Right?

178
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,672
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

179
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,507
Here's a gold coin."

180
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,178
-I don't know how jobs work.
-That's exactly how they work.

181
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,055
I'll knock out the bones
of the Death Star.

182
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,143
I'll come by afterwards. For the most
part, the difficult thing is the base of it.

183
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,646
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

184
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,816
That'd be great.

185
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,318
I'm gonna be late.

186
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,820
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...

187
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,073
...between points A and B?

188
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,283
Flash.

189
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,494
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.

190
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,956
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

191
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,376
Yeah, yeah.

192
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,881
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

193
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:39,927
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

194
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,720
You're dead.

195
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:49,436
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

196
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,231
...but trust me,
there's nothing Bohr-ing...

197
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,692
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

198
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,704
Did Liz get a new top?

199
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,625
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

200
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,628
-Liz, hey. That looks so good.
-Hi!

201
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,422
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

202
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,841
Too late.

203
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,676
You guys are losers.

204
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,053
Well, then why do you sit with us?

205
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,763
Because I don't have any friends.

206
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,767
Next question.

207
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,436
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

208
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,689
Hydrogen's the lightest.

209
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,315
That's not the question. Okay.

210
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,692
-Yeah.
-Uranium.

211
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,944
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.

212
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,154
-Yes.
-Please open your books to page 10.

213
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,532
Peter, it's nationals.

214
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,909
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

215
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:50,038
I can't go to Washington. If Mr Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

216
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,583
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

217
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,001
Wait. What's happening?

218
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,128
-Peter's not going to Washington.
-No.

219
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,463
-No, no, no.
-Why not?

220
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,340
Really? Right before nationals?

221
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,177
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

222
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,597
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

223
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,016
Flash, you're in for Peter.

224
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,310
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

225
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,687
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.

226
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,647
That is false.

227
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,193
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

228
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,586
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey, man.

229
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,881
What's up, Mr Delmar?

230
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,591
Hey, Mr Parker.

231
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,967
Number five, right?

232
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,638
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.

233
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,264
You got it, boss.

234
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,974
How's your aunt?

235
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,643
Yeah, she's all right.

236
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,355
She's a very hot Italian woman.

237
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,565
How's your daughter?

238
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,195
-Ten dollars.
-It's 5 dollars.

239
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:07,074
-For that comment, 10 dollars.
-Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

240
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,576
Here's 5 dollars.

241
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,246
What's up, Murph?

242
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,373
How you doing, buddy?

243
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,626
So how's school?

244
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,753
It's boring. Got better things to do.

245
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,173
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

246
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,885
-This is great.
-Best sandwiches in Queens.

247
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,581
Finally.

248
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,088
-What's the matter with you?
-Could you hold this?

249
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,590
Thanks.

250
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,928
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

251
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,514
-Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
-I have no change.

252
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,974
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

253
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,438
Everybody good?

254
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,779
Hey!

255
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,740
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?

256
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,950
Call me Spider-Man.

257
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,618
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

258
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,330
-Yeah!
-Not bad.

259
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,178
Hey, buddy.

260
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,391
-Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
-It's my car, dumbass!

261
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,268
Hey! Shut that off!

262
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,478
-Can you tell him it's my car?
-I was--

263
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,189
-I work at nights. Come on.
-That's not your car!

264
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,483
-That's his car.
-How was I supposed to know?

265
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,027
-He was putting that in the window!
-Every day with these alarms!

266
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,030
-Turn it off!
-Don't make me come down there, punk.

267
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,867
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

268
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,369
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

269
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,752
I'm good, I'm good.

270
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,380
You have reached
the voicemail box of:

271
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,007
Happy Hogan.

272
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,384
Hey, Happy. Here's my report
for tonight.

273
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,052
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

274
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,763
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

275
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,225
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

276
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,270
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.

277
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,607
I just feel like I could be doing more.

278
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,985
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.

279
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,446
So, yeah, just call me back.

280
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,365
It's Peter. Parker.

281
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,748
Why would I tell him about the churro?

282
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,003
Hey, hey.

283
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,842
Okay.

284
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,096
-Can't wait to see this thing.
-Finally, something good.

285
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,852
Yo, this high-tech stuff
makes it too easy.

286
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,855
-Told you it was worth it.
-Okay, go, go, go.

287
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,736
Oh, nice.

288
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,739
We can hit, like,
five more places tonight.

289
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,461
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

290
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,921
You're the Avengers.

291
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,006
What are you guys doing here?

292
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,761
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.

293
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,431
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.

294
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,518
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

295
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,355
Hey--

296
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,524
Oh, this feels so weird.

297
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,611
What is that thing?

298
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,032
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

299
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,746
911. What's your emergency?

300
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:09,501
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

301
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,503
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.

302
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,051
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

303
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,014
No. Wait, wait, wait!

304
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,437
Mr Delmar.

305
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,858
Hey, Mr Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

306
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,827
Oh, come on.

307
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,247
I gotta--

308
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,875
-Here, here.
-Good, yeah.

309
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,337
Okay. Good. Yes.

310
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,922
Yes-- No. No, put that down.

311
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,217
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?

312
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,470
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...

313
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,847
-...with high-tech weapons--
-Take a breath. I don't have time...

314
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,891
-...for ATM robberies...
-Yeah, but--

315
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:09,311
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

316
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,188
Everything's gotta be out next week.

317
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,983
-Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
-Yeah, don't you watch the news?

318
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,445
Tony sold Avengers Tower. We're
relocating to a new facility upstate...

319
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,823
-...where hopefully cell service is worse.
-But what about me?

320
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,742
What about you?

321
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,954
Well, what if Mr Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

322
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,582
-Can I please talk to Mr Stark?
-Stay away from anything dangerous.

323
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,502
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

324
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,881
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.

325
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,467
-My backpack's gone.
-That doesn't sound responsible.

326
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,637
-I'll call you back.
-Feel free not to.

327
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,782
What was that?

328
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,327
It's nothing. Nothing.

329
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,204
You're the Spider-Man.

330
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,207
-From YouTube.
-I'm not. I'm not.

331
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,667
-You were on the ceiling.
-No. What are you doing in my room?

332
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,753
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

333
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,130
You can't just bust into my room!

334
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,008
That turkey meatloaf recipe
is a disaster.

335
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,802
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

336
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,221
-Yes.
-No. He's got a thing.

337
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,973
A thing to do after.

338
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,017
Okay.

339
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,853
Maybe put on some clothes.

340
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:18,357
-Oh, she doesn't know?
-Nobody knows.

341
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:20,776
Mr Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.

342
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:24,154
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?

343
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,907
Yeah, basically.

344
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,370
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

345
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:33,372
-Secret? Why?
-You know what she's like.

346
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,542
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.

347
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,918
Come on, Ned, please.

348
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,795
Okay, okay, okay.

349
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,673
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.

350
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,591
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

351
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,427
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

352
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:51,348
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.

353
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,395
-Okay.
-Just swear it, okay?

354
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:57,896
I swear.

355
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,107
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

356
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,192
I can't believe this is happening now.

357
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,610
-Can I try the suit on?
-No.

358
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,612
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

359
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,990
-I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
-Great.

360
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,117
Okay, well, wait, then.

361
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,787
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

362
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,040
This is the Stark internship.

363
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,252
Just get out of here.

364
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,464
What's the matter?

365
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,550
Thought you loved larb.

366
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,886
It's too larby?

367
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,763
Not larby enough.

368
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,518
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?

369
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,854
You know I larb you.

370
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:42,065
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

371
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,275
A lot of work.

372
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:45,694
The Stark internship.

373
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:49,531
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

374
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:53,911
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

375
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,164
-Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
-What does he have you doing?

376
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,916
-...in an explosion...
-You need to use your instincts.

377
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:02,211
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...

378
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,462
What?

379
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,172
...the Spider-Man.

380
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,674
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...

381
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:11,512
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.

382
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,722
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

383
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,891
If you spot something
like that happening...

384
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,976
...you turn and you run the other way.

385
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,895
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

386
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,355
Six blocks away from us.

387
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,524
I need a new backpack.

388
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,152
-What?
-I need a new backpack.

389
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,820
That's five.

390
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,366
-Sticky rice pudding.
-We didn't order that.

391
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,368
It's on the house.

392
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,411
Thanks.

393
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,457
That's nice of him.

394
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,210
I think he larbs you.

395
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,338
You got bit by a spider?

396
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:47,965
Can it bite me?

397
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,967
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

398
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,427
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

399
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,179
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

400
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,557
The spider's dead, Ned.

401
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,900
You were here?

402
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,027
Yeah.

403
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,822
You could've died.

404
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,201
Do you lay eggs?

405
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,078
What? No.

406
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,292
-Can you spit venom?
-No.

407
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,752
Can you summon an army of spiders?

408
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,004
No, Ned.

409
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,090
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place....

410
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,551
How far can you shoot your webs?

411
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:33,927
It's unknown. Shut up.

412
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,345
--to begin regulating....

413
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,848
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...

414
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:41,393
-...and just shoot it as far as I could--
-Shut up, Ned.

415
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,439
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...

416
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,274
-Do you know him too?
-Yeah, we met.

417
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,901
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.

418
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,153
-I stole his shield.
-What?

419
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,363
Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...

420
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,158
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.

421
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,409
Thank you, Captain.

422
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:00,621
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

423
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,998
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

424
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,666
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

425
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,460
What does Hulk smell like?

426
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,629
-I bet he smells nice.
-You have to shut up.

427
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,507
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

428
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,592
Ned, just...okay?

429
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,262
-Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
-What?

430
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,973
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...

431
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,975
...telling the other guy where to go?

432
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,978
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

433
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,731
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

434
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,984
-I could be your guy in the chair.
-I don't need a guy in the chair.

435
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,819
Looking good, Parker.

436
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:38,492
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...

437
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,536
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

438
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,538
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

439
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:43,914
It's just Spider-Man.

440
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:47,292
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

441
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,294
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.

442
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,546
No way.

443
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,756
-Kind of.
-Oh, gross.

444
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,843
-He's probably 30.
-You don't know what he looks like.

445
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,970
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

446
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,848
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

447
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,891
Peter knows Spider-Man.

448
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,855
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--

449
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,357
They're friends.

450
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,485
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.

451
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,363
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

452
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:17,906
But it's...

453
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,784
...through the Stark internship.

454
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,580
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

455
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,623
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?

456
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,459
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

457
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,921
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

458
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,507
-Having a party?
-Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

459
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,468
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.

460
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,179
It's okay.

461
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,056
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so....

462
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,058
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?

463
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:52,900
What are you doing?

464
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,568
Helping you out.

465
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,320
Did you not hear her?

466
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,947
Liz has a crush on you.

467
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,452
Dude, you're an Avenger.

468
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,497
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

469
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,295
House party in the suburbs.

470
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:16,840
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

471
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,218
It'll be a night to remember.

472
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,513
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

473
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,640
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

474
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,016
This is a mistake.

475
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,434
Hey, let's just go home.

476
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,061
Oh, Peter.

477
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,980
I know. I know it's really hard...

478
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,400
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

479
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,610
It's flowering now.

480
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,864
He's so stressed out lately.

481
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,616
What helps with stress is a party.

482
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,661
-We should go to the party.
-Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

483
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,705
Peter.

484
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,708
-Have fun, okay? Okay.
-I will.

485
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,752
Bye, May.

486
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,756
Dude, you have the suit, right?

487
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,175
-Yeah.
-This is gonna change our lives.

488
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,015
-Annie, over here!
-Hey.

489
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,350
Hey.

490
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,355
DJ Flash.

491
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,483
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...

492
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,943
...say you guys are tight...

493
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,612
...and I get a fist bump
or one of those half bro-hugs.

494
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,906
Can't believe you're at this lame party.

495
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,283
But you're here too.

496
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,994
Am I?

497
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,789
Oh, my gosh.

498
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:32,749
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

499
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,668
-Hi, Liz.
-Hi, Liz.

500
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,712
I'm so happy you guys came.

501
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,381
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

502
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,843
-What a great party.
-Thanks.

503
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,763
Oh, I--

504
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,600
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--

505
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,226
-Yeah.
-Have fun.

506
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,353
-Bye.
-Bye.

507
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,522
Dude, what are you doing?

508
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,774
She's here. Spider it up.

509
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,569
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.

510
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,988
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

511
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:05,824
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

512
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,285
Peter, no one wants that.

513
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,245
Dude.

514
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,540
Penis Parker, what's up?

515
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,542
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

516
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,253
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

517
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,884
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

518
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,602
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

519
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,813
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

520
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,149
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

521
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,151
He must be around...."

522
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,575
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

523
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:58,794
What the hell?

524
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,358
This sucks.

525
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:30,909
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

526
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,369
Here. You try.

527
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,332
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

528
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,585
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?

529
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,546
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

530
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:47,759
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns....

531
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,012
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.

532
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,807
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.

533
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,227
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

534
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,230
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying...

535
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:01,773
...to shoot them back in time.

536
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,151
I got antigrav climbers.

537
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,402
Yo, climbers?

538
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,198
Okay, what the hell is that?

539
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,368
-Did you set us up?
-Hey, hey, man.

540
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,708
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

541
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,001
All right.

542
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,641
What was that?

543
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,947
-We gotta call him.
-No, no, no.

544
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:56,912
Did you just do it again?

545
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,248
-Shut up.
-I'm calling him.

546
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,342
Toomes's phone.

547
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,886
Boss.

548
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,179
Oh, my butt!

549
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,994
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.

550
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,831
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

551
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,750
Hey, hey, buddy.

552
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,420
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

553
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,757
Now, this is more like it.

554
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,563
Smells really good.

555
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,194
Great movie!

556
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,284
Oh, hey, guys.

557
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,370
No! No!

558
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,248
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.

559
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:24,917
Peter, where are you?

560
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,960
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

561
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,005
Almost got you.

562
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,478
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?

563
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,855
I got you right where I want you.

564
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,858
Surprise!

565
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,947
What the hell?

566
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,954
Oh, hey.

567
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,460
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...

568
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:54,173
...and picked me up, and took me up like
a thousand feet and just dropped me.

569
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,176
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

570
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,178
I put everything in your suit.

571
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:00,679
Including this heater.

572
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,351
That's better. Thanks.

573
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,686
What were you thinking?

574
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:11,148
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

575
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,983
Take him down now, huh?

576
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,902
Crockett, there are people
who handle...

577
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,987
-...this sort of thing.
-The Avengers?

578
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,947
No. This is a little below
their pay grade.

579
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,116
Mr Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.

580
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,701
I had that. I was fine.

581
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,288
Oh, I'm not here.

582
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:28,957
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...

583
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,918
...or you would be toast right now.

584
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,087
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.

585
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,423
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.

586
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,633
-Why?
-Why?

587
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,843
Because I said so!

588
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,013
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

589
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,640
Stay close to the ground.

590
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,600
Build up your game
helping little people...

591
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,852
...like that lady
that bought you the churro.

592
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:52,397
Can't you just be a friendly...

593
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,399
...neighbourhood Spider-Man?

594
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,276
But I'm ready for more than that now.

595
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:57,819
No, you're not.

596
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,280
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

597
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,075
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.

598
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:07,996
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.

599
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:09,623
Are you driving?

600
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,793
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

601
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,711
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

602
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,589
No, I don't need to go to--

603
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:19,800
Mr Stark is no longer connected.

604
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,346
That's awesome.

605
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:30,435
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

606
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,164
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.

607
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,543
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

608
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,879
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."

609
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,088
-Penis!
-Parker!

610
00:38:58,255 --> 00:38:59,464
-Penis!
-Parker!

611
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,217
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.

612
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,304
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-I'll see you tomorrow in school.

613
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,054
Idiots.

614
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,014
Idiots.

615
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,724
Idiots!

616
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:52,601
Boss?

617
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:56,230
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

618
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,815
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

619
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,234
Sorry. You left it out.

620
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,236
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.

621
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,282
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

622
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,537
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?

623
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,747
You're still on that? I told you, no.

624
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,457
The answer's no. Forget it.

625
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,596
I mean, that was badass.

626
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:36,103
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

627
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,814
-You said, move the merchandise.
-Under the radar.

628
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,190
Under the radar!

629
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,109
That's how we survive.

630
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:45,612
If you bring Damage Control or the
Avengers down here, we're through.

631
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:49,199
You're out there wearing
that goofy thing, lighting up cars...

632
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,868
...calling yourself the Shocker.

633
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,162
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

634
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,123
Whatever, old man. Come on.

635
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,001
Look.

636
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:00,586
Look.

637
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,422
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.

638
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,215
But I do.

639
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,510
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.

640
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,889
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,559
You know what?

642
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:18,395
I can't afford your bullshit.

643
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,022
-Get out of here.
-What?

644
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:23,483
-You're done. You're off the crew.
-Yeah, all right.

645
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,402
All right.

646
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,988
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

647
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,990
With everything I know.

648
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:33,785
-Excuse me?
-I'm just saying...

649
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,789
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

650
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,209
-You know what?
-What?

651
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,752
You're right.

652
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,378
-That work?
-I don't know.

653
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,215
I can't afford that.

654
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,926
Wait.

655
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,059
Damn.

656
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:02,022
-I thought this was the antigravity gun.
-What?

657
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:03,273
No, that's that one.

658
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:17,788
Here.

659
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:22,960
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.

660
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,169
All right.

661
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,389
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

662
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,516
Yeah, well, something came up.

663
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:38,892
What is that?

664
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,854
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporise me with it.

665
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,480
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

666
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:45,107
Awesome.

667
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:48,360
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

668
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:50,320
So scary.

669
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,323
Well, look, I think it's...

670
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,950
...a power source.

671
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,703
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

672
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,204
That's an inductive charging plate.

673
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,081
That's what I use
to charge my toothbrush.

674
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,293
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.

675
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:08,338
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.

676
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,550
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...

677
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:14,094
...into this amazing--

678
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,725
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

679
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,979
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

680
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:26,356
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.

681
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:27,816
Let's do it.

682
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,576
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

683
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,204
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."

684
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,455
You're right.

685
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,082
Crap.

686
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,168
Come on, come on, come on.

687
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,382
High schools creep me out.

688
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,052
They got this funny smell, you know?

689
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,513
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

690
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:58,722
What?

691
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,390
-Yeah.
-We gotta get out of here.

692
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,434
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

693
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,187
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

694
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:07,606
-Someone dropped you in a lake?
-Yeah, it was not good.

695
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:11,026
-Peter--
-No. Stay there, Ned.

696
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,778
Peter.

697
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:17,074
What are you doing?

698
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:18,492
Nothing.

699
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,827
Yeah. You good?

700
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,037
Chess.

701
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:28,418
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

702
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,671
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

703
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:32,256
There's no sign of the weapon.

704
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:35,384
-And even if it was here, now it's gone.
-So are we.

705
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,919
This is so awesome.

706
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,921
I know, right?

707
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:17,926
They're in Brooklyn.

708
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,057
Staten Island.

709
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,690
Leaving Jersey.

710
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:40,949
They stopped.

711
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,745
Maryland?

712
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:47,164
-What's there?
-I don't know.

713
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:48,373
Evil lair?

714
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,959
-They have a lair?
-A gang with alien guns...

715
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,920
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.

716
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,505
Badass.

717
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:57,549
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

718
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:02,387
It's not too far from D.C.

719
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,598
-Hey, it's Peter.
-Guys.

720
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:05,807
-Peter?
-Hey, buddy.

721
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,851
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.

722
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:09,645
No, no way. You can't quit on us...

723
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,439
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.

724
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:15,484
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

725
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,985
-What?
-He's taking your place.

726
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,529
Excuse me, can we go already?

727
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:22,491
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

728
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:25,118
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

729
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,666
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.

730
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,459
The second law of thermodynamics.

731
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,920
-Frank Sinatra.
-Fort Sumter.

732
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:37,923
-Flash is wrong.
-Okay, let's focus. Next one.

733
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,424
Liz, don't overwork them.

734
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,635
Strontium, barium, vibranium.

735
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,679
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.

736
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,305
Glad to be back.

737
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:49,142
-What is the current standard unit of--?
-Can I take this real quick?

738
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,811
Yeah, fine.

739
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,771
-Hello?
-Got a blip on my screen here.

740
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:53,981
You left New York?

741
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,774
-Okay, focus up, everyone.
-Tracker.

742
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:58,068
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.

743
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:00,654
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...

744
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:02,614
...is a complete violation of privacy.

745
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:05,117
-That's different.
-What's different?

746
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,744
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.

747
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,998
-It's no big deal.
-Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

748
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,752
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

749
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:29,725
-Everyone stick together.
-Yeah.

750
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,060
You kidding me? This place is huge.

751
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,813
-I've seen bigger.
-There's a bird in here.

752
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,233
-Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
-Why?

753
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,659
Peter...

754
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,829
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

755
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:55,459
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...

756
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,587
...and I don't really want Mr Stark
to know about it.

757
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:00,589
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

758
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,382
No, I'm not lying.

759
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:05,177
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.

760
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:11,266
Gotcha.

761
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:15,604
All right, Happy,
enjoy tracking this lamp.

762
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,610
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...

763
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:25,405
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.

764
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:26,698
What?

765
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:30,494
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.

766
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:33,580
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

767
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,333
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.

768
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,877
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

769
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:41,338
-It's not cool.
-But you are a kid.

770
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,590
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.

771
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:47,511
Peter, I just don't think this is a great
idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

772
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:50,639
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.

773
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:52,558
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

774
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,435
-I don't think this is a good idea.
-The guy in the chair.

775
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:58,063
-Don't do that.
-Come on.

776
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,079
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.

777
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:15,831
-All right?
-Okay. Okay.

778
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,001
-They're moving.
-Be careful.

779
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:24,715
-Hey, Liz.
-Perfect timing.

780
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:26,300
We're gonna go swimming.

781
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,135
-Come on, come on, come on.
-What?

782
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,554
-Hey, Peter.
-Hi.

783
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,557
Hey.

784
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:38,020
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business centre.

785
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,522
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

786
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,982
And besides...

787
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:45,944
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

788
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,489
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--

789
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,909
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.

790
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,994
And I read a coaching book.

791
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,164
You really--
This is really important to you.

792
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,208
Yeah. It's our future.

793
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,792
I'm not gonna screw it up.

794
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:05,714
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

795
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:09,134
-So get your trunks on and come on.
-Come on.

796
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,428
-Come on.
-I'm coming, I'm coming.

797
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:12,638
Let's go.

798
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,789
-Good evening, Peter.
-Hello? Hello?

799
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,875
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...

800
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,586
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.

801
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,338
Thank you.

802
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:48,340
Where would you like
to take me tonight?

803
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:51,218
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

804
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:53,428
Tracker located.

805
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,139
Plotting course to intercept target.

806
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,393
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

807
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:10,112
One hundred metres
from destination and closing.

808
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:12,114
Jump now.

809
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,620
Detecting three individuals.

810
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:22,958
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.

811
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:28,755
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

812
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,215
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?

813
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,843
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.

814
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,928
Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.

815
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:38,015
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos
cleanup. The rest is my design.

816
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,516
Whoa, that's so cool.

817
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,518
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.

818
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,687
I love it. They keep making messes...

819
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:46,231
-...we keep getting rich.
-Target inbound.

820
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,025
They're in the middle of a heist.

821
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,360
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.

822
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,821
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.

823
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:55,699
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?

824
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:58,202
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.

825
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,828
Activating Instant Kill.

826
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,080
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.

827
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:04,541
Deactivating Instant Kill.

828
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:09,254
Did you hear that?

829
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,632
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

830
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,218
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.

831
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,096
What's wrong with my web-shooters?

832
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:20,599
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.

833
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:23,477
-Why would I need rapid-fire?
-Would you like to see more options?

834
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:26,647
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.

835
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:28,524
Mr Stark really overdid it.

836
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,858
You two wait right here.

837
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,152
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.

838
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,656
-That thing will shatter your arm.
-All right, where's the dampers?

839
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,491
-That one.
-Great choice.

840
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,244
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?

841
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:42,788
No, no, no.

842
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:45,499
-Push that in. No, the other--
-Here? This one here?

843
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,001
-What was that?
-Taser webs.

844
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,003
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

845
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,673
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.

846
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:54,883
Would you like to run
a refresher course?

847
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,386
-No. Just-- You choose.
-Sure thing.

848
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,222
Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?

849
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:03,851
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

850
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:08,522
-I got a visual.
-Green light, green light.

851
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,403
Oh, that's him.

852
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,200
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

853
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,785
Pulling in behind the caboose.

854
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:24,621
Deploy anchors.

855
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:36,758
Dropping down.

856
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,263
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.

857
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:46,518
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.

858
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,821
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

859
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,369
All right, coming up.

860
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,835
Hey, Big Bird.
This doesn't belong to you.

861
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,630
Oh, God.

862
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,931
-Suit lady, what was that?!
-You told me to choose.

863
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,476
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.

864
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:29,895
Activating all systems.

865
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:47,829
My head.

866
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,791
You appear to have a mild concussion.

867
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:56,171
Hey, so where am I right now?

868
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:57,464
I'm not sure.

869
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,175
The container walls are hindering
my sensors.

870
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,220
Wait a minute.

871
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,932
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.

872
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:10,853
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.

873
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,272
Three, two, one.

874
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,530
What is this place?

875
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:22,948
Suit lady, where am I?

876
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:25,909
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.

877
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:27,786
The Damage Control deep storage vault.

878
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,455
No. Seriously?

879
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,794
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.

880
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,254
Morning?

881
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:42,509
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?

882
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,970
I think I should probably
give you a name.

883
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,472
Like Liz. No, no, no.

884
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,641
God, that's-- That's weird.

885
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,186
What about Karen?

886
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,438
You can call me Karen
if you would like.

887
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:57,733
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

888
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,818
What?

889
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:01,904
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.

890
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,239
-Ricochet web.
-Ricochet web.

891
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:07,284
-Cool.
-Splitter web.

892
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,330
-Web grenade.
-Web grenade!

893
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,751
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

894
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:16,960
Who is Liz?

895
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,796
Who's Liz? She's--

896
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,423
She's the best. She's awesome.

897
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,301
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

898
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:25,511
And--

899
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:29,598
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

900
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:32,976
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

901
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,269
What's weird about that?

902
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,480
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

903
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,649
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

904
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:42,361
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.

905
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:44,029
Thanks, Karen.

906
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:46,949
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

907
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,951
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

908
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,994
-Thirty-seven minutes.
-What?!

909
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,871
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

910
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:56,708
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to-- I gotta get out of here.

911
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:01,463
There's got to be something in here
I can use.

912
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,258
Okay, let's see.

913
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:05,968
Nope.

914
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:08,345
That's awesome.

915
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,431
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

916
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,601
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.

917
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,770
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

918
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:20,649
It would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.

919
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,485
No, no, no.

920
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:30,242
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

921
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,327
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.

922
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,080
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage
and run it.

923
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:36,748
Trial unsuccessful.

924
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:39,585
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

925
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:45,299
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

926
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,759
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

927
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,641
Initiating trial 247.

928
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:56,560
It worked. It works.

929
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:12,618
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

930
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:13,827
Thank you.

931
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:15,871
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.

932
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,164
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.

933
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,999
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.

934
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,292
It's Ned. Leave a message.

935
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,127
Call me back.
The glowy thing's a bomb!

936
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:30,093
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.

937
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,471
We have now entered sudden death.

938
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:35,432
The next correct answer wins
the championship.

939
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,688
Midtown Tech?

940
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,482
Zero.

941
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:44,691
That is correct.

942
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:47,736
Midtown takes the championship.

943
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:51,240
-We won.
-You guys, I am so proud of you.

944
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,576
-Told you we didn't need Peter.
-Flash, you didn't answer a question.

945
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,704
-Taking it all in, Michelle?
-Oh, yeah, I just--

946
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:00,207
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

947
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:02,835
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by--

948
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:07,339
Okay.

949
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:09,967
-Enjoy your book.
-Thanks.

950
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,013
-Oh, Ned, you're alive.
-Peter, are you okay?

951
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,765
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

952
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:18,267
It's safe. It's in my backpack.

953
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,519
Ned, listen,
the glowy thing is dangerous.

954
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:22,271
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

955
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,356
-Listen.
-We're at the Washington Monument.

956
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:25,899
-Peter, is that you?
-Hey, Liz.

957
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:27,484
-Is that Liz?
-Put Ned back on the phone.

958
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,779
-You should tell her how you feel.
-You flake. You are lucky we won.

959
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:34,533
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

960
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,201
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.

961
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,620
-All items on the belt, please.
-There's something in Ned's backpack.

962
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,873
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.

963
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,961
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

964
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,758
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

965
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:01,727
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

966
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:06,481
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

967
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:16,325
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

968
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:18,827
The Chitauri core has detonated...

969
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,996
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.

970
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,372
-Oh, no.
-My friends are up there.

971
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:25,083
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

972
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,336
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.

973
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:34,927
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

974
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:36,595
Just stay calm, everyone.

975
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:38,430
Oh, we are all going to die here.

976
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,727
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.

977
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:45,395
We're freaking screwed.

978
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,690
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

979
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:51,276
The safety systems
are completely failing.

980
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,111
We're very safe in here.

981
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,864
The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.

982
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,115
Going as fast as I can!

983
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,168
-Let's go.
-Give me your hand.

984
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:11,880
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.

985
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,090
What?! Why?

986
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,593
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.

987
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,222
-How do I get in there?
-Activating reconnaissance drone.

988
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,977
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.

989
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,688
Locating optimal entry point.

990
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:31,066
Proceed to southwest window.

991
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:32,985
Karen, I'm on my way.

992
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:39,533
-There's a lot of glass here.
-You got this.

993
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,909
Keep coming, keep coming.

994
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,967
Okay. Oh, my God.

995
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,802
Okay.

996
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,514
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.

997
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,433
-Why are you hesitating?
-It's fine.

998
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,310
I've just never been this high before.

999
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,645
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...

1000
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,523
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.

1001
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,610
Perfect.

1002
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:16,361
Oh, my God.

1003
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,031
Why is it not breaking?

1004
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:22,868
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.

1005
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,431
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.

1006
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:46,183
My friends are in there! Stop!

1007
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,101
Return to the ground immediately.

1008
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,270
-Okay, who's next?
-Me, it's my turn.

1009
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,272
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

1010
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,400
-Come on.
-Don't worry about the trophy.

1011
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,034
Stand down!

1012
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:06,954
Return to the ground immediately.

1013
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:13,126
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!

1014
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:15,128
Go up, go up.

1015
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:17,339
I got this.

1016
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:19,174
Take my trophy.

1017
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:23,220
This is your last chance.

1018
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:25,430
I'm gonna die.

1019
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:35,065
Break!

1020
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:50,998
I did it.

1021
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:06,555
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.

1022
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:09,558
-Yes! Yes.
-Hey, hey, hey.

1023
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:11,810
-Big guy, quit moving around.
-I'm sorry, sir.

1024
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:16,481
Let's go, let's go!

1025
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:23,405
Okay, okay.

1026
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,532
-Mr Harrington, go.
-Ned, come on.

1027
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,492
-This is your stop.
-Come on, Liz.

1028
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,579
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

1029
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,247
-Are you sure it's safe?
-Liz.

1030
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:34,374
Liz!

1031
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,255
You're okay. You're okay.

1032
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,135
Okay.

1033
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:46,970
-Oh, my God.
-Good, good.

1034
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,014
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1035
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,183
-Come on in.
-You guys good?

1036
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,726
So is everyone okay?

1037
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,188
This is your chance, Peter.

1038
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:58,190
Kiss her.

1039
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:03,612
Thank you.

1040
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:09,159
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1041
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:21,004
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck....

1042
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,757
Yeah, damn it.

1043
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:26,468
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1044
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:28,637
Yeah, but then that's it.

1045
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:34,852
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.

1046
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,603
-Would you shut up about that?
-It's only one job.

1047
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,272
No.

1048
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:43,026
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...

1049
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:47,239
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.

1050
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:52,119
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.

1051
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:55,956
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1052
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:59,001
Really?

1053
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:01,336
I'm gonna kill him.

1054
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:03,547
-I'm gonna find him--
-Found him.

1055
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:05,007
The Spider-Man swooped in...

1056
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:08,093
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.

1057
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,471
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.

1058
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:16,476
-Mom.
-Oh, kids. All right.

1059
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,146
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.

1060
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,569
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...

1061
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:28,697
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.

1062
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,532
Later that day,
they also defeated death.

1063
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,118
Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.

1064
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:37,080
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.

1065
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:40,626
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.

1066
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:43,879
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.

1067
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,173
Not again.

1068
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:50,511
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.

1069
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,471
-Thank you, Spider-Man.
-Thank you, Spider-Man.

1070
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:55,557
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.

1071
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:58,352
How can you show your spider spirit?

1072
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,191
Dude, dude, dude.

1073
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:07,069
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1074
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:08,695
-Crazy, dude.
-It's crazy.

1075
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,697
-Should we tell everyone?
-No.

1076
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,659
-Should I tell everyone?
-No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1077
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:17,162
-Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
-I'm not going to class.

1078
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,081
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1079
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:20,791
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1080
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,876
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1081
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:26,046
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.

1082
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:29,132
-So all I gotta do is catch him.
-But we have a Spanish quiz.

1083
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:31,510
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.

1084
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:34,721
Mr Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...

1085
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,849
-...so when I bring this guy in--
-Dude.

1086
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,934
You want to be a high school dropout?

1087
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:41,770
I am so far beyond high school
right now.

1088
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,648
Parker, my office.

1089
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:48,944
So...

1090
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:50,612
...you got detention.

1091
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:52,948
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.

1092
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,492
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?

1093
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:56,827
Maybe you were trying to be cool.

1094
01:07:57,536 --> 01:08:00,205
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...

1095
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:03,500
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.

1096
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:07,129
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.

1097
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,840
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...

1098
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:12,259
-...you know is wrong...
-Where you going? Get back here.

1099
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,803
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?

1100
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:16,763
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.

1101
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,517
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.

1102
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,272
It's you.

1103
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:29,526
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.

1104
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,788
May?

1105
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,336
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1106
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,296
Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?

1107
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:50,546
I was wondering if you could help me.

1108
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:53,216
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...

1109
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,844
...but I can only remember
part of a licence plate.

1110
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,805
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.

1111
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:00,474
-Footage?
-Yes, Peter.

1112
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,518
I record everything you see.

1113
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:03,810
-Everything?
-Everything.

1114
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:06,313
-All the time?
-It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.

1115
01:09:07,104 --> 01:09:09,024
Yeah, of course it is.

1116
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:13,069
-Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
-With pleasure.

1117
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:15,113
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.

1118
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,866
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.

1119
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,993
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1120
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,870
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1121
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:24,206
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.

1122
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:25,832
No, no, no. That's definitely--

1123
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:27,584
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1124
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:31,255
-Your impressions are very funny.
-Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1125
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,714
Okay.

1126
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:36,385
-The two on the right, who are they?
-Searching law enforcement databases.

1127
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:39,263
No records found
for two of the individuals.

1128
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:41,515
-Nothing?
-One individual identified.

1129
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:43,809
Aaron Davis, age 33.

1130
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:46,812
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.

1131
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,229
Let's pay him a visit.

1132
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:51,733
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?

1133
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:52,984
Yeah.

1134
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,960
-Remember me?
-Hey--

1135
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:11,962
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1136
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:13,839
-All right, chill.
-Come on!

1137
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,217
-What happened to your voice?
-What do you mean?

1138
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,469
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1139
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:22,598
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.

1140
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:24,600
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--

1141
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:26,435
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1142
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:28,937
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1143
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:31,398
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1144
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:39,364
-You ain't ever done this before, huh?
-Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1145
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:41,783
Look, man.

1146
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:45,162
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1147
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:46,747
They can't be out on the streets.

1148
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:49,082
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--

1149
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,835
-You know Delmar's?
-Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

1150
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:54,213
-Sub Haven's pretty good.
-It's too much bread.

1151
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,507
-I like bread.
-Come on, man, please.

1152
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:01,553
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1153
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,182
The other night, you told that dude,
"If you shoot somebody, shoot me."

1154
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:06,808
That's pretty ballsy.

1155
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,019
I don't want those weapons
in this neighbourhood.

1156
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:10,562
I got a nephew who live here.

1157
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:13,023
Who are these guys?

1158
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,108
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1159
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,528
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1160
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,655
I don't know who he is
or where he is.

1161
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:26,119
-I do know where he's gonna be.
-Really?

1162
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,539
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...

1163
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:31,124
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.

1164
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,918
Yes! Yes.

1165
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:34,670
-Thank--
-Hey. Hey. Hey.

1166
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:37,130
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1167
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:39,800
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--

1168
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,218
Yeah.

1169
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:43,554
-Where is it?
-Can I give you some advice?

1170
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:46,765
You got to get better
at this part of the job.

1171
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:48,392
I don't understand.

1172
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:49,935
I'm intimidating.

1173
01:11:50,102 --> 01:11:52,980
-Staten Island Ferry, 11.
-Oh, that's soon.

1174
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:54,857
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1175
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:57,609
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1176
01:11:57,776 --> 01:11:59,444
-Two hours. You deserve that.
-I got ice cream in here.

1177
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:02,197
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr Criminal.

1178
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:18,130
Nice.

1179
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:24,052
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1180
01:12:24,219 --> 01:12:25,262
Sure thing.

1181
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:27,764
He's up front, main deck.

1182
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,349
I hate this guy.

1183
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,852
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1184
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,645
Just keep me posted.

1185
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:35,689
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.

1186
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:38,525
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?

1187
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,111
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.

1188
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:46,366
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1189
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,710
-Who's the guy on the left?
-Mac Gargan.

1190
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:59,296
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.

1191
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:01,298
Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?

1192
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:04,885
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1193
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:08,388
White pickup truck.

1194
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,020
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1195
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:37,167
Oh, this is too perfect.

1196
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:39,670
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1197
01:13:39,837 --> 01:13:42,798
-Incoming call from Tony Stark.
-No, no, no.

1198
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,133
-Don't answer.
-Mr Parker. Got a sec?

1199
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,719
-I'm actually at school.
-No, you're not.

1200
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:49,763
-Nice work in D.C.
-Okay.

1201
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,641
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...

1202
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,977
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.

1203
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:56,311
I'm in the middle of something.

1204
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:57,855
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.

1205
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:01,149
Anyway, great things are about to--
What is that?

1206
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:03,777
I'm at band practice.

1207
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:08,615
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?

1208
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,993
-I gotta go. End call.
-Hey.

1209
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:12,286
I'll take those!

1210
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:19,251
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal
ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.

1211
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,887
Spider guy's here.

1212
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:35,058
Not so fast.

1213
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:39,188
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1214
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:42,900
I got to say, the other guy
was way better with that thing.

1215
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:44,568
I'm honestly--

1216
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,695
I'm-- I'm shocked.

1217
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:00,709
-Freeze! FBI.
-Don't move.

1218
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,669
-Get on the ground.
-FBI.

1219
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:03,879
What do you mean, FBI?

1220
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:07,466
-The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
-I know, but what are they doing here?

1221
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,518
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

1222
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,811
No.

1223
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,525
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1224
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:31,532
-Move.
-Get to the top deck.

1225
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:33,242
We're getting out of here.

1226
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:14,408
Activate Taser web!

1227
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:28,881
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1228
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:10,047
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...

1229
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:13,467
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1230
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:18,347
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1231
01:17:20,182 --> 01:17:22,392
Splitter web, go.

1232
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:53,590
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.

1233
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:57,010
-Ninety-eight?
-Yeah, Spider-Man!

1234
01:17:58,178 --> 01:18:00,764
No, no, no.

1235
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:37,009
What the hell?

1236
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:42,306
What the hell?

1237
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:45,809
Hi, Spider-Man.

1238
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:48,353
Band practice, was it?

1239
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,211
Yeah, Iron Man!

1240
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,386
Mr Stark.

1241
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:26,391
Hey, Mr Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1242
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:29,436
I think you've done enough.

1243
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:46,828
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1244
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:51,667
Feds were waiting for us.

1245
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:54,503
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1246
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:56,922
Yeah, I'm running.

1247
01:19:57,714 --> 01:19:58,882
You should too.

1248
01:19:59,424 --> 01:20:01,260
You know I can't do that.

1249
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:02,636
So now what?

1250
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:07,766
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1251
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:09,935
Seriously?

1252
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:12,271
Yes. You will not regret this.

1253
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:17,234
You in?

1254
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,955
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...

1255
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:31,832
...I tell you to stay away from this.

1256
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:34,626
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...

1257
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:37,045
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...

1258
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:40,048
...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.

1259
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:41,216
Is everyone okay?

1260
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:44,595
No thanks to you.

1261
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,389
No thanks to me?

1262
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:51,560
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...

1263
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:53,103
...but you didn't listen.

1264
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,690
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1265
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:58,901
If you even cared,
you'd actually be here.

1266
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:06,533
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1267
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:09,286
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1268
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:13,248
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1269
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,709
-I'm 15.
-No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1270
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:18,462
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?

1271
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:21,715
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1272
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:23,217
And if you died...

1273
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:25,594
...I feel like that's on me.

1274
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:27,804
-I don't need that on my conscience.
-Yes, sir.

1275
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:30,599
-I'm sorry. I understand.
-Sorry doesn't cut it.

1276
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:33,143
I just wanted to be like you.

1277
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,853
And I wanted you to be better.

1278
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:38,982
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1279
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,360
-For how long?
-Forever.

1280
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:43,570
-Yeah, that's how it works.
-No, no. Please.

1281
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,656
-Let's have it.
-Please, this is all I have.

1282
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:47,199
I'm nothing without this suit.

1283
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:50,369
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1284
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:51,703
Okay?

1285
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,081
God, I sound like my dad.

1286
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:58,001
I don't have any other clothes.

1287
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:00,671
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1288
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:12,224
Hey.

1289
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:20,357
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

1290
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:21,984
You can't do that.

1291
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:24,778
Then this ferry thing happens.

1292
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,614
I've called five police stations.

1293
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:28,991
Five.

1294
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:30,951
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

1295
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:34,746
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1296
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:36,707
Cut the bullshit.

1297
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:38,542
I know you left detention.

1298
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:41,211
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.

1299
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:43,297
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1300
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:44,756
That's not fine.

1301
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:48,552
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.

1302
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:49,761
It's just me and you.

1303
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,265
I lost the Stark internship.

1304
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:55,434
-What?
-Yeah.

1305
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,019
What happened?

1306
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,897
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could--

1307
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:01,648
He would-- You know.

1308
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:04,943
But I screwed it up.

1309
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,904
It's okay, it's okay.

1310
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:10,240
It's okay.

1311
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,535
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1312
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,537
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1313
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:16,997
Yeah, I know.

1314
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,457
Just--

1315
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:21,001
-I used to sneak out too.
-Yeah.

1316
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,173
And take a shower. You smell.

1317
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,218
You smell like garbage.

1318
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,011
I know.

1319
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:36,391
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...

1320
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:39,186
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

1321
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,271
Okay.

1322
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:43,273
All right, get out of here.

1323
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:52,282
Are you expelled?

1324
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:55,452
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

1325
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:58,956
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1326
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:01,792
You're so lucky.

1327
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:51,300
Hey.

1328
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:54,595
-Hey.
-I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1329
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:57,139
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1330
01:24:57,306 --> 01:24:59,016
Hey, look, I--

1331
01:24:59,892 --> 01:25:02,603
I just wanted to apologise
about the whole decathlon thing.

1332
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:03,854
It's fine.

1333
01:25:04,021 --> 01:25:08,066
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

1334
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,152
No, I'm--

1335
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:12,321
I just mean that...

1336
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:15,365
...it was not cool, especially...

1337
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:18,869
...because...

1338
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,706
...I like you.

1339
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:24,708
I know.

1340
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:28,378
You do?

1341
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:31,173
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1342
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,008
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1343
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,680
I got to get to class, but--

1344
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:43,268
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...

1345
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:46,438
...forever, but--

1346
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:48,941
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.

1347
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:51,276
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really...

1348
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:53,820
...got around to that part, so--

1349
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,740
Do you want to...

1350
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:57,950
...go with me?

1351
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:00,744
Yeah. Sure.

1352
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:03,539
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1353
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,332
Cool.

1354
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,418
I'm actually going that way.

1355
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:21,473
May, I need your help.

1356
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,741
Through or around?

1357
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:45,998
Right?

1358
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:58,594
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1359
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,304
Open the door for her.

1360
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,890
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.

1361
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:04,141
-Don't be creepy.
-No.

1362
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,977
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1363
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:08,896
I got this.

1364
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:12,357
-Love you.
-Bye.

1365
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,874
You must be Peter.

1366
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:30,834
Yeah.

1367
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:32,544
I'm Liz's dad.

1368
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:34,213
Put her there.

1369
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:36,340
Hell of a grip.

1370
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:38,800
Come on in here. Come on.

1371
01:28:02,324 --> 01:28:03,575
Hi, Peter.

1372
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:05,827
You look very handsome.

1373
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,496
Thank you.

1374
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:09,790
You got his name right?

1375
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,333
-Freddie?
-Peter.

1376
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,709
Peter. Peter.

1377
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:14,837
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1378
01:28:15,254 --> 01:28:16,797
Okay.

1379
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:23,971
You all right, Pete?

1380
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:25,264
Yeah.

1381
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:28,016
Because you look pale.

1382
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,311
You want something to drink?

1383
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:33,730
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

1384
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,190
I'm not old enough to drink.

1385
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,150
That's the right answer.

1386
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:44,366
-Do you look beautiful.
-Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1387
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:45,951
Doesn't she, Pete?

1388
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:48,495
Yeah, you look really good.

1389
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:50,873
Once again, that's the right answer.

1390
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,083
Is that a corsage?

1391
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:56,336
Thanks.

1392
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:59,715
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.

1393
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:03,051
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.

1394
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:05,470
-Oh, right here. Perfect.
-Mom.

1395
01:29:05,637 --> 01:29:07,097
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1396
01:29:07,848 --> 01:29:09,933
Peter, closer.

1397
01:29:11,185 --> 01:29:12,561
Smile.

1398
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,314
There you go.

1399
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:24,281
-Sir, you don't have to drive us.
-No, no, it's not a big deal.

1400
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:26,658
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1401
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,744
-He's always going. Have fun.
-Last time.

1402
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:30,287
-Thank you.
-Promise.

1403
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:31,872
He's cute.

1404
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:36,543
-See you in a couple of days. All right.
-Bye, baby.

1405
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,295
Come on, Pedro.

1406
01:29:38,462 --> 01:29:40,380
-Bye, Peter. Have fun.
-Yeah, I will.

1407
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:53,352
-What are you gonna do, Pete?
-What?

1408
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,562
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1409
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,315
-Oh, I don't know.
-Don't grill him, Dad.

1410
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:01,068
Just saying, you know.

1411
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:02,986
All you guys who go to that school...

1412
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:05,572
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

1413
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:08,283
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1414
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,870
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.

1415
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:14,331
Really? Stark?

1416
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:16,208
So cool.

1417
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:18,418
What do you do?

1418
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:21,797
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.

1419
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:24,967
-Seriously?
-Yeah, it got...

1420
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:26,176
...boring.

1421
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:29,304
It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

1422
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:31,390
Really? Spider-Man?

1423
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:34,434
What's he like?

1424
01:30:35,519 --> 01:30:37,062
Yeah, he's nice.

1425
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:39,064
Nice man.

1426
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:41,066
Solid dude.

1427
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:46,071
Look. So cute.

1428
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,662
I've seen you around, right? I mean...

1429
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:57,541
...somewhere. We've-- Have we ever--?
Because even the voice--

1430
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,043
He does Academic Decathlon with me.

1431
01:31:01,044 --> 01:31:02,629
And he was at my party.

1432
01:31:02,796 --> 01:31:05,174
It was a great party, really great, yeah.

1433
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,553
-Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
-You were there for, like, two seconds.

1434
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,473
That was-- I was there longer
than two seconds.

1435
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,144
-You disappeared.
-No. No, I did not disappear.

1436
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:21,481
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.

1437
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:32,409
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.

1438
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:34,203
Were you scared?

1439
01:31:35,037 --> 01:31:37,539
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...

1440
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:39,791
...showed up in the elevator
though, huh?

1441
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:44,296
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.

1442
01:31:44,463 --> 01:31:46,215
I saw it all from the ground.

1443
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:48,550
Yeah.

1444
01:31:48,884 --> 01:31:51,220
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1445
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,934
Good old Spider-Man.

1446
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:02,439
Dad, the light.

1447
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:20,040
Here we are. End of the line.

1448
01:32:20,207 --> 01:32:21,625
Thanks, Dad.

1449
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:23,627
You head in there, gumdrop.

1450
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:26,547
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.

1451
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:30,384
Don't let him intimidate you.

1452
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:31,760
Love you.

1453
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,388
-Love you, gumdrop.
-Have a safe flight.

1454
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:35,764
Hi.

1455
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:39,101
You guys look so pretty.

1456
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:44,982
Does she know?

1457
01:32:46,024 --> 01:32:47,317
Know what?

1458
01:32:47,484 --> 01:32:49,236
So she doesn't. Good.

1459
01:32:49,403 --> 01:32:51,071
Close to the vest.

1460
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,406
I admire that.

1461
01:32:52,573 --> 01:32:54,700
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1462
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:59,162
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date....

1463
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:02,749
Peter...

1464
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,127
...nothing is more important than family.

1465
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:07,087
You saved my daughter's life.

1466
01:33:07,254 --> 01:33:09,089
I could never forget something like that.

1467
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:11,008
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1468
01:33:11,175 --> 01:33:12,301
Are you ready?

1469
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:16,013
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1470
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,808
...and don't you ever, ever...

1471
01:33:19,975 --> 01:33:22,561
...interfere with my business again.

1472
01:33:22,728 --> 01:33:24,646
Because if you do...

1473
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:27,065
...I'll kill you...

1474
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:28,817
...and everybody you love.

1475
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:31,904
I'll kill you dead.

1476
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,865
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?

1477
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:38,202
Hey.

1478
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:42,956
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1479
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:46,502
Thank you.

1480
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:48,420
You're welcome.

1481
01:33:48,587 --> 01:33:54,134
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?

1482
01:33:54,885 --> 01:33:56,762
Just not too good.

1483
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,483
Hey.

1484
01:34:53,944 --> 01:34:55,362
What did he say to you?

1485
01:34:59,616 --> 01:35:01,034
Gotta go.

1486
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:04,580
I'm sorry.

1487
01:35:04,955 --> 01:35:06,874
You don't deserve this.

1488
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:29,646
He gave you a choice.

1489
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:31,899
-You chose wrong.
-What the hell?

1490
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:33,734
What's with the crappy costume?

1491
01:35:36,153 --> 01:35:37,362
My web-shooters.

1492
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:50,876
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.

1493
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:57,424
Gross.

1494
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:11,855
-Why did he send you here?
-Guess you'll never know.

1495
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:18,195
Nice shot!

1496
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:24,660
Yes!

1497
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:26,662
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1498
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:28,705
-What?
-I gotta tell Mr Stark.

1499
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:31,708
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr Stark's head of security.

1500
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,085
Get a computer and track my phone.

1501
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:35,254
-Will you be okay?
-Hurry, we gotta catch him...

1502
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,714
...before he leaves town.

1503
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:40,092
I'm sorry about dinner...

1504
01:36:40,509 --> 01:36:43,804
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--

1505
01:36:45,264 --> 01:36:46,849
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1506
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:49,768
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--

1507
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,279
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1508
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:02,447
-Go for Ned.
-Ned, I need you...

1509
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,950
-...to track my phone.
-Yeah, but where is it?

1510
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:12,291
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1511
01:37:12,457 --> 01:37:15,669
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1512
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:18,172
-I'll pull the specs.
-Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1513
01:37:18,338 --> 01:37:21,300
-You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
-Yeah, it's awesome. It's--

1514
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:24,845
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!

1515
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:26,638
-Are you okay?
-I've never driven before...

1516
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:30,475
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

1517
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:33,896
Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?

1518
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:37,399
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

1519
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:42,529
Guy in the chair.

1520
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:49,036
Takeoff in nine minutes.

1521
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:51,371
Hello? Hello? Who is this?

1522
01:37:51,538 --> 01:37:52,581
-Mr Happy, it's Ned.
-Who?

1523
01:37:52,748 --> 01:37:55,042
I'm an associate of Peter Parker. Got
something very important to tell you--

1524
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:56,752
You gotta be shitting me.

1525
01:37:57,461 --> 01:37:58,504
Damn.

1526
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:01,048
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1527
01:38:02,633 --> 01:38:05,469
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.

1528
01:38:05,636 --> 01:38:06,929
Left, okay.

1529
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:08,889
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?

1530
01:38:10,474 --> 01:38:12,059
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.

1531
01:38:12,226 --> 01:38:15,020
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.

1532
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:18,607
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1533
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:20,442
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1534
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:21,735
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.

1535
01:38:21,902 --> 01:38:23,904
-What?
-He was surrounded by boxes.

1536
01:38:24,071 --> 01:38:25,614
Boxes? It's moving day.

1537
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:27,741
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1538
01:38:27,908 --> 01:38:29,785
I gotta stop him!

1539
01:38:32,955 --> 01:38:34,748
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1540
01:38:34,915 --> 01:38:37,501
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armour...

1541
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:41,088
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging--

1542
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:42,798
The Meg-- The--

1543
01:38:42,965 --> 01:38:44,132
Thor's magic belt.

1544
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:48,136
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.

1545
01:38:48,303 --> 01:38:49,555
-What?
-Turn right.

1546
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:01,692
-Peter. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1547
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:04,278
Just keep trying
to get through to Happy.

1548
01:39:04,736 --> 01:39:06,905
It's been an honour, Spider-Man.

1549
01:39:07,573 --> 01:39:09,783
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1550
01:39:13,579 --> 01:39:14,621
I'm...

1551
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:16,081
...looking...

1552
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:18,417
...at porn.

1553
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:57,748
Hey!

1554
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:00,667
Surprised?

1555
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:02,711
Oh, hey, Pete.

1556
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,713
I didn't hear you come in.

1557
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,965
It's over. I've got you.

1558
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:09,134
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1559
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:12,638
...I really, really admire your grit.

1560
01:40:14,223 --> 01:40:15,390
I see why Liz likes you.

1561
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,520
I do. When you first came to the house...

1562
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:22,814
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.

1563
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:25,400
How could you do this to her?

1564
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:27,569
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.

1565
01:40:27,736 --> 01:40:30,072
I'm doing this for her.

1566
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:31,615
Yeah.

1567
01:40:35,661 --> 01:40:37,120
Peter...

1568
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,039
...you're young.

1569
01:40:39,206 --> 01:40:41,458
You don't understand
how the world works.

1570
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:44,378
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1571
01:40:44,545 --> 01:40:47,297
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?

1572
01:40:47,464 --> 01:40:48,924
Or any of his little toys?

1573
01:40:49,091 --> 01:40:50,843
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...

1574
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:53,303
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1575
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,222
Guys like us...

1576
01:40:55,389 --> 01:40:57,266
...like you and me...

1577
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:58,892
...they don't care about us.

1578
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:01,520
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...

1579
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:03,981
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.

1580
01:41:04,147 --> 01:41:08,318
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1581
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,572
That's how it is.

1582
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:14,032
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.

1583
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:15,951
Why are you telling me this?

1584
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:18,579
Because I want you to understand.

1585
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:20,163
And...

1586
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:23,333
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1587
01:41:36,305 --> 01:41:37,347
I'm sorry, Peter.

1588
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:44,479
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1589
01:41:44,938 --> 01:41:47,191
True. Then again...

1590
01:41:47,357 --> 01:41:49,067
...wasn't really trying to.

1591
01:41:54,823 --> 01:41:56,450
Chief, they're powering up engines.

1592
01:41:56,617 --> 01:41:59,453
-Okay. Yeah, yeah.
-Come on, come on, come on.

1593
01:42:50,921 --> 01:42:52,714
Okay, ready?

1594
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,600
Hello?

1595
01:43:05,978 --> 01:43:07,437
Hello!

1596
01:43:07,604 --> 01:43:09,189
Please, hey.

1597
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:11,900
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1598
01:43:12,067 --> 01:43:14,027
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1599
01:43:14,194 --> 01:43:16,989
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--

1600
01:43:33,755 --> 01:43:37,843
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1601
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:45,559
Come on, Peter.

1602
01:43:45,726 --> 01:43:47,269
Come on, Spider-Man.

1603
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:49,396
Come on, Spider-Man.

1604
01:43:49,563 --> 01:43:51,773
Come on, Spider-Man.

1605
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:56,028
Come on, Spider-Man!

1606
01:44:47,204 --> 01:44:48,705
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1607
01:44:49,081 --> 01:44:50,749
Oh, yeah.

1608
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:07,933
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1609
01:45:19,945 --> 01:45:22,865
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1610
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:25,701
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.

1611
01:45:38,422 --> 01:45:41,592
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.

1612
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:52,853
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1613
01:45:53,187 --> 01:45:55,606
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1614
01:45:55,772 --> 01:45:57,024
This better work, Mason.

1615
01:46:02,863 --> 01:46:05,908
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.

1616
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,367
Yeah.

1617
01:46:19,796 --> 01:46:21,256
You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...

1618
01:46:21,423 --> 01:46:23,217
...and override their security.

1619
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:36,313
Cloning transponder signal.

1620
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,148
Launching decoy drone.

1621
01:46:42,277 --> 01:46:44,404
Entering new coordinates.

1622
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,578
Good, so it's on its way.

1623
01:46:51,745 --> 01:46:54,581
-Yes, sir, right on course.
-Okay, thank you.

1624
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:56,834
All right.

1625
01:47:09,346 --> 01:47:10,973
Hot dog.

1626
01:48:00,606 --> 01:48:02,441
Just a typical homecoming...

1627
01:48:02,608 --> 01:48:05,319
...on the outside of an invisible jet...

1628
01:48:06,028 --> 01:48:07,738
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1629
01:48:17,289 --> 01:48:18,373
Oh, God!

1630
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:28,050
I can't believe that worked.

1631
01:49:04,545 --> 01:49:06,797
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1632
01:49:06,964 --> 01:49:08,090
I'm not going home empty-handed.

1633
01:49:18,392 --> 01:49:20,185
Oh, my God.

1634
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:37,536
-Get out of there. What are you doing?
-Please turn, please turn!

1635
01:51:12,506 --> 01:51:14,216
Hey, Pedro.

1636
01:52:01,638 --> 01:52:02,681
Bingo.

1637
01:52:18,864 --> 01:52:20,657
Your wingsuit.

1638
01:52:20,824 --> 01:52:22,910
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1639
01:52:30,292 --> 01:52:31,752
Time to go home, Pete.

1640
01:52:31,919 --> 01:52:33,378
I'm trying to save you!

1641
01:52:48,602 --> 01:52:49,978
No.

1642
01:52:50,646 --> 01:52:52,189
No.

1643
01:54:31,747 --> 01:54:33,665
It looked so insane. That whole--

1644
01:54:33,832 --> 01:54:35,167
Like, it was just crazy.

1645
01:54:35,334 --> 01:54:37,711
He-- He was just, like....

1646
01:54:37,878 --> 01:54:39,880
And you were like....

1647
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:41,924
And then I just hit him with the....

1648
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:43,967
It was so-- Oh, my God.

1649
01:54:44,134 --> 01:54:46,136
I mean, you saved me.

1650
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:48,096
It was awesome.

1651
01:54:54,061 --> 01:54:55,812
Hey, Liz.

1652
01:54:57,314 --> 01:54:58,482
I'm gonna miss you.

1653
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:00,567
Bye.

1654
01:55:01,193 --> 01:55:02,653
Liz.

1655
01:55:09,493 --> 01:55:10,702
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1656
01:55:11,745 --> 01:55:14,748
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1657
01:55:16,166 --> 01:55:17,209
The dance?

1658
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:21,296
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1659
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:22,798
Well, yeah, but I--

1660
01:55:22,965 --> 01:55:25,801
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.

1661
01:55:25,968 --> 01:55:28,136
If there's anything I can do to help....

1662
01:55:28,303 --> 01:55:30,806
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1663
01:55:30,973 --> 01:55:34,226
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1664
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:39,231
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So....

1665
01:55:40,649 --> 01:55:43,318
Liz, I-- I--

1666
01:55:43,485 --> 01:55:45,153
Bye, Peter.

1667
01:55:46,029 --> 01:55:49,533
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1668
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:05,591
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1669
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:07,509
Yeah!

1670
01:56:07,968 --> 01:56:10,387
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

1671
01:56:10,554 --> 01:56:13,056
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.

1672
01:56:13,223 --> 01:56:14,892
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...

1673
01:56:15,058 --> 01:56:16,602
...a new team captain next year.

1674
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,438
So I am appointing Michelle.

1675
01:56:20,439 --> 01:56:22,107
Yeah!

1676
01:56:24,318 --> 01:56:25,527
Thank you.

1677
01:56:25,694 --> 01:56:27,154
My-- My friends call me MJ.

1678
01:56:27,779 --> 01:56:29,823
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1679
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:31,909
I didn't.

1680
01:56:36,788 --> 01:56:38,790
-I gotta go.
-Hey, where you going?

1681
01:56:41,502 --> 01:56:43,629
What are you hiding, Peter?

1682
01:56:45,923 --> 01:56:47,508
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1683
01:56:47,674 --> 01:56:50,344
-All right, so we should run some drills.
-Yeah.

1684
01:56:58,769 --> 01:57:02,105
Hey, Happy. What--?
What are you doing here?

1685
01:57:03,065 --> 01:57:04,316
I really owe you one.

1686
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:08,695
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1687
01:57:08,862 --> 01:57:11,365
I mean, before I met Tony--

1688
01:57:40,477 --> 01:57:42,479
So how long you been here?

1689
01:57:42,646 --> 01:57:44,815
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1690
01:57:45,774 --> 01:57:48,652
-Is he here too?
-In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1691
01:57:49,194 --> 01:57:50,696
Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate?

1692
01:57:50,863 --> 01:57:52,447
Yeah, let's go.

1693
01:57:53,824 --> 01:57:54,950
Take a look.

1694
01:57:55,117 --> 01:57:57,160
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1695
01:57:58,245 --> 01:58:00,998
They just finished remodelling
the whole thing.

1696
01:58:27,191 --> 01:58:30,277
-You don't see that every day.
-Oh, there they are.

1697
01:58:30,944 --> 01:58:32,571
How was the ride up?

1698
01:58:32,988 --> 01:58:35,616
-Good.
-Give me a minute with the kid.

1699
01:58:36,366 --> 01:58:38,202
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

1700
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:39,995
I gotta talk to the kid.

1701
01:58:40,579 --> 01:58:41,663
I'll be close behind.

1702
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:45,584
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.

1703
01:58:50,589 --> 01:58:51,798
Sorry I took your suit.

1704
01:58:51,965 --> 01:58:54,468
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...

1705
01:58:54,635 --> 01:58:56,637
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.

1706
01:58:56,803 --> 01:58:59,640
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1707
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:01,600
-I guess.
-Let's just say it was.

1708
01:59:03,477 --> 01:59:06,688
-Mr Stark, I really--
-You screwed the pooch hard, big time.

1709
01:59:07,314 --> 01:59:08,982
But then you did the right thing.

1710
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:12,319
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies....

1711
01:59:12,486 --> 01:59:14,363
All right, not my best analogy.

1712
01:59:15,572 --> 01:59:17,491
I was wrong about you.

1713
01:59:18,033 --> 01:59:20,285
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1714
01:59:20,452 --> 01:59:22,913
...you could be a real asset to the team.

1715
01:59:24,706 --> 01:59:26,542
-To the--? To the team?
-Yeah. Anyway...

1716
01:59:26,708 --> 01:59:29,753
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1717
01:59:30,254 --> 01:59:32,089
When you're ready...

1718
01:59:32,464 --> 01:59:35,425
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce...

1719
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:38,262
...the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:

1720
01:59:38,428 --> 01:59:40,097
Spider-Man.

1721
01:59:42,558 --> 01:59:44,142
I....

1722
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:48,063
Yeah, give that a look.

1723
01:59:53,569 --> 01:59:55,737
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...

1724
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,989
...your new quarters.

1725
01:59:57,155 --> 01:59:59,408
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?

1726
01:59:59,575 --> 02:00:01,827
-Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
-It's fun.

1727
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:03,328
Or walls.

1728
02:00:03,495 --> 02:00:05,372
You'll fit right in.

1729
02:00:11,795 --> 02:00:13,797
Thank you, Mr Stark.

1730
02:00:14,256 --> 02:00:15,507
But I'm good.

1731
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:19,052
You're good? Good--?
How are you good?

1732
02:00:19,219 --> 02:00:23,390
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1733
02:00:23,557 --> 02:00:25,726
Friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man.

1734
02:00:25,893 --> 02:00:27,853
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1735
02:00:28,312 --> 02:00:29,771
You're turning me down?

1736
02:00:29,938 --> 02:00:32,024
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1737
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:33,442
Look at me.

1738
02:00:34,193 --> 02:00:35,277
Last chance. Yes or no?

1739
02:00:35,444 --> 02:00:36,737
-No.
-Okay.

1740
02:00:36,904 --> 02:00:40,407
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1741
02:00:40,574 --> 02:00:42,576
Happy will take you home.

1742
02:00:42,743 --> 02:00:44,244
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1743
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:46,580
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

1744
02:00:48,123 --> 02:00:50,792
-Thank you, Mr Stark.
-Yes, Mr Parker, very well.

1745
02:00:50,959 --> 02:00:52,669
-See you around.
-Okay.

1746
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:02,095
That was a test, right?

1747
02:01:02,888 --> 02:01:05,349
-There's nobody back there?
-Yes, you passed.

1748
02:01:06,225 --> 02:01:09,102
-All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
-Thank you, Mr Stark.

1749
02:01:09,269 --> 02:01:10,979
Yeah, thank you.

1750
02:01:13,065 --> 02:01:14,942
Told you he's a good kid.

1751
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:22,658
-Where's the kid?
-He left.

1752
02:01:22,824 --> 02:01:25,744
-Everybody's waiting.
-He actually made a mature choice.

1753
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:28,914
-It just surprised the heck out of us.
-Did you screw this up?

1754
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:31,166
-He told the kid to go wait in the car.
-Are you kidding?

1755
02:01:31,333 --> 02:01:33,502
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...

1756
02:01:33,669 --> 02:01:35,462
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?

1757
02:01:35,629 --> 02:01:38,131
Think of something. How about...?

1758
02:01:38,674 --> 02:01:40,843
-Hap, you still got that ring?
-Do I--? I--?

1759
02:01:41,009 --> 02:01:42,177
-The engagement ring.
-Are you kidding?

1760
02:01:42,344 --> 02:01:45,556
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1761
02:01:48,225 --> 02:01:49,351
Okay.

1762
02:01:49,518 --> 02:01:51,103
I think I can think
of something better than that.

1763
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:53,647
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1764
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:57,067
Like we need time.

1765
02:01:57,234 --> 02:01:58,902
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.

1766
02:01:59,069 --> 02:02:01,572
-Want me to get the door for you, hon?
-I got it.

1767
02:02:17,754 --> 02:02:20,215
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1768
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:32,144
May?

1769
02:02:53,916 --> 02:02:54,958
What the--?!

1770
02:05:09,051 --> 02:05:11,011
Look who it is.

1771
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:16,099
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

1772
02:05:16,266 --> 02:05:17,559
Relax.

1773
02:05:18,185 --> 02:05:20,187
This? It's not on you.

1774
02:05:20,354 --> 02:05:23,440
It's on our little spider friend.

1775
02:05:23,607 --> 02:05:27,194
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

1776
02:05:27,361 --> 02:05:30,822
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1777
02:05:31,365 --> 02:05:33,617
And I heard a rumour.

1778
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:38,455
You know who he is.

1779
02:05:42,209 --> 02:05:44,545
If I knew who he was...

1780
02:05:44,711 --> 02:05:46,296
...he'd already be dead.

1781
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:53,720
Toomes, your family's here!

1782
02:12:32,828 --> 02:12:35,664
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

1783
02:12:35,831 --> 02:12:39,793
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

1784
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,628
Patience.

1785
02:12:41,795 --> 02:12:43,922
Sometimes patience
is the key to victory.

1786
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,133
Sometimes it leads to very little...

1787
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:48,635
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

1788
02:12:48,802 --> 02:12:50,304
And you wonder...

1789
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:54,308
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

1790
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:00,022
How many more of these?
