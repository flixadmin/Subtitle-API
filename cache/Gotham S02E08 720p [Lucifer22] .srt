You got there late.

339

Uh...

340
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,030
I've never told anybody that.

341

I will give you this

350
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,923
as a signing gift.

351

356
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,276
and give you closure.

357
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,544
It's what your father

358
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,679
would've wanted.

359
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,949

desperately needs.

He's a psychopath,
Barbara.

372
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,198
He's using you.

373

He's laughing at you.

you're just a loose end.

376

He'll kill you.

Yeah, well, how many will suffer
in the meantime?

504
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,535
How many will die
because of the crimes

505
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,836
committed by my family's
company?

506
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,172
What...

507
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,808
Who...

508
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,977
Where's all this coming from,
Master Bruce?

509
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,146
Eh?

510
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,348
(bat chirping)

511
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:13,157
I spoke to...
Mayor Galavan this morning.

512
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,425
And...?

513
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,465
He wants me to sell him my
shares in Wayne Enterprises

514
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:25,769
so he can...
fix the company.

515
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,771
Clean up Gotham.

516
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,241
I see.

517
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,378
And what aren't you telling me?

518
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:42,586
He says...

519
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,588
that he knows the identity
of the man

520
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,890
who killed
my parents.

521
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,794
Which he's offering in return
for the company, right?

522
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,898
Yes.

523
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,467
Yeah, well, that's...

524
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,935
not an offer, is it?

525
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:58,902
That's bloody extortion.

526
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,205
Yeah, well, I can't help
but consider it, Alfred.

527
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,073
Well, you shouldn't.

528
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,608
There's a fine line

529
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,077
between extortion
and negotiation.

530
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,312
Yes, there is, Master Bruce,

531
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:09,947
but there's still a line.

532
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,616
My parents were killed

533
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,218
because of
the corruption

534
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,953
that my father
was trying to stop.

535
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,354
As of now,
their...

536
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,789
their deaths have been in vain,

537
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,692
but if Mayor Galavan
can truly...

538
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:24,361
if he can truly fix
Wayne Enterprises,

539
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,897
isn't it my moral... duty

540
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,899
to allow him to do so?

541
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,905
For my father's legacy?

542
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:37,975
Wayne Enterprises

543
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,310
isn't Thomas
and Martha Wayne's legacy.

544
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,850
That legacy is standing
right here.

545
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,720
With me.

546
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:01,031
Alfred, am I wrong if
I just want it all to be over?

547
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,433
(crying):
I just want...
I just want it to be over.

548
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,271
No, no. No, you're not wrong.

549
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,806
Come here.

550
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,410
You're not wrong.

551
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,612
(Bruce sobs)

552
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,891
(gasps)

553
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,364
(footsteps approaching)

554
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,567
(Barbara humming
"Bridal Chorus")

555
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,686
I know.

556
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,488
Can you believe it still fits?

557
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:04,995
Do you remember

558
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:08,832
when we first visited
this place?

559
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,934
How excited I was

560
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,136
to get married here?

561
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,807
How long do you think you have

562
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,709
before the GCPD finds us?

563
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,144
So typical.

564
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,946
I'm talking about us,

565
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:23,947
and your head...

566
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,082
(clicks tongue)

567
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,483
...is in work.

568
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,517
There is no "us."

569
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,989
What is all this?

570
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,491
Well, this is
my wedding dress.

571
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,226
The tailor still
had it in storage.

572
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,363
I mean, can you
believe the luck?

573
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,164
Or fate.

574
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,700
That's Father Callahan.
(muffled grunting)

575
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,035
You remember him, of course.

576
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,637
And these bozos...

577
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,704
(whimpering)

578
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,506
Oh!

579
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,774
Who knows?

580
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,710
But you can't have a wedding
without witnesses.

581
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,178
That's the law.

582
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,382
Barbara...

583
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,884
Jim...

584
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,486
please don't act all surprised

585
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,355
and aggrieved.

586
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,490
You knew,

587
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,859
from the start,

588
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,327
that this was a trap.

589
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,430
But you thought, "Hey,

590
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,066
"let the bad guys
take their best shot.

591
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:20,003
"I'm Jim Gordon.

592
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,539
"I'll find a way to win.

593
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,774
(laughs)

594
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:26,743
Or die."

595
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,816
It's option B, baby.

596
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,788
Your fondest wish come true.

597
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,758
I don't want to die.

598
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,527
Oh.

599
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,463
Hey.

600
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,198
Sure you do.

601
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,469
Aren't you tired of hiding

602
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,072
your true self?

603
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,541
Tired of lying to yourself?

604
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,777
To Lee?

605
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,547
I don't lie to Lee.

606
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:07,751
Really?

607
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,553
Let's ask her.

608
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,790
(wheels squeaking)

609
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,959
Lee!

610
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:19,529
(whimpering)

611
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,273
Savor every moment.

612
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,848
Hey, girlfriend.

613
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,817
We really need to talk

614
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,587
about this bad boy.

615
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,223
(gasps)

616
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:49,993
BARBARA (over speaker):
<i>We had real love.</i>

617
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,762
You asked me to marry you.

618
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:55,665
I booked the church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.

619
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,168
Jim...

620
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,037
fool that I am,

621
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:03,206
I still love you even now.

622
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:10,580
I booked the church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.

623
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,854
I want updates every 15 minutes.

624
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,789
Hang on.

625
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,857
Turn around
and get the hell out of here.

626
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,226
She's taking him to church.
Church? What church?

627
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,895
She talked about the wedding
they never had.

628
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,596
She wants a do-over.

629
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,432
Gotham Cathedral
is nearest to the snatch site.

630
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,933
That's where they are.

631
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,001
That's thin.

632
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:33,203
I know I am right.

633
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,339
I'll call you back.

634
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,475
Let's go.

635
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,677
(humming, chuckles)

636
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:45,982
So, Lee, how do you think

637
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,584
your relationship
with Jim is going?

638
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,252
This doesn't concern Lee.
Let her go.

639
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,654
This is between you and me.

640
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:52,189
Oh.

641
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,157
This...

642
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,026
is about all of us.

643
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,195
She deserves to know

644
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:00,464
exactly who you are.

645
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,167
I know who he is.

646
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,136
Oh, how could you

647
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,238
when he doesn't even know?

648
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,675
He is incapable
of being honest

649
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,410
with himself,

650
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,345
let alone anyone else.

651
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,214
What about you?

652
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,748
This entire day
has been a lie.

653
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,951
You were never going to
give up proof on Galavan.

654
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,752
Who?

655
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,221
Oh.

656
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,256
You want some honesty?

657
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,458
Fine.

658
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:33,597
Mayor James is alive and well

659
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,267
at a stash house
on China Docks.

660
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,035
Hmm, see?

661
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,037
Honesty.

662
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,172
Now you.

663
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,040
Who put him there?

664
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,942
Who put him there?

665
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,944
Boring, Jim.

666
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:53,450
The Jim Gordon you know
is an act.

667
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,218
He's like an addict

668
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,888
who thinks he can dabble
in darkness

669
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,991
as long as nobody sees
the needle marks.

670
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,993
Everyone has an act.
(scoffs)

671
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,298
Did he tell you how
he got reinstated at the GCPD?

672
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,333
He killed a man for Penguin.

673
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,270
Wow!

674
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,005
Very good, Jim.

675
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,773
You did tell her.

676
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,141
We don't have secrets
between us.

677
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,176
Mm-hmm.

678
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,377
He's done a lot of things

679
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,478
that he's not proud of.

680
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,846
Everyone has.
Oh.

681
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,015
But you love him anyway,

682
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,150
is that right?

683
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,885
Despite all his faults.

684
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,020
Yes, I do.

685
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,326
Cute little do-gooder
Dr. Lee,

686
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:39,095
hmm... in love
with a cruel, cold,

687
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:41,031
death-obsessed sadist.

688
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,633
(laughs)
That's not Jim.

689
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,270
Do you think you know him

690
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:48,772
better than I do?

691
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:49,906
Hmm?

692
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,709
I love him, too, you know.

693
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,477
I know him

694
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,947
better than you do.

695
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:59,182
Okay, Barbara, I hear you.

696
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,517
You love him. We both love him.

697
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,420
That's okay.
But I love him more.

698
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,588
Okay, listen, Barbara.

699
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,389
I know that now. Please...

700
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,124
I'm gonna prove

701
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,626
that I love him more.

702
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:12,329
I am going to carve

703
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,496
your pretty face

704
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,732
off your skull.

705
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,901
And then you will
both understand

706
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,469
what true love is.

707
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,838
Okay, just one more thing.

708
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
What?

709
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,407
Your dress.

710
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,709
I-I love your dress.

711
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,611
I just want to know
where you got it.

712
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:28,812
Hmm.

713
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:29,980
Oh, um...

714
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:33,984
Drop the knife.

715
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,986
There he is.

716
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:38,188
My little monster.

717
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,156
Don't make me kill you.

718
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,858
Make you?

719
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,960
Jim,

720
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,729
you long

721
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,464
to kill me.

722
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,834
Do it, Jim.

723
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,035
Do me.

724
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,136
(sirens approaching)

725
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,704
Don't take another step.

726
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,843
(tires squealing,
sirens wailing)

727
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,847
Kill him!

728
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,914
(gunshots)

729
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,460
Go get her!

730
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,136
Jim!

731
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,153
It's over.

732
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,757
Not yet.

733
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:55,899
(wind whistling)

734
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,901
Hold on.

735
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,302
Hold on.

736
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,937
I'm sorry, baby.

737
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:04,040
I've been kind of
a bad date, huh?

738
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,913
I love you, baby.

739
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:16,152
No!

740
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,994
Some hedges and bushes
broke her fall,

741
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,730
but she's got
half a dozen broken bones

742
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,531
and a concussion.

743
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,734
She's critical.

744
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,538
Are you okay?

745
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,173
Yeah.

746
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,541
(door closes)

747
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,310
(engine starts)

748
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:41,945
Not now,
but when this is over,

749
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,079
we need to talk.

750
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,548
I know.

751
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,786
Tell me you got something
from her.

752
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,154
She didn't give up Galavan,

753
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,189
but she did say
Mayor James is alive.

754
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,959
Stashed in a safe house
on China Docks.

I can't sell you my company.

May I ask what the charge is?

782

The kidnapping and torture
of Aubrey James.
