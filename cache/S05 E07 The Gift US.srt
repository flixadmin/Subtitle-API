1
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,684
First Ranger, you have command
of Castle Black.

2
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,270
Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you

3
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,606
I believe this mission to be reckless,
foolhardy,

4
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,819
and an insult to all the brothers
who have died fighting the wildlings.

5
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,780
As always, thank you for your honesty.

6
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,831
Safe travels, Lord Commander.

7
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,208
Thank you, Sam.

8
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,927
It's dragonglass. It's what I used to kill
the White Walker.

9
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,685
I hope you don't need them.

10
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:48,812
Me, too.

11
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,056
There he is.

12
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,436
That laugh.

13
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,813
Egg.

14
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,608
Egg laughed like that.

15
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,195
One of the first things I remember.

16
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,369
His little brother Aegon.
He… he became king.

17
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,960
And before that, he was a jolly fellow,
like this one.

18
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,677
Get him south, Gillyflower.

19
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,681
Before it's too late.

20
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,318
-Theon, wait.
-Not Theon, my lady. Reek.

21
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:01,987
Help me.

22
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,907
You're his wife now.

23
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,578
-Theon.
-Do what he says.

24
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,498
-Do what he says or he'll hurt you.
-He already hurts me every night.

25
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,252
All day I'm locked in this room
and every night he comes…

26
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,591
-Can't be any worse.
-It can.

27
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,719
It can always be worse.

28
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,813
-What did he do to you?
-Please.

29
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,274
-You betrayed my family!
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

30
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,945
-You have to help me. Theon, help me.
-He'll see us. You don't know him.

31
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,948
My family still has friends in the North.

32
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,576
All I need to do is give a signal
and they'll rescue me.

33
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,079
Climb to the top of the broken tower.

34
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,664
Light this candle and put it
in the window.

35
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,292
-Promise me, Theon.
-Reek! My name is Reek.

36
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,881
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

37
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:09,096
Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands. Do you hear me?

38
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,850
Theon…

39
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,479
promise me.

40
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,002
Yes, Reek?

41
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,436
Egg.

42
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,063
Egg.

43
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,110
Mother's looking for you.

44
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:49,946
Egg.

45
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,326
Get some sleep, Sam.

46
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,495
You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

47
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,209
-You don't know that.
-Get some sleep.

48
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,045
I'll watch over him.

49
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,633
I'm staying, too.

50
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,594
He's always been good to me.

51
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,721
I can't leave him now.

52
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,140
Egg!

53
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,570
Egg.

54
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,032
I dreamed…

55
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,118
that I was old.

56
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,840
His name was Aemon Targaryen.

57
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,177
He came to us from King's Landing.

58
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,349
A maester of the Citadel,
chained and sworn,

59
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,644
and sworn brother of the Night's Watch,
ever faithful.

60
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:09,526
No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder.

61
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,950
At the Wall, a dozen lord commanders
came and went during his years of service,

62
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,952
but he was always there to counsel them.

63
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,832
He was the blood of the dragon…

64
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,836
but now his fire has gone out.

65
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,385
-And now his watch is ended.
-And now his watch is ended.

66
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,999
You're losing all your friends, Tarly.

67
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,497
My beautiful wife.

68
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,383
When my father told me we were marrying,
I half expected a fat, bearded beast.

69
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,015
Do you know how pleased I was
when I saw you?

70
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,226
You've made me very happy.

71
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,567
Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon
rides for Winterfell.

72
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,403
He's a respected commander.

73
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,116
His troops are loyal and battle-tested.

74
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,661
He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords
to bolster his army.

75
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,289
But this storm is a stroke of luck
for us northerners.

76
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,627
Our people are used to fighting
in the frost.

77
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,424
His army is out there now,
suffering in the snow.

78
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,804
One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

79
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,849
You'll be my lady and wardeness.

80
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,772
-But isn't your stepmother pregnant?
-What of it?

81
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,817
What happens if she has a boy?

82
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,945
Then I'll have a baby brother.

83
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,824
-But he'll be the heir.
-I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

84
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,454
But you're a bastard. A trueborn will
always have the stronger claim.

85
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,460
I've been naturalized by a royal decree
from--

86
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,337
Tommen Baratheon? Another bastard.

87
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,555
Bastards can rise high in the world.

88
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,309
Like your half brother Jon Snow.

89
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,562
Born the bastard of Winterfell…

90
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,274
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

91
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,069
You didn't know?

92
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,239
Yes, he's done very well for himself.

93
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,827
I nearly forgot why I asked you
to join me.

94
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,662
Come, my lady.

95
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,842
Your northern friend.

96
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,972
Reek told me you wanted to leave.

97
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,391
Why?

98
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,561
Winterfell is your home
and I am your husband.

99
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,064
Tough old bird.

100
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,193
Everyone talks when I start peeling them.
But this one…

101
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,197
her heart gave out before I even got
to her face.

102
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
We do breed them tough in the North.

103
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,502
Bring my wife back to her chamber.

104
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,588
It's far too cold out here for a lady.

105
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,675
You should hold on to your candles.

106
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,928
The nights are so long now.

107
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,938
Forty horses died in the night.

108
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,526
We'll lose more come sunset.
We're running out of food.

109
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,279
We can't open the supply line
until the snow clears.

110
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,455
-What else?
-The Stormcrows rode off last night.

111
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,543
Five hundred men.

112
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,214
Sellswords.

113
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,343
Loyal to nothing but gold.

114
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,515
We still have a hard march to Winterfell

115
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,559
and we won't be marching anywhere
in this weather.

116
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,771
-And?
-This isn't our time.

117
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,358
We should head back to Castle Black
when the snow clears.

118
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,777
I retreated from King's Landing,
Ser Davos.

119
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,280
If I retreat again, I'll become
the King Who Ran.

120
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,115
-Your Grace--
-Winter is coming.

121
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,285
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

122
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:39,248
If we march back to Castle Black,
we winter at Castle Black.

123
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,461
And who can say how many years
this winter will last?

124
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,463
It's better to wait for the right time
than risk everything.

125
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,007
This is the right time,
and I will risk everything.

126
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,343
Because if I don't, we've lost.

127
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:56,599
We march to victory or we march to defeat.

128
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,644
But we go forward, only forward.

129
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,947
Your Grace.

130
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:21,958
I've trusted in your visions,
in your prophecies for years.

131
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,421
You saw it yourself, my king,
when you stared into the flames.

132
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,131
A great battle in the snow.

133
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,300
-I don't know what I saw.
-You do know. Trust yourself.

134
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,553
And you? Do you trust yourself?

135
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,805
I trust in the Lord.

136
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,934
Are you sure?

137
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,777
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.

138
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,490
I have seen the flayed man banners lowered
to the ground.

139
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,794
But sometimes sacrifices must be made
to ensure victory.

140
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,507
I have shown you the power
of king's blood.

141
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,387
The usurper Robb Stark.
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

142
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:21,601
-We don't have Robert's bastard here.
-No, we have someone better.

143
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,772
And your blood runs through her veins.

144
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,818
-Have you lost your mind?
-Do you doubt me?

145
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,862
Still?

146
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,325
-After all that you've seen.
-There must be another way.

147
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,077
-Leeches or--
-There is only one way.

148
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,915
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

149
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,125
Only you can lead the living
against the dead.

150
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,128
All your life has led us to this moment.

151
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,756
-To this decision.
-She's my daughter.

152
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,635
Get out.

153
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,619
-There's always some sort of grub on.
-A bit of mutton would be nice.

154
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,291
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

155
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,672
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better looking than the fat man?

156
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,758
Now, question is, is she pretty
down south in the real world,

157
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,760
or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?

158
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,679
Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

159
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,349
-Come on, love, give us a kiss.
-Leave me alone.

160
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,434
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

161
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,353
-One little kiss.
-Come on, give him a kiss.

162
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,855
A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

163
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,321
There's no need to be rude.
We just want a little affection.

164
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:02,869
Get your hands off her.

165
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,247
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

166
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,499
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.

167
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,669
Sam the Slayer.
You gonna slay me with that sword?

168
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,964
-Look at his hand shake.
-Gilly, go on.

169
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,425
Get back to your room, lock the door.

170
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,305
-I'm warning you.
-Come on.

171
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,973
Come on!

172
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:28,853
Sam!

173
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,772
You lying sack of shit.

174
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,484
-Killed a White Walker, eh?
-You fat-ass fuck.

175
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,653
Come on, get up.

176
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,948
-No!
-This your hero? This hog?

177
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,700
Leave him alone!

178
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,454
Stubborn little wildling bitch,
aren't you?

179
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,832
-Come on!
-No!

180
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,628
-Sam! Sam! Sam!
-Come on!

181
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,096
-Sam! Sam!
-Come on.

182
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,681
Right.

183
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,434
I'll deal with this.

184
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,396
-Turn her over.
-All right.

185
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:20,029
-I said get your hands off her.
-You're gonna get yourself killed.

186
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,740
Your lover Jon Snow's not here
to save you.

187
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,201
I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn.

188
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,703
I'll take my chances with you.

189
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,846
Sam!

190
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,101
-I'm all right.
-You're not.

191
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,269
Just a bit woozy.

192
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,297
The next time you see something like that,
you leave it alone.

193
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,800
I will not. They would have…

194
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,847
I don't know what they would have done.

195
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,850
I know they would have killed you
if Ghost hadn't come.

196
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,020
No. No, no, they were tiring out.

197
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,605
I had them in the palm of my hand.

198
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,610
Don't be stupid, Sam.
You're not a fighter.

199
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,655
What kind of man would I be

200
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,033
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?

201
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,201
Just promise me,

202
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,663
whatever happens,
you'll take care of Little Sam.

203
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,331
But of course I will.

204
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,375
And

205
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,170
I'll take care of you, too.

206
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,428
I need more water.

207
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,558
Stay.

208
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,019
Please?

209
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,705
Am I hurting you?

210
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:22,795
Are you sure?

211
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,201
Oh, my!

212
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,388
A rare find for the fighting pits,
my friends.

213
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,309
Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.

214
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,562
This one's a Westerosi knight

215
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,983
from an ancient house trained in sword
and lance.

216
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,821
He fought beside the stag king Robert
on the far side of the Narrow Sea.

217
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,991
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,

218
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,286
slaughtering 50 men
with his flaming sword.

219
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,540
He killed the great Khal Drogo
in single combat.

220
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,918
Betrayed by his woman,

221
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,588
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

222
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,674
Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

223
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,303
Thirteen. Do I have 14?

224
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:59,058
Fifteen? Fifteen gold honors.

225
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,269
Do I hear 16? Sixteen?

226
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,520
Twenty.

227
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,439
Sold.

228
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:19,370
-Wait! You have to buy me as well.
-Why?

229
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,415
We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too.

230
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,588
He's funny. You have to give him that.

231
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,201
You're right, he's funny.

232
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,003
-Thank you, my lord. Thank you.
-Yes.

233
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:14,341
My lord, if I may, I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.

234
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,344
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight the slaves in the fighting pits.

235
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,596
Now, if you were to fight freed men
who'd be paid a wage--

236
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,937
There's your wages, funny man.
Should last the rest of your life.

237
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,067
These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

238
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,902
Five, going once…

239
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,660
How long before the King of Meereen comes
to claim my pillow?

240
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:46,790
Don't be ridiculous. My marriage
to Hizdahr is political.

241
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,376
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

242
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,589
I think the Sons of the Harpy
have stopped killing

243
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,341
because their leader was made king.

244
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,137
Are you jealous?

245
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,557
You think I'm petty enough to speak ill
of a man

246
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,517
just because he represents competition?

247
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:07,811
I do.

248
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:14,109
You're right. My motivations
are entirely impure.

249
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,370
Doesn't make me wrong.

250
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,670
You told me yourself I can't fight enemies
within and without.

251
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:38,425
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

252
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,635
I have no choice.

253
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,972
Everyone has a choice.
Even slaves have a choice,

254
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,599
death or slavery.

255
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,601
So, what else can I do?

256
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,480
Marry me instead.

257
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,903
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

258
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,240
-I couldn't.
-Why not?

259
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,992
You are queen. You can do what you like.

260
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,413
No.

261
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,915
I can't.

262
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,418
Then you are the only person in Meereen
who's not free.

263
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,391
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

264
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,310
but can I make one more suggestion?

265
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,691
Of course.

266
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,238
On the day of the great games,

267
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,783
gather all the Great Masters,
and Wise Masters,

268
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,535
and Worthy Masters you can find…

269
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,580
and slaughter them all.

270
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,670
I am a queen, not a butcher.

271
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,094
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

272
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:18,400
You there, where would I find
the High Septon, or High Sparrow,

273
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,486
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

274
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:24,323
It's not as good a name
as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

275
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:30,120
You should have the decency to stand
when you speak to a lady.

276
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,956
You should have the decency to kneel
before the gods.

277
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,458
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

278
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,214
For me, it's the knees.

279
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,508
-You?
-Hips.

280
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,888
A man of the people, is that your game?

281
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,518
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

282
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,147
A man of the people who does
Cersei's dirty work for her.

283
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,234
The people always do the dirty work.

284
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,737
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

285
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,863
Useful talent.

286
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,908
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.

287
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,496
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

288
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,791
The Father judges us all.

289
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,836
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

290
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,507
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

291
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,510
Don't you walk away from me.

292
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,762
You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.

293
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,763
What is it you want?

294
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,848
Gold?

295
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,893
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

296
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,813
What, then?

297
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,191
I imagine this is strange for you.

298
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:47,197
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

299
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,242
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

300
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,955
I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.

301
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,042
How do they communicate their demands?
By raven or horse?

302
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,461
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

303
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,799
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

304
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,468
I've readThe Seven-Pointed Star.

305
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,681
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

306
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,975
Your grandchildren will be punished

307
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,730
in the same manner as anyone who breaks
the sacred laws.

308
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:24,526
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

309
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,946
You live among murderers, thieves,
and rapists,

310
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:33,327
and yet you punish Loras for shagging
some perfumed ponce

311
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,038
and Margaery for defending her brother?

312
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,375
Yes, the gods' laws must be applied
to all equally.

313
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,836
If it's equality you want, so be it.

314
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,965
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,

315
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,051
everyone here will starve.

316
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,429
And I'll make sure the hungry know
who's to blame.

317
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,185
Have you ever sowed the field,
Lady Olenna?

318
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,938
Have you ever reaped the grain?

319
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,359
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

320
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,364
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

321
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,533
You are the few…

322
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,203
we are the many.

323
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:21,458
And when the many stop fearing the few…

324
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,099
Lady Olenna.

325
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,823
Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

326
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,997
She's in a prison cell
and there is nothing I can do.

327
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,548
I am the king! The queen is in prison
and there is nothing I can do!

328
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,564
No matter who you are…

329
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,609
no matter how strong you are,
sooner or later,

330
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,945
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

331
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,282
Events you couldn't possibly
have anticipated

332
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:39,202
or prevented even if you had.
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

333
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,374
Your father, your brother,
your grandfather,

334
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,043
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
and what could I do?

335
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,504
Hold them as they left this world.

336
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,090
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

337
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,301
I'll call in the army.

338
00:34:54,843 --> 00:35:00,015
I'll take back the sept and kill
every last one of them.

339
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,686
I'll start a war if I have to.

340
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,898
You know as well as I do who
the first casualty of that war would be.

341
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,362
I love her.

342
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,284
I love her…

343
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,039
I can't help her.

344
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,391
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

345
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:48,313
I will speak with the High Sparrow.
There… there must be something--

346
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,981
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

347
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,694
The king cannot sully himself negotiating
with an unwashed fanatic.

348
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,114
You will try to help her?

349
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,618
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

350
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,162
Your happiness is all I want
in this world.

351
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,416
-I know.
-No, you don't.

352
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,005
You can't possibly.

353
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,717
Not until you have children of your own.

354
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,929
I would do anything for you.

355
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,975
Anything to keep you from harm.

356
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,729
I would burn cities to the ground.

357
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,233
You are all that matters.

358
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,822
You and your sister.

359
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,575
From the moment you came into this world.

360
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,869
My boy.

361
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,206
My only boy.

362
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,849
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies

363
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,934
your concerns
about the princess's well-being.

364
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,738
You looked different when I left.
You had more hair.

365
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,239
And more hands.

366
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,368
-How's Trystane?
-He'll be all right.

367
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,288
I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

368
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,998
Why is it happening at all?

369
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,001
Your mother's worried about you.

370
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,006
Threats have been made.
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

371
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,592
-I've come to take you home.
-This is my home.

372
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,593
This has been my home for years.

373
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,596
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

374
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,391
I did what she said. I did my duty
and now she's forcing me to go back?

375
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,561
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

376
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,730
No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.

377
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,817
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

378
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,946
-I don't understand.
-Of course you don't. You don't know me.

379
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:14,125
Brothers, oh, brothers
My days here are done

380
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,630
The Dornishman's taken my life

381
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:23,718
But what does it matter
For all men must die

382
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:27,347
And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

383
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:33,937
I have, I've tasted the Dornishman's wife

384
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,899
He's got a good voice.

385
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,568
We're lucky he's a singer.

386
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,196
If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

387
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,324
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

388
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,202
It's amazing how many men we beat seem
to have this code.

389
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,912
I wouldn't say you beat me.

390
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,707
-How's your arm?
-Wonderful.

391
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,669
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne
without a new scar.

392
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,423
-You think you're leaving Dorne?
-No great hurry.

393
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,843
Dornish women are the most
beautiful women in the world.

394
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,472
-Thank you.
-I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

395
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,602
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

396
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:19,232
I've seen quite a few women
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

397
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,360
Name one more beautiful than I am.

398
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:30,827
Well, now, in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous…

399
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:36,916
There was a what?

400
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,755
In King's Landing, you were saying?

401
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,798
Was I?

402
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,302
There was a woman more beautiful
than I am.

403
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:48,970
Was there?

404
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,473
My memory's not what it was earlier.

405
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,646
-How's your arm now?
-You seem concerned with it.

406
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,273
You must really like me.

407
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,785
And how about your head?

408
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:17,832
My head?

409
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,126
My head?

410
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,755
You don't even want to know
what's going on in…

411
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,226
Your nose is bleeding.

412
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,773
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

413
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,239
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

414
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,743
They call it the Long Farewell.
It takes time to work,

415
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,541
but if a single drop makes contact
with the skin, death.

416
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,676
The only antidote.

417
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,142
Who's the most beautiful woman
in the world?

418
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,769
You.

419
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,356
Sorry? Who?

420
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,068
You.

421
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,863
Don't drop it.

422
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,880
I think you're very handsome as well.

423
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,510
-I'm sorry about the locale.
-No, you're not.

424
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:41,226
-It felt like the safest place.
-Not for your clientele, clearly.

425
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,437
It was an establishment like no other.

426
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,941
Sheer range of appetites catered to.

427
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:52,028
Desires that didn't even exist
until we invented them.

428
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,907
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

429
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,910
Past is the past.

430
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,373
The future is all that's worth discussing.

431
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,960
The future of House Tyrell.

432
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,712
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

433
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,506
my grandchildren, or me.

434
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,092
I should have known you'd return
to the capital

435
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,511
as soon as things started to go wrong.

436
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,846
-I promise you--
-I promise you, Lord Baelish,

437
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,558
that our fates are joined.
Together we murdered a king.

438
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,020
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

439
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:33,528
And if I should meet with some accident
here at your broken little flesh market,

440
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,906
they'll never even find what's left
of you.

441
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:42,036
So, do you deny a part in all this?

442
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,872
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

443
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,626
-I dared not refuse her.
-And what did she want?

444
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,379
A piece of information she knew
that I had.

445
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,882
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

446
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,721
But I have other information of which she
is unaware.

447
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,850
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

448
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,478
I have a gift for you.

449
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,566
-What kind of gift?
-The same kind I gave Cersei.

450
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,819
A handsome young man.

451
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:33,546
Many worthy fighters have died trying
to make it to the Great Games.

452
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,258
When most of you worthless scum join them
in death this afternoon,

453
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,094
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

454
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,181
But if you do happen to triumph here,

455
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,059
you will fight at the Great Pit
of Daznak itself,

456
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,393
in front of the queen.

457
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,689
So, whatever happens, the gods
have smiled upon you today.

458
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,235
This is the day your lives actually start
to mean something.

459
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,074
You and you, and you.

460
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,410
You two.

461
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,830
You, you, and you.

462
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,375
Up.

463
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,003
-Valar morghulis.
-Valar dohaeris.

464
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,671
Prepare yourselves.

465
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,895
Sitting through the Great Games
will be bad enough.

466
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,023
For generations in the days leading up
to the Great Games,

467
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:37,527
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

468
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,862
to pay the fighters there the honor
of her presence.

469
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,202
Move yourselves.

470
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:57,839
Your Grace. Your Future Grace.
You honor us all.

471
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,093
Stand here.

472
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,304
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

473
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:10,560
We fight and die for your glory,
oh, glorious queen.

474
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,733
We fight and die for your glory,
oh, glorious queen.

475
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,926
-I think I've seen enough.
-Your Grace, it is a tradition

476
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,637
for the queen to stay until the victor
has emerged.

477
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,722
I've sacrificed more than enough
for your traditions.

478
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,437
What are you doing?

479
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,281
Wait your turn, you piece of fucking--

480
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,623
Get him out of my sight.

481
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:22,877
Khaleesi, please. I just need a moment
of your time.

482
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,087
I brought you a gift.

483
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,381
It's true!

484
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,676
He has.

485
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,262
Who are you?

486
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,223
I am the gift.

487
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,853
It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.

488
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,523
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

489
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,310
This is horrible. Unacceptable.

490
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,314
Are they feeding you enough at least?

491
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,944
I brought you this. Venison.

492
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,154
It's quite good.

493
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,327
I had it myself for supper
only last night.

494
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,334
We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

495
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:49,130
Tommen even went to the sept himself
to confront the High Sparrow.

496
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,800
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.

497
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,136
I know you did this.

498
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,306
We are making every effort on your behalf.

499
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,685
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

500
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,230
Lies come easily to you.
Everyone knows that.

501
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:11,318
But innocence, decency, concern,

502
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,280
you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

503
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,327
Perhaps that's why your son was so eager
to cast you aside for me.

504
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:23,831
You're upset.

505
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,250
You're not thinking clearly.

506
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,378
I'll visit again when you've had a chance
to calm down.

507
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,172
I don't want to see you again.

508
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,549
I do hope you change your mind about that.

509
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:38,387
I've been told men often go mad
in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

510
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,057
Though I suppose your isolation will end
when your trial begins.

511
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,561
Leave.

512
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:51,567
Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me
now more than ever.

513
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,195
Get out, you hateful bitch!

514
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,710
Sleep well, sister.

515
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,532
Thank you, Boake.

516
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,374
-You saw her?
-Yes.

517
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,126
-And?
-Her accommodations seem sufficient.

518
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,294
What happens to her now?

519
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,132
Well, she and her brother
are both being held under fair suspicion.

520
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:03,389
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

521
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:06,934
that might constitute a violation
of the tenets of the Faith.

522
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,602
Who will stand judge?

523
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:13,148
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

524
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,069
-Will you be one of them?
-I will.

525
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,742
If one or both of them were to confess
before the trial?

526
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,786
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.

527
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,123
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

528
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,084
It depends upon the situation.

529
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,254
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

530
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,423
Thank you, High Septon,

531
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,051
for bringing them whatever justice
they deserve

532
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,596
in the eyes of the Seven.

533
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,103
Did you know this chapel is one
of the oldest structures

534
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,271
in King's Landing?

535
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:58,569
-I think I may have heard at one point.
-Baelor built his sept around it.

536
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,948
But men worshipped here long before him.

537
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,826
Who carved this altar?

538
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,704
-Do you know?
-I'm afraid I don't.

539
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,415
No one does.

540
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,628
There's no name on it or anywhere else
in the chapel.

541
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,257
No, the people who built this place

542
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:24,011
didn't inflict their vanity on those
who came after them

543
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,307
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.

544
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,852
Their faith was clean.

545
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:39,401
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,
knock down the statues and the pillars,

546
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,820
and this is what remains.

547
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,618
Something simple.

548
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,291
Solid and true.

549
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,882
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

550
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,135
Their lies knocked down.

551
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,805
Their true hearts laid bare for all
to see.

552
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,684
And so it will be for all of us.

553
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,770
High and low alike.

554
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,737
What will we find when we strip away
your finery?

555
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,244
A young man came to us not long ago.

556
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,455
Broken in body and spirit.

557
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,252
He had so much to strip away.

558
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,964
So much weighing him down.

559
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,760
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

560
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,725
Let go of vanity, pride, sin.

561
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,563
Now his soul is so light,

562
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:01,316
he will float through the seven heavens
like a bird.

563
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,451
And he has much to say about you.

564
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,018
Move.

565
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:41,273
Let me go immediately.

566
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,109
You will order her to let me go.

567
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,447
I am the queen! I am the queen!
Have you lost your mind?

568
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,532
Let me go!

569
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,496
Get your filthy hands off me!
I'll have you punished!

570
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,416
I am the queen! Let me go!

571
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:06,882
Look at me.

572
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,136
Look at my face.

573
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,725
It's the last thing you'll see
before you die.
