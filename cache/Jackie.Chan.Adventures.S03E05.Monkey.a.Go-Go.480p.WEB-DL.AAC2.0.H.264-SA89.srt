1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,772
Are we there yet?

2
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,307
Patience, Jade.

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,542
We will not know
where there is

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,344
until uncle's
locator spell

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,847
leads us to
the animal we seek.

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,117
The tiger who
has inherited
the talisman power

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,386
of yin and Yang.

8
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:21,553
Well, make it hurry,

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,723
'cause it reeks
something fierce in here.

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,259
Are you sure
the spell is
accurate, uncle?

11
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:31,196
Nevada is not
exactly known
as tiger country.

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,766
Never mock the sock.

13
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:36,101
It's our only chance
of finding the tiger

14
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,804
before the forces
of darkness do.

15
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,073
Well, bet ya
daolon wong doesn't have to

16
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,275
spend all day cooped up
in a smelly car.

17
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,377
(Chants)

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,014
Pee-yew!
Are we there yet?

19
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,117
So, big d,
- we really appreciate

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,219
you turning us
into superpowered
dark chi dudes

21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,889
and all,
but we gotta
talk image.

22
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,091
I'm not digging the
whole orange vibe,

23
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,694
and these
outfits kinda
scream boy band.

24
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,064
Nah, we look like kiss.

25
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,266
We look like
circus freaks.

26
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,268
Hey! Can you not all see

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,638
that I am trying
to concentrate?

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,041
I must find the tiger
and acquire its power

29
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:20,512
before that
accursed old man
and his family intrude.

30
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,084
What?

31
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,286
Aah! Daolon wong!

32
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,292
Aah!

33
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,588
(Gurgles) Ow!

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,823
(Gurgles) Ow!

35
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,591
(Chants)

36
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,161
(Chants)

37
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,563
Whoa!

38
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,334
Get out there
and stop them!
But--

39
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,003
now!

40
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,743
Jackie, look out!

41
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,077
Aah!

42
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,147
All: Aah!

43
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,025
Dudes, we have powers.

44
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,527
Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,762
Sweet!

46
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,502
(All laugh)

47
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,674
Do you think
they are...
All right? Ow!

48
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,242
Of course they
are all right!

49
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:34,179
They are magic!
Now drive! Quickly!

50
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,786
(Growls)

51
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,956
Uncle: Stop the car!

52
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,893
The tiger we seek
is here!

53
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,729
Jackie:
In las Vegas?

54
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,132
I think the world famous
Sasha makes the cut.

55
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,606
But uncle, even if
it is the right tiger,

56
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,541
what am I
supposed to say?

57
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,309
"Hello, my
name is Jackie.

58
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,178
Can I borrow your
star attraction?"

59
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,279
Ow!

60
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,914
You figure it out!

61
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,016
Uncle must do research.

62
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,951
When daolon wong arrives,

63
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,355
we will need powerful
spells to combat him.

64
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,489
Shoo! Shoo!

65
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,927
Come on, Jackie.
We'll take care
of the tiger,

66
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,662
and then
take in Vegas.

67
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,398
Some shows,
some all-you-can-eat
buffets...

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,602
Jade, what part of
daolon wong did you
not understand?

69
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,037
Oh!

70
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,812
Sasha has
the heart of
a savage predator,

71
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,682
but we have tamed
her wild nature

72
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,252
with years
of training.
Right, ulf?

73
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,288
Ya, Helmut!

74
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,458
Now Sasha is our Princess!

75
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,167
Room service?

76
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,638
Yes, please send up
one vial of eel saliva,

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,308
3 jars of
powdered duck feet,

78
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,843
and a pair of
moose antlers.

79
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,512
What?

80
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,848
What kind of hotel
does not have eel saliva?

81
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,851
Hey, uncle,
I know you're busy,

82
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,887
so if you want me
to go help Jackie,

83
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,489
just signal by
yelling into the phone.

84
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,491
I do not want
chicken fingers!

85
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,694
I require duck feet!

86
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,063
You got it!

87
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:35,400
So, you want
to borrow
our Sasha?

88
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,937
Uh, yes.
Um, I'll pay you?

89
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,105
(Both laugh)

90
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,207
Ulf giggles
at you!

91
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,176
And Helmut chortles!

92
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,912
Wait, you do not understand!

93
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:50,015
Your tiger is in danger!

94
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,517
Is that
a threat, mister?

95
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,021
What? No,
not danger from me!

96
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,222
From who, then?

97
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,926
Um, a dark chi wizard?

98
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,196
Please, let me explain--

99
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,198
(impersonating Elvis)
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,466
Yo, red,
how ya doin'?

101
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,834
Thank you,
thank you very much.

102
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,902
...peanut
butter sandwich.

103
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,105
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.

104
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,674
Get me a banana and
peanut butter sandwich?

105
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,584
Uh, yes,
thank you very much.

106
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,724
Now, where would
I keep a--

107
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,559
aah!

108
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,064
(Gasps)

109
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,735
Uh, nice tiger.

110
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,174
Whew! Tame tiger.

111
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,414
Hello, uh, Sasha.

112
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,149
Would you like
to go for a walk?

113
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,120
Come with Jackie.
Come on.

114
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,424
(Meows) Please?

115
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:09,594
If the yin Yang
power means balance...

116
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,864
Good balance.

117
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,211
Good Sasha. Huh?

118
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,712
Bad Sasha!

119
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,022
(Gasps)

120
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,256
Jackie!

121
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,965
2 Sashas?

122
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,735
Just one!
And her nice half
is getting away!

123
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,974
¶ Oh, pretty tiger ¶

124
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,176
Sasha is excited, ya?

125
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,580
She loves to train
with Helmut and ulf.

126
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,749
(Both scream)

127
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,551
(Meows)

128
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,353
(Helmut and ulf
screaming)

129
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,023
Jackie.

130
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,100
(Both scream)

131
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,303
Huh?

132
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,410
Sasha is very
moody today.

133
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,415
You have
the keys, ya?

134
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,988
Bad day. Bad day.
Bad day. Bad day.

135
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,791
Jackie, you rock!

136
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,093
You can pull 'em
back together, right?

137
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,504
Uh-oh. Jackie's
coming apart, too!

138
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,045
Jackie, are
you ok?!

139
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,446
Oh, yeah.

140
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,481
Thank you
for asking.

141
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,183
Aah!

142
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,785
What?
What?

143
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,859
Aah!
Aah!

144
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,963
Hey, I have a zit.

145
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,899
Get off of my body
or I'll pop you!

146
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,301
Oof! I do not
wish to argue,

147
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,904
but this is
my body, too!

148
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,873
I didn't let
the yin-Yang power
finish separating you,

149
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,910
so one head's
your dark side,
and the other is...

150
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,312
Light! That's me!

151
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,048
There's only
one sure way to put
your heads back together.

152
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,385
Come on, we really
have to find those tigers!

153
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,990
There goes one!

154
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,201
Uh-oh.

155
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,837
And I thought
we looked freaky.

156
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,139
Forget them!
The animal is near!

157
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,273
Come on!

158
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,642
Bring it on!

159
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,276
I'll whup ya
with one hand.

160
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,878
Hey!

161
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,149
Hmm?

162
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,693
Hmm?

163
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,500
Yes.

164
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,071
What are you
looking at?

165
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,775
I do not
see the tiger!

166
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,444
Maybe we should
split up.

167
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,614
So I got
all the brains.

168
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,056
Tiger at 12 o'clock.

169
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,024
Aah! It's a tiger!

170
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,759
A tiger! Aah!

171
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,728
Uh, heads up, guys.

172
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:47,272
And now, to absorb
your glorious power.

173
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,544
(Chants)

174
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,012
Hmm?

175
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,549
The extraction spell
is not working!

176
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,485
Yo, dao-man,
you online?

177
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,654
We eyeballed
the cat!

178
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,657
Nonsense! The animal
is here before me.

179
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,526
Who knew there were
so many tigers in Vegas?

180
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,495
You sure about
that, boss?

181
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,663
This one's
white.

182
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,331
And it's mean.

183
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,468
Mean?

184
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,871
(Gasps) I possess only
the yin of the beast.

185
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,407
Bring me
the Yang immediately!

186
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,847
Gotcha!

187
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,248
Hello, kitty.

188
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,351
Muzzle!

189
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,753
(Growls)

190
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,755
(Growls)

191
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,857
We did it!

192
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,725
We are kings
of the jungle!

193
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,795
Hand over
the tomcat, chan,

194
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:48,032
or we'll wipe
that smile off your faces.

195
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,503
Let's rock!

196
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,304
Wait!
- We cannot leave
the tiger with--

197
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,372
whoa!

198
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,142
Get the cat!

199
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,045
Sorry!

200
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,313
Oh, sorry!

201
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,286
Oh, did
I hurt you?

202
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,492
All: Aah! Tiger!
Aah! Tiger!

203
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,728
No, wrong way!

204
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,768
Whoa!

205
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,771
3 jokers,
and jackies are wild.

206
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,906
Who's in?

207
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:28,973
Not me!

208
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,850
Hey, you kicked them
with my leg!

209
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,186
Missed me!

210
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,188
Stop! Please!

211
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,523
Can we talk
about this?

212
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,991
Come on!

213
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,728
Hold this.

214
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,767
Aah!

215
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,938
Heads, you lose!

216
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,744
Ow!

217
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,347
Double or nothing.

218
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,582
Oh, no.

219
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,321
Jackpot.

220
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,622
Twofer!

221
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,994
Hello, muzzle?

222
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,163
This is the
all-you-can't-eat buffet.

223
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,700
(Groans)

224
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,504
We're on a winning streak.
2 tigers to none!

225
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,707
You have
the other tiger?

226
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,443
Yo, d-man,
beam us up.

227
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,313
Jackie! Jackie!

228
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,781
The bad guys
have both Sashas!

229
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,950
If the anti-uncle
drains their power,

230
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,619
you guys'll be
stuck this way!

231
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,221
(Gasps) Forever?

232
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,025
Oh, boy.

233
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,131
(Telephone rings)

234
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,834
Room service? I have
been waiting for--

235
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,003
uncle, thank
goodness you are--

236
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,005
Jackie! How can
you leave uncle

237
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,441
at a shabby hotel
with no eel saliva?

238
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,645
Pull your tongue
out of your mouth
and wring out the spit.

239
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,015
(Gasps) You call
uncle an eel?!

240
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,950
Uncle,
I'm sorry.
No, I'm not!

241
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,685
Yes, I am.
No, I'm not.

242
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,821
Jackie, why
do you babble
like a crazy person?

243
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,057
Both: Because
I have 2 heads.

244
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,362
And daolon wong
has 2 tigers.

245
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,464
We need your
locator spell.

246
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,274
(Sighs)
It's still not
long enough, ulf.

247
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,710
Oh, we must find
a way out, Helmut.

248
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,779
It is nearly showtime.

249
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:53,584
At last, I shall
absorb the power of--

250
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,819
(sniffs) Hmm?

251
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,421
Wasn't me.

252
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,190
Hello!

253
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,197
Hurry, fathead!

254
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,866
Hey, our heads
are the same size!

255
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,835
Off with
his heads!

256
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,087
All: Whoa!

257
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,091
Well, that's the opposite
of what we had in mind.

258
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,626
Ah! Free at last!

259
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:36,861
Attack!

260
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,130
(Growls)

261
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,199
Fighting
is not nice.

262
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,639
You cannot
defeat me, old man.

263
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:53,111
Who are you calling old,
you bag of bones!?

264
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,646
Aah!

265
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,551
You have learned
the yen huo fire magic?

266
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,288
Substituting eel saliva
with mayonnaise.

267
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,392
No match for
the genuine article!

268
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,483
Nice teamwork,
partner.

269
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,618
don't touch me.

270
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,819
Aah!

271
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,354
(Gasps)

272
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,794
Uh, hello.

273
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,792
(Audience oohs and aahs)

274
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,796
Thank you. Aah!

275
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,401
Wonder what
this one does?

276
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,905
Whoa!

277
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,146
Aah!

278
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,417
don't touch me.

279
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,686
No problem.

280
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,058
Ow!

281
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,128
(Audience cheers)

282
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,931
So, which one's Helmut
and which one's ulf?

283
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,104
Your half-baked spells
cannot defeat me!

284
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,743
I blame room service!

285
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,847
Uh-oh.

286
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,654
Come to me,
talisman magic!

287
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,656
(Chanting)

288
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,264
Jackie!

289
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,471
Giddyap!

290
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,906
Abra-cadabra?

291
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,881
Eh?

292
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,323
No, I don't
wanna go back!

293
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,359
Come on,
we belong together!

294
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:07,471
(Audience cheers)

295
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,377
The one, the only!

296
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,913
Now we just
have to convince

297
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,515
Helmut and ulf to let us--

298
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:20,818
take the nasty
tiger, please!

299
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,822
Ya! We will be auditioning
for a juggling Bear.

300
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:28,326
Well, no bears in
the Chinese zodiac, right?

301
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,000
Hey Jackie,
do you play video games?

302
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:39,103
I really love
all kinds of video.

303
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,471
Ok, I play Tetris.

304
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,773
People come
to talk to me,
I just keep playing.

305
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,978
One day I dream my head
no fit into any hole.

306
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,413
I get up, I take
my video game away.

307
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,648
It's bad.
