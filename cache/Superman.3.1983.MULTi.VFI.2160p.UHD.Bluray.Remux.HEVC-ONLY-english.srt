1
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,599
Next, please.

2
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,559
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,186
Next.

4
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,687
Name.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,564
Gus Gorman.

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,699
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,160
Have you looked for work this week?

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,080
- Yes.
- What kind?

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,210
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?

10
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,128
No, but...

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,007
Mr. Gorman, according to our records,
you've been unemployed for 36 weeks.

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,342
No, it's 35.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,386
Not counting this week.

14
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:58,015
You secured employment in June as
a messenger and were discharged after...

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,977
- one day for losing...
- No, they said I lost it.

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,230
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

17
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,856
A television set?

18
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,735
It was a teeny-tiny, teeny-weensy
Japanese television set.

19
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:14,865
The other employment you found
was in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

20
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,409
28 minutes?

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,245
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

22
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:24,000
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,170
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,923
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese".

25
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,635
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault, but...

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,012
I'm not the fault!

27
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,097
Thirty-six weeks
of chronic unemployment.

28
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,434
Thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

29
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,895
- Do you know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!

30
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:50,735
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

31
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,778
- Well, look...
- Next.

32
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,072
Wait. What about this week?
I need this week!

33
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,532
Next.

34
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,451
You mean, that's it?

35
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,661
"Finished," like "over"?

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,666
Next.

37
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,169
"Next" as in "bye".

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,171
Next!

39
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,258
Name.

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,970
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

41
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,836
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.

42
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,022
Huh? Ah.

43
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,830
Excuse me.

44
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,532
Say thank you.

45
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,284
Wow!

46
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,886
Way to go, Superman!

47
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,798
Your drink is on its way.

48
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,467
Sir.

49
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,219
Excuse me...

50
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,934
but what if you wanna program two
bilateral coordinates at the same time?

51
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,144
You can't do that. It's impossible.

52
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,063
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

53
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,317
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

54
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,487
But if you think we can't
do it that way, what happens?

55
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,280
Sir.

56
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,829
Good Lord.

57
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,831
How did you do that?

58
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,626
I don't know. I just did it.

59
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,148
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

60
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,359
Just after he received the award for
Humanitarian of the Year.

61
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,278
He is good-looking.

62
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,363
Because I gave him F2 at a 50th.

63
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,365
One thing I don't understand...

64
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,870
the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

65
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,707
and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of this other person.

66
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,543
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

67
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,379
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

68
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,215
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

69
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,717
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?

70
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,679
The picture's fine, chief.
She looks like that in real life.

71
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,100
- She's VP of Webscoe Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

72
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,604
A boring banquet and you bring me
3000 boring pictures.

73
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,565
Yet Superman saves a man
from drowning on Third Avenue...

74
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,152
while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!

75
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,154
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

76
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,742
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

77
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,369
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

78
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,748
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

79
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,501
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

80
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,504
- I don't know why the idiot in Circulation...
- Good morning.

81
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,714
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

82
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,674
You've got mustard on your lapel.

83
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,885
Excuse me, Mr. White,
I hate to interrupt...

84
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,346
Sorry. I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

85
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,598
It'll never replace the printing press.

86
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,768
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- Fifty-three.

87
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,939
- Mr. White...
- Fifty-three!

88
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,609
- Mr. White...
- You've got to pull three more numbers.

89
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,570
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?

90
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,783
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

91
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,619
What's a terrific story?

92
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,163
Kent's been invited
to his high-school reunion.

93
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,123
- Say.
- Yeah.

94
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Could we have the next number?

95
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,795
It's practically an
American institution. Isn't it?

96
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,924
I don't know, Mr. Kent. Most of
the people I know are still in high school.

97
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,554
Thirty-three.

98
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,473
What I thought this story
would be about, Mr. White, is...

99
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,308
Thirty-three.

100
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,312
Is how much the typical small town
has changed in the last 15 years.

101
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,689
Take me, for example:

102
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,568
Can I really go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?

103
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,737
I'm really excited about this.
In fact, I was looking around...

104
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,407
in my closet last night...

105
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,452
and I even found
my old high-school sweater.

106
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,832
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

107
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,501
Can I go ahead
and make my travel plan?

108
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,211
Same question about mine.

109
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,841
Tell your people the prodigal son
and his photographer are coming home.

110
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,843
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

111
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:23,015
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

112
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,601
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

113
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,019
Thank you.

114
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,148
Lois, are you going someplace?

115
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,028
Clark, you know some people
get to go all the way to Smallville...

116
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,990
and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

117
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,825
Golly.

118
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,368
- Bye.
- Bye, Miss Lane.

119
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,874
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

120
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,044
Well, I guess I better be going too.

121
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,672
So I'll be going.

122
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,135
Bye.

123
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,723
Couldn't we get a computer to do this?

124
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,791
- Hey, what is this?
- First paycheck.

125
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,420
This is the first rip-off, man! We're
supposed to get 225 a week, right?

126
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,882
This says, "$143.80".
How am I supposed to live on that?

127
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,386
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

128
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,222
It's so you're still getting
some money when you hit 65.

129
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,599
So I'm getting money when I? 65?

130
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,101
I want mine now!

131
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,814
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
I wanna get up and get down. Boogie.

132
00:12:55,316 --> 00:13:00,112
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

133
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,616
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

134
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,619
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?

135
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,621
Everybody loses those fractions?

136
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,624
They don't lose them.
You can't lose what you never got.

137
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,043
Then what happens?
The company gets them?

138
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,881
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

139
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,466
Then what happens to them?

140
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,221
Well, they're just floating around out there.
The computers know where.

141
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,931
How many sugars?

142
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,975
One and a half.

143
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,109
It's quitting time, Gus. You coming?

144
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:43,947
Yeah. No, actually, I got some
stuff to finish up, so...

145
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,994
Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?

146
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,164
Yeah, looking for a raise.

147
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,702
You bet.

148
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,545
But my Uncle Al on my father's
side, he won't eat her stuffing.

149
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,383
He says it should be cooked on the outside.
She cooks it on the inside.

150
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,720
My mother told my Aunt Helen.
She's my father's half sister.

151
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,056
- I told you that, right?
- Yeah.

152
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,933
- And anyway, the family...
- Hey, hey.

153
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,227
- Look at that.
- Wow.

154
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:10,408
Okay, your choice.
You can turn back or pull over till it's over.

155
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,161
- How long will it take?
- Can't tell with these fires.

156
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,414
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

157
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,083
It's just a building burning.

158
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,585
It's not just a building.
That's a chemical plant.

159
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,381
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

160
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,219
If any of that stuff goes up in smoke,
we're in for a hairy time around here.

161
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,222
- Clark.
- Yeah?

162
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,599
I want you to keep
these people distracted.

163
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,934
What are you doing?

164
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,229
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?

165
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,606
A photographer always
goes after a story.

166
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,358
That could be dangerous, Jimmy.

167
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,612
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

168
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,402
Help me!

169
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,658
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.

170
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,036
- It's you. Forget the helmet.
- How bad is it?

171
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:40,624
My God, it's a nightmare. Everything's
either explosive or flammable or worse.

172
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,254
Get the ladder truck in here.

173
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,299
- It won't reach.
- My God, they're trapped!

174
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,844
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?

175
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,198
Let's go! Everybody,
down there! Move it!

176
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,033
Come on! Hurry up!

177
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,326
There you go.

178
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,082
Right down there. Take it easy.

179
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,169
All right. Everybody down there!

180
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,547
Keep moving!

181
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,916
Sir, get out. I'll show you
the quickest way.

182
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,252
Go on. Look after the others.
I can't leave.

183
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,671
- Why not?
- I gotta stay and look after those.

184
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,423
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

185
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,718
If that stuff heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

186
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,262
that'll make this fire
look like a picnic.

187
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,513
What does it do?

188
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,558
As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

189
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,228
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

190
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,648
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that will eat through anything.

191
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,443
Steel, concrete, anything.

192
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,080
Who the hell is that?

193
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:49,085
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- I'm just gonna get a couple more shots.

194
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,387
Ow! Ah!

195
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,688
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!

196
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,776
Help!

197
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,112
Help! Help me!

198
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,451
Help! Somebody help me!

199
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,995
- Help!
- It's all right.

200
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,831
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

201
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,792
All right. We'll go nice and easy.

202
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,796
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.

203
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,843
Medics! Over here, please.

204
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,638
That's it. Here you go.

205
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,348
Go easy. It's the left leg.

206
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,184
- My camera.
- Yeah.

207
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,729
It's a clean break right across the fibula.

208
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,817
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

209
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,739
Get that fire out, otherwise there'll be an
acid cloud all over the Eastern seaboard.

210
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,371
- The pump house is gone!
- What?

211
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,040
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!

212
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,544
- We've got to have water!
- How?

213
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,713
Lake Comooga's five miles from here.
We'd need a five-mile hose!

214
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,882
- Where's this lake?
- That way.

215
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,684
Tell them it's hopeless.

216
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,270
You told me we had
an adequate water supply.

217
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,457
Water!

218
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,641
I tell you, that man's a miracle!

219
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,002
Carol, you got gorgeous!

220
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,140
Look at you.

221
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,652
That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

222
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,822
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

223
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,700
we're back at the 25-yard line.

224
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,203
Coach sends in a play,
Right Flanker Option.

225
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,340
You really have grown, Clark.

226
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,384
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

227
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:11,347
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

228
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,058
But really, I can't complain.

229
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,019
Lana?

230
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,229
Clark?

231
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,405
Would you excuse me? There's someone
I'd really like to say hello to.

232
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,993
Lana?

233
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,539
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

234
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,252
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look...

235
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,464
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- No, no. I can manage.

236
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,591
Uh...

237
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,220
This is the first time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

238
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,264
Yeah. I'm sorry.

239
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,435
I heard that you and...

240
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,730
- Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?

241
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,981
No.

242
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,984
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

243
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,615
- That's not right.
- No?

244
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,284
You're right about Donald and me,
but... Hold this, okay?

245
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,869
Oh, sure.

246
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,790
Hi, Kent.

247
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,417
Hi. How you doing?

248
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts. Thanks.

249
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,760
- Clark.
- Yeah.

250
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,137
Lana.

251
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,807
Uh-oh. Um...

252
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,308
Hey, sweet.

253
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,810
Here I am.

254
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,148
Remember when you were prom queen?
All these guys were waiting for a dance?

255
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,984
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Huh, honey?

256
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,028
- That's good old...
- Brad Wilson.

257
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,073
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

258
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,158
Long time no see.

259
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,244
You know, see, see, see?

260
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,455
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

261
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,791
- Clark already asked me.
- I did?

262
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,793
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.

263
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,796
Lana, I haven't danced...

264
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,385
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

265
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,225
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

266
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,727
What?

267
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,106
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,608
Here you go.

269
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,579
Ooo...

270
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,007
Thanks for helping me out.

271
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,927
You kidding? A lot of guys
would like to be where I am.

272
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,554
You'd be surprised at how many
offers I didn't get.

273
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,431
Even Brad wouldn't stick around.

274
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,099
It really isn't easy.

275
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,268
The streamers?
Yeah, you just pull, and...

276
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,938
No, not the streamers. Everything.

277
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,440
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

278
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,610
I don't know why,
I just feel like I can talk to you.

279
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,903
What?

280
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,405
I feel like I can talk to you!

281
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,950
- You can?
- Yes.

282
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,118
- You know something, Lana?
- What?

283
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,455
I always...

284
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,958
I always wished that you would.

285
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,126
I mean, even back in high school.

286
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,963
- Remember when you were?
- Queen of the prom.

287
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,591
Then three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

288
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,969
- Isn't that terrible?
- Yeah, sure is.

289
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,973
There must be a gallon
of potato salad left over.

290
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,475
You know what the problem is?

291
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,478
I don't know, too much mayonnaise?

292
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,439
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?

293
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,484
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville?

294
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,444
Believe me, I've asked myself that.

295
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:40,157
Do you know how lucky you are
to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.

296
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,576
Well, Lana, you could...

297
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,495
Easy to say. But how?
What about Ricky?

298
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,081
- Ricky?
- My little boy.

299
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,625
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

300
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:54,338
I mean, at least here we have a house
and I've got a job that pays the bills.

301
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,009
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

302
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,512
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

303
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,139
That's a shame.

304
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,523
You never got married?

305
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,235
- Me?
- Yeah.

306
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,195
Well, I was...

307
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,198
No. Not...

308
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,252
You know, years later you can
look at someone and think...

309
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,255
"Well, I guess that's
the one that got away".

310
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,722
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

311
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,391
- Eighty-five thousand dollars.
- Missing?

312
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,145
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

313
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,563
By whom?

314
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,274
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?

315
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,068
Vera, get ahold of yourself.

316
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,362
Nobody else ever will.

317
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,238
I don't know.

318
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,406
Whom?

319
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,742
In the old days it was simple.

320
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,288
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

321
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,165
If somebody wanted to rob you...

322
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,876
they'd come in with a gun and say,
"Stick them up".

323
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,213
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

324
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,675
My old friend, you are yesterday.

325
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,761
Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

326
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,057
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

327
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,101
Does this woman
have the right to burst in?

328
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,896
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist?

329
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:38,234
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

330
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,446
Why don't you hold your breath instead.
Maybe you'll turn blue.

331
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,950
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

332
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,328
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

333
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,960
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

334
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,255
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

335
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,965
Now, girls.

336
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,925
Simpson.

337
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,635
Well, old chum. What now?

338
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,596
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?

339
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,600
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again?

340
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,895
- He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
- Why?

341
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,440
That's what they always say
in the movies.

342
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,151
He won't slip up at all. No, not at all.

343
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,987
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

344
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:27,408
He'll keep a low profile and won't
do a thing to call attention to himself.

345
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,996
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

346
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,390
I'll go first. Andrew.

347
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,019
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?

348
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,520
LANA Ricky, your shoe.

349
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,024
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.

350
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,359
All right, come on, Ricky.

351
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,528
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

352
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,491
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

353
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,993
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

354
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,873
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

355
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,628
Oh, look. He's stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

356
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,005
- Gee, all he had was chocolate milk.
- No, him.

357
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,673
Hey, sweet thing.

358
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,051
Little kid getting hassled, huh?

359
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,221
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.

360
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,140
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

361
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,185
I won the all-country bowling
trophy two years in a row.

362
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,394
I didn't know that.

363
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,522
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

364
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,482
Brad, you're just gonna
make it worse.

365
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,151
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

366
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,493
You watch, he'll get a spare.

367
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,203
Come on, Ricky.

368
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,456
Hey, kid, you're holding it all wrong.

369
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,335
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

370
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,257
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

371
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,052
For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.

372
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,514
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

373
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,601
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

374
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,771
Here you go, Ricky.

375
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,983
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.

376
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,611
Sorry.

377
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,286
Ah-choo!

378
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,129
Gesundheit.

379
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,463
Thank you.

380
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,760
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

381
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,513
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

382
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,142
No, not that boss. The boss.

383
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,811
- You mean, the boss...
- Yup.

384
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,479
- Wants to see me?
- Yup.

385
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,816
Oh, my God,
why would he wanna see me?

386
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,151
I mean...

387
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,821
Why would the boss wanna see me?

388
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,741
There's no reason.

389
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,535
Then why'd he? Oh, I know!

390
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,830
It's my suggestion
for the volleyball uniforms.

391
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,248
That's it.

392
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,056
Ross the boss.
Ross the boss. The boss!

393
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,059
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

394
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,775
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?

395
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,612
Mr. Webster, I did not... Mr. Webster.

396
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,031
Mr. August Gorman?

397
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,449
August Gorman here.

398
00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:00,204
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't wanna go to jail...

399
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,373
because they have robbers
and rapists...

400
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,959
I just wanna ask you one question.

401
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,878
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?

402
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,546
Come on, admit it now.

403
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,216
You've been just a little bit naughty,
haven't you?

404
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,219
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

405
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,597
I can... What do
the young folks say today?

406
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,475
"Dig where you're
coming from, brother".

407
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,520
- You wanna be rich, right?
- How, wha...

408
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,232
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

409
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,900
What do you do with your socks?

410
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,029
I don't know. They're laundered and sent
to some charitable institution, I think.

411
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,408
Actually, I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into dust rags...

412
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,076
or pen-wipers or something.

413
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,911
Or maybe socks.

414
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,872
Yes! That never occurred to me.

415
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,876
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.

416
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:51,755
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect, right? Cheers.

417
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,925
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

418
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,095
No, no, because computers
rule the world today.

419
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,932
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

420
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,437
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines...

421
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,939
do what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?

422
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,066
- Yes!
- Gus...

423
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:16,030
Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

424
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,115
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

425
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,284
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow me?

426
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,952
I follow you, sir.

427
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,288
- Gus, do you know what I want now?
- No.

428
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,539
I want coffee.

429
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,458
All right. Black, cream, sugar, or?

430
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,710
No, you don't seem to understand.

431
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,297
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

432
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,676
in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

433
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,638
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

434
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,809
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy, right?

435
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,312
That could bug... What country?

436
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,940
- Colombia.
- Colombia?

437
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,110
Colombia has two important exports,
and one of them's coffee.

438
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,947
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

439
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,284
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

440
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:07,831
has the gall to think it can dictate
the economy of an open market. Gus.

441
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,667
Gus, my friend...

442
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,296
we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?

443
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,175
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

444
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,844
right down to the last bean.

445
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,305
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

446
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,850
But you got so much. You know, like...

447
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,728
A wise man once said,
I think it was Attila the Hun...

448
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,523
"It is not enough that I succeed.

449
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,692
Everyone else must fail".

450
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,444
Seems fair.

451
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,196
- Gus.
- What?

452
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,033
You are going to do this for me.

453
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,830
- How?
- The weather.

454
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,207
You didn't say your mother was here.

455
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,377
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

456
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,547
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

457
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,215
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

458
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,176
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

459
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,719
to monitor the weather.

460
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:07,182
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

461
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,017
It could make weather.

462
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,727
Storms and floods.

463
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,688
Blizzards, heat waves.

464
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,064
How do you do that?

465
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,734
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

466
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,403
You push buttons.

467
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,283
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

468
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,742
You won my hand, Maury.

469
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,745
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

470
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,581
Let's get one with the sombreros.

471
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,084
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

472
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,753
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?

473
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,257
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

474
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,259
of history's biggest factory fire.

475
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,262
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

476
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,763
It was hot.

477
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,099
Smile, Mr. White.

478
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,686
South America!
I can't believe my luck!

479
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,106
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

480
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,443
you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

481
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,070
that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

482
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,240
Someplace you can sneak into, right?

483
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,617
Somebody could...

484
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,829
Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

485
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,956
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

486
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,126
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

487
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,961
How about someplace...

488
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:19,963
small?

489
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:26,637
Smallville. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

490
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,639
Mind your step.

491
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,641
Watch your step, please.

492
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,434
Thanks, Selma.

493
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,978
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

494
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,817
Let me help you, Lana.

495
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,363
I'm sorry.

496
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,451
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

497
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,162
Come on, Buster, sit down.
That's a good boy.

498
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,248
Okay. You all set? Great.

499
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,753
Wow.

500
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,012
I'm not saying another word.

501
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,516
That's it. Okay?

502
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,353
Jesus Christ!

503
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,027
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?

504
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,196
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

505
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,365
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?

506
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,535
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?

507
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,036
Okay, Mom.

508
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,623
Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

509
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,709
- This is so nice for him.
- Here you go.

510
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,337
It's even nicer when there's a man around,
which isn't that often.

511
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,048
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

512
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,551
That's why Brad thinks
he's God's gift to women.

513
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,221
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

514
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,057
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

515
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,852
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

516
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,937
some of that.

517
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,648
Green stuff.

518
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,735
Hey, pâté.

519
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,531
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

520
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,367
I didn't make any... Oh, Clark.

521
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,828
That's Buster's dog food.

522
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,247
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!

523
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,749
What time's the dog eat?

524
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,876
- This is nice.
- Here.

525
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,586
It's all right, Lana.

526
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,422
Thanks.

527
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,092
Hey, where you going? Come on!

528
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,219
Buster, stop messing about!

529
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,433
- How much longer?
- I was just thinking...

530
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,102
- I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
- No. You.

531
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,940
Well...

532
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,444
I was just thinking that...

533
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,614
somebody like you
could do really well in Metropolis.

534
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,494
I suppose I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

535
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,792
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?

536
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,295
Call me.

537
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,465
- No, I wouldn't wanna call you.
- You don't wanna call me?

538
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:13,011
Yes, I wanna call you, but I wouldn't
wanna be a nuisance to you.

539
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,139
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me, Lana.

540
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,143
Clark, may I tell you something?

541
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,649
My oil pan is leaking.

542
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,323
See? There's something dripping.

543
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,158
- Can I give you a hand?
- No, thanks.

544
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,162
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

545
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,248
Look at this.

546
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,750
Oh, boy.

547
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,613
Lana, I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay?

548
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,073
Yeah.

549
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,247
Gosh, is he all right?

550
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,924
Hi.

551
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,094
Superman?

552
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,638
That's me.

553
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,392
Mom! Mom!

554
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:30,232
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

555
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,108
Thank you.

556
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,778
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

557
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,112
And this is Clark.

558
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,241
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

559
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,078
We were flying, Mom!

560
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,704
What were you doing, anyway?

561
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,289
I was looking for Buster.

562
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,292
- Buster! Buster!
- I found him!

563
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,962
Come on, boy. That's it.

564
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,798
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!

565
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,175
- What?
- Yes, he really was.

566
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,636
Aren't you excited?

567
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,889
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

568
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,101
You do? Could you get me
his autograph?

569
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,566
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

570
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,923
Yeah? What do you want?

571
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,842
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

572
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,844
- What?
- We're in big trouble.

573
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,596
First, they lost the invoice.

574
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,433
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

575
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:50,854
So I rented a car because I missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.

576
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,524
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

577
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,861
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

578
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:02,657
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean?

579
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,034
What do you mean?

580
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,870
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

581
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,998
He wanted this special order installed...

582
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,792
in his office no later
than tomorrow morning.

583
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,211
Let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

584
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,713
Get all what set up?

585
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,560
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

586
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,896
- Which way's the office?
- Straight on ahead.

587
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,815
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

588
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,359
Oh, yeah.

589
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,028
Not bad. It's pretty good.

590
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,323
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore wing?

591
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,243
Sling! Singapore Sling.

592
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,746
What's wrong with it?

593
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,790
There's not enough vodka in it.

594
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,584
There's no vodka in it!

595
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,379
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.

596
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,382
What did you? You know.

597
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,349
- Yeah.
- There's vodka in it now, buddy.

598
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,604
Yeah, perfect.

599
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,941
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.

600
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,530
Never.

601
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,574
Job well done, buddy.

602
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,327
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you? Ha, ha.

603
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,954
Fooled you.

604
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,707
Get the keys, get the keys.

605
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,728
Somebody's drunk.

606
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,150
Hello, baby!

607
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,485
How's the little baby?

608
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,070
Okay.

609
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,366
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

610
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,163
One, two, button your shoe.

611
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:33,600
"Both keys at the same time"?

612
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,477
Whoa.

613
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,616
Wait. Wait a minute.

614
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,618
Think you've won, don't you?

615
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,205
The Philly Flash!

616
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,091
Okay, ready?

617
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,886
One, two, three!

618
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,568
Yeah. Now we'll see what we'll see.

619
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,191
Oh.

620
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,529
Oh...

621
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,124
Oh.

622
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,583
Come on, please.

623
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,713
There it is!

624
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,423
Hello! Now...

625
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,258
getting down to business.

626
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,263
I am a genius.

627
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,433
I am a...

628
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,068
Longitude...

629
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,071
and the other thing. Latitude, right?

630
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,799
Oh, look, Maury. A native wedding.

631
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,994
No one said at the Daily Planet
that this was the rainy season!

632
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,035
Meteorologists are baffled
by the tornado and rainstorms...

633
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,038
that struck the country
of Colombia this afternoon...

634
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:33,709
threatening to destroy the nation's
entire coffee crop for the next five years.

635
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,545
Gale-force winds up to...

636
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,881
an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

637
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:43,803
while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

638
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,724
A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said this was, I quote...

639
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,645
"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark".

640
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,690
If I laugh any harder, I'll split my sides!

641
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,985
To defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.

642
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,239
What a shame.

643
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,743
Poor little Colombia. Well...

644
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,424
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!

645
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,552
Bubba, do you realize what we're on to?

646
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,304
Do I?

647
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,599
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

648
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,809
Why stop at coffee?

649
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,938
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

650
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,232
But what keeps the world working?

651
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,109
Diet soda?

652
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,446
Vera, you mean? You mean?

653
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,073
Today, coffee.

654
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,784
Tomorrow, the oil!

655
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,454
- Oil?
- Lf Gus can push the right buttons...

656
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,373
I can have it all. Holy cats!

657
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,125
All the oil.

658
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,585
All the pumps.

659
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,212
All the tankers.

660
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,963
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

661
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,798
- Boss?
- Very nifty.

662
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,635
- Just the man I want to see.
- Boss, it is not my fault.

663
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,428
Isn't it neat? There...

664
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,472
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.

665
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,808
How was I to know he was
gonna start doing his thing...

666
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,102
when you started doing your thing?

667
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,064
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk?

668
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,150
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?

669
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,735
Don't call me "man".

670
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,154
I just saw Colombia
bite the dust. That's all.

671
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:29,659
You didn't see the man come flying out
of the sky from the clouds? It was him!

672
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,370
With his cape flapping in the...

673
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,793
His cape was flapping in the wind!

674
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,254
He was flying! He was great!

675
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,256
He was just flying around...

676
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,884
His cape was blowing in the wind
like this. It looked like a flag!

677
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:51,013
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!

678
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,602
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

679
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:01,357
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

680
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,693
Straight-out laser points.

681
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,195
Dried up everything!

682
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,863
Just like that!

683
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,158
I'm talking about drying it up,
like machines in the men's rooms.

684
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,368
You know what I mean?

685
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,829
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

686
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,706
Sometimes they don't work, right?

687
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,207
But Superman's worked!

688
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,419
You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.

689
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,213
No, sir. He flies off again. Right?

690
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,882
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

691
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,843
He flew into the tornado...

692
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,680
went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!

693
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,225
He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom!

694
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,894
I was gonna go crazy!

695
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,981
I've never seen nothing like it.

696
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,233
The big end was on the bottom.

697
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,193
Little end on the top.

698
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,572
Mr. Ross, it was... The big...

699
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,701
Superman's bad.

700
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,203
I'll say he was.

701
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,581
I mean, he was bad!

702
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,334
No.

703
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,877
No!

704
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,920
Here, let me help.

705
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,424
- It was a perfect plan. It was foolproof!
- And we were the fools.

706
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:12,470
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

707
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,599
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

708
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,772
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

709
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,442
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?

710
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,778
Shoot him? You know
about him and bullets.

711
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,238
- Kryptonite.
- What?

712
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,993
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?

713
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,455
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

714
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,458
- How would you know about that?
- I know a few things.

715
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,251
I know, from the graffiti I saw.

716
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,795
Wait a second.

717
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,129
She's right.

718
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,591
Kryptonite. I remember reading
about it in an interview with him.

719
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,009
Where does it come from?

720
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,470
The same planet Superman
came from... Krypton.

721
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,138
Where is Krypton?

722
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,640
It's nowhere.

723
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,475
It blew up in space, years ago.

724
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:03,145
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.

725
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,480
I know some things too.

726
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:08,150
Wait a minute. You know
what happens when a planet explodes.

727
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,904
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?

728
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,991
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

729
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,120
Then we get good old Gus
to contact the Vulcan satellite.

730
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,455
Old Gus has been doing some thinking.

731
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,541
Good. That's why I keep you around.

732
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,045
Yeah. I've been thinking that I'm not
making enough money for this gig.

733
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:32,049
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

734
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,009
it's greed.

735
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,304
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

736
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,348
Let me tell you something.

737
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,308
I can't ski!

738
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,051
Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite...

739
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,220
he orders it to search
through space...

740
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,182
around where Krypton
went bye-bye.

741
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,236
Then the laser probe locks
on to a floating chunk of Kryptonite.

742
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,489
The computer analyzes
the components...

743
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,992
and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.

744
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,411
"Unknown"?

745
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,413
"Unknown"?

746
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,766
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

747
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,274
Mr. White can't be responsible.

748
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:15,736
Where is he?

749
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,530
Please, Mr. Stokis.

750
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,657
He'll pay for this.

751
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,701
Get out your wallet!

752
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,956
- Good morning.
- Don't you "good morning" me.

753
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,628
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

754
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,463
The prettiest girl in the school..."

755
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,592
is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

756
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,433
- Hello?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.

757
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:51,188
Lana! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

758
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,731
Oh, um...

759
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,109
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

760
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,610
Why? What happened to Ricky?

761
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,322
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

762
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,492
and told the kids Superman
was coming on his birthday.

763
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,994
Okay, it was wrong...

764
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,831
but when Wednesday comes and
Superman doesn't show, it's gonna...

765
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:13,460
Well, Lana, in this case I think
I can go ahead and speak for Superman.

766
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,713
I mean, he and I
are pretty close, you know.

767
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,967
And you can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?

768
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,139
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

769
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,682
in a long time.

770
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,852
- Tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
- All right.

771
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,146
- But, Clark...
- Yeah?

772
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,856
You're the best.

773
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,322
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

774
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,825
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

775
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,827
In a church?

776
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,549
Hey!

777
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,718
Here's that compound you ordered.

778
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,803
Can't imagine what you want with it.

779
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,347
But you got it.

780
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,564
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.

781
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,405
Lana, I really wasn't expecting all this.

782
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,200
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

783
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:43,300
Superman, we all know...

784
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,679
that you're not looking
for honors and awards.

785
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,100
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

786
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:55,104
we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

787
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,690
First, for putting out
the Lake Comooga fire.

788
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,443
And not least,
for saving little Ricky.

789
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,613
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

790
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,949
Superman...

791
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:11,203
may I present you
with the key to the city.

792
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,788
Thank you, sir.

793
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,043
Thank you.

794
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,145
As you were.

795
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,482
Now listen up.

796
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,818
I just came in directly...

797
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,154
from the Pentagon...

798
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:49,491
and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

799
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,828
Because God has given us...

800
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:56,498
one of the greatest gifts in the world...

801
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,625
Chemicals.

802
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:04,256
Now, you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you?

803
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,092
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

804
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,343
Yeah.

805
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,596
Sit on what?!

806
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:16,185
You sit on molded, plastic seats!

807
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:20,522
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

808
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:26,361
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

809
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,905
in high-grade plastics.

810
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,701
We cannot afford
a chemical-plastics gap.

811
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,162
Now, listen to me.

812
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,539
Do you want...

813
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:42,127
our president of the United States
sitting down...

814
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,880
to write a peace treaty...

815
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:47,966
and have his ballpoint pen bust open...

816
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:51,386
and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

817
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,388
in front of the world leaders?

818
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,432
No. No.

819
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,726
Now, we all know...

820
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:02,231
that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

821
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,066
almost bit the bullet...

822
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,194
if it wasn't for this man here.

823
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,742
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

824
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,834
Superman, you saved our bacon...

825
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,336
and I'd like to show our gratitude.

826
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:31,844
This is a small token
of our appreciation...

827
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:36,682
to show to you for saving us
from a chemical-plant disaster.

828
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,606
Thank you very much, general.

829
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,276
This is very nice. Thank you.

830
01:05:58,705 --> 01:05:59,746
It's very nice.

831
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,799
Unknown. How am I supposed
to know what "unknown" means?

832
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,094
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

833
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,471
- Hello, boss?
- Gus?

834
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,808
- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go?

835
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:24,104
You know how they're always
trying to find the secret recipe...

836
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,106
in that chicken in the bucket?

837
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,317
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

838
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,652
because it's unknown, right?

839
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:35,657
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

840
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,660
He didn't die.

841
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,997
I ask you to kill Superman...

842
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:46,335
and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

843
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,798
Hello?

844
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,273
He hasn't had
an afternoon nap for years.

845
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:12,152
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

846
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,987
You did with that wonderful lunch.

847
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:17,366
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

848
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,369
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.

849
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,704
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

850
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,212
Hello? Yes.

851
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,215
What?

852
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,467
Oh, really?

853
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,885
Yeah, he's here.

854
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,054
I'll tell him.
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

855
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,182
Superman, that was my friend Betty.

856
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,894
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

857
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,147
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

858
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,109
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

859
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,069
Well, there's no rush.

860
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,490
- But the bridge...
- It's okay. I always get there on time.

861
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,367
Come on, let's relax a little.

862
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,718
It's unusual finding a good-looking girl
like you alone like this.

863
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:33,275
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge?

864
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,110
What bridge?

865
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,575
You're right.

866
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,539
I have to get going.

867
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,091
Get him out of there. Come on.

868
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,926
Get him out! Get him out quick!

869
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,804
Come on. Get him away.
That thing's gonna go.

870
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,738
Everybody okay? Joe?

871
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,740
What can I do to help?

872
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,450
Not much of anything now.

873
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,203
If only you'd got here
a minute sooner.

874
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,114
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

875
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:47,534
178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

876
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:50,162
with only Colombia abstaining".

877
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,830
I can tell you one thing.

878
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,876
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

879
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,503
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

880
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,047
I hated laying that big chunk of...

881
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,759
Kryptonite. Don't you see?

882
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,263
That stuff we ran off in the lab
wasn't a complete failure after all.

883
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,308
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

884
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,602
an ornery, evil, malicious, selfish...

885
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,729
- A normal person.
- Yes.

886
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,858
And now that Superman
is out of the nice-guy business...

887
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,735
We can get to work on that oil.

888
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:49,638
And now, the supreme
moment, as the last runner...

889
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:53,767
the one given the great honor
of lighting the ceremonial flame...

890
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:58,063
runs the last leg of a marathon
that began seven days ago...

891
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:02,984
as this torch has been passed
from athlete to athlete...

892
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,946
for 970 miles...

893
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,948
across the country.

894
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:52,409
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

895
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,453
in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?

896
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,083
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?

897
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:03,211
- Stick around, you may learn something.
- Hi, Lorelei.

898
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:07,048
All the oil tankers in the world
are totally controlled by computers.

899
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:10,093
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

900
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,012
and where to deliver it.

901
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,055
Don't they have captains
on these ships?

902
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,682
Yes, but they don't need them.

903
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:19,144
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

904
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:23,023
You will command the tankers
to sail toward a 50-mile area...

905
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,066
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

906
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,901
And do what?

907
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,279
And do nothing.

908
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,740
Just sit there.

909
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,785
How are all the people
gonna get their oil?

910
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,372
You catch on fast, old buddy.

911
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:45,253
Every oil pump in America is run by...

912
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,214
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!

913
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,591
I'm sorry.

914
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,720
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

915
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:57,807
Then I want you to program
one special command...

916
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,101
into all these systems.

917
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,063
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

918
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:07,025
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

919
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,110
Can you do this for me, old buddy?

920
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,529
Old pal?

921
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,289
You know, you get your way
all the time.

922
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,250
And it's not right.

923
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,797
I wanna know when I get a taste.

924
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:39,516
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you?

925
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,268
Or would you prefer jail?

926
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,312
You can't run that jail number on me.

927
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:48,233
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

928
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,152
than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

929
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,988
I see.

930
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,990
What do you want?

931
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,791
What? A wastebasket?

932
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,127
No. These are plans.

933
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,504
Blueprints.

934
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,132
- For what?
- A computer.

935
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,135
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

936
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,847
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world anyplace.

937
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,266
It doesn't exist. You see...

938
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,851
we have to build it.

939
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:24,477
What will it do?

940
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,646
Anything I tell it.

941
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,357
What will it do for me?

942
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:33,820
For you? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

943
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,405
Wow.

944
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,786
Tell me.

945
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,000
First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

946
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,085
the computer counterattacks it.

947
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,297
I mean, it finds their weaknesses
and wipes them out.

948
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:53,882
Right, old buddy.

949
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:57,886
You deal with my oil
and I'll build you your machine.

950
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,224
Okay, I'll do it.

951
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,936
But I'm not so sure about
this irreversible business.

952
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,748
They all kind of went...
What the hell?

953
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,629
That's it. The last tanker.

954
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,257
They're all mine now. All mine.

955
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,301
Yay.

956
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,762
Not quite.

957
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,431
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant?

958
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,934
It's a tanker.

959
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:49,979
And it's going the wrong way.

960
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:01,950
Skipper?

961
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,786
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

962
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,081
latitude 30 north, longitude 45 west.

963
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,459
There await further orders".

964
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,795
Hell, that's the middle of the Atlantic.

965
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,881
I'm not taking my ship there
just to await further orders...

966
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,633
no matter what that says.

967
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:22,470
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

968
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,930
All right.

969
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,652
That's where she is. Yeah.

970
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,904
Come on, get it up there.

971
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,699
Miss?

972
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,493
Miss, can you hear me?

973
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,329
Listen, we are here to help you.

974
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,000
Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!

975
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,003
Thought you'd never get here.

976
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:58,631
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

977
01:17:58,841 --> 01:17:59,924
Don't worry.

978
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,844
I'm long past saving.

979
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,183
Well...

980
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,686
don't let me keep you
from anything.

981
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,938
I'm not in a rush.

982
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,738
What did you have in mind?

983
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,698
Lots of things.

984
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,158
Oh, yeah?

985
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,994
Ooo...

986
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:31,164
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

987
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:32,707
What's that?

988
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,959
Well...

989
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,712
See, there's this little boat...

990
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:41,633
and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

991
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,921
Stop all engines!

992
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,590
Stop all engines!

993
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,478
Hi.

994
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:35,455
How about a little après-ski?

995
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,842
Champagne?

996
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,451
Take your turn like everybody else!

997
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,703
Stop it!

998
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,500
He's coming over here, Martha.

999
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,463
Don't you do that!

1000
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,133
Don't! Please!

1001
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,308
Hit him with your handbag!

1002
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,232
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

1003
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,027
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?

1004
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:51,572
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

1005
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,574
Somebody's behind this.

1006
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:55,535
You can't tell me there's no oil.

1007
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:58,079
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

1008
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,122
Someone's always getting rich.

1009
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,333
You know who suffers? The small guy.

1010
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,753
The East Coast gets
the brunt of the spill.

1011
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,007
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

1012
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,009
No. I'm busy tomorrow night too.

1013
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:54,969
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

1014
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,221
I'll think of something. Look...

1015
01:22:57,431 --> 01:23:00,600
- I gotta go. Ricky needs me.
- Lana.

1016
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:03,895
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!

1017
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,147
Well, you listen to me, huh?

1018
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,316
You better start appreciating old Brad.

1019
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,276
What else you got in Smallville?

1020
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,743
What else have I got in Smallville?

1021
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,288
I think I got the right answer.

1022
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,332
So do I.

1023
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:37,136
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?

1024
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,311
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.

1025
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,066
- Where do you want this?
- Put it up there.

1026
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,197
Are you kidding? I'm not going in there.

1027
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,553
Hey, hey. Come on.

1028
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,230
Just leave him alone.

1029
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,129
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

1030
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,131
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!

1031
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,426
- I wanna see what's happening here.
- Ricky. Ricky!

1032
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,929
- Ricky.
- Yeah, that's right.

1033
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,765
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what it is.

1034
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,768
I'll tell you, nobody's ever
gonna trust that creep again.

1035
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,395
He's washed up.

1036
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:15,609
What are you looking at? Huh?

1037
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:19,196
Excuse me. Superman? It's me, Ricky.

1038
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,073
Ricky from Smallville.

1039
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,034
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!

1040
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,410
He's changed.

1041
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:27,246
No! Maybe he's just sick.

1042
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,290
Superman, please get better!

1043
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,958
He's not listening to you.

1044
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,962
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

1045
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,757
Superman, you're just in a slump!

1046
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:39,675
You'll be great again!

1047
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,385
You can do it, Superman!

1048
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:44,555
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?

1049
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,308
Superman, you're just in a slump.

1050
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:51,103
You'll be great again.
You can do it, superman.

1051
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:54,315
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?

1052
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:15,544
He's gone nuts!

1053
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:18,464
Come on!

1054
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,386
I can give as good as I get.

1055
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:51,515
Oh, yeah? All right, come on! Come on!

1056
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,434
Come on! Come on!

1057
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:21,545
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?

1058
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:26,467
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.

1059
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,928
You've been on my nerves a long time!

1060
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,910
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

1061
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:54,328
Now's your chance.

1062
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:49,957
Skipper!

1063
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,974
God, would you look at that!

1064
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:57,024
Miss Lorelei Ambrosia
isn't at home right now.

1065
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,443
But if you'd care to leave a message...

1066
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:03,030
why not deliver it to her in person?

1067
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:06,575
So you've finally shown
your true colors.

1068
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:11,038
Well, if you're looking for us,
here's where you'll find us.

1069
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:12,956
Do drop in.

1070
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,214
Wow, this is fun!

1071
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,675
Fun? The fun's just starting.

1072
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,095
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

1073
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:29,681
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?

1074
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:33,977
Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

1075
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:38,106
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

1076
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:39,399
Well...

1077
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:42,361
No way.

1078
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,072
I just don't believe a man can fly.

1079
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,257
Watch out, horsy!

1080
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:16,103
Don't, don't, don't.

1081
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,689
Just don't try to fly.

1082
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,399
Don't try to fly!

1083
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,081
Will you get out of my way!

1084
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:57,227
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

1085
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,110
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

1086
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,029
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?

1087
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,532
I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

1088
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:14,619
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

1089
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:20,834
Wow, what a jukebox!

1090
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,961
I told you, didn't I?

1091
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:25,422
There. The ultimate computer!

1092
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:36,349
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can do.

1093
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:37,976
Let's give it a dry run.

1094
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,103
Wait a minute.
We've gotta wait for Gus.

1095
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:41,605
Who needs Gus?

1096
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:45,150
- He's the only one who can operate it.
- Like fish he is!

1097
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,570
I know enough about computers
to put a PhD to shame.

1098
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:51,323
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

1099
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:54,201
I was gonna let that little man
run the show, did you?

1100
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,620
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done?

1101
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:59,623
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

1102
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,712
Engage those buttons
to activate the alpha circuit...

1103
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:07,297
and lock the modular grid.

1104
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:12,385
You! Activate circuits 29 through W-7...

1105
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:16,681
and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

1106
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,768
In other words, push this red button.

1107
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,604
How did you know about that?

1108
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,581
He's here!

1109
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,751
Good. Let's give him
something to worry about.

1110
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,295
Now, let's see...

1111
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,131
Tracking systems locked.

1112
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,617
Let the games begin.

1113
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,245
Don't tense up now, honey.

1114
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:55,655
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

1115
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,165
Come on, Superman!

1116
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,126
Let him have it, Ross.

1117
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,843
Bubba, keep firing.

1118
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,679
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

1119
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,125
What the hell is going on?

1120
01:40:57,218 --> 01:41:00,887
You keep your rockets coming.
He won't notice the missile till too late!

1121
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:11,231
So much for your catlike reflexes.

1122
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:23,284
Oh, God!

1123
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,162
Ha, ha!

1124
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:36,214
No more. Look, you sit.

1125
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,216
Sit, sit!

1126
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,054
Help!

1127
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:46,933
Hello? Forget you, jackass!

1128
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:49,519
That's him out of the way.

1129
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:53,773
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems?

1130
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:55,859
Baby!

1131
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,527
It's Daddy!

1132
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:00,780
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?

1133
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:05,410
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

1134
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:19,883
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

1135
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:25,805
All right, the game's over.

1136
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:27,515
Hi, honey.

1137
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,225
I don't know you, lady.

1138
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:32,479
But the other night...

1139
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,317
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

1140
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,818
That guy's gone.

1141
01:42:40,613 --> 01:42:42,072
And you're next, Webster.

1142
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,618
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

1143
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:48,244
How do you like it?

1144
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:50,997
I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

1145
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:54,667
Instead of helping others, the four
of you just wanna help yourselves.

1146
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,170
Four of you?

1147
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:59,464
You mean, us? Four? Wait...

1148
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,341
Hey, man!

1149
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:05,178
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman".

1150
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:08,598
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

1151
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,600
You could've fooled me, mister.

1152
01:43:18,943 --> 01:43:20,443
That's very good.

1153
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:26,407
Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

1154
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:50,515
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!

1155
01:43:50,683 --> 01:43:51,808
Don't bet on it!

1156
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:05,864
You're hurting him.

1157
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:12,036
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.

1158
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:14,747
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.

1159
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:18,877
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

1160
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:20,920
Congratulations, old buddy.

1161
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:24,340
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman!

1162
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:25,758
I'm... No.

1163
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:27,760
Superman!

1164
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:29,512
No!

1165
01:44:30,055 --> 01:44:32,348
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.

1166
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:35,435
- Turn the power up.
- Hasn't he had enough?

1167
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,565
Turn it up!

1168
01:44:40,733 --> 01:44:42,859
Power! More power!

1169
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:49,199
Whoa!

1170
01:44:54,246 --> 01:44:55,538
Ow!

1171
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:06,966
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

1172
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:15,808
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

1173
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,602
Oh, here it is!

1174
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:45,296
What's going on?

1175
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,007
I don't know. The power's gone.

1176
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:50,343
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

1177
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,303
It worked.

1178
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,847
It worked! I got it!

1179
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:00,353
What have you got?

1180
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,607
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?

1181
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,943
- That screw.
- Never!

1182
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,866
Hey, wait. I can't see.

1183
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:37,557
What?

1184
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,853
Holy!

1185
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,564
No! Make it stop!

1186
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:47,650
I can't! It's out of control!

1187
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:51,029
But how? Where's it getting
the power from?

1188
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:56,784
It's feeding itself.

1189
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,244
It wants to live!

1190
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:23,311
It's this thing here. We'll go to the zoo.

1191
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,773
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

1192
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,443
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.

1193
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:31,861
Put the lights on!

1194
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:53,841
Stop it! You're killing him!

1195
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:57,011
Stop it!

1196
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,900
Hey. Put me down!

1197
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,254
Don't leave us alone in here! Superman!

1198
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:36,717
Oh, I get it.

1199
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:40,471
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

1200
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:42,515
We're through, frogface.
I'm splitting.

1201
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:44,267
Hey, wait a minute!

1202
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:49,480
Girls. Girls, come out of there!

1203
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,367
Help me! Please!

1204
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,167
Sis?

1205
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:14,297
Oh, my God.

1206
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,181
What is that?

1207
01:49:34,776 --> 01:49:36,027
Lorelei!

1208
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:40,740
Sis, it's your Bubba!

1209
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:20,446
Help me. Help!

1210
01:50:22,658 --> 01:50:23,950
Superman!

1211
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,120
Honey!

1212
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:32,166
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?

1213
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:44,345
Look out!

1214
01:52:53,684 --> 01:52:54,892
Bubba?

1215
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:42,982
Thank you, brother.

1216
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:51,699
Regular or premium?

1217
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:55,995
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

1218
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:58,956
How you doing?

1219
01:53:59,124 --> 01:54:02,209
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

1220
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:05,171
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

1221
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:07,214
I'm not gonna argue with you.

1222
01:54:07,382 --> 01:54:10,509
I mean, any man who can trick
my machine can do anything.

1223
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:12,386
How did you beat my defenses?

1224
01:54:12,596 --> 01:54:16,015
Those defenses are good as long
as it didn't know it's in trouble.

1225
01:54:16,224 --> 01:54:19,727
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

1226
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:23,564
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

1227
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,691
- Watch the trees.
- Whoa!

1228
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:29,361
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

1229
01:54:30,614 --> 01:54:33,199
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies?

1230
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:36,911
They're gonna have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

1231
01:54:38,455 --> 01:54:39,997
Are we in Metropolis yet?

1232
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:43,292
Nope. We're just gonna make
a little stop right over there.

1233
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:45,419
Whoa!

1234
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:53,511
We're on the ground, Gus.
Morning.

1235
01:54:53,678 --> 01:54:55,679
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.

1236
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:57,056
Excuse me a second.

1237
01:55:01,394 --> 01:55:03,187
Can you guys spare one of these?

1238
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:06,774
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?

1239
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:08,984
Are you kidding? Is that?

1240
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:11,904
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?

1241
01:55:13,114 --> 01:55:17,701
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"

1242
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:19,411
Just right.

1243
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:21,288
Okay, Gus, let's go.

1244
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:24,583
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

1245
01:55:25,085 --> 01:55:28,420
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?

1246
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:31,674
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

1247
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:35,511
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

1248
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:39,348
Wow, thank you, Supe.

1249
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:40,724
Take care.

1250
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:44,103
I'll see you around.

1251
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:51,277
So long.

1252
01:55:54,322 --> 01:55:56,031
Take it easy, man.

1253
01:55:57,409 --> 01:56:01,620
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

1254
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:08,460
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

1255
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:10,546
Can you tell me
where the bus station is?

1256
01:56:10,755 --> 01:56:13,340
Yeah, about nine, 10 miles over there.

1257
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:18,012
Nine or 10 miles. Okay.

1258
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:20,264
Hey. You really flew with him?

1259
01:56:20,432 --> 01:56:23,475
Superman? Have you ever
seen Superman before?

1260
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:26,520
No.

1261
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:30,316
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?

1262
01:56:35,488 --> 01:56:37,823
Yeah, we go way back together.

1263
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:40,659
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

1264
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,871
Nine or 10 miles?

1265
01:56:44,414 --> 01:56:46,332
I think I'll walk.

1266
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,125
Yeah, I'll walk.

1267
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:49,919
Yeah.

1268
01:56:54,966 --> 01:56:56,175
Clark.

1269
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:59,511
What a nice surprise! Come in.

1270
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,263
- Gosh. Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Hi, Ricky.

1271
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:03,933
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with.
- Who?

1272
01:57:04,142 --> 01:57:05,517
Superman!

1273
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:08,270
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

1274
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,356
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

1275
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:14,234
but he's run into a problem and he
won't be able to have dinner with you.

1276
01:57:14,402 --> 01:57:16,695
- I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
- Yeah.

1277
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:19,740
Would you mind settling for me?

1278
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,200
Any day.

1279
01:57:22,077 --> 01:57:23,410
- I'll get my things.
- Okay.

1280
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:28,832
You know, Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

1281
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:32,795
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

1282
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,632
And he felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

1283
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:41,220
Well, he found...

1284
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:45,641
He found this one just lying around.

1285
01:57:46,935 --> 01:57:49,395
He wanted you to have this.

1286
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,195
Wow, a ring from Superman!

1287
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:01,156
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

1288
01:58:01,324 --> 01:58:02,741
Look at that.

1289
01:58:03,576 --> 01:58:05,911
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

1290
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:07,413
It fits.

1291
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:09,248
It looks really pretty.

1292
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:10,791
Thank you.

1293
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:13,502
Well...

1294
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:14,753
- Brad.
- Brad.

1295
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:16,255
Son of a bitch.

1296
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:20,009
Kent, I hate you.

1297
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:22,845
I've always hated you.

1298
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:25,139
- You know why?
- No.

1299
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:26,932
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

1300
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:28,600
And nice guys finish last.

1301
01:58:40,405 --> 01:58:42,031
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

1302
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,616
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

1303
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:47,786
that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean?

1304
01:58:47,996 --> 01:58:51,290
I knew I was on to something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

1305
01:58:51,499 --> 01:58:53,500
Lois, you're terrific.

1306
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:57,087
I have to be. Seems I've got
some new competition.

1307
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:58,672
Hmm?

1308
01:58:59,007 --> 01:59:01,550
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion?

1309
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,552
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

1310
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:07,347
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

1311
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:09,808
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

1312
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:13,937
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

1313
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:15,147
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

1314
01:59:15,315 --> 01:59:19,651
Lana. Lois, say hello to Lana Lang,
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

1315
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:22,279
I'm glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

1316
01:59:22,655 --> 01:59:23,739
Thank you.

1317
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:26,033
I like your sparkler a lot.

1318
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:29,161
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

1319
01:59:30,663 --> 01:59:32,790
- Clark gave it to you?
- Yes.

1320
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:36,877
Mr. White.

1321
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:40,214
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

1322
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:43,342
People, I am in love with this machine!

1323
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:48,138
Mr. White, excuse me, but I have
a couple of errands to run before lunch.

1324
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:51,058
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?

1325
01:59:51,267 --> 01:59:54,520
There is no handle.
You just push the button.
