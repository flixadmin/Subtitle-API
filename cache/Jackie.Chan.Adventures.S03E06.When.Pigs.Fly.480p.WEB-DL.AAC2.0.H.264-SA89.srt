1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,040
(Rooster crowing)

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,878
Do not look down.
Do not look down.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,513
Do not look down.
Do not look--

4
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,583
guhh!

5
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:27,259
Please step inside
this nice, cozy magic cage

6
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,495
so that you do not...

7
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,730
Levitate!

8
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:35,100
Wait! Dark forces wish
to steal your magic!

9
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,669
I'm only trying
to protect you!

10
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,509
Guess the chicken
can fly.

11
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,279
Question is,
chan, can you?

12
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,816
Aah!

13
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,070
Aah!

14
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,390
Can we do that?

15
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,992
Never know
till you try.

16
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,060
Whoa!

17
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,930
Now let's go home to--

18
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,732
aah!

19
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,335
I did it!

20
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,670
Uh, way to go?

21
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,150
Give up the bird, chan.

22
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,620
Locked! Whoa!

23
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,889
Try knocking.
Maybe somebody'll--

24
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,391
all: Aah!

25
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,662
Jackie?

26
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,000
Ohh. Jade!

27
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,735
You are supposed
to be on the--

28
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,136
observation deck.

29
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,305
How did you think
I observed you
getting creamed?

30
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,873
(Cell phone rings)

31
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,409
Jackie!

32
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,510
Uncle?

33
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,078
Have you found
the rooster?

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,246
Yes, I just--

35
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,315
good, because
a new spell

36
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,350
has revealed
the location

37
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,320
of the next magic
animal that we seek.

38
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,156
You must meet us
where the pig
will be found.

39
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,692
Tohru is preparing
a magic cage

40
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,195
which will prevent
it from activating

41
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,498
it's power of
heat beam eyes.

42
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,267
(Sighs) I will
change our flight.

43
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,570
Another mission?
Where we going this time?

44
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,573
Paris? Moscow? Tahiti?

45
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,812
Arline, Kansas.

46
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,448
Yee-haw.

47
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,520
Hey, Jackie, I think
egbert wants to
stretch his legs.

48
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,622
We cannot let him
out of the cage

49
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,558
until he is safely
inside section 13.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,794
So, where's uncle?

51
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,166
Tohru: I do not
think this is the
interstate, sensei.

52
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:58,804
Of course
it is interstate!
Map does not lie!

53
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,607
We came all the way
from Malaysia.

54
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,375
How did we
arrive first?

55
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,645
Well, uncle
may not be here,
but the pig is.

56
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,248
Jade, how are we
supposed to find it

57
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,250
without uncle's
locator spell?

58
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,588
"Local beaut mordecai
claimed first prize

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,690
at last week's
county fair."

60
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,261
Let's give a little
hey-howdy-do to
our noble oinker.

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,232
Remember, do not
mention magic.

62
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,067
No one ever believes.

63
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,007
Now, what's
a city feller like you

64
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,810
want with a 280-pound
Hampshire boar?

65
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,847
Uh, good question,
farmer MacDonald.

66
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,484
Um, well, I am an
archaeologist, and--

67
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,886
you mean like
a eye doctor?

68
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,788
Uh, no, that is
an optometrist.

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,758
Archaeologists
study very
old things.

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,528
Old? Mordecai
ain't turned 3 yet!

71
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,463
Uh...

72
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,765
Let's cut
to the chase, mister.

73
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,267
Whatever pigs cost,
we'll pay double.

74
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,370
Naw, I could never
part with mordecai.

75
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,339
He done so good at county,

76
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,575
I figure he might
just fetch a ribbon
at the state fair.

77
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:17,215
'Sides, I know
city slicker hogwash
when I smells it.

78
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:21,219
Well, what are
we gonna do now,
Mr. archaeologist?

79
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,455
You are going back
to the motel.

80
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,223
Ohh!

81
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,002
Mordecai?

82
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,670
Mordecai?

83
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,372
Rise and shine.

84
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,041
Now come with
farmer Jackie.

85
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,190
A dark chi wizard
is coming to--

86
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,257
whup!

87
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,398
I don't think
this little piggy's
going to market.

88
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,334
Jade, you are supposed
to be guarding the--

89
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,570
egbert wanted to hang
with the other white meat.

90
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,638
Ok, pig.

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,974
No more
horsing around.

92
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,924
Uh-oh--baah!

93
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,763
Shh! No, it's not--
(Crows)

94
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,767
Ah, sunrise.

95
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,869
Time to milk the...

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,772
What in tarnation?!

97
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,640
It's the middle
of the night.

98
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,510
MacDonald: You.

99
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,145
Ok, we'll
pay you triple,

100
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,546
but that's
our final offer.

101
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,549
Buford! E.B.!

102
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,585
We've got ourselves
a couple of rustlers.

103
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,355
No, we do not
want to rustle.

104
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,923
Yaaah!

105
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,458
Daaah!

106
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,900
They's been
stealin' chickens, too!

107
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,674
Unh! Please, can't we
just talk about--ooh!

108
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,310
Maybe they don't
know how to talk.

109
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,914
My brother e.B. Here
graduated Stanford,
phi beta kappi!

110
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,484
And buford here
is a renowned
nuclear physicist.

111
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,685
Whoa! Gah!

112
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,253
Uhh! Guh!

113
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,389
<i>Dr.</i> buford MacDonald?

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,259
Your books
are very insightful.

115
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,327
Thank you.

116
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,697
Ohh! Uhh!

117
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,167
Where is uncle?

118
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,003
(Tohru sighs)

119
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,473
Perhaps
we should stop
and ask directions.

120
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,642
Uncle knows
how to read map!

121
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,511
Oh.
Ow!

122
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,680
Map must be
right side up.

123
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,881
Rrr.

124
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,928
(Splutters)

125
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,530
You're wastin' milk!

126
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,268
Oh, man!

127
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,136
Now you're
wastin' eggs!

128
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,305
All part
of a balanced breakfast!

129
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,610
Whoa!

130
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,448
(Jade gasps)

131
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,116
Uh, Jackie...

132
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,252
Talk later. Wah!

133
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:44,523
Ain't nobody takin'
my pig, Mr. archeologist.

134
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,029
(Crows)

135
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,712
We caught 'em, pa.

136
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,049
Soowee!

137
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,284
(Gasps)

138
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,785
Mordecai!

139
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,387
The pig is gone!

140
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,389
F.Y.I.,
so's the rooster.

141
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,690
But how?

142
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,972
Maybe now
you'll tell me where
my pig's up and gone to.

143
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,273
I do not know,

144
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,176
but some very bad men
may have taken him.

145
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,479
So, y'all was just
decoys, huh?

146
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:46,017
C'mon, boys.
Let's go nab us their
pig-rustlin' compadres!

147
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,420
Uh, no! That is not
what I meant!

148
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,822
You think
daolon wong bagged
our barnyard buddies?

149
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,892
If he didn't, the animals
are vulnerable to him.

150
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,295
Whoa!

151
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,132
I'm sorry!
I owe you a scarecrow!

152
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,334
They're
gettin' away!

153
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,501
After 'em!
After them!

154
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,638
(Jackie panting)

155
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,913
(Clatter)

156
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,191
Uh...Uh, shoo?

157
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,961
Or n-not.

158
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,465
(Sighs) I think
we lost 'em.

159
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,833
Now we just have to--

160
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,101
pork ahoy!

161
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,304
(Squeals and snorts)

162
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,243
Ok, feeding time is over.

163
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,579
Who wants
to come with Jackie?

164
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,382
Aah!

165
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,154
Where is uncle?!

166
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,856
Quickly, tohru!

167
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,692
The forces of darkness
wait for no man!

168
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,127
(Sighs)

169
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,065
Willy-John, I will
marry you when pigs fly!

170
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,601
Jackie: Waaaah!

171
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,473
Over here, Jackie!

172
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,811
Hyuh! Unh!

173
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,725
Yippee-Kai-ya-aa-aa!

174
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,596
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!

175
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,866
Jade!

176
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,170
Easy, boy.
That's it. Easy.

177
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,774
Come on, egbert.
Take us down.

178
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:50,842
Whoa!

179
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,850
Uhh! Ohh...

180
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,320
MacDonald: Soowee!
Mordecai!

181
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,158
Soowee!

182
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,894
I done missed you,
too, little feller.

183
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,198
Come on, egbert.

184
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,299
Who's your pal?

185
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,037
I thought <i> gallus domesticus</i>
àwas a flightless bird.

186
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,106
And I think
a flyin' chicken

187
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,641
wins blue ribbon
at the state fair.

188
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:27,245
(Men clucking)

189
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,855
Them city folks
can't even cluck
a decent rooster call.

190
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,259
Come on!
They have egbert
and mordecai!

191
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,633
Where is uncle?!

192
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,335
Uncle: Jackie!

193
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,305
Where is rooster?!

194
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,678
don't mind this here
tether, pretty bird.

195
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,015
It's just so's you don't
go flyin' off nowhere.

196
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,217
Daolon: The pig
<i>and</i> the rooster.

197
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,687
Heh. How kind of you
to gather them for me.

198
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,490
For you? Why come
all you city fellers

199
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,993
is suddenly after
my livestock?

200
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,428
Show 'im the road, boys.

201
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,098
<i>Gan! Ren! Chui!</i>

202
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,233
(Gasps) Ooh!

203
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,638
What city you fellers
from, anyhow?

204
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,109
Creatures,
surrender your powers

205
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,344
to daolon wong!

206
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,386
Hey!

207
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,487
Hey!

208
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,490
(Daolon chanting)

209
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,591
Ohh!

210
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,761
Chan.

211
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,101
Tohru!

212
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,838
Hiya!

213
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,276
Daolon: Gan...Ren...Off!

214
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,484
What in Sam hill's nanny
is goin' on here?

215
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,453
The animals have
magic powers,

216
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,523
and dark forces
have come to claim them.

217
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,692
Magic?

218
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,828
Well, why didn't
you just say so
in the first place?

219
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,500
Ahh. Exterminate the mortals

220
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,604
and bring the beasts to me!

221
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,839
Uh, soowee!

222
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,987
You get your magic butt
off of my property, mister.

223
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,660
Magic must
defeat magic butt.

224
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,528
(Chanting)

225
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,474
Get him!

226
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,545
Jackie,
get those swine!

227
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,780
(Snorts)

228
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,181
Heh. Sorry.

229
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,832
Aiyaa!

230
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,133
Hoowee!

231
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,240
They're defyin'
the known laws of physics!

232
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,642
With our house!

233
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,855
Jackie, I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

234
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,191
Jade, bring the pig
this--whaah!

235
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,229
(Panting)

236
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,898
The house is flying.

237
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,302
Hello? Did you not catch
my <i> wizard of oz</i> reference?

238
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,104
There's no place
like home...

239
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,272
To kick your butt!

240
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,681
Ok, mordecai,
heat beam the bad guys!

241
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,149
Please?

242
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,386
(Hiss)

243
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,187
Uhh!

244
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,691
That'll do, pig.

245
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,226
That'll do.

246
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,595
It's a twister!

247
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,696
(All scream)

248
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,364
Auntie em!
Auntie em!

249
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,799
Tornadie!

250
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,334
MacDonald: They're
headin' northeast!

251
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,636
Hang a right up
at route 41, and we'll--

252
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,671
go straight, tohru!

253
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,408
Route 41
is not on my map!

254
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,510
I don't care
if it's on your map

255
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,378
or buford's underpants.

256
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,479
Ah, pa.

257
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,614
Turn right!

258
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,416
- Straight.
- Right!
- Straight!

259
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,084
- Right!
- Straight!

260
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,185
Right!

261
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,888
You want
a piece of uncle?

262
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,935
Ready to buy
the farm, chan?

263
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,375
(Chow groans)

264
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,043
We got your back, Jackie.

265
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,679
Ah, but who has yours?

266
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,487
The power of levitation
shall be mi--

267
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,755
(Jackie groans)

268
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,857
Duck, Jackie!

269
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,961
Wah!

270
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,273
My bad.

271
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,708
Grr!

272
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,176
Aah!

273
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,513
Whoa. I made it.

274
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,969
(Clucks)

275
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,537
Talkin' Turkey.

276
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,110
(Chanting)

277
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,517
Egbert!

278
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,885
Mordecai!

279
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,561
Ha ha ha ha ha!

280
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,297
Let us go,
you power hog!

281
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,467
No! But with the power
of the hog,

282
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,837
I shall reduce you both
to ashes.

283
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,540
Gah!

284
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,242
Your feeble cage
cannot withstand

285
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,711
the burning gaze of my...

286
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,649
Uh...Heat-beam eyes?

287
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:50,555
My cage is forged
of good chi, feeble one!

288
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,258
I will incinerate you...
Next time.

289
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,062
Jade: Whoa.

290
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,866
MacDonald:
Y'all sure about this?

291
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,367
Absolutely.

292
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,036
After trying
to rustle your pig...

293
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,538
And relocating your house
to another county...

294
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,674
The least I can do
is reward you

295
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,576
with a former
flying chicken.

296
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,977
'Sides, pa,

297
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:16,113
they's demonstratin'
a psychological bond.

298
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,717
Yep. They's buddies.

299
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,753
Uncle: Jackie!
Time to go!

300
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,297
- Hey, Jackie.
- Yes?

301
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,899
What do you do
with your free time?

302
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,469
My free time.
I don't really have
a lot of free time.

303
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,904
I'd rather
stay in the office.

304
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,872
I call up all
the script writer.

305
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,808
I watch a lot of DVD...

306
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,576
Training, and meeting...

307
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,677
Editing.

308
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,413
Do I have a free time?
