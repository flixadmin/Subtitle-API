<font color="#ff8000"><i>Is fallen.</i></font>
Bruce!

10
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:43,293
Bruce, it's alright.

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,225
Bruce, please.

12
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,005

Bruce.

17
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,713
Jack, listen to me.

18
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,926
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

19
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,079
<i>You understand?</i>
Oh, my God.

20
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,210
Stay away from the windows!

21
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,330
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people.

22
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:46,781
Let's go.

23
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,575
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

24
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,397
Jack.

25
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:51,702
Jack!

26
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,632
<i>We're sorry.</i>

27
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,201
<i>All circuits are busy now.</i>

28

<i>Will you please try your call again later?</i>

29
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,824
Heavenly God,

30
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,925
creator of Heaven and Earth,

31
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,629
have mercy on my soul.

32
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,515
Jack!

33
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,183
Buddy hands!

34
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:33,252
Everybody show me! Good job!

35
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,011
Come on, guys.

36
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,130
Hold on tight.

37
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Come on, guys.

38
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:43,598
Go.

39
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:44,649
Mr. Wayne!

40
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,954
Mr. Wayne!

41
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,091
I can't feel my legs.

42
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,696
I can't feel my legs.

43
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,098
We need help over here!

44
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,793
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

45
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,441
You're gonna be ok.
You hear me?

46
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,771
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally?

47
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,895
You're the boss, boss.

48
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,046
Alright.

49
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:05,530
You're gonna be ok.

50
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,953
Easy, easy. Come on.

51
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,719
Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.

52
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,670
My God. I can't feel my legs.

53
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:23,730
It's ok.

54
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:24,992
You're gonna be ok.

55
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,711
You're ok. Alright?

56
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
You know what?
We're gonna find your mom.

57
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,629
Where is she?

58
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,092
All that wind is bad luck.

59
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,614
Blood in the sky.

60
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,575
Oh, there she is!

61
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,315
Miss Lane.

62
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,951
Miss Lane.

63
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,947
Jimmy Olsen. Photographer.

64
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:54,999
Obviously.

65
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Where's Heron?

66
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,138
Trouble at the border.

67
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,158
So, how'd you land it?

68
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,654
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

69
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,525
Amajagh's never given an interview.

70
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,838
You know what Heron always says
when we're on assignment together?

71
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,633
Not a goddamn thing.

72
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,709
I like Heron.

73
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,419
Let's go.

74
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,761
Passports. Electronics.
Phones. Camera.

75
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,145
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

76
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,155
Are you a terrorist, General?

77
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,944
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

78
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:16,711
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

79
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,413
What I am is a man with nothing

80
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,391
except a love of my people.

81
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,092
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

82
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,028
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

83
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,216
One question begs another.

84
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,389
Yes?

85
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,598
Say what you're saying, General.

86
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,989
It's just a camera.

87
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,084
The United States has declared its
neutrality in your country's civil war

88
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:46,536
both in policy and in principle.

89
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,080
Don't open...

90
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,104
You just exposed...

91
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,542
These pious American fictions,

92
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:55,998
spoken like truth.

93
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,465
Ok. That's my film.

94
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,211
Men with power obey neither,

95
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:07,218
policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

96
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,635
No one is different.

97
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,816
No one is neutral.

98
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:25,600
C.I.A.

99
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,342
They're tracking us!

100
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,366
You!

101
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,941
You're C.I.A?

102
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,359
What? No. No!

103
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,529
You brought him here!

104
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,077
No, he's a photographer.

105
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,164
No!

106
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,059
It's ok, Lois.

107
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,280
Talon's down, sir.

108
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,819
Python, we have lost our asset
on the ground.

109
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,930
Repeat, we have lost our
<i>asset on the ground.</i>

110
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,972
There's still a civilian in the compound.

111
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,157
We'll extract her.

112
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,143
<i>Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.</i>

113
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,727
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

114
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,919
Call off the goddamn drone.

115
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,843
Stand down is an order.

116
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,323
Python?

117
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,493
Let's move!

118
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,571
I...

119
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,566
I didn't know.

120
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,093
Ignorance,

121
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,233
is not the same,

122
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:45,309
as innocence,

123
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,461
Miss Lane.

124
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,854
Get up!

125
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:16,566
Stand up!

126
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,882
Quickly. He's coming.

127
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,079
Inbound 2 mikes.

128
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,161
Passing Python.

129
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,434
Now.

130
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,319
Move out!

131
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,910
Target locked.

132
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:07,342
You are clear to engage.

133
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,874
Armed hot and in range.

134
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,008
Three.

135
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,747
Two.

136
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,059
One.

137
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,848
Link's been hit.

138
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,142
By what?

139
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,256
Take one step,

140
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:41,431
you will see the inside of her head.

141
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,913
The women in the village
heard a noise.

142
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,244
Like the...

143
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,937
sky cracked open.

144
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,447
He came down.

145
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:17,855
Then came fire.

146
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,028
Even worse came after.

147
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,359
The government attacked.

148
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,156
No mercy in the villages.

149
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,430
My parents tried to run.

150
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,927
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do...

151
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,021
that...

152
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,474
no one has asked what he should do.

153
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,798
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

154
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,849
He'll never answer to you.

155
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,296
He answers to no one.

156
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,915
Not even, I think to God.

157
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:03,549
<i>Delta Charlie 27.</i>

158

161
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:14,852

164
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,628
10-4. We're on it.

167
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:19,978
Go.

168
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:34,499
It's ok.

169
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,677
It's ok.

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,160
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

171
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,556
We're gonna get you out of here.

172
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,632
Ok?

173
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,113
I don't understand.

174
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,558
Please don't.
Please don't.

175
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,039
Please.

176
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,220
I don't know who he is.

177
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,999
I don't know who he is!

178
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
No!

179
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,908
Oh, fuck.

180
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Christ!

181
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,813
I saw him.

182
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:27,119
I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.

183
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,353
You almost took my face off.

184
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,556
How about you don't shoot
the good guys.

185
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,814
Jesus Christ.

186
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,118
He branded him.

187
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:09,269
Hey.

188
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:10,160
Hey.

189
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:11,665
I was gonna cook.

190
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,154
Surprise you.

191
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,897
They held hearings
about what happened.

192
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:23,579
They're saying...
I don't care.

193
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,672
I don't care what they're saying.

194
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,284
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

195
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:31,092
Think of what could have happened.

196
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,749
Well, think about what did happen.

197
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,958
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

198
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,096
If that's what you're saying.

199
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,022
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

200
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:43,875
I'm saying thank you
for saving my life.

201
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,632
I'm saying there is a cost.

202
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,476
I just don't know if it's possible.

203
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,199
Don't know if what's possible?

204
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,453
For you to love me and be you.

205
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,653
Clark!

206
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,570
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

207
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
You still working?

208
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,728
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

209
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,076
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

210
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,846
Even you got too old to die young.

211
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,058
And not for lack of trying.

212
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,336
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

213
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,999
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry...</i>

214
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,541
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

215
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,651
It's this new layer of armor.

216
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,272
I'll just have to rewire.

217
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:42,904
So,

218
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,837
last night was productive?

219
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:47,736
No.

220
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:49,131
He's too low-level.

221
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,388
He knew nothing.

222
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:52,874
This is the man who knows things.

223
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,762
Anatoli Knyazev.

224
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:56,857
He's Russian.

225
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:58,599
Contracts all over the globe,

226
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,097
but he's based out
of the port of Gotham.

227
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,833
Weapons and human trafficking.

228
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,985
So the White Portuguese is a Russian.

229
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,219
That's the theory.

230
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,930
No.

231
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:10,258
The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

232
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,332
If he is, indeed,

233
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:13,518
a him.

234
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:17,598
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

235
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,730
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

236
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,671
High-stakes round.

237
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:27,653
New rules.

238
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,978
We're criminals, Alfred.

239
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,553
We've always been criminals.

240
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:34,568
Nothing's changed.

241
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,106
Yes it has, sir.

242
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:40,815
Everything's changed.

243
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,746
Men fall from the sky.

244
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,400
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

245
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,032
Innocents die.

246
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,512
That's how it starts, sir.

247
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,234
The fever.

248
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:00,199
The rage.

249
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,302
The feeling of...

250
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,182
powerlessness.

251
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,808
It turns good men...

252
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,151
cruel.

253
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,934
John get, D.

254
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,096
I did not know you were here.

255
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:27,937
Man on the marquee.
Stop, don't believe it.

256
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,573
My father named the company
after himself.

257
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:31,509
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
Hi, how are you doing?

258
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,038
Really great.

259
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,829
Really great?

260
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:34,982
Good. Good.

261
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,918
Follow me.

262
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,548
Now my Dad started,

263
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,931
saying that he named the company,

264
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,650
after his kid at investor pitches.

265
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:42,892
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

266
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:44,142
Write checks for Lex.

267
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,591
You know, Dad was born
in East Germany.

268
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,033
He grew up eating stale crackers.

269
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,618
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

270
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,197
and wave flowers at tyrants.

271
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,198
So,

272
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,545
I think it was providence that his son,

273
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:58,576
me,

274
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,789
would end up with this.

275
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,368
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

276
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,774
Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.

277
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,385
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

278
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:08,552
Homeland security?

279
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,225
No, no, no, ma'am,

280
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,794
planetary security.

281
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:14,439
The fragment is of
a radioactive xenomineral.

282
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,870
We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,

283
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,151
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

284
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:23,677
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

285
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:26,940
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

286
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,308
this happened.

287
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:31,215
Profound biodegradation.

288
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,531
Decaying Kryptonian cells.

289
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:35,439
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

290
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,740
if a large enough sample was found.

291
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:37,820
And then,

292
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,297
among the fishes, a whale.

293
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,657
Lying at the bottom
of the Indian Ocean.

294
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,479
Emerald City.

295
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,903
Beautiful.

296
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,919
Now Rocky is radioactive,

297
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:51,604
but what he needs from you

298
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:53,332
is an import license.

299
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:56,173
And why would we want
to weaponize this material?

300
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:57,040
As a deterrent.

301
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:59,779
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

302
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,139
so the day does not come, madam,

303
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,560
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

304
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,316
Last I looked, the only one of those

305
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,058
flying around up here was Superman.

306
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,823
Yes. Superman.

307
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,172
Yeah, but there are...

308
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,295
There are more of them.

309
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,774
The metahuman thesis.

310
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,050
Yes, the metahuman thesis.

311
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:15,556
More likely than not.

312
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:17,798
These exceptional
beings live among us.

313
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,964
The basis of our myths.

314
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,647
Gods among men upon our...

315
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,919
little blue planet here.

316
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,111
Now, you don't have
to use a silver bullet.

317
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:27,769
But if you forge one...

318
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,573
Well, then...

319
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,875
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

320
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,351
There are ways,

321
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,110
we can help each other.

322
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,750
Would you step into my office here?

323
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,448
Yes.

324
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,032
What's your wish list?

325
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:57,293
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

326
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,189
Done.

327
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,233
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

328
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,468
You want Zod's body?

329
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Ok.

330
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,208
It's cherry.

331
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,873
<i>Because the time has come</i>

332
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,093
<i>for the world to hear
the other side of the story.</i>

333
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,591
<i>They say that Superman is a hero.
Ok, but whose hero?</i>

334
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:52,210
<i>If Superman were here, right now,</i>

335
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:53,611
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

336

Sir, get down.

00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:23,218
Sir, I said get down!

343
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,343
Now!

344
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,553
Can we get some backup here?

345
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,080
Hey! Hey!

346
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,356
Don't do it!

347
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:32,204

00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,940
Don't let them take your lunch money.

358

Ok.

No, she's been gone.

What'd she do, officer?

I'm not a cop.

I'm a reporter.

381

The young lady living here...

382
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,473
She hasn't been back.

383
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:28,098
In fact if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

384

386

Unless you want to run into him.

Don't listen to that nonsense.

388
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,037
Only people scared of him,

389
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:37,836
people who got reason to be.

390

Scared of who?

391
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,145
Well there is a new kind
of mean in him.

392
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,354
He is angry.

393
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,894
And he's hunting.

394
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,793
Show them what you got!

Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

401

Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,
that line was all she taught me.

Not all, I'm sure.

403
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:53,136
Good evening.

404
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,911
It's like a one-man reign of terror.

405
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,985
This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

406
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,697
and the adjacent projects
and tenements.

407
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,039
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,360
Poor people don't buy papers?

People don't buy papers period Kent.

415
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,917
Perry, when you assign a story,

416
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,796
you're making a choice
about who matters.

417
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,066
And who's worth it.

418
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,310
Good morning, Smallville.

419
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,678
The American conscience died,

420
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,741

421
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:33,549
Sorry. I'm sorry.

422
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,699
No match.

423
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:38,161
My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

424
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,542
It's called a bullet.

425
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:41,937
You shoot people with them.

426
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,533
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.

427
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:47,079
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

428

even black market.

429
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,037
So?

430
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,679
So who gave prototype military rounds

431
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,080
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

432
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:54,228
You're the reporter. Tell me.

433
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,254
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels

434
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:58,339
while claiming to support
the elected government.

435
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,819
The Ask, Lois.

436
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:06,515
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

437
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,044
Go.

438
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,489
Coach. No extra legroom.

439
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,230
Economy plus.

440
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,322
Coach!

441
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:19,161
So, why didn't you tell me?

442
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,414
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

443
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,704
It's kind of dangerous.

444
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,911
That is why I didn't tell you.

445
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:29,978
Lane, don't you have a plane to catch?

446
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:31,944
Yes, sir.

447
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,579
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

448
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,581
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

449
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:42,073
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

450
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:53,710
Senator.

451
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,199
Little bourbon before lunch?

452
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:58,571
My driver's outside.
I can't stay.

453
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,908
No bourbon?

454
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,962
Kentucky girl like yourself?

455
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,008
My dad always said that,

456
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:08,951
Kentucky mash was
the secret to health.

457
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:13,340
This was his room.

458
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,052
I kept it just the same.

459
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,630
Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same.

460
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,894
That is silly.

461
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,269
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

462
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,234
I'm blocking the import license
for your mineral.

463
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,952
The redcapes are coming.

464
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:48,197
The redcapes are coming.

465
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,724
You and your hearings.

466
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,405
Galloping through
the streets to warn us.

467
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:04,001
One if by land,

468
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,075
two if by air.

469
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:14,657
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

470
00:42:15,508 --> 00:42:16,319
Can I call you June?

471
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,899
You can call me whatever you like.

472
00:42:19,111 --> 00:42:21,892
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.

473
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:26,258
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

474
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,053
You won't fool a fly or me.

475
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,353
I'm not gonna drink it.

476
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,755
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

477
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,690
If I changed just...

478
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:46,099
Just one thing in this room?

479
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,052
Because,

480
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:50,636
that should be upside-down.

481
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,631
We know better now, don't we?

482
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,965
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

483
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,713
No, they come from the sky.

484
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,739
I hope the next generation of Waynes

485
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,810
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

486
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,477
Not that there is likely
to be a next generation.

487
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,006
Thank you, sir.

488
00:45:13,174 --> 00:45:16,325
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

489
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,319
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

490
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,379
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

491
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:25,517
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

492
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:29,210
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

493
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,490
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

494
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:35,599
Regardless, I'll need
to put a leech at his house,

495
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,749
and I'm gonna need the suit.

496
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,219
The Bat interrogated six people

497
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,972
and came away with nothing.

498
00:45:42,688 --> 00:45:45,138
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

499
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,171
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

500
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,773
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

501
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,319
He's been invited.

502
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,582
Who's that?

503
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,369
You must be new
to the let them eat cake beat.

504
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,879
That is Bruce Wayne.

505
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,116
<i>Philanthropist,</i>

506
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:16,216
<i>bibliophile.</i>

507
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:19,238
<i>True friend of the Library of Metropolis.</i>

508
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:20,781
<i>Mr. Lex Luthor.</i>

509
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Me?

510
00:47:22,664 --> 00:47:23,664
Ok.

511
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,570
Nicky.

512
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,352
<i>You're embarrassing me.</i>

513
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:33,675
<i>Speech, speech.</i>

514
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,800
<i>Open bar.</i>

515
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:40,204
<i>The end.</i>

516
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,993
<i>The word philanthropist
comes from the Greek.</i>

517
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,098
<i>Meaning a lover of humanity.</i>

518
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:51,210
<i>It was coined about 2,500 years ago.</i>

519
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,038
Alright. Where am I going, Alfred?

520
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,591
Go past the elevator.

521
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:56,396
Do a left.

522
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,535
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

523
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,511
<i>It's in the service corridor
in the basement.</i>

524
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:02,680
<i>Go down the stairs.</i>

525
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,121
<i>Gods and men.</i>

526
00:48:04,123 --> 00:48:05,495
<i>Prometheus went with us.</i>

527
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:08,557
<i>And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,</i>

528
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,959
<i>and for that he was given a thunderbolt.</i>

529
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,021
<i>That seems unfair.</i>

530
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,451
<i>On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...</i>

531
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,071
Go to the stairs.
You saw them on your way in.

532
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:18,819
<i>Down the stairs.</i>

533
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,371
<i>But at one time, Dad could not buy them.</i>

534
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,259
<i>No. My father could not
afford books growing up.</i>

535
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,660
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

536
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,980
Alright.
You got the kitchens on your right.

537
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,906
<i>Do a left.</i>

538
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

539
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,677
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

540
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,461
I just...

541
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:57,460
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

542
00:48:58,259 --> 00:48:59,898
That last martini was...

543
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:01,617
two too many, I think.

544
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,181
Men's room is upstairs.

545
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:04,575
Great. I'm ok.

546
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,918
I like those shoes.

547
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,714
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

548
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:15,358
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

549
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,164
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

550
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,954
In your dreams, Alfred.

551
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,719
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

552
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,237
<i>and knowledge is power,</i>

553
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:26,777
<i>and I am...</i>

554
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,400
<i>No. I...</i>

555
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:31,171
<i>No. What am I? I...
What was I saying?</i>

556
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,377
<i>No.</i>

557
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,933
<i>The bittersweet pain among men,</i>

558
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:37,846
<i>is having knowledge with no power,</i>

559
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:38,684
<i>because...</i>

560
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:41,922
<i>Because that is paradoxical!
And...</i>

561
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,151
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

562
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,910
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

563
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,803
Mr. Wayne?

564
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:01,187
Mr. Wayne?

565
00:50:02,037 --> 00:50:03,263
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

566
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,142
My foundation has already
issued a statement in support of...

567
00:50:06,576 --> 00:50:07,238
books.

568
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,011
Sir?

569
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:12,769
Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. Alright?

570
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,160
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

571
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,198
Daily Planet. Do I own this one?

572
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,247
Or is that the other guy?

573
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,471
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

574
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:24,620
Good people are living in fear.

575
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:29,236
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

576
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,079
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.

577
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,314
He thinks he's above the law.

578
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:39,865
The Daily Planet criticizing those
who think they're above the laws

579
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,461
is a little hypocritical,

580
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:43,003
would not you say?

581
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:46,419
Considering every time your hero
saves a cat out of a tree,

582
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,270
you write a puff piece editorial,

583
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,126
about an alien who,

584
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:53,108
if he wanted to could burn
the whole place down.

585
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,316
There would not be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

586
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,531
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

587
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,637
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

588
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:05,229
We just...

589
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:08,563
have a bad history with
freaks dressed like clowns.

590
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,508
Boys!

591
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:14,331
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent.

592
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:17,014
I love it. I love bringing people together.

593
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,876
How are we?

594
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,699
Lex.
Hello. Good.

595
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,061
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.

596
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:23,641
That is a good grip!

597
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:25,432
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

598
00:51:26,629 --> 00:51:29,178
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

599
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:30,779
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

600
00:51:30,802 --> 00:51:31,718
Well, you're welcome.

601
00:51:31,742 --> 00:51:32,918
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

602
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,080
I'd love to show you my labs.

603
00:51:34,082 --> 00:51:35,974
Maybe we could partner on something.

604
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,330
My R and D is up
to all sorts of no good.

605
00:51:43,473 --> 00:51:44,840
That's seven minutes.

606
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,831
<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>

607
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,709
Mr. Luthor.
Yes?

608
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:50,288
The governor.
Governor.

609
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,139
Excuse me.
Next time.

610
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,485
Governor! Hi!

611
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,277
Lex, it's good to see you.

612
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Excuse me.

613
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:43,348
<i>We, as a population on this planet,</i>

614
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,853
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

615
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:47,317
<i>90% of people believe in a higher power,</i>

616
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:50,748
<i>every religion believes
in some sort of messianic figure.</i>

617
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:53,693
<i>And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,</i>

618
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,042
<i>we want to make him abide by our rules?</i>

619
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:58,251
<i>We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.</i>

620
00:53:58,346 --> 00:54:00,735
<i>We have to start thinking
beyond politics.</i>

621
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,480
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

622
00:54:03,566 --> 00:54:05,342
<i>We have international law.</i>

623
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,619
<i>On this Earth, every act
is a political act.</i>

624
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:10,525
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

625
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:12,690
<i>that the most powerful man in the world</i>

626
00:54:13,092 --> 00:54:15,534
<i>should be a figure of controversy?</i>

627
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,388
<i>To have an individual engaging</i>

628
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,084
<i>in these state-level interventions</i>

629
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,533
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

630
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,417
<i>Human beings have a horrible track record</i>

631
00:54:25,419 --> 00:54:27,734
<i>of following people with great power</i>

632
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,031
<i>down paths that led
to huge human atrocities.</i>

633
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,892
<i>We have always
created icons in our own image.</i>

634
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,310
<i>What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.</i>

635
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,097
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

636
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,430
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.</i>

637
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,690
<i>We're talking about
a being whose very existence</i>

638
00:54:46,898 --> 00:54:49,679
<i>challenges our own sense of priority,</i>

639
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:50,978
<i>in the universe.</i>

640
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,283
<i>And you go back to Copernicus where</i>

641
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:55,813
<i>he restored the Sun
in the center of the known universe,</i>

642
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:57,114
<i>displacing Earth.</i>

643
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,262
<i>And you get to Darwinian evolution,</i>

644
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:01,405
<i>and you find out we're not special
on this Earth,</i>

645
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:03,848
<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

646
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:05,226
<i>And now we learn,</i>

647
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:09,575
<i>that we're not even special in the entire
universe because there is Superman.</i>

648
00:55:10,313 --> 00:55:11,347
<i>There he is.</i>

649
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,526
<i>An alien among us.</i>

650
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,155
<i>We're not alone.</i>

651
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,419
<i>Are you, as a United States senator,</i>

652
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,198
<i>personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,</i>

653
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,186
<i>Superman could have saved your child,</i>

654
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,822
<i>but on principle,</i>

655
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:30,400
<i>we did not want him to act.</i>

656
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,312
<i>I'm not saying he should not act.</i>

657
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,465
<i>I'm saying he should not
act unilaterally.</i>

658
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:36,376
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

659
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,208
<i>Must there be a Superman?</i>

660
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:42,504
<i>There is.</i>

661
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:56,597
Hello?

662
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,624
<i>Mom?</i>

663
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,922
Clark!

664
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,518
What is it?

665
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:02,489
What's wrong?

666
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:05,021
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

667
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,273
Hi.

668
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:12,480
Hi.

669
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,998
How come Dad never left Kansas?

670
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,240
Well, he just...

671
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,867
You know how he was.

672
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,237
What do I need to travel for?

673
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,773
I'm already there.

674
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,978
Just wish it was more simple.

675
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,073
My baby boy.

676
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,275
Nothing was ever simple.

677
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:50,416
An odd little duck.

678
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,600
I've never seen a metal like this.

679
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,152
Could be DARPA black box.

680
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,833
Who could find out?

681
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,379
Nobody who'd want to.

682
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:06,722
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

683
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,912
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

684
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:12,370
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

685
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:14,660
Stuff like this still shocks you.

686
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,089
It don't come off!

687
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:39,712
It don't come off!

688
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,853
Prisoner transfer!

689
00:57:42,372 --> 00:57:44,634
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

690
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,936
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

691
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,696
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

692
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,393
for taking in your branded ass.

693
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:50,395
Sign here, please.

694
00:57:50,397 --> 00:57:52,156
I'm marked, man. You know what they
do to people with this on them?

695
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,118
He's only a criminal.

696
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,005
This way! Let's go!
They're gonna kill me!

697
00:57:55,186 --> 00:57:57,364
They're gonna kill me!
Let's go! Let's go!

698
00:57:57,544 --> 00:57:59,423
Keefe. You made bail.

699
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,795
Open two.

700
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,669
Who paid?

701
00:58:19,988 --> 00:58:21,387
Who the hell are you?

702
00:58:26,948 --> 00:58:27,948
Just a man.

703
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,857
Yeah?

704
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:30,592
Well, what the fuck do you want?

705
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,380
To help you stand for something.

706
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,553
Your three o'clock's here.

707
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,825
He made me,

708
00:58:55,256 --> 00:58:56,426
half a man.

709
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,275
My wife,

710
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:02,010
walked out on me.

711
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:07,112
I can't even piss standing up.

712
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,793
Let me face him.

713
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,154
You'll take care of it?

714
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,012
Good.

715
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,795
What?

716
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,793
Wrong room, miss.

717
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:06,360
Secretary Swanwick, you haven't
been returning my phone calls.

718
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,308
Miss Lane,

719
01:00:09,676 --> 01:00:10,739
if you'd like an interview,

720
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,729
Major Farris is just outside that door.

721
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,871
You're treating me like a stranger?

722
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,112
I'm treating you like a reporter.

723
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,589
Alright.

724
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:23,479
Is the US providing experimental
military arms to rebels in Africa?

725
01:00:24,174 --> 01:00:25,799
You know, with balls like yours,

726
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,901
you belong in here.

727
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:29,908
What's your source on this?

728
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:31,309
A tin foil hat?

729
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,220
No, not tin.

730
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:34,202
But it's metal.

731
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:35,730
Fired in the Superman incident.

732
01:00:35,824 --> 01:00:37,976
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.

733
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:39,477
We haven't been told the truth.

734
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,455
Here's the truth.

735
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,440
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she should not have.

736
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,850
Superman acted like some...

737
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,298
rogue combatant to rescue her,
and people died.

738
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:50,919
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

739
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,389
Or yours.

740
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:56,013
Major.
Sir.

741
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,094
So...

742
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,537
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

743
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,459
There's copy alright.

744
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,587
But nothing about football.
Nothing about...

745
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:10,179
friends of the Metropolis Library, just...

746
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,479
the goddamn Gotham Bat thing,

747
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:15,719
I told you not to pursue.

748
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,160
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

749
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,841
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

750
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,054
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

751
01:01:22,056 --> 01:01:25,845
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

752
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:29,245
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

753
01:01:29,455 --> 01:01:32,333
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

754
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,438
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

755
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,352
<i>So apparently Superman</i>

756
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,908
<i>doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.</i>

757
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,154
<i>And really why would we?</i>

758
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,172
<i>I mean aside from the red
and blue costume and...</i>

759
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:51,430
<i>I don't know, the fact that he has one-third
of the USA's initials on his chest.</i>

760
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:55,335
<i>I assume the only reason he's not wearing
the Declaration of Independence as a cape, is...</i>

761
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,479
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

762
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,164
What is going on back here?
No.

763
01:01:59,179 --> 01:02:00,693
Guys, come on. Let's go.

764
01:02:00,786 --> 01:02:02,352
Get yourselves together and get out there.

765
01:02:02,477 --> 01:02:03,711
Get those glasses on those trays.

766
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:05,312
We got thirsty people out there.

767
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:15,644
I wonder, would you excuse us?

768
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:17,525
There's something I'd like to show you.
I'm sorry.

769
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,837
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened.

770
01:02:22,148 --> 01:02:23,831
But I believe it's the action

771
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:28,091
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

772
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,429
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

773
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,772
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

774
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,126
It's the Sword of Alexander.

775
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,273
It's the blade that cut
the Gordian knot.

776
01:02:45,781 --> 01:02:47,100
It's a triumph.

777
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,195
Yes.

778
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,950
Enjoy.
Thank you.

779
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:58,963
It's a fake.

780
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,994
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

781
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,438
And now it hangs...

782
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,540
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

783
01:03:08,966 --> 01:03:10,135
Excuse me.

784
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,209
Excuse me, miss.

785
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:16,791
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

786
01:03:17,037 --> 01:03:18,436
Stealing's not polite.

787
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,968
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

788
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,639
Who are you?

789
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:28,017
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

790
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,140
Is that right?

791
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:33,676
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

792
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:34,906
Did you get it?

793
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,240
As it happens, no I didn't.

794
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,718
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

795
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,580
You know, I bet with that dress,

796
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,033
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

797
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,628
But you're the 10th?

798
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,699
I'm guessing I'm the first

799
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,491
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

800
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,090
You don't know me,

801
01:03:56,618 --> 01:03:58,410
but I've known a few women like you.

802
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,009
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

803
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:08,694
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

804
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,129
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

805
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,220
I didn't steal your drive.

806
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:16,478
I borrowed it.

807
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,512
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

808
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:23,024
Mr. Wayne.

809
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,394
Did you get it?

810
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,560
The rock?

811
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,948
Yeah, we got it.

812
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,034
I'm sorry.

813
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,859
Get down!

814
01:06:50,384 --> 01:06:51,694
Get down now!

815
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,595
No!

816
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,193
She was my world.

817
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,871
And you took her from me.

818
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
<i>Bruce!</i>

819
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:23,743
<i>Listen to me now!</i>

820
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,074
<i>It's Lois!</i>

821
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,334
<i>It's Lois Lane!</i>

822
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,988
<i>She's the key!</i>

823
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,279
<i>Am I too soon?</i>

824
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,273
<i>I'm too soon!</i>

825
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,364
<i>You're right about him!</i>

826
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,480
<i>You've always been right about him!</i>

827
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,115
<i>Fear him! Fear him!</i>

828
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,364
<i>Find us, Bruce!</i>

829
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,752
<i>You have to find us!</i>

830
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,838
The White Portuguese is not a man.

831
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:01,445
It's a ship.

832
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:04,877
Master Wayne,

833
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,280
since the age of seven,

834
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:11,508
you have been to the art of deception
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

835
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,217
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

836
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,791
The White Portuguese,

837
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:20,719
is not carrying a dirty bomb.

838
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,119
What is it carrying?

839
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,474
It's a weapon.

840
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,772
It's a rock.

841
01:11:27,155 --> 01:11:30,478
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

842
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:32,499
The first sample big enough
to mean something

843
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,579
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

844
01:11:34,852 --> 01:11:36,639
It is now aboard
the White Portuguese

845
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,515
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

846
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,550
Who I am going to steal it from.

847
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,417
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

848
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,079
To destroy it.

849
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,404
No.

850
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,005
You're gonna go to war?

851
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,159
That son of a bitch
brought the war,

852
01:11:54,161 --> 01:11:56,538
to us two years ago.

853
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,696
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.

854
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:01,440
Thousands of people.

855
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,716
What's next?

856
01:12:04,206 --> 01:12:05,108
Millions?

857
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,639
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

858
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,178
and if we believe there is even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

859
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,330
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

860
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,393
And we have to destroy him.

861
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,230
But he is not our enemy.

862
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,063
Not today.

863
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,817
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

864
01:12:23,737 --> 01:12:25,648
We've seen what promises are worth.

865
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,192
How many good guys are left.

866
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,278
How many stayed that way.

867
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,753
14 hours.

868
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,198
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the Daily Planet.

869
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,679
I'm trying to find out what
happened to an inmate,

870
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,749
a Santos.

871
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,758
I can't give out that information.

872
01:13:08,269 --> 01:13:09,805
Mommy!

873
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,314
Mrs. Santos?

874
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,846
May I ask you a few questions?

875
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,741
He wasn't my husband.

876
01:13:20,166 --> 01:13:21,500
But I know what he did.

877
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,473
But he was a father.

878
01:13:24,898 --> 01:13:26,222
He was that, too.

879
01:13:27,016 --> 01:13:28,737
They took him out of Gotham Central.

880
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,297
They moved him to Metropolis.

881
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,312
But inside they know.

882
01:13:32,644 --> 01:13:34,999
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

883
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,399
Bat's the judge.

884
01:13:37,468 --> 01:13:39,299
One man decides who lives.

885
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,318
How is that justice?
Talk to me.

886
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,075
Help me change it.
With what? Your pen?

887
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,995
A man like that, words don't stop him.

888
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,394
You know what stops him?

889
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:50,757
A fist.

890
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,880
Kent, I want to talk to you.

891
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,824
Kent!

892
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,469
Where does he go?

893
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:02,617
Where does he go, Jenny?

894
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,023
I don't. I don't know.

895
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,432
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

896
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,434
Son of a...

897
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,896
Turn it!

898
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,126
Turn it!

899
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,847
Move out!

900
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,640
Go, go, go, go!

901
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,674
No!

902
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,828
Where is he?

903
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:15,918
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

904
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,675
don't go to it.

905
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,614
The Bat is dead.

906
01:19:20,099 --> 01:19:20,975
Bury it.

907
01:19:22,405 --> 01:19:23,679
Consider this mercy.

908
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,966
Tell me.

909
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,993
Do you bleed?

910
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,039
You will.

911
01:21:25,459 --> 01:21:28,153
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

912
01:21:28,688 --> 01:21:30,438
I went into the desert, people died.

913
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:32,130
It keeps me awake. It should.

914
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,969
If you think that Superman is a murderer,
then throw it away.

915
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,490
But I don't believe you think that.

916
01:21:47,016 --> 01:21:48,889
<i>How do we determine what's good?</i>

917
01:21:50,059 --> 01:21:51,429
<i>In a democracy,</i>

918
01:21:51,431 --> 01:21:52,862
<i>good is a conversation,</i>

919
01:21:52,864 --> 01:21:54,484
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

920
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,170
<i>So I urge Superman,</i>

921
01:21:57,387 --> 01:21:59,598
<i>to come to this Hill
of the People tomorrow,</i>

922
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,919
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

923
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:05,313
<i>The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.</i>

924
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,706
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

925
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,670
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

926
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,967
<i>Does he act by our will,</i>

927
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,053
<i>or by his own?</i>

928
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,753
People hate what
they don't understand.

929
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,463
But they see what you do,

930
01:22:30,465 --> 01:22:32,230
and they know who you are.

931
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,840
You're not a killer,

932
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:36,796
a threat.

933
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,751
I never wanted this world
to have you.

934
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,800
Be their hero, Clark.

935
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:49,017
Be their monument.
Be their angel.

936
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:51,308
Be anything they need you to be.

937
01:22:52,682 --> 01:22:53,907
Or be none of it.

938
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:57,596
You don't owe this world a thing.

939
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:00,277
You never did.

940
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,498
<i>This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.</i>

941
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,913
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

942
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,983
I have to speak to the senator today.

943
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,496
You cannot see the senator today.

944
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,359
I need to speak to her
before the hearing.

945
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,959
Do you understand
how important this is?

946
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,496
I cannot let you see the senator.

947
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,112
Please, I need to speak to her.

948
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,278
Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!

949
01:23:51,617 --> 01:23:52,891
This is so important!

950
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:54,573
Come with me.
Don't touch me!

951
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,468
Please!
I'm sorry. She would not leave.

952
01:23:59,443 --> 01:24:01,156
I didn't tell you the truth.

953
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,071
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

954
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,077
Somebody wanted Superman
to look guilty.

955
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:10,415
The bullet?

956
01:24:18,144 --> 01:24:20,276
The metal was developed
by a private company.

957
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:21,455
What company?

958
01:24:21,581 --> 01:24:22,500
LexCorp.

959
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:25,058
Lex Luthor?

960
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,072
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

961
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,719
Go on record.

962
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,324
Not a chance.

963
01:24:35,749 --> 01:24:37,095
It's classified.

964
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,174
I happen to like my job.

965
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,409
It doesn't make sense.

966
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,491
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

967
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:44,363
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

968
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,757
In the middle of the desert.
Thank you.

969
01:24:57,349 --> 01:25:00,959
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

970
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,278
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

971
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,491
will Superman show up?

972
01:25:04,493 --> 01:25:06,556
That is what they're really
waiting to see. Mr. Keefe?

973
01:25:06,558 --> 01:25:08,771
Mr. Keefe? Soledad O'Brien,
In the Moment.

974
01:25:08,773 --> 01:25:09,842
Quick question for you.

975
01:25:09,862 --> 01:25:11,418
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

976
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:12,848
What will you tell them?

977
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,438
<i>I've come here to tell them to wake up.</i>

978
01:25:16,059 --> 01:25:17,462
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

979
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,733
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

980
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,840
<i>And this...</i>

981
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,415
<i>This is what war looks like.</i>

982
01:25:23,612 --> 01:25:24,710
<i>I have nothing.</i>

983
01:25:24,838 --> 01:25:27,939
<i>There are plenty of people sir,
who would say he's their hero.</i>

984
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,496
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

985
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,551
Grace,

986
01:25:31,023 --> 01:25:32,495
can you get Greg up here, please?

987
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,580
Right now.

988
01:25:34,659 --> 01:25:36,404
An anonymous source can verify

989
01:25:36,406 --> 01:25:38,557
everything I told you
about what happened in Nairomi.

990
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:40,399
An anonymous source?

991
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:41,036
<i>Run it.</i>

992
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,030
Luthor engineered the desert.

993
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,033
It was an ambush for Superman.

994
01:25:45,317 --> 01:25:47,173
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

995
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:48,844
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

996
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:51,376
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i>

997
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,800
<i>You need proof.</i>

998
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,478
No. It needs to run now.

999
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,639
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

1000
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,538
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

1001
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,642
I am not going to risk the paper,

1002
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,639
so that you can pass notes in class

1003
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,834
to the man that rescued you.

1004
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,294
He paid her?

1005
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,862
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

1006
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,593
Gave her a script to learn.

1007
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:11,577
Her parents are alive back home.

1008
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,837
But the girl's got a conscience.

1009
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,640
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

1010
01:26:16,642 --> 01:26:17,526
Senator!

1011
01:26:17,838 --> 01:26:18,851
Hi, you.

1012
01:26:19,637 --> 01:26:21,036
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

1013
01:26:21,038 --> 01:26:21,886
You know what?

1014
01:26:21,888 --> 01:26:24,395
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

1015
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:26,096
So what you been up to?

1016
01:26:26,144 --> 01:26:27,460
I'm just here to tell my story.

1017
01:26:27,462 --> 01:26:29,638
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

1018
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,474
but a certain junior senator from
Kentucky decided to block it.

1019
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,799
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

1020
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,839
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

1021
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:39,773
He is, Mr. Wayne.

1022
01:26:39,846 --> 01:26:41,501
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

1023
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,195
He returns them.

1024
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,549
Jesus.

1025
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:55,038
Why haven't I seen this?

1026
01:26:55,172 --> 01:26:56,972
I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

1027
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,279
<i>And there he is. Superman is here.</i>

1028
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,342
<i>He is actually at the United States Capitol.</i>

1029
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:04,618
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

1030
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,869
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i>

1031
01:27:06,871 --> 01:27:08,921
<i>some kind of a statement
to the Senate,</i>

1032
01:27:08,926 --> 01:27:11,669
<i>to the American people,
and of course, to the world.</i>

1033
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,754
He's here. He came.

1034
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,458
He's above the Capitol.

1035
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,359
You are gonna be on the hot
seat in there, Junebug.

1036
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,674
I grew up on a farm.

1037
01:27:20,676 --> 01:27:22,492
I know how to wrestle a pig.

1038
01:27:22,775 --> 01:27:24,700
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

1039
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,980
It's that power can be innocent.

1040
01:27:30,462 --> 01:27:31,577
Good luck.

1041
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,797
Oh, miss...

1042
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,256
Rudy, she's good to go.

1043
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,955
Get out!

1044
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,034
Get out! Get out!
Superman! Superman!

1045
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,080
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

1046
01:29:15,043 --> 01:29:18,080
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

1047
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:20,012
for coming before us today.

1048
01:29:21,407 --> 01:29:23,270
This is how a democracy works.

1049
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:25,530
We talk to each other.

1050
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,978
We act,

1051
01:29:28,315 --> 01:29:30,652
by the consent of the governed, sir.

1052
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,008
I have sat here before,

1053
01:29:34,048 --> 01:29:35,675
to say that shadow interventions

1054
01:29:35,677 --> 01:29:37,477
will not be tolerated by this committee.

1055
01:29:38,692 --> 01:29:40,127
Neither will lies.

1056
01:29:41,915 --> 01:29:43,134
Because today,

1057
01:29:43,714 --> 01:29:45,322
is a day for truth.

1058
01:29:47,187 --> 01:29:48,825
Because only by speaking...

1059
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:01,655
Only by working,

1060
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:03,620
together can we...

1061
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:10,699
Can we... Can we...

1062
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,484
Can...

1063
01:30:22,446 --> 01:30:24,530
we create a free and a...

1064
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,200
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1065
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,956
<i>We're back at the nation's Capitol,</i>

1066
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,599
<i>where something is happening.</i>

1067
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,520
Excuse me.

1068
01:31:43,053 --> 01:31:44,241
Excuse me, officer.

1069
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,694
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

1070
01:31:55,429 --> 01:31:57,218
Breathe slowly and deeply.

1071
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,957
You're gonna be fine.

1072
01:32:06,245 --> 01:32:07,561
Thank you.

1073
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:10,240
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

1074
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,170
Ma'am, it appears
you've suffered a head injury.

1075
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,040
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

1076
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,153
Master Wayne.

1077
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,072
Mr. Wayne!

1078
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,603
<i>In the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.</i>

1079
01:33:19,605 --> 01:33:22,433
<i>This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.</i>

<i>have died in this explosion.</i>

1085

<i>Now initially,</i>

1086
01:33:32,226 --> 01:33:35,539
<i>Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,</i>

1087
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:37,592
<i>but he seems to have disappeared,</i>

1088
01:33:37,847 --> 01:33:39,216

Can you enhance that?

1095
01:34:16,928 --> 01:34:18,079
There you go, sir.

1100
01:35:05,513 --> 01:35:07,779
<i>that explosive device into the hearing</i>

<i>As for Superman he was in the room,</i>

<i>but obviously failed to stop him.</i>

1104
01:35:13,612 --> 01:35:14,801
I didn't see it, Lo.

1105
01:35:15,889 --> 01:35:17,551
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1106
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,593
Clark, there are people behind this.

1107
01:35:19,595 --> 01:35:21,778
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1108
01:35:25,188 --> 01:35:26,349
All this time,

1109
01:35:27,451 --> 01:35:29,634
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1110

Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1111
01:35:35,515 --> 01:35:37,079
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1112
01:35:41,555 --> 01:35:43,282
Superman was never real.

1113
01:35:44,581 --> 01:35:46,575
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1114
01:35:48,386 --> 01:35:50,919
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

It's all that gives them hope.

1116
01:36:05,123 --> 01:36:06,671
This means something.

1117
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,671

And where is the Council of Krypton?

1148
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,554
<i>Destroyed, sir.</i>

1149
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,896
Then proceed.

1150
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,643
<i>Very well.</i>

1151
01:41:41,535 --> 01:41:44,208
<i>Preparing chrysalis
and commencing metamorphosis.</i>

1152
01:41:47,122 --> 01:41:48,864
So we are left to wonder

1153
01:41:48,926 --> 01:41:51,913
if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,

1154
01:41:52,097 --> 01:41:55,209
was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?

1155
01:41:55,659 --> 01:41:56,624
Still no Kent?

1156
01:41:56,626 --> 01:41:58,228
His disappearance raises questions.

1157
01:41:58,881 --> 01:41:59,530
No.

1158
01:41:59,858 --> 01:42:01,758
<i>There are still so many
unanswered questions.</i>

1159
01:42:01,898 --> 01:42:03,760
<i>Chief among them, whether Superman</i>

1160
01:42:03,762 --> 01:42:05,714
<i>was involved in the planning
of this attack.</i>

1161
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:08,369
<i>I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power,</i>

1162
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:11,314
<i>yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.</i>

1163
01:42:11,316 --> 01:42:13,263
<i>It just doesn't add up for investigators.</i>

1164
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,736
<i>Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>

1165
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,457
<i>Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>

1166
01:42:40,614 --> 01:42:42,039
For 20 American,

1167
01:42:42,525 --> 01:42:43,751
he didn't see you.

1168
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:45,298
Same for me.

1169
01:42:57,114 --> 01:43:00,346
<i>Now one FBI official
familiar with this case</i>

1170
01:43:00,348 --> 01:43:01,952
<i>told me they found quote.</i>

1171
01:43:01,954 --> 01:43:05,790
<i>A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment.</i>

1172
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:07,278
<i>What they need to determine now</i>

1173
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,426
<i>is whether he had
any help in the planning</i>

1174
01:43:09,428 --> 01:43:10,940
<i>and execution of the bombing.</i>

1175
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:15,574
<i>And they haven't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.</i>

1176
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,759
<i>Now my sources are telling me</i>

1177
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,789
<i>they are getting a barrage
of anonymous and credible tips</i>

1178
01:43:21,018 --> 01:43:23,205
<i>with all roads in this investigation</i>

1179
01:43:23,386 --> 01:43:25,789
<i>leading to the Kryptonian visitor.</i>

1180
01:44:02,787 --> 01:44:05,017
Alright, Lois. You got to go.

1181
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:23,756
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1182
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,072
He just bought groceries.

1183
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,532
The wheelchair and the bullet from the
desert were made from the same metal.

1184
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,559
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1185
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,233
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1186
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,668
<i>But Luthor goes through all
of that trouble,</i>

1187
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:40,752
creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1188
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,166
What do you mean?

1189
01:44:43,052 --> 01:44:45,279
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1190
01:44:47,867 --> 01:44:49,039
You couldn't stop it.

1191
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,761
You couldn't see it.

1192
01:45:34,118 --> 01:45:35,437
Something, isn't it?

1193
01:45:37,566 --> 01:45:39,625
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,

1194
01:45:39,627 --> 01:45:41,134
so we come to the mountains.

1195
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:44,008
All downhill from here,

1196
01:45:44,808 --> 01:45:45,990
down to the floodplain.

1197
01:45:46,732 --> 01:45:48,489
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1198
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:52,404
I remember one season
the water came bad.

1199
01:45:53,358 --> 01:45:54,770
I couldn't have been 12.

1200
01:45:55,408 --> 01:45:57,967
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1201
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,096
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1202
01:46:00,565 --> 01:46:02,176
But we managed to stop the water.

1203
01:46:03,499 --> 01:46:04,838
We saved the farm.

1204
01:46:06,582 --> 01:46:07,981
Your grandma baked me a cake.

1205
01:46:08,522 --> 01:46:09,720
Said I was a hero.

1206
01:46:12,223 --> 01:46:13,657
Later that day we found out,

1207
01:46:15,233 --> 01:46:16,423
we blocked the water alright.

1208
01:46:16,425 --> 01:46:17,644
We sent it upstream.

1209
01:46:18,857 --> 01:46:20,715
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1210
01:46:22,433 --> 01:46:24,958
While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.

1211
01:46:28,296 --> 01:46:30,355
I used to hear
them wailing in my sleep.

1212
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,867
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1213
01:46:38,663 --> 01:46:39,438
Yeah.

1214
01:46:41,047 --> 01:46:42,385
When I met your mother.

1215
01:46:45,019 --> 01:46:47,438
She gave me faith that
there is good in this world.

1216
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,567
She was my world.

1217
01:46:55,293 --> 01:46:56,472
I miss you, son.

1218
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,250
I miss you too, Dad.

1219
01:47:23,535 --> 01:47:25,327
You know you can't win this.

1220
01:47:26,786 --> 01:47:28,378
It's suicide.

1221
01:47:31,273 --> 01:47:33,925
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1222
01:47:36,603 --> 01:47:39,162
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1223
01:47:40,387 --> 01:47:43,984
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1224
01:47:44,419 --> 01:47:46,209
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1225
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:49,330
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1226
01:47:51,493 --> 01:47:53,546
This is about the future of the world.

1227
01:47:55,243 --> 01:47:56,835
This is my legacy.

1228
01:47:58,428 --> 01:48:00,419
My father sat me down right here.

1229
01:48:00,834 --> 01:48:02,743
Told me what Wayne Manor
was built on.

1230
01:48:02,993 --> 01:48:04,893
Railroads, real estates,

1231
01:48:05,357 --> 01:48:06,342
and oil.

1232
01:48:06,553 --> 01:48:07,657
The first generation,

1233
01:48:07,659 --> 01:48:09,631
made their fortune
trading with the French.

1234
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:11,462
Pelts and skins.

1235
01:48:15,607 --> 01:48:16,829
They were hunters.

1236
01:48:33,676 --> 01:48:36,565
So falls the house of Wayne.

1237
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:40,825
<i>We got to wait for more evidence,
but the question still remains,</i>

1238
01:48:41,177 --> 01:48:42,292
<i>where is he?</i>

1239
01:48:42,934 --> 01:48:45,084
<i>If Superman was not involved,</i>

1240
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,979
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i>

1241
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,813
<i>then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?</i>

1242
01:48:50,815 --> 01:48:52,022
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

1243
01:48:52,024 --> 01:48:54,716
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1244
01:48:54,718 --> 01:48:56,271
<i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>

1245
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,321
The night is here.

1246
01:50:57,406 --> 01:50:58,600
Excuse me.

1247
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:02,169
Don't I know...

1248
01:52:05,257 --> 01:52:06,597
Plain Lo in the morning.

1249
01:52:07,639 --> 01:52:08,838
Lola in slacks.

1250
01:52:10,242 --> 01:52:11,285
Lois Lane.

1251
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:14,771
Come see the view.

1252
01:52:17,922 --> 01:52:18,963
Now the secret,

1253
01:52:19,448 --> 01:52:20,423
to the height,

1254
01:52:20,425 --> 01:52:21,893
is the building material.

1255
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:23,635
It's light metals which...

1256
01:52:24,253 --> 01:52:25,884
sway a bit in the wind.

1257
01:52:30,694 --> 01:52:33,343
And you know something about
LexCorp metals don't you Miss Lane?

1258
01:52:34,052 --> 01:52:35,753
I've proven what you've done.

1259
01:52:35,854 --> 01:52:37,226
You're feisty.

1260
01:52:37,949 --> 01:52:39,826
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1261
01:52:40,785 --> 01:52:42,413
Like sand in the desert.

1262
01:52:42,624 --> 01:52:43,912
You're psychotic.

1263
01:52:43,975 --> 01:52:47,350
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.

1264
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:49,819
Next category. Circles.

1265
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,626
Round and round,

1266
01:52:52,762 --> 01:52:54,950
and round they go to find Superman.

1267
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:57,267
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1268
01:52:57,423 --> 01:52:59,019
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1269
01:52:59,021 --> 01:53:02,115
The shortest distance between any
two points is a straight path.

1270
01:53:03,025 --> 01:53:04,700
And I believe the straightest path

1271
01:53:04,702 --> 01:53:05,718
to Superman,

1272
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,512
is a pretty little road...

1273
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,823
called Lois Lane.

1274
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:33,562
You came back.

1275
01:53:34,702 --> 01:53:35,795
You came back.

1276
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,230
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1277
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,666
The problem of,

1278
01:54:02,777 --> 01:54:04,004
of evil in the world.

1279
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:06,499
The problem of absolute virtue.

1280
01:54:06,717 --> 01:54:08,355
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1281
01:54:09,147 --> 01:54:10,471
Which is more than you deserve.

1282
01:54:10,473 --> 01:54:12,653
The problem of you on top
of everything else.

1283
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,149
You above all.

1284
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,392
Because that's what God is.

1285
01:54:17,365 --> 01:54:18,122
Horus.

1286
01:54:18,124 --> 01:54:18,842
Apollo.

1287
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:19,940
Jehovah.

1288
01:54:20,332 --> 01:54:21,121
Kal-El.

1289
01:54:22,816 --> 01:54:23,463
Clark.

1290
01:54:23,865 --> 01:54:24,743
Joseph.

1291
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:25,904
Kent.

1292
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:28,895
See, what we call God

1293
01:54:28,897 --> 01:54:30,612
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1294
01:54:31,678 --> 01:54:34,150
Because God is tribal.
God takes sides.

1295
01:54:34,777 --> 01:54:36,300
No man in the sky intervened

1296
01:54:36,301 --> 01:54:38,822
when I was a boy to deliver me
from Daddy's fist and abominations.

1297
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,357
I figured out way back,

1298
01:54:41,937 --> 01:54:43,265
if God is all-powerful,

1299
01:54:43,768 --> 01:54:45,008
he cannot be all-good.

1300
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,897
And if he is all-good,

1301
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:49,798
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1302
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,042
And neither can you be.

1303
01:54:52,863 --> 01:54:54,999
They need to see the fraud you are.

1304
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,180
With their eyes.

1305
01:54:58,592 --> 01:54:59,471
The blood

1306
01:55:00,071 --> 01:55:01,028
on your hands.

1307
01:55:01,598 --> 01:55:02,624
What have you done?

1308
01:55:03,101 --> 01:55:04,472
And tonight, they will.

1309
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:05,331
Yes.

1310
01:55:05,896 --> 01:55:07,985
Because you, my friend, have a date.

1311
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:10,008
Across the bay.

1312
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,682
Ripe fruit, his hate.

1313
01:55:11,907 --> 01:55:12,979
Two years growing.

1314
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,776
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1315
01:55:14,969 --> 01:55:16,418
Little red notes, big bang.

1316
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:17,893
You let your family die!

1317
01:55:19,185 --> 01:55:21,691
And now you will fly to him.

1318
01:55:22,973 --> 01:55:24,480
And you will battle him.

1319
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,205
To the death.

1320
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,842
Black and blue.

1321
01:55:29,371 --> 01:55:30,473
Fight Night!

1322
01:55:31,318 --> 01:55:34,196
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1323
01:55:34,677 --> 01:55:36,089
God versus man.

1324
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,711
Day versus night.

1325
01:55:39,999 --> 01:55:42,967
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1326
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,983
You think I'll fight him for you?

1327
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:46,732
Yes, I do.

1328
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:49,421
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1329
01:55:50,012 --> 01:55:51,437
She's safe on the ground.

1330
01:55:51,637 --> 01:55:52,590
How about you?

1331
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:55,113
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1332
01:55:55,862 --> 01:55:56,503
No.

1333
01:55:56,722 --> 01:56:00,032
Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1334
01:56:05,979 --> 01:56:08,011
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1335
01:56:10,458 --> 01:56:13,205
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1336
01:56:14,582 --> 01:56:16,714
The punishment for witches,
what is that?

1337
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,039
That's right.

1338
01:56:18,142 --> 01:56:19,337
Death by fire.

1339
01:56:29,944 --> 01:56:31,207
Where is she?

1340
01:56:31,325 --> 01:56:33,205
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1341
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,569
Now if you kill me, Martha dies.

1342
01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:37,725
And if you fly away...
Martha also dies.

1343
01:56:37,727 --> 01:56:39,449
But if you kill the Bat...

1344
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,544
Martha lives.

1345
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,967
There we go.

1346
01:56:48,829 --> 01:56:50,091
There we go.

1347
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,916
And now God bends to my will.

1348
01:57:02,953 --> 01:57:05,342
Now the cameras are waiting
at your ship.

1349
01:57:05,364 --> 01:57:07,515
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1350
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:10,461
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1351
01:57:10,646 --> 01:57:11,840
To save Martha,

1352
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,711
bring me the head of the Bat.

1353
01:57:18,543 --> 01:57:21,298
Mother of God,
would you look at the time?

1354
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:23,735
When you came here,
you had an hour.

1355
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,245
Now it's less.

1356
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,476
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1357
01:58:30,478 --> 01:58:32,240
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

1358
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,220
There's something happening at the ship.

1359
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,771
It's sending massive power surges.

1360
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:40,006
<i>Police helicopters surrounding the area.</i>

1361
01:58:40,008 --> 01:58:42,783
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

1362
01:58:42,904 --> 01:58:44,639
<i>And we're trying to
get a little bit closer here</i>

1363
01:58:44,641 --> 01:58:45,818
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

1364
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:47,336
<i>It is absolute chaos.</i>

1365
01:58:47,338 --> 01:58:50,144
<i>You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.</i>

1366
01:58:50,146 --> 01:58:52,417
<i>They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.</i>

1367
01:58:53,227 --> 01:58:54,345
<i>Daily Planet.</i>

1368
01:58:55,701 --> 01:58:56,536
Lois.

1369
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,499
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1370
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,482
Who?

1371
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,995
Or he has to die.

1372
01:59:05,885 --> 01:59:06,885
Clark.

1373
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,750
No one stays good in this world.

1374
01:59:21,505 --> 01:59:25,034
<i>But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

1375
01:59:25,431 --> 01:59:26,500
<i>Much chaos.</i>

1376
01:59:26,607 --> 01:59:29,623
<i>Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1377
01:59:29,707 --> 01:59:31,692
<i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i>

1378
01:59:31,704 --> 01:59:34,502
<i>I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...</i>

1379
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:39,299
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.</i>

1380
02:01:39,301 --> 02:01:41,396
<i>Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1381
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:44,080
<i>All procedural interventions have failed.</i>

1382
02:01:44,419 --> 02:01:45,502
<i>Outcome</i>

1383
02:01:48,677 --> 02:01:49,630
<i>will be death.</i>

1384
02:01:58,426 --> 02:02:01,356
<i>Dr. Silas Stone suspending
all clinical protocol.</i>

1385
02:02:01,561 --> 02:02:05,066
<i>US Gov, object 6-19-82</i>

1386
02:02:05,431 --> 02:02:08,253
<i>is successfully activated.</i>

1387
02:02:29,582 --> 02:02:31,019
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

1388
02:02:31,186 --> 02:02:32,313
Call the heliport.

1389
02:02:32,315 --> 02:02:34,161
Chopper?
We can barely afford a bicycle.

1390
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:36,279
You wanna chase a story?
Go to the ship.

1391
02:02:36,281 --> 02:02:37,910
Superman's probably there already.

1392
02:02:37,912 --> 02:02:40,284
Perry, it's not for a story.

1393
02:02:45,459 --> 02:02:47,238
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1394
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,699
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1395
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,114
On the roof, Lois!

1396
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:55,153
Where are we headed?

1397
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:56,575
There!

1398
02:03:12,904 --> 02:03:13,900
<i>Well,</i>

1399
02:03:14,776 --> 02:03:15,951
<i>here I am.</i>

1400
02:03:17,214 --> 02:03:18,080
Bruce.

1401
02:03:18,082 --> 02:03:19,034
Please.

1402
02:03:20,325 --> 02:03:21,584
I was wrong.

1403
02:03:21,586 --> 02:03:23,073
You have to listen to me.

1404
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:24,764
Lex wants us to...

1405
02:03:39,558 --> 02:03:42,118
You don't understand.

1406
02:03:42,568 --> 02:03:43,861
There's no time!

1407
02:03:45,314 --> 02:03:46,667
<i>I understand.</i>

1408
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,278
Stay down!

1409
02:05:04,598 --> 02:05:05,711
If I wanted it,

1410
02:05:05,713 --> 02:05:06,950
you'd be dead already.

1411
02:05:45,014 --> 02:05:46,075
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

1412
02:05:49,263 --> 02:05:50,677
<i>That's fear.</i>

1413
02:05:53,817 --> 02:05:55,077
<i>You're not brave.</i>

1414
02:05:59,584 --> 02:06:01,013
<i>Men are brave.</i>

1415
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:52,747
<i>I bet your parents taught you</i>

1416
02:09:53,014 --> 02:09:54,494
<i>that you mean something.</i>

1417
02:09:55,528 --> 02:09:57,359
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

1418
02:09:58,755 --> 02:10:00,878
<i>My parents taught me
a different lesson,</i>

1419
02:10:02,951 --> 02:10:04,452
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

1420
02:10:04,892 --> 02:10:06,510
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1421
02:10:23,673 --> 02:10:25,834
<i>They taught me the world
only makes sense</i>

1422
02:10:26,288 --> 02:10:27,959
<i>if you force it to.</i>

1423
02:11:06,121 --> 02:11:07,918
<i>You were never a God.</i>

1424
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,316
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

1425
02:11:19,947 --> 02:11:21,902
You're letting him,

1426
02:11:22,263 --> 02:11:23,998
kill Martha.

1427
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,829
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1428
02:11:32,498 --> 02:11:34,025
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1429
02:11:35,272 --> 02:11:36,506
Find...

1430
02:11:36,758 --> 02:11:37,734
him.

1431
02:11:39,067 --> 02:11:40,028
Save

1432
02:11:40,785 --> 02:11:42,348
Martha.

1433
02:11:45,348 --> 02:11:46,594
<i>Martha.</i>

1434
02:12:17,577 --> 02:12:18,569
<i>Martha.</i>

1435
02:12:23,859 --> 02:12:25,340
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1436
02:12:26,559 --> 02:12:28,731
<i>Martha! Why did you say that name?</i>

1437
02:12:28,750 --> 02:12:29,864
Clark! Stop!

1438
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,189
Please! Stop!

1439
02:12:31,236 --> 02:12:32,873
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1440
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,405
It's his mother's name!

1441
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,673
It's his mother's name.

1442
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:10,560
We're not getting any answers.

1443
02:13:10,584 --> 02:13:12,596
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1444
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:13,689
A dangerous situation.

1445
02:13:13,713 --> 02:13:16,591
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1446
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,078
Luthor.

1447
02:13:33,557 --> 02:13:35,673
He wanted your life for hers.

1448
02:13:37,126 --> 02:13:38,479
She's losing time.

1449
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:41,388
The scout ship seems
to be drawing power from the city.

1450
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:43,074
It's got to be Lex.

1451
02:13:43,461 --> 02:13:44,745
<i>They need you at that ship.</i>

1452
02:13:45,025 --> 02:13:46,014
<i>I'll find her.</i>

1453
02:13:46,425 --> 02:13:48,429
My mother needs me.
<i>Wait.</i>

1454
02:13:49,348 --> 02:13:50,997
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

1455
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,435
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1456
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,798
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1457
02:14:22,106 --> 02:14:22,995
<i>Alfred.</i>

1458
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:26,783
I'm sorry for listening in, but
I've tracked the Russian's phone

1459
02:14:26,785 --> 02:14:28,392
to a warehouse near the port.

1460
02:14:28,394 --> 02:14:29,839
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

1461
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,603
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1462
02:14:31,859 --> 02:14:33,927
No, sir. You don't.

1463
02:14:54,044 --> 02:14:56,035
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1464
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:00,816
And every time we say goodbye,

1465
02:15:01,474 --> 02:15:02,904
you die a little.

1466
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,398
Take it down.
Go! Go!

1467
02:15:41,188 --> 02:15:42,537
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

1468
02:15:43,693 --> 02:15:44,411
Right.

1469
02:15:44,954 --> 02:15:46,497
Commencing drone mode.

1470
02:15:50,029 --> 02:15:54,307
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1471
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,406
Why don't I drop you off
on the second?

1472
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,821
Drop it.

1473
02:19:05,366 --> 02:19:06,791
I said drop it!

1474
02:19:08,004 --> 02:19:09,403
I'll kill her.

1475
02:19:11,344 --> 02:19:12,986
Believe me, I'll do it.

1476
02:19:16,538 --> 02:19:17,687
<i>I believe you.</i>

1477
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:30,822
<i>It's ok.</i>

1478
02:19:31,034 --> 02:19:32,401
<i>I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1479
02:19:32,838 --> 02:19:34,025
I figured.

1480
02:19:34,506 --> 02:19:35,799
The cape.

1481
02:20:03,764 --> 02:20:05,482
Late, late, says the White Rabbit.

1482
02:20:05,502 --> 02:20:07,329
<i>Forty seconds to animation.</i>

1483
02:20:07,374 --> 02:20:08,317
Right, wabbit?

1484
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:10,997
Out of tricks,

1485
02:20:11,666 --> 02:20:12,815
out of time.

1486
02:20:13,908 --> 02:20:14,930
And one...

1487
02:20:15,296 --> 02:20:16,387
Bat head short.

1488
02:20:16,451 --> 02:20:18,473
<i>Thirty seconds to animation.</i>

1489
02:20:19,109 --> 02:20:21,009
That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

1490
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:23,218
Gotham Roast. Well done.

1491
02:20:24,021 --> 02:20:25,872
Hello. Break the bad news.

1492
02:20:26,122 --> 02:20:28,238
<i>I'd rather do the breaking in person.</i>

1493
02:20:29,221 --> 02:20:31,871
<i>Twenty seconds to animation.</i>
You've lost.

1494
02:20:32,867 --> 02:20:34,054
I don't know how to lose.

1495
02:20:34,409 --> 02:20:35,394
You'll learn.

1496
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:36,657
I'll learn.

1497
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:38,309
I don't hate the sinner.

1498
02:20:39,512 --> 02:20:41,584
I hate the sin.
<i>10 seconds to animation.</i>

1499
02:20:41,586 --> 02:20:43,970
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1500
02:20:44,694 --> 02:20:46,127
I cannot let you win.

1501
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,816
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.

1502
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:51,159
So, if man won't kill God...

1503
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:51,719
<i>Two.</i>

1504
02:20:52,034 --> 02:20:52,745
<i>One.</i>

1505
02:20:54,878 --> 02:20:55,915
The devil will do it!

1506
02:21:13,153 --> 02:21:14,176
Perry!
Alright.

1507
02:21:14,178 --> 02:21:15,435
Stay calm, everybody!

1508
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:17,933
<i>We're getting reports
there are total blackouts</i>

1509
02:21:17,935 --> 02:21:20,589
<i>in the north and to the northwest
of the city.</i>

1510
02:21:20,738 --> 02:21:22,056
<i>Federal authorities
are trying to determine</i>

1511
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:24,741
<i>if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.</i>

1512
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,651
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1513
02:21:32,995 --> 02:21:35,356
Blood of my blood.

1514
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,896
Born to destroy you.

1515
02:21:47,373 --> 02:21:48,731
Your Doomsday.

1516
02:22:12,395 --> 02:22:13,503
Now God,

1517
02:22:14,149 --> 02:22:15,364
is good,

1518
02:22:15,777 --> 02:22:16,980
as dead.

1519
02:23:40,601 --> 02:23:41,794
POTUS joining.

1520
02:23:42,706 --> 02:23:43,683
Mr. President.

1521
02:23:43,685 --> 02:23:44,886
<i>What the hell is it, Calvin?</i>

1522
02:23:44,888 --> 02:23:46,394
<i>These are live images from the top</i>

1523
02:23:46,396 --> 02:23:49,216
<i>of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.</i>

1524
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:50,953
<i>Military aircraft are on the scene.</i>

1525
02:24:02,925 --> 02:24:04,877
Are you hurt, ma'am?
I'm ok.

1526
02:24:04,928 --> 02:24:06,400
Good.
You're gonna be alright, ok?

1527
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:19,596
<i>This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site</i>

1528
02:24:19,598 --> 02:24:20,835
<i>just moments ago.</i>

1529
02:24:21,100 --> 02:24:23,997
<i>Thankfully though, the work day
is over in the downtown core.</i>

1530
02:24:24,037 --> 02:24:25,505
<i>It's nearly empty.</i>

1531
02:24:25,879 --> 02:24:27,681
<i>Now military aircraft.</i>

1532
02:24:27,792 --> 02:24:29,477
<i>Those are Apache helicopters.</i>

1533
02:24:29,521 --> 02:24:31,955
<i>They have now just arrived.
The images that...</i>

1534
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,399
<i>We've... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.</i>

1535
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:13,703
<i>Now, it's not clear what just happened.</i>

1536
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:18,681
<i>What's happening there, Alfred?</i>

1537
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:22,676
How best to describe it?

1538
02:25:22,678 --> 02:25:24,581
<i>Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.</i>

1539
02:25:24,583 --> 02:25:25,360
Excuse me?

1540
02:25:25,362 --> 02:25:26,618
<i>We kindly ask
that you stay in your seats.</i>

1541
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:27,460
Excuse me?

1542
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:29,364
Miss Prince?

1543
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:45,815
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

1544
02:25:45,817 --> 02:25:47,342
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1545
02:25:47,646 --> 02:25:49,612
We can go straight to Key Red,
Mr. President.

1546
02:25:49,614 --> 02:25:51,089
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1547
02:25:51,091 --> 02:25:53,960
They're high enough that we can
nuke them with no casualties, sir.

1548
02:25:53,962 --> 02:25:55,808
One casualty, Mr. President.

1549
02:25:55,974 --> 02:25:57,135
Superman.

1550
02:25:59,147 --> 02:26:01,199
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

1551
02:26:06,852 --> 02:26:08,680
Key is hot.
Key is hot.

1552
02:26:08,735 --> 02:26:10,898
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1553
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,389
<i>Fire at will.</i>

1554
02:26:13,669 --> 02:26:14,395
Three.

1555
02:26:14,692 --> 02:26:15,348
Two.

1556
02:26:15,637 --> 02:26:16,231
One.

1557
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,804
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1558
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:29,737
Projectile 1. Impact.

1559
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,711
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1560
02:27:31,762 --> 02:27:32,911
That's uninhabited.

1561
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:34,453
Projectile 2.

1562
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,403
No apparent reentry.

1563
02:27:42,270 --> 02:27:43,566
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

1564
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:46,183
Superman, Mr. President.

1565
02:27:46,364 --> 02:27:49,062
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1566
02:27:50,213 --> 02:27:51,056
Sir.

1567
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:53,232
It's moving.

1568
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,285
The shockwaves are getting stronger.

1569
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:38,837
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1570
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,838
We can't attack.

1571
02:28:42,257 --> 02:28:43,687
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

1572
02:28:44,782 --> 02:28:46,149
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1573
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,664
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1574
02:29:16,980 --> 02:29:19,354
<i>Alfred.
It's Kryptonian.</i>

1575
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:21,836
<i>Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.</i>

1576
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:23,298
They might.

1577
02:29:23,691 --> 02:29:25,419
If you had any left.

1578
02:29:25,967 --> 02:29:27,503
<i>I got one round left.</i>

1579
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:30,085
<i>The spear.</i>

1580
02:29:30,163 --> 02:29:33,076
<i>Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.</i>

1581
02:29:33,353 --> 02:29:34,558
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

1582
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:36,647
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,</i>

1583
02:29:36,903 --> 02:29:38,159
<i>the spear will kill it.</i>

1584
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:39,160
It would in theory.

1585
02:29:39,162 --> 02:29:40,485
<i>I've got to get it to chase me</i>

1586
02:29:40,674 --> 02:29:41,846
<i>back to the city.</i>

1587
02:29:42,047 --> 02:29:43,324
<i>Back to the Kryptonite.</i>

1588
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,481
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1589
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:37,358
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1590
02:31:37,440 --> 02:31:38,790
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

1591
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:40,717
<i>There's a weapon here that can kill it.</i>

1592
02:31:53,541 --> 02:31:54,735
Did you find the spear?

1593
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,126
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

1594
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:59,082
This thing, this creature,

1595
02:31:59,392 --> 02:32:00,878
seems to feed on energy.

1596
02:32:02,634 --> 02:32:04,847
This thing is from another world.

1597
02:32:06,573 --> 02:32:07,573
My world.

1598
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,022
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1599
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:13,515
Is she with you?

1600
02:32:14,375 --> 02:32:15,654
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

1601
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,409
Clark!

1602
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,339
Clark!

1603
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,047
Clark! Are you alright?

1604
02:36:57,804 --> 02:36:58,857
I love you.

1605
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:03,979
No.

1606
02:37:05,304 --> 02:37:06,624
No, Clark, you can't.

1607
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:09,652
This is my world.

1608
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:11,513
No, Clark, don't.

1609
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:17,170
You are my world.

1610
02:37:17,725 --> 02:37:18,463
No.

1611
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:23,723
Please. Clark!

1612
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,600
Hi.

1613
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:40,482
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1614
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,628
The dead shall live.

1615
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:12,001
My slain...

1616
02:47:12,511 --> 02:47:13,942
shall rise again.

1617
02:47:16,801 --> 02:47:19,745
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1618
02:47:21,173 --> 02:47:22,535
For thy dew,

1619
02:47:22,701 --> 02:47:24,615
is like the dew of morning.

1620
02:47:26,341 --> 02:47:27,491
And the earth,

1621
02:47:27,758 --> 02:47:29,287
shall give birth,

1622
02:47:30,262 --> 02:47:31,299
to her dead.

1623
02:47:39,325 --> 02:47:41,183
I need a ride back to the house.

1624
02:47:41,185 --> 02:47:43,631
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1625
02:47:43,778 --> 02:47:45,469
They said it's all taken care of.

1626
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,269
By whom?

1627
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,348
Anonymous donor.

1628
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:36,809
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1629
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,591
They don't know how to honor him,

1630
02:48:40,906 --> 02:48:42,619
except as a soldier.

1631
02:48:44,521 --> 02:48:45,703
I've failed him...

1632
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:47,714
in life.

1633
02:48:49,382 --> 02:48:50,936
I won't fail him in death.

1634
02:48:53,129 --> 02:48:54,838
Help me find the others like you.

1635
02:48:55,876 --> 02:48:57,630
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1636
02:48:58,682 --> 02:48:59,684
They will.

1637
02:49:00,412 --> 02:49:01,432
And they'll fight.

1638
02:49:02,744 --> 02:49:04,271
We have to stand together.

1639
02:49:12,485 --> 02:49:15,238
100 years ago,
I walked away from mankind.

1640
02:49:17,672 --> 02:49:19,734
From a century of horrors.

1641
02:49:23,240 --> 02:49:26,525
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1642
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,519
Men are still good.

1643
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:35,515
<font color=#ff8000><i>We fight.</i></font>

1644
02:49:36,331 --> 02:49:37,360
<font color="#ff8000"><i>We kill.</i></font>

1645
02:49:38,240 --> 02:49:40,319
<font color=#ff8000><i>We betray one another.</i></font>

1646
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,203
<font color=#ff8000><i>But we can rebuild.</i></font>

1647
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,367
<font color=#ff8000><i>We can do better.</i></font>

1648
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:50,226
<font color=#ff8000><i>We will.</i></font>

1649
02:49:51,375 --> 02:49:52,538
<font color=#ff8000><i>We have to.</i></font>

1650
02:50:15,342 --> 02:50:16,934
The others like me.

1651
02:50:17,196 --> 02:50:19,187
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1652
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:26,144
Just a feeling.

1653
02:50:38,288 --> 02:50:40,870
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1654
02:50:40,979 --> 02:50:43,303
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1655
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:47,129
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1656
02:50:47,421 --> 02:50:50,131
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1657
02:50:57,810 --> 02:50:59,601
Turn around and face the wall.

1658
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:03,748
Place your forehead against the wall.

1659
02:51:04,152 --> 02:51:05,981
Put your hands behind your back,

1660
02:51:05,983 --> 02:51:07,811
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1661
02:51:36,301 --> 02:51:37,705
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

1662
02:51:37,957 --> 02:51:39,439
<i>wherever you go,</i>

1663
02:51:39,455 --> 02:51:41,010
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

1664
02:51:44,848 --> 02:51:45,998
Look at us.

1665
02:51:47,584 --> 02:51:49,470
This is how it all caves in.

1666
02:51:49,746 --> 02:51:53,304
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's,

1667
02:51:53,837 --> 02:51:55,211
out the window.

1668
02:51:59,438 --> 02:52:01,270
But who would believe me? I...

1669
02:52:02,295 --> 02:52:03,171
I...

1670
02:52:03,700 --> 02:52:04,870
I'm insane.

1671
02:52:06,038 --> 02:52:07,791
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1672
02:52:08,350 --> 02:52:09,527
That's right.

1673
02:52:10,114 --> 02:52:12,633
We have hospitals
that treat the mentally ill

1674
02:52:13,023 --> 02:52:14,172
with compassion.

1675
02:52:15,225 --> 02:52:16,794
But that's not where you're going.

1676
02:52:17,234 --> 02:52:20,856
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1677
02:52:22,127 --> 02:52:23,910
I still have some friends there.

1678
02:52:24,774 --> 02:52:26,237
They're expecting you.

1679
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:31,661
But...

1680
02:52:32,227 --> 02:52:34,757
the bell's already been rung.

1681
02:52:37,302 --> 02:52:38,815
And they've heard it.

1682
02:52:40,787 --> 02:52:42,063
Out in the dark.

1683
02:52:42,596 --> 02:52:44,317
Among the stars.

1684
02:52:48,470 --> 02:52:49,507
Ding dong,

1685
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:51,750
the God is dead.

1686
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:03,953
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1687
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:06,443
He's hungry.

1688
02:53:07,633 --> 02:53:09,018
He's found us.

1689
02:53:10,159 --> 02:53:11,657
And he's coming!

1690
02:54:43,467 --> 02:54:46,467
