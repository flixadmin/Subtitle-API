I could have S.C.P.D. here

of being summoned by one of my operatives.

Paris to Hong Kong nonstop.

You prevented that flight

-Were you watching me?
-Via Keyhole Hexagon satellite.

How else was I supposed to know

The man you had me murder.

He was Edward Fyers' handler.

-And he worked for you.
-You're out of your depth, Mr. Queen.

I think Mr. Castwidth had a USB drive
detailing everything.

524
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,537
I think he knew you told Fyers
to shoot the plane down.

525
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:45,208
-And I think that you wanted him silenced.
-And the world thinks you dead, Mr. Queen.

526
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,588
The convenient thing about dead men
is that no one tends to believe them.

527
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,550
What about dead men who make arrangements
to get the information on that USB drive...

...in the hands of every blogger

If anything happens to Maseo's family...

...you're gonna spend a long time
testifying in front of the Senate subcommittee.

The world's a much more complicated place
than you realize.

Edward Fyers thought he was to shoot down
that plane to destabilize the Chinese economy.

533
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,781
In truth, I wanted to take out a single target.

534
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:21,786
So you blow up a plane
full of innocent people to take out one man?

No, to take out one woman.
