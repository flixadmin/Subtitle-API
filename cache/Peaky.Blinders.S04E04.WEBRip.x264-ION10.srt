Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Shelby.

I know how busy you are.

How can I help you?

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, you see tomorrow

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,600
I thought I would invite your brother.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,360
Arthur.

Not exactly forgiving us.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,120
But something like that.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,800
And also it’s a way of saying thank you

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
[Michael breathing heavily]

188
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,720
[door opens]

189
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,640
[Tommy] Oi!

190
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Get out.

191
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,240
[indistinct chatter]

192
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,840
It's 1-8-3-3-3.

193
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,520
Charlie?

194
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,760
Listen, Molly Gold
will be calling in four minutes.

195
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,080
Tell them the Italians are around south. A Rolls Royce. Maybe two. Black.

196
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,040
Tell them to expect
a full complement of men.

197
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,960
We inflicted no casualties.

198
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
I said we inflicted no fucking casualties.

199
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,320
[exhales]

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
-[Luca speaking Italian]
-[driver speaking Italian]

201
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
There seems to be an
obstruction, Mr. Changretta...

202
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
There's been an accident.

203
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,120
Well, why don't you
move it out of the way?

204
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
[policeman] What?

205
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
I said why don't you clear it
so that we can get past?

206
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
What’s that accent?

207
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,440
We’re Americans.

208
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,320
We’re here on business.

209
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,320
Well, you’re gonna have to wait.

210
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
Jesus Christ.

211
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,600
We waited for you
fucking Yanks until 1918.

212
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,120
It will be clear in 20 minutes, all right?

213
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,160
Yeah, all right.
Thank you officer. Big fucking help.

214
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
[speaking Italian]

215
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,160
1918, what the fuck is he talking about?

216
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
[in English] Talking about the war.

217
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Everything here is about the war.

218
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
[sighs]

219
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,800
C’mon, let’s go move it ourselves.
Fucking idiots.

220
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,599
What’s this? Whose wagon is that?

221
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,240
[policeman] They’re gypsies.

222
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,560
Tribe of fucking gypsies.

223
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,240
We can move it, all right?

224
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,000
I said it will be clear in 20 minutes.

225
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,960
Let’s go.

226
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
We’ll find another way out of here.

227
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,640
Go. Get us the fuck out of here.

228
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
[driver grunting]

229
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,720
Come on, fucking move.

230
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
Frankie, fucking move.

231
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,200
[gunfire]

232
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,440
Ahhh!

233
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,640
[car engine starts]

234
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,040
Put the guns down! Put the guns down!

235
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
[groans]

236
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,320
[Michael] <i>He spared me.</i>

237
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
He said, "Tell your mum
that we have a deal."

238
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,720
What deal?

239
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,920
It will just be me and you
going to Australia, Michael.

240
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,760
-Think about that.
-What deal, Mum?

241
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,440
What deal did you make
with Luca Changretta?

242
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,760
A deal to spare your life.

243
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,840
In return for what?

244
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,400
Men don't have the strategic intelligence
to conduct a war between families.

245
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,680
Men are less good at
keeping secrets out of their lives.

246
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,960
You agreed to give up Tommy?

247
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,680
To save my life?

248
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,920
You never forgave him, did you?

249
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,000
We’re out of our league.

250
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,440
No.

251
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,560
-We don't do that to our own.
-Think.

252
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,120
If it wasn't for me you’d be smoke
blowing out of a mortuary chimney.

253
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,520
Think about that.

254
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,440
Uh, two.

255
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,760
We killed two.

256
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,040
You also shot a copper.

257
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,400
Shot him in the arm with purpose.

258
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,280
There’s a copper on the floor,

259
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
the Stratford Constabulary
will swarm all over it.

260
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
The copper’s alive.

261
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,240
Got a description of the Italians.

262
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,760
The Italians will be forced underground.

263
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,560
We’re gypsies.

264
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,680
We’re already underground.

265
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,240
You yourself inflicted
no casualties this end so...

266
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,920
You know,

267
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
Mr. Shelby,

268
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,200
maybe you’ve been pushing
pieces of paper around too long.

269
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,560
Luca Changretta got away.

270
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,920
You let him get away.

271
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,440
When our paths cross
I won’t be so careless.

272
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,160
And when will your paths cross?

273
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Soon.

274
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,920
[mellow guitar music playing]

275
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,480
If her majesty smells like paraffin,

276
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,040
it’s because my old lamp
is smoking for want of fuel.

277
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,120
Times are hard
in case you haven’t noticed.

278
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,320
I hope your insistence that I take

279
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,480
a boat rather than a cab from the station

280
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
wasn't purely for your own amusement.

281
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
No. For the avoidance of death and kidnap.

282
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,520
By boat, you get to see
the nicer parts of the city.

283
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,880
He got us here, now.
You'll be all right. This way.

284
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,800
Good morning, Lady Carleton.

285
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,600
I’m not a lady.

286
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
[door opens]

287
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
Too right you’re not.

288
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
[Tommy] Shoeing, stabling, feed,
two hours a day in the gallops.

289
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
Did you think of a name?

290
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,040
Yes. Dangerous.

291
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,320
"Dangerous", eh?

292
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,880
Oh, a horse called Dangerous won the
Epsom Derby in 1833, so I stole the name.

293
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,400
-I thought you’d approve.
-[lighter clicks]

294
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
You should visit her.

295
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
If I leave Small Heath, I'll be shot dead.

296
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
Anyway, I'm busy.

297
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,880
Well, the good news is

298
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,280
your horse is the
fastest filly that I have ever ridden.

299
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,960
These are her registration papers.

300
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,920
Ready for your signature.

301
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,760
So, is this why you came here?

302
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,720
All this way in person?

303
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,520
For my fucking signature?

304
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,400
You’ve lost your wife...

305
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
And now your brother, too.

306
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,680
I thought it would make you different.

307
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,960
But it doesn't seem to change you. Nothing seems to change you.

308
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,160
[door opens]

309
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,280
The end of year accounts
for the Gray Shelby Institute, Mr. Shelby.

310
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,000
I beg your pardon, madam.

311
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,360
Already signed off on those, Lizzie. What do you think of his shirt?

312
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,760
He’s having them made in London.
I’m not sure about them.

313
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,400
All right, Lizzie, thank you.

314
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,920
But, you know sometimes,
he sees something glamorous and expensive,

315
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,680
he just can’t resist it.

316
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
He’s so weak.

317
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,320
Actually,

318
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,880
speaking of the Gray Shelby Foundation,

319
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,400
I’d like to make a donation.

320
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,960
[clears throat]

321
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
I'll leave it blank.

322
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
You can decide how much, Mr. Shelby.

323
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,280
Then perhaps,

324
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
Lizzie?

325
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
You can pop to the bank
and pay it in for me?

326
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,240
That be all, Lizzie, thank you.

327
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Drink?

328
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,840
No, thank you.

329
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,640
Did you pack an overnight bag?

330
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,920
No.

331
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,760
Pity.

332
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,600
Why?

333
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,720
Well, because 25 minutes ago,

334
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,960
the Birmingham branch

335
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,560
of the train drivers union

336
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,200
called a wildcat strike

337
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,120
in support of the coal miners.

338
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,000
No trains to London until tomorrow.

339
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
It wasn't in any of the papers.

340
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,800
It’s why they call it a wildcat.

341
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
No one knows.

342
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,920
Apart from you, of course.

343
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,760
Your city.

344
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,800
So where would I stay in your city?

345
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,680
I’ll be free at four.
I could meet you then.

346
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,800
Meet and do what?

347
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,120
I’ll pour you some gin...

348
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,920
And I’ll make myself...

349
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
From my father’s recipe.

350
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,280
"Distilled for the eradication
of seemingly incurable sadness".

351
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
I’m going to have that on the label.

352
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
I’ll book myself a room.

353
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,640
Already done. The Midland. Suite.

354
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,080
Stay there myself sometimes.

355
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,520
Sometimes it's where you stay.

356
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,080
But not tonight it would seem.

357
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,120
Well, since I’m stuck here
maybe I should try your gin.

358
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,920
4 o’clock then.

359
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Where?

360
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,200
I'll find you.

361
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,840
What the fuck was that about, Lizzie? Eh?

362
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,600
Have a guess.

363
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,720
You know, I can’t even guess anymore.

364
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,960
I’ll be back at 4:00.

365
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,520
Why is she still here?

366
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,000
Something to do with
the coal miners, apparently.

367
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,760
[door opens]

368
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,520
[footsteps receding]

369
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,440
Oh, today’s your lucky day, sir.
I’ll give you 3 to 1 on Raging Robbers.

370
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,240
Come on, gents. Get your bets on.

371
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,280
[continues chattering]

372
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,720
[phone ringing]

373
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
Small Heath 5-5-2.

374
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,160
[Luca] Mrs. Gray.

375
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,480
I wanted to illustrate to you

376
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,040
that at any time

377
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
we can reach your son.

378
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,520
And we will kill your son...

379
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,200
If you do not deliver Tommy Shelby

380
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,440
as you promised. Huh?

381
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,040
You just tell us where and when

382
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,040
<i>and we’ll do the rest.</i>

383
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,200
[gasps]

384
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,880
Where is he?

385
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Fucking.

386
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,920
Fucking what?

387
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,600
Fucking her.

388
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,040
Ten thousand pounds?

389
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,240
She left it blank
so I filled it in for her.

390
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,720
What’s Tommy’s diary looking like
for the rest of the week?

391
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,520
Oh, fuck Tommy and his cock and his gin.

392
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
And his stuck up whore.

393
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,520
I saved this.

394
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,320
Read my leaves, Pol?

395
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,960
You haven’t done my leaves in ages.

396
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,080
Haven’t done anyone’s leaves for ages.

397
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,760
Okay.

398
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,200
Pour.

399
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Swirl the tea cup.

400
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
Think about the man you love.

401
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,800
Fuck him.

402
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,320
Think about your white wedding gown.

403
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,760
[exhales]

404
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,240
Now pour the tea back into the pot.

405
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,760
Okay?

406
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
I’ll read your tea leaves,

407
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,920
if you go and get Tommy’s diary.

408
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,520
[door opens]

409
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,240
See if Tommy’s got
a free afternoon in the next seven days?

410
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,240
Friday.

411
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,920
Now read my future
and make it fucking good.

412
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Make sure he keeps it free.

413
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000
Just read my leaves, Pol.

414
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Already have.

415
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
[blows air]

416
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Plain as day.

417
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,160
What are you doing?

418
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,280
Stop drinking whiskey. Switch to stout.

419
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,360
Why?

420
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,720
Make sure Tommy keeps that Friday free.

421
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,520
Tell him I have an appointment for him.

422
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
And then go and see a doctor

423
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,240
about that baby in your tea leaves.

424
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,520
[rock music playing]

425
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
[groans]

426
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,760
Next.

427
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,560
You’re not in the
fucking fairground now, son.

428
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,720
Get down and skip me 200

429
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,040
for taking the piss out of a fine fighter.

430
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,560
-He’s got a head on him that boy.
-[Aberama] And a fist.

431
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,320
So, what do you say, Mr. May?

432
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,480
He works hard, his game.

433
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,640
I need to work on his defense.

434
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,720
Right now his left hand
is just good for wanking.

435
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,360
You don't have to earn your money,
we’re paying you anyway, is he ready?

436
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,560
Is he even registered?

437
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,200
I’ve put him down as a welterweight.

438
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
Midlands division.

439
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,480
Amateur turning pro.
Just need your counter signature.

440
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,920
Like I’m going to say no to you boys.

441
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,280
Just tell us.

442
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,640
Is he ready?

443
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,000
[Mr. May] In 30 years,

444
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,680
I’ve never seen a war boy so ready.

445
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
[Bonnie exhales]

446
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,480
And that’s 200, Mr. May.

447
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
So, who am I fighting first, Mr. Shelby?

448
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,520
When you step in the ring, Bonnie,

449
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,840
who do you see across the canvas, eh?

450
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,720
I see myself.

451
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Forty years old having done fuck all
except tramping the lines.

452
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
See my life wasted.

453
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,880
I won’t let it happen.

454
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,040
Me? I’m going to be a champion.

455
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,960
[speaking Romani]

456
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,720
When this business is done...

457
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,160
You’ll be champion of the world Gypsy boy.

458
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
[in English] First heard in Camden Town.

459
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,400
Boy’s name is Goliath.

460
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,760
[peppy music playing]

461
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,120
Said he’s at a meeting.

462
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,960
Yes. I was wondering
do you have any boots that I can borrow?

463
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,400
Why do you need boots?

464
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,640
Well, no one here will speak to me.

465
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,600
So, I thought I would
take a walk by the canal.

466
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,520
Is he really making gin?

467
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,040
He’s going mad
cooped up here is what he is.

468
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,240
Like a wasp in a beer glass.

469
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,480
Um...

470
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,000
You’ll look a bit funny in these I think.

471
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,360
[chuckles]

472
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,200
Thank you, Curly.

473
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,000
If you’re going to take a walk along
the canal, you’ll also need this.

474
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,280
Are you serious?

475
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,440
Italians north. Italians south.

476
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,520
He makes gin to take his mind off
being stuck inside a prison.

477
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,040
[gun clicking]

478
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,240
If you had any sense, Mrs. Carleton,

479
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,880
you would get out of here now.

480
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,760
Curly can sail you to Snowhill Station
hidden in the coal sacks.

481
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
I said I would wait.

482
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,160
The man you are waiting for doesn't exist.

483
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,400
[Curly stammers]

484
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,840
While you’re waiting
for the man who doesn't exist,

485
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,520
would you like to try some of his gin?

486
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,840
[music continues]

487
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,080
[Devlin] <i>The strike has blocked </i>
<i>the Coventry Road.</i>

488
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,760
<i>Made all the men get off the buses.</i>

489
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,239
Where were the police? They were busy.

490
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,440
Apparently there was a report of
armed men in the Small Heath area.

491
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,520
And there was a murder

492
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,360
at the Summer Lane Hospital.

493
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,080
And something happening
on the Stratford Road.

494
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
The strike has
threatened the men's families.

495
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,280
They said come the revolution,
their names would be on the list.

496
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,080
Like in Russia.

497
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,440
And the buses turned round?

498
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes. They turned round.

499
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,960
Mr. Shelby.

500
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,760
Factories are shut. Mines are shut.

501
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,880
Coal's running out.

502
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,320
Did you ever consider the possibility

503
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,960
that the Communists might win?

504
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,280
And you and me,

505
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,120
traitors to our class,

506
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,560
will be put up against a wall and shot?

507
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,360
As a businessman,

508
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,520
I consider all possibilities.

509
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,680
But Mr. Devlin,

510
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,160
I’m not a traitor to my class.

511
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,160
Small Heath 5-5-1.

512
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,480
I’m just an extreme example

513
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,200
of what a working man can achieve.

514
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,240
Hello, Ada.

515
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,600
Yeah, it’s me.

516
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
I need your help.

517
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,000
[May singing]

518
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,360
[Tommy] Four o’clock.

519
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,080
[May] Is it?

520
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,120
What do you think?

521
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,800
Oh, nice. A little sweet.

522
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,840
I've heard not sweet enough.

523
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,600
Come and see.

524
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,440
[door opens]

525
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
[May] My God, Tommy.

526
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
What is this, a hobby?

527
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,520
No. Don't really have time for hobbies.

528
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,400
This is more of, uh...

529
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,160
More of a place where I try things out.

530
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,520
I decided if I’m going to be
stuck here in Small Heath,

531
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,920
might as well do something useful.

532
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,720
Less of a hobby,

533
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,520
more of a venture.

534
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,400
Since the start of
prohibition I’ve been sending

535
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,240
single malt, scotch whiskey

536
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,560
to Boston and Halifax, Nova Scotia

537
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,960
hidden in crates of car parts.

538
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,000
[chuckles]

539
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,480
But my supply lines
from Scotland have been unreliable.

540
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,920
There have been a lot of thefts.

541
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,320
And in this modern age,

542
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,320
American women drink
as much booze as the men.

543
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,200
And women apparently prefer gin.

544
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,520
[pours drink]

545
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
So with the help
of a friend of mine in Camden Town,

546
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,080
I set up my own source of supply.

547
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,240
Junipers, potatoes,

548
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,600
sugar and water,

549
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,080
all turned into U.S. dollars.

550
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
When we’re up and running,

551
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,040
we’ll produce over 200 gallons a week.

552
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,320
But before then...

553
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,840
I need to get my recipe right.

554
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
So tell me the truth?

555
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,560
-The truth?
-Mmm-hmm.

556
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,560
You’re unlike any man I have ever met.

557
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
And the gin?

558
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,000
Too sweet.

559
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,960
You said you booked a room?

560
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,440
No, I booked a suite.

561
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,520
Thank you.

562
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,280
If you book a taxi, I’ll go. You’re a businessman, Tommy, a good one.

563
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
-If only you could...
-If only I could what?

564
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,400
"If only you could change."

565
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Go on, say it.
If only you could change the bad.

566
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,800
And the good is laying off
a thousand men, which I do

567
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,400
like a good businessman.

568
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,400
And I do it like that.
[snaps fingers]

569
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,920
And people go hungry.

570
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,680
And the bad,

571
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,280
the bad is fucking winning the horses

572
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,560
and a gun

573
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,000
and some fucking self-respect.

574
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,960
You fucking people.

575
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,840
You bite like your horse.

576
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,920
I don't trust taxis anymore.

577
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,960
Come with me.

578
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,760
[Arthur] There you go, brother.

579
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,280
Home sweet home.

580
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,960
Place for you to bring women back,

581
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,800
bring your mates,

582
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,280
play games, gamble, cards and

583
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,640
you keep an eye on our back yard.

584
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,200
[glass clatters]

585
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,360
Artillery Square.
Place is full of Communists.

586
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The strikers.

587
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,080
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

588
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,960
Light the fucking fire.

589
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,040
Take some of the shit off the walls.

590
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,880
Curly will be over later
with some poison for the rats.

591
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,200
-[Finn] Arthur?
-Huh?

592
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,640
This morning...

593
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
I wouldn’t have
been able to pull that trigger.

594
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,280
I know I wouldn't.
They would have just walked past.

595
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,080
I’m not John.

596
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,040
-I know I’m not.
-All right.

597
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,320
You’re my brother.

598
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,040
I know you're not.

599
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,840
All right? In the end,

600
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,600
it’s God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

601
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,040
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies, Finn.

602
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,360
Not us.

603
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,760
You just have to...

604
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,880
Flick a switch...

605
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,720
In your head.

606
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,080
Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

607
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,800
He's right.

608
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,480
[May] Italians north and south, he said.

609
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,400
[Tommy] No.

610
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,160
It’s mostly chancers, local kids,

611
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,320
trying to get famous.

612
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,800
Sweeney's boys.

613
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,120
Sheffield boys, Manchester, Glasgow.

614
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,320
They all know we’re on the ropes.

615
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,000
And that's not including the mafia.

616
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,560
Yep. Here’s your carriage.
You can catch the 7:15 train.

617
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,560
I thought there was a strike?

618
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,680
Who gave you that idea?

619
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,280
My God!

620
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,440
I know. The bad I can’t help.

621
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,360
I wanted you to stay.

622
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,880
And normally I get my own way.

623
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,720
Losing occasionally makes me worse.

624
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,240
Thank you, Curly.

625
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,280
She looks a picture in my boots,
doesn't she, Tom?

626
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,520
Walk her to the train, Curly.

627
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,760
Yeah.

628
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,280
[woman] <i>Not a minute on the day.</i>

629
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,600
<i>Not a penny of the pay.</i>

630
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,120
This talk of national austerity,

631
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,880
this talk of tightening our belts
must be met with resolute certainty.

632
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,680
We will not accept any goods and pay.

633
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,720
We will not accept working
longer hours for the same wage.

634
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,000
Shoulder to shoulder with the coal miners,

635
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,080
dock workers,
railway men and steel workers.

636
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,880
We will stand united

637
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,240
through the storm

638
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,560
to show they come into our city.

639
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,800
[workers cheering]

640
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,160
Goodnight. See you soon. Take care.

641
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,000
Jessie Eden?

642
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,440
Yes?

643
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,400
I’d like to buy you a drink.

644
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,120
No. I'm afraid the pubs around here don't
allow unaccompanied female drinkers.

645
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm sure we'll be fine.

646
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,360
I know you from somewhere.

647
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,200
I’m Ada Thorn, formerly Shelby.

648
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,760
I have a settlement proposition

649
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,440
that my brother's too arrogant
and proud to offer you in person.

650
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,400
[indistinct chatter]

651
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,720
[chattering stops]

652
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,600
Sorry, ladies, we don't...

653
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,040
Don't what?

654
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,640
It’s all right. I’m sorry, I didn't...

655
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,120
"What are you drinking ladies?"

656
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,960
That’s what you’re supposed to say.

657
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,720
Yes. Sorry, uh, what are you drinking?

658
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,440
Beer. Pint.

659
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,080
And a whiskey on ice.

660
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,080
I’m afraid we don't have ice.

661
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,280
Next time make sure you have ice.

662
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,400
This pub’s come
to our attention for its lack of ice.

663
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,320
[men chattering]

664
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,160
[Ada] There is more than one way
to achieve equality.

665
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,000
Before you begin to congratulate yourself,

666
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,040
I’m not impressed with your
power to terrify people.

667
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,360
Hmm.

668
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,840
Whereas, I am impressed by your ability

669
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,080
to stand up in front
of an audience and speak.

670
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,040
I was never able to do it.

671
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,000
I’ve heard people talk about you.

672
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,760
You used to advocate armed revolution.

673
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Shelby Company Limited is prepared to
offer parity for male and female workers

674
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,280
across all the factories in our ownership

675
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,040
and withdraw the pay cut for men.

676
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,600
In return for what?

677
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,240
In return for something very unusual

678
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,560
but very typical of my brother.

679
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,960
What does he want?

680
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,040
To sit down with you and talk.

681
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,360
If he withdraws his pay cut
we've no need to talk.

682
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,160
He wants to talk about
socialism and revolution.

683
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,360
Dear God, are you serious?

684
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,160
My brother’s a book maker,

685
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,320
book makers hedge their bets.

686
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,120
Sometimes long shots come in.

687
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,360
And because we emptied his buses today,

688
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,240
he thinks we are amongst
the runners and riders?

689
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,360
Beneath it all,
my brother’s a very rational man.

690
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,440
Beneath all what?

691
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,480
You mean beneath the beatings,
the cuttings, the shootings,

692
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,160
-the murders.
-Yeah, beneath all that.

693
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,440
Tell your brother that

694
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,080
when we take power all means of
production will be owned by the workers.

695
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,160
Essential industries will
be taken under state control.

696
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,360
Birmingham Town Hall

697
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,760
is a rather beautiful building
and we plan to preserve it.

698
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,760
What else does he need to know?

699
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
It's going to happen.

700
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,560
Aren’t you a bit sorry
you jumped ship too soon?

701
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,960
He wants to take you for dinner.

702
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,800
I really have nothing to wear.

703
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,360
You’d need to wear boots,

704
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,480
he’s suggesting dinner
in a scrap metal yard.

705
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,480
Said you would appreciate the sentiment.

706
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,120
If you don't show up,
the offer of parity is withdrawn.

707
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,680
This is not how
you conduct union business.

708
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,160
Well, we must all make personal sacrifices
for the good of the good old cause, right?

709
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,680
[suspenseful music playing]

710
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,480
[Alfie grunts]

711
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,920
Fucking hell it smells of
pig round here, don’t it?

712
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,800
Definitely not kosher.

713
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,760
Come to Small Heath
and you will go to hell

714
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,400
for fucking breathing.

715
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,280
Where is everyone?

716
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,920
[Alfie] Stretch your legs, Treacle.

717
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
Fuck me, it looks like
he’s grown since we’ve left London.

718
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,360
Like a mushroom, ain't he?
He grows in the dark.

719
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,680
Need a piss.

720
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,960
Do you? Yeah, well,
this place is a shit hole, yeah.

721
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,560
So, why don't you knock yourself out.

722
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,920
Where is everyone?

723
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,560
Ishmael, please,

Yeah, it is. It is.

but you have a good nose.

Right, well, you’ve got to
ask yourself seriously though,

did I even want to piss and shit indoors

761

defecate in fields and the outhouses?

762
