you gotta leave that on.</font>

7
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,949
<font color="#787878">Yeah, it's like the tag made the last flight without the plane crashing or anything.</font>

8
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,953
<font color="#787878">So I figure it's gotta be on the bag, or at least, with the bag.</font>

00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,498
<font color="#787878">No! No!</font>

131
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,418
<font color="#787878">Christa! No!</font>

132
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,862
<font color="#787878">Alex, could you trade seats with Blake so she and I could sit together?</font>

133
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,740
<font color="#787878">She asked Tod, but he said
he had some medical thing.</font>

134
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,159
<font color="#787878">Please?</font>

135
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,042
<font color="#787878">What's up, dude?</font>

136
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,215
<font color="#787878">~ Is there a problem, sir?
~ What's your problem?</font>

137
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,675
<font color="#787878">Alex, qu'est-ce que c'est?</font>

138
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,970
<font color="#787878">~ The fucking plane's gonna explode.
~ Shut up, Browning.</font>

139
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,389
<font color="#787878">~ You're so not funny.
~ If this is your joke....</font>

140
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,182
<font color="#787878">It's not a joke. It's not a joke.</font>

141
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,810
<font color="#787878">~ Alex, take it easy.
~ That's it, sit down, Browning.</font>

142
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,396
<font color="#787878">~ It's going down.
~ We will remove you.</font>

143
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,564
<font color="#787878">~ I'll remove him.
~ I'll remove myself.</font>

144
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,066
<font color="#787878">~ Excuse me.
~ Get off him.</font>

145
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,903
<font color="#787878">~ That's my seat right there.
~ This plane is going down.</font>

146
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,322
<font color="#787878">Everybody in the aisle, off the plane.</font>

147
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,324
<font color="#787878">~ Get off the plane.
~ Stay where you are.</font>

148
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,910
<font color="#787878">~ Just sit tight.
~ The fucking plane is going down.</font>

149
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,080
<font color="#787878">Go check him out.
See how he's doing.</font>

150
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,373
<font color="#787878">Okay.</font>

151
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,051
<font color="#787878">~ I got my ticket here.
~ Get off me.</font>

152
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,595
<font color="#787878">Jerk.</font>

153
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,180
<font color="#787878">~ Hey.
~ You got this?</font>

154
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,932
<font color="#787878">No one gets back onboard.</font>

155
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,685
<font color="#787878">~ That's my call.
~ Wait, please.</font>

156
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,271
<font color="#787878">I've got 40 students going to Paris. Please, please?</font>

157
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,150
<font color="#787878">~ Look, you must understand my position.
~ I understand, and I apologize for Alex.</font>

158
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,193
<font color="#787878">But one of us needs to be on that plane.</font>

159
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,612
<font color="#787878">I cannot let students
go to Paris for ten days....</font>

160
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,573
<font color="#787878">Carter, no.</font>

161
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,450
<font color="#787878">~ Sit the fuck down, Carter.
~ Sit down.</font>

162
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,617
<font color="#787878">Sit.</font>

163
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,162
<font color="#787878">One of you can go on
the flight. That's it.</font>

164
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,039
<font color="#787878">Larry.</font>

165
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,793
<font color="#787878">Airline's not taking this well.
They'll let one of us back on.</font>

166
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,588
<font color="#787878">The rest can take an 11:10 flight. It gets in three....</font>

167
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,339
<font color="#787878">I'll stay.</font>

168
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,135
<font color="#787878">No, no, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane, it's fine.</font>

169
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,888
<font color="#787878">Hi, Mr. Murnau.
See, I was in the bathroom.</font>

170
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,973
<font color="#787878">And the lock, it was stuck, and....</font>

171
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,975
<font color="#787878">Oh, wait, I didn't fight with anyone.</font>

172
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,145
<font color="#787878">Damn.</font>

173
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,147
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

174
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,738
<font color="#787878">I just.... I called your parents. They're on their way.</font>

175
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,161
<font color="#787878">We should be going.</font>

176
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,792
<font color="#787878">Alex, talk to me. Tell me what happened.</font>

177
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,002
<font color="#787878">I saw it.</font>

178
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,297
<font color="#787878">Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it on the runway.</font>

179
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,840
<font color="#787878">I saw it take off.</font>

180
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,258
<font color="#787878">I saw out my window.</font>

181
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,761
<font color="#787878">~ I saw the ground, and....
~ Carter.</font>

182
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,348
<font color="#787878">The cabin, it starts to shake, right? And the left side blows up.</font>

183
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,350
<font color="#787878">And then the whole plane just explodes.</font>

184
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,020
<font color="#787878">And it was so real. Just like
how everything happens, you know?</font>

185
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,647
<font color="#787878">You been on planes that blew up?</font>

186
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,273
<font color="#787878">You must have fallen asleep.</font>

187
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,360
<font color="#787878">Whoa, we get thrown off the plane.</font>

188
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,362
<font color="#787878">We blow, what, a half a day in Paris....</font>

189
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,948
<font color="#787878">....all because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?</font>

190
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,118
<font color="#787878">But wait, "The plane, it's gonna blow up, it's gonna blow up."</font>

191
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,161
<font color="#787878">~ Hey, hey, fuck you, Horton.
~ Tod.</font>

192
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,872
<font color="#787878">The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital.</font>

193
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,457
<font color="#787878">~ Get off him.
~ Hey, hey.</font>

194
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,668
<font color="#787878">~ Alex, stop it.
~ Come on, now.</font>

195
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,674
<font color="#787878">There they go, here we stay.</font>

196
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,304
<font color="#787878">~ You're paying for my trip.
~ I wish you were on that plane.</font>

197
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,890
<font color="#787878">~ You fucking prick.
~ Oh, shit!</font>

198
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,068
<font color="#787878">~ Call it in.
~ Security....</font>

199
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,331
<font color="#787878">You're looking at me
as if I caused this.</font>

200
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,836
<font color="#787878">I didn't cause this.</font>

201
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,883
<font color="#787878">Are there any survivors?</font>

202
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,973
<font color="#787878">How should I know?</font>

203
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,729
<font color="#787878">~ What, you think I'm some sort of....?
~ He's not a witch.</font>

204
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,739
<font color="#787878">Hello, I'm Howard Seigel,
National Transportation Safety Board.</font>

205
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,660
<font color="#787878">We've contacted all your families. They are on the way.</font>

206
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:50,164
<font color="#787878">Is there anyone here who feels they might need a little medical attention....</font>

207
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,541
<font color="#787878">....or spiritual counseling at this time?</font>

208
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,001
<font color="#787878">What's going on?</font>

209
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,003
<font color="#787878">Are there any survivors?</font>

210
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,841
<font color="#787878">Well, the cause for the explosion is still undetermined.</font>

211
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,302
<font color="#787878">The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.</font>

213
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,848
<font color="#787878">Excuse me.</font>

<font color="#787878">I understand how you all
must be feeling right now.</font>

217
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,023

<font color="#787878">....while they're still
fresh in your mind.</font>

220
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,491
<font color="#787878">This will prove invaluable to our rescue attempts and any criminal investigation.</font>

221
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,541
<font color="#787878">You said, "Listen to me.
This plane will explode on takeoff."</font>

222
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,127
<font color="#787878">How did you know that?</font>

223
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,546
<font color="#787878">I got this feeling.</font>

224
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,382
<font color="#787878">This weird feeling.</font>

225
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,427
<font color="#787878">Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane?</font>

226
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,471
<font color="#787878">Did you take any sleeping pills, any narcotics, hallucinogens?</font>

227
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,974
<font color="#787878">~ Alex, do you take any drugs?
~ No.</font>

228
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,394
<font color="#787878">I saw it.</font>

229
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,231
<font color="#787878">I saw it happen.</font>

230
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,233
<font color="#787878">I saw the plane explode.</font>

231
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,944
<font color="#787878">Did the feelings
have anything to do with your saying....</font>

232
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:06,240
<font color="#787878">....that you wished that Carter Horton was on the plane just before it exploded?</font>

233
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,202
<font color="#787878">~ No.
~ Then why'd you say it?</font>

234
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,622
<font color="#787878">Because I really didn't think
it was gonna happen.</font>

235
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,419
<font color="#787878">If that's the case, Alex, then why did you really get off the plane?</font>

236
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,511
<font color="#787878">My brother, George, he told me
to go and keep an eye on Alex.</font>

237
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,558
<font color="#787878">And so he stayed, and....</font>

238
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,858
<font color="#787878">He told me to get off the plane.</font>

239
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:47,490
<font color="#787878">Larry Murnau said I should get back on, but I told him that he should go.</font>

240
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,577
<font color="#787878">I sent him back on the plane.</font>

241
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,581
<font color="#787878">All right.</font>

242
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,709
<font color="#787878">Nobody forced you off the plane.</font>

243
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,962
<font color="#787878">You said you weren't friends
with those that were.</font>

244
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,382
<font color="#787878">So, Clear,
why did you get off the plane?</font>

245
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,512
<font color="#787878">Because I saw and I heard Alex.</font>

246
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,935
<font color="#787878">And I believed him.</font>

247
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,616
<font color="#787878">Honey.</font>

248
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,495
<font color="#787878">Oh, God.</font>

249
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,417
<font color="#787878">There he is.</font>

250
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,168
<font color="#787878">Over here.</font>

251
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,195
<font color="#787878">Thank you for the ride.</font>

252
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,760
<font color="#787878">You're looking
at the first piece of debris....</font>

253
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,429
<font color="#787878">....to wash ashore
from Volée Air Flight 180....</font>

254

303
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,163

~ Yeah, well, anyways.</font>

307

308
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,759

326
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,820
<font color="#787878">Hey, look, when he gets
over this thing....</font>

327
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,073
<font color="#787878">....you and me,
little road trip to the city, you know?</font>

329
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,161
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Yeah, all right, we'll do that.</font>

330
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,746

335
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,606
<font color="#787878">Because of you, I'm still alive.</font>

336
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,110
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

350
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:03,530
<font color="#787878">You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane, he took his own life.</font>

351
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,949
<font color="#787878">~ No.
~ Time to go.</font>

352
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,954
<font color="#787878">Look, he wouldn't do that.</font>

353
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,040
<font color="#787878">Okay? He said to me we'd be friends again after you got better.</font>

354
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,128
<font color="#787878">Why would he make plans with me if he was thinking about killing himself?</font>

358
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,595

361
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,772
<font color="#787878">Almost autumn.</font>

362
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,649
<font color="#787878">It's only the end of June.</font>

363
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,196
<font color="#787878">Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.</font>

364
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,114
<font color="#787878">If you focus, one week into summer....</font>

365
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,784
<font color="#787878">....you can feel almost feel
autumn coming.</font>

366
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,286
<font color="#787878">Kind of like being able
to see the future.</font>

<font color="#787878">Why were you at Tod's house last night?</font>

00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,130
<font color="#787878">I've seen enough TV to know that the FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.</font>

<font color="#787878">They were there last night.
They don't have a clue....</font>

<font color="#787878">....what caused the crash.</font>

371
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,969
<font color="#787878">They haven't ruled out anything.</font>

372
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,431
<font color="#787878">The fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough.</font>

373
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,185
<font color="#787878">Not to mention that one of those people had a vision, or whatever....</font>

374
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,481
<font color="#787878">....of the plane exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious.</font>

375
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,151
<font color="#787878">And it doesn't help that the visionary's friend just committed suicide.</font>

376
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,613
<font color="#787878">Why were you there last night?</font>

377
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,955
<font color="#787878">Do you know what this is?</font>

378
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,626
<font color="#787878">This is a....</font>

379
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,297
<font color="#787878">Who's the spring-head guy?</font>

380
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,842
<font color="#787878">It's you.</font>

00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,469
<font color="#787878">Not a likeness.</font>

382
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,141
<font color="#787878">It's how you make me feel, Alex.</font>

383
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,017
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry.</font>

384
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,231
<font color="#787878">You know, like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is.</font>

385
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,567
<font color="#787878">It's reluctant to take form.</font>

386
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:51,322
<font color="#787878">And yet, creating an absolute
but incomprehensible attraction.</font>

387
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,786
<font color="#787878">In four years of high school,
we haven't said one word to each other.</font>

388
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,415
<font color="#787878">At that moment on the plane,
I felt what you felt.</font>

389
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,709
<font color="#787878">I didn't know
where those emotions were from....</font>

390
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,128
<font color="#787878">....until you started freaking out.</font>

391
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,049
<font color="#787878">I didn't see what you saw,
but I felt it.</font>

392
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,886
<font color="#787878">You can still feel it, can't you?</font>

393
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,848
<font color="#787878">Something from that day
is still with you.</font>

394
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,603
<font color="#787878">I know because I can still feel you.</font>

395
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,399
<font color="#787878">That's why I was there last night.</font>

396
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,362
<font color="#787878">You know,
I've never dealt with death before.</font>

397
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,866
<font color="#787878">This could all be in our head.</font>

398
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,952
<font color="#787878">It just feels like it's all around us.</font>

399
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,246
<font color="#787878">It?</font>

400
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,376
<font color="#787878">What if Tod was just the first?</font>

401
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,420
<font color="#787878">Of us?</font>

402
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,756
<font color="#787878">Is that something that you're feeling?</font>

403
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,427
<font color="#787878">I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.</font>

404
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,346
<font color="#787878">One last time.</font>

405
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,932
<font color="#787878">So maybe I would know.</font>

406
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,892
<font color="#787878">Then let's go see him.</font>

407
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,466
<font color="#787878">Easy.</font>

408
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,054
<font color="#787878">Gives me a rush.</font>

409
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,516
<font color="#787878">This place?</font>

410
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,727
<font color="#787878">Doing something I'm not supposed to.</font>

411
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,107
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

412
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,280
<font color="#787878">Hurry up.</font>

413
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,463
<font color="#787878">~ Is that him?
~ I think.</font>

414
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,008
<font color="#787878">Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?</font>

415
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,719
<font color="#787878">Yeah, that's him.</font>

416
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,848
<font color="#787878">But whatever it was that made him Tod is definitely gone.</font>

417
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,977
<font color="#787878">Christ.</font>

418
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,813
<font color="#787878">Shh.</font>

419
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,732
<font color="#787878">Please.</font>

420
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,526
<font color="#787878">You'll wake the dead.</font>

421
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,455
<font color="#787878">Why did his hand do that?</font>

422
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:51,294
<font color="#787878">Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasms.</font>

423
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,755
<font color="#787878">Look, um....</font>

424
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,633
<font color="#787878">~ I'm his friend and....
~ I know who you are.</font>

425
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,094
<font color="#787878">What are all those tiny marks?</font>

426
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,890
<font color="#787878">Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.</font>

427
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,017
<font color="#787878">Pulling at the wire?</font>

428
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,103
<font color="#787878">If he was pulling at the wire,
he wasn't trying to kill himself.</font>

429
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:13,274
<font color="#787878">~ It was an accident.
~ In death, there are no accidents.</font>

430
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,402
<font color="#787878">No coincidences. No mishaps.</font>

431
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,905
<font color="#787878">And no escapes.</font>

432
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:25,995
<font color="#787878">What you have to realize is that we're all just a mouse that a cat has by the tail.</font>

433
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:30,917
<font color="#787878">Every single move we make,
from the mundane to the monumental....</font>

434
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,003
<font color="#787878">....the red light that
we stop at or run....</font>

435
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,756
<font color="#787878">....the people we have sex with, or won't with us....</font>

436
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,218
<font color="#787878">....the airplanes that we ride,
or walk out of....</font>

437
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:45,264
<font color="#787878">....it's all part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave.</font>

438
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,476
<font color="#787878">Design?</font>

439
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:54,023
<font color="#787878">Does that mean if you figure out the design, you could cheat death?</font>

440
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,526
<font color="#787878">Alex.</font>

441
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,904
<font color="#787878">You've already done that
by walking off the plane.</font>

442
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,281
<font color="#787878">Your friend's departure shows....</font>

443
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:06,619
<font color="#787878">....that death has a new design
for all of you.</font>

444
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:13,042
<font color="#787878">Now, you have to figure out how
and when it's coming back at you.</font>

445
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,753
<font color="#787878">Play your hunch, Alex.</font>

446
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,132
<font color="#787878">If you think you can get away with it.</font>

447
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:24,303
<font color="#787878">But remember the risk
of cheating the plan....</font>

448
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:28,766
<font color="#787878">....of disrespecting the design
could incite a fury....</font>

449
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,811
<font color="#787878">....that could terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.</font>

450
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,442
<font color="#787878">And you don't even wanna fuck
with that Mack Daddy.</font>

451
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,698
<font color="#787878">Okay, then, well....</font>

452
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,118
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'm sorry we broke in and....</font>

453
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,954
<font color="#787878">No harm. No foul.</font>

454
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,501
<font color="#787878">I'll see you soon.</font>

455
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,844
<font color="#787878">The mortician said
that death has a design.</font>

456
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,637
<font color="#787878">Okay.</font>

457
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,390
<font color="#787878">I'm talking about omens.</font>

458
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,686
<font color="#787878">How do we know that just by sitting here, by sipping this coffee....</font>

459
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,439
<font color="#787878">....or breathing the air
or crossing the intersection....</font>

460
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,235
<font color="#787878">....that we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death....</font>

461
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,696
<font color="#787878">....40 years from now,
10 years from now, tomorrow?</font>

462
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,451
<font color="#787878">We don't unless we open ourselves up....</font>

463
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,121
<font color="#787878">....to the signs it's willing to show us.</font>

464
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,501
<font color="#787878">I don't understand.</font>

465
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,462
<font color="#787878">Did you see Tod die?</font>

466
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,465
<font color="#787878">Did it happen again, like on the plane?</font>

467
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,052
<font color="#787878">No, no, it didn't, but I mean,
it might as well have.</font>

468
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,597
<font color="#787878">This is a message of something, Clear.</font>

469
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,017
<font color="#787878">Or someone, hinting at a design.</font>

470
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:57,522
<font color="#787878">Total bullshit. I mean, you can find death omens anywhere you want to.</font>

471
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,024
<font color="#787878">Coffee.
Starts with a C and ends with an E.</font>

472
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,361
<font color="#787878">So does the word choke.
So, what, we're gonna choke to death?</font>

473
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,779
<font color="#787878">I wanna hear you.</font>

474
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,366
<font color="#787878">We'll go nuts if you
start with this shit.</font>

475
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,703
<font color="#787878">The mortician said
that death has a design, right?</font>

476
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:18,417
<font color="#787878">Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton....</font>

477
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,628
<font color="#787878">....messed up that design
for whatever reason?</font>

478
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,966
<font color="#787878">I saw death's plan, then we cheated it.</font>

479
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,467
<font color="#787878">But what if it was our time?</font>

480
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,053
<font color="#787878">What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?</font>

481
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,557
<font color="#787878">What if it still is our time?</font>

482
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,185
<font color="#787878">If it is, then it's not finished.</font>

483
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,565
<font color="#787878">And we will die now, not later.</font>

484
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,441
<font color="#787878">Unless....</font>

485
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,945
<font color="#787878">Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.</font>

486
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,999
<font color="#787878">After hearing you, I do believe....</font>

487
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,377
<font color="#787878">....that Tod killed himself.</font>

488
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,909
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.</font>

489
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,662
<font color="#787878">~ You all right, man?
~ Hey, baby, come on, not now.</font>

490
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,998
<font color="#787878">~ Carter.
~ Oh.</font>

491
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,250
<font color="#787878">It looks like
we have a bit of a reunion here.</font>

492
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,502
<font color="#787878">~ Let it go.
~ When are you moving?</font>

493
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,795
<font color="#787878">A couple weeks.</font>

494
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,255
<font color="#787878">~ That's too bad.
~ You dick.</font>

495
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,674
<font color="#787878">~ We're losing our favorite teacher.
~ Baby, come on.</font>

496
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,344
<font color="#787878">Look, guys. There's something
I need to tell you, okay?</font>

497
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,011
<font color="#787878">Alex.</font>

498
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:54,038
<font color="#787878">And you lived here
your whole life? Yeah.</font>

499
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,682
<font color="#787878">And now she's gotta move
all because of Browning.</font>

500
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,852
<font color="#787878">Enough, both of you.</font>

501
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,979
<font color="#787878">They died and we lived.</font>

502
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,523
<font color="#787878">Get over it.</font>

503
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,444
<font color="#787878">I will not let this plane crash
be the most important thing in my life.</font>

504
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,490
<font color="#787878">I'm moving on, Carter.</font>

505
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,867
<font color="#787878">And if you wanna waste your life....</font>

506
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,371
<font color="#787878">....beating the shit out of Alex every time you see him....</font>

507
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,499
<font color="#787878">....then you can just drop fucking dead.</font>

508
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,219
<font color="#787878">~ Okay.
~ You look like a smart shopper.</font>

509
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,553
<font color="#787878">Well, thank you.</font>

510
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,598
<font color="#787878">Let's just say you were to see
this knife set in a department store.</font>

511
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,183
<font color="#787878">What do you think you'd have
to pay?</font>

512
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,144
<font color="#787878">Wow, that's a huge knife set,
but how many....?</font>

513
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,945
<font color="#787878">~ Hello?
~ Is Alex there?</font>

514
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,155
<font color="#787878">Oh, hi, Clear. Yeah, just a minute.</font>

515
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,909
<font color="#787878">It's Clear again. You wanna talk to her?</font>

516
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:01,080
<font color="#787878">The economy kept trading
volume below average today, and stocks....</font>

517
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,833
<font color="#787878">Clear, he's in the shower.</font>

518
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,962
<font color="#787878">~ Can I get him to call you back?
~ Sure, bye.</font>

519
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,756
<font color="#787878">She's concerned about you.</font>

520
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,675
<font color="#787878">I'm concerned about you.</font>

521
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,468
<font color="#787878">Why won't you talk to her?</font>

522
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,679
<font color="#787878">Or me?</font>

523
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,724
<font color="#787878">~ Which could put a cloud
over both stocks and bonds.</font>

524
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,435
<font color="#787878">Dad, you and Mom
have both been a big help.</font>

525
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:27,356
<font color="#787878">But there's something I need to understand before I can talk to anyone.</font>

526
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,859
<font color="#787878">~ The Dow down 75.</font>

527
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,154
<font color="#787878">The National Transportation Safety Board has a new theory tonight....</font>

528
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,824
<font color="#787878">....on the possible cause of the explosion of Volée Air Flight 180.</font>

529
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,952
<font color="#787878">Officials believe
deterioration of silicon insulation....</font>

530
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,621
<font color="#787878">....on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump....</font>

531
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,540
<font color="#787878">....may have leaked combustible fluids.</font>

532
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,126
<font color="#787878">~ A spark in the fuel switch....
~ That's Tod's seat.</font>

533
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,213
<font color="#787878">....in the fuselage may have ignited the fuel line and proceeded to the fuel pump....</font>

534
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,717
<font color="#787878">....which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.</font>

535
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,166
<font color="#787878">The path of the explosion.</font>

536
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,962
<font color="#787878">Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.</font>

537
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,632
<font color="#787878">They're dying in the order
they would have died.</font>

538
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,926
<font color="#787878">That's death's design.</font>

539
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,970
<font color="#787878">Miss Lewton's next.</font>

540
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,974
<font color="#787878">And whenever I can
fall asleep, I just....</font>

541
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,434
<font color="#787878">I see Terry Chaney.</font>

542
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,229
<font color="#787878">And in the day, out of nowhere....</font>

543
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,856
<font color="#787878">....I hear the sound of my own voice in my head....</font>

544
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,191
<font color="#787878">....saying to Larry Murnau:</font>

545
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,986
<font color="#787878">"No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane."</font>

546
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,781
<font color="#787878">Everything reminds me of that day.</font>

547
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,910
<font color="#787878">Right, yeah.</font>

548
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,495
<font color="#787878">I'm hoping a change will help.</font>

549
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:10,376
<font color="#787878">It's just that I've lived here
my whole life, you know?</font>

550
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,337
<font color="#787878">And everywhere I looked
were great memories.</font>

551
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,048
<font color="#787878">And now all I see is Larry....</font>

552
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,427
<font color="#787878">....and those kids, you know?</font>

553
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:24,849
<font color="#787878">Just looking out my own front yard makes me feel nothing but fear.</font>

554
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,066
<font color="#787878">Laura, I'm gonna have to call you back.</font>

555
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,734
<font color="#787878">Right.</font>

556
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,204
<font color="#787878">Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.</font>

557
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,733
<font color="#787878">What are you doing here?</font>

558
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,110
<font color="#787878">I was just....</font>

559
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,572
<font color="#787878">I was checking the air in the tire to make sure it's safe.</font>

560
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,115
<font color="#787878">Get in the car.</font>

561
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,837
<font color="#787878">Put on your seat belt.</font>

562
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:05,199
<font color="#787878">I believe that Miss Lewton is next.</font>

563
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,284
<font color="#787878">~ Next?
~ Yes.</font>

564
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:14,333
<font color="#787878">Yeah, next, because there's this pattern that's occurring.</font>

565
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,795
<font color="#787878">Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too, huh?</font>

566
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,355
<font color="#787878">Mom's favorite.</font>

567
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,546
<font color="#787878">So, what about this pattern, Alex?</font>

568
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,840
<font color="#787878">Did you see it
in another one of your visions?</font>

569
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,217
<font color="#787878">Did you catch it in some TV static?</font>

570
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,098
<font color="#787878">You know, I never asked
for what happened on the plane.</font>

571
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,853
<font color="#787878">You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs and make fun of me. Whatever, it's fine.</font>

572
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,772
<font color="#787878">But I saved six lives on that plane.</font>

573
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,651
<font color="#787878">Six lives, and everybody in my
entire school thinks I'm a freak.</font>

574
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,739
<font color="#787878">And I'm not.... I'm not suffering from posttraumatic stress.</font>

575
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,200
<font color="#787878">I don't have a narcissistic
deity complex.</font>

576
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,454
<font color="#787878">I'm not going Dahmer on you guys.</font>

577
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,788
<font color="#787878">This just is.</font>

578
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,250
<font color="#787878">There is a pattern for us all.</font>

579
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,128
<font color="#787878">There's a pattern for you,
there is a pattern for you.</font>

580
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,714
<font color="#787878">There's a design for everyone.
I don't know how yet.</font>

581
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,966
<font color="#787878">But I'm gonna break this one.</font>

582
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,132
<font color="#787878">Alex, you came to our
attention at first....</font>

583
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,343
<font color="#787878">....because you were under suspicion in this plane explosion.</font>

584
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:15,639
<font color="#787878">Now, I know
you didn't blow up the plane.</font>

585
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:21,061
<font color="#787878">And we were ready to move on, but then the other survivors started to die.</font>

586
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,980
<font color="#787878">First, your friend Tod.</font>

587
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,566
<font color="#787878">Then Terry Chaney,
while you were there at the scene.</font>

588
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,444
<font color="#787878">And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.</font>

589
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,821
<font color="#787878">Alex, nobody has control
over life and death.</font>

590
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,366
<font color="#787878">Unless they are taking lives
and causing death.</font>

591
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,327
<font color="#787878">Now, can you promise me
that no one else is going to die?</font>

592
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,872
<font color="#787878">No, I can't.</font>

593
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,000
<font color="#787878">As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control, I'm sorry.</font>

594
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:53,135
<font color="#787878">Okay, go ahead. Get out of here.</font>

595
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,971
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

596
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,148
<font color="#787878">That kid gives me the creeps.</font>

597
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,567
<font color="#787878">What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.</font>

598
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,360
<font color="#787878">That's not what I'm talking about.</font>

599
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,280
<font color="#787878">There were a couple of moments there....</font>

600
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,283
<font color="#787878">....where I almost believed him.</font>

601
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,329
<font color="#787878">Can I tell you something?
Don't take this the wrong way.</font>

602
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,706
<font color="#787878">But sometimes, you give me the creeps.</font>

603
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,559
<font color="#787878">You've gotta stop this.
Stop this, it's a stupid mug.</font>

604
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,938
<font color="#787878">You're out of here.
Pretty soon, you'll be gone.</font>

605
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,814
<font color="#787878">You'll be gone.</font>

606
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,239
<font color="#787878">Miss Lewton.</font>

607
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,500
<font color="#787878">Miss Lewton.</font>

608
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,420
<font color="#787878">Okay, all right, okay.</font>

609
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,589
<font color="#787878">Just stay still, okay?</font>

610
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,516
<font color="#787878">Oh, God. Oh, God. Miss Lewton.</font>

611
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,741
<font color="#787878">Hey, Alex.</font>

612
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,972
<font color="#787878">Dude.</font>

613
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,226
<font color="#787878">I don't know where he is.</font>

614
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,271
<font color="#787878">~ He's not talking to me.
~ Why?</font>

615
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,440
<font color="#787878">Because I didn't believe him.</font>

616
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,816
<font color="#787878">If he does contact you....</font>

617
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,486
<font color="#787878">....I think it would be in the best interest of your safety if you called us.</font>

618
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,406
<font color="#787878">Now, here's my card.</font>

619
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,074
<font color="#787878">Toll-free number.</font>

620
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,747
<font color="#787878">Interesting work.</font>

621
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,426
<font color="#787878">Carter, you dick.</font>

622
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,278
<font color="#787878">What are you doing?</font>

623
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,783
<font color="#787878">Terry's name should be on this wall.</font>

624
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,704
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

625
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,874
<font color="#787878">Why'd you want us
to meet you here anyway, huh?</font>

626
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,544
<font color="#787878">Because they're watching me,
see if I go to Alex.</font>

627
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,630
<font color="#787878">That's why you're taking me.</font>

628
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,089
<font color="#787878">Why would I wanna see him?</font>

629
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,968
<font color="#787878">Because he knows
which one of us is next.</font>

630
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,735
<font color="#787878">So drive the speed limit, okay?</font>

631
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,988
<font color="#787878">Oh, and don't pass on the right.</font>

632
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,407
<font color="#787878">Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.</font>

633
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,786
<font color="#787878">You're the next one, man.</font>

634
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,704
<font color="#787878">Hey, man, why'd you say that?</font>

635
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:58,333
<font color="#787878">Because if you say another word, I'm gonna fucking kill you.</font>

636
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,439
<font color="#787878">He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down.</font>

637
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,317
<font color="#787878">So you guys drive down there,
we'll meet around the middle.</font>

638
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,444
<font color="#787878">It'll take half the time.</font>

639
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,727
<font color="#787878">Do you think they're still up there?</font>

640
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:04,316
<font color="#787878">Somehow, Flight 180,
are they still in flight?</font>

641
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,569
<font color="#787878">Somewhere, are they safe?</font>

642
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,701
<font color="#787878">When I was a kid, like 6 or 7....</font>

643
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,495
<font color="#787878">....I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.</font>

644
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,457
<font color="#787878">Lying awake at night just worrying.</font>

645
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,918
<font color="#787878">Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.</font>

646
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,795
<font color="#787878">Most kids never have it happen.</font>

647
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,512
<font color="#787878">When I was 10, my dad went into
a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.</font>

648
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,182
<font color="#787878">I guess that he heard someone say, "Don't turn around."</font>

649
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,685
<font color="#787878">So on reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.</font>

650
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,647
<font color="#787878">And the guy blew his head off.</font>

651
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,192
<font color="#787878">Life became shit after that.</font>

652
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,904
<font color="#787878">My mom just couldn't deal anymore.</font>

653
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,281
<font color="#787878">She married this asshole....</font>

654
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:57,702
<font color="#787878">....who my mom with my real dad would have crossed the street to avoid this guy.</font>

655
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,873
<font color="#787878">He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.</font>

656
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,963
<font color="#787878">If that was the design
for my father and my family....</font>

657
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,298
<font color="#787878">....then fuck death.</font>

658
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:15,637
<font color="#787878">God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere, Alex.</font>

659
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,474
<font color="#787878">It exists, that place.
Where my dad is still safe.</font>

660
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:23,812
<font color="#787878">Where he had a full pack of cigarettes that night and just kept driving.</font>

661
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,731
<font color="#787878">Where me and my mom
and my dad are still together....</font>

662
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,901
<font color="#787878">....and have no idea
about this life here.</font>

663
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,656
<font color="#787878">Where our friends are still in the sky.</font>

664
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,827
<font color="#787878">Where everyone gets a second chance.</font>

665
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,872
<font color="#787878">Alex, we can't give up.</font>

666
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,545
<font color="#787878">Look, I can't go home.</font>

667
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,756
<font color="#787878">All right? After Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.</font>

668
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,758
<font color="#787878">No, we're taking you to my dad's cabin.</font>

669
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,593
<font color="#787878">It's only a couple miles from my house.</font>

670
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,763
<font color="#787878">All right, Browning,
you fucking warlock.</font>

671
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:03,143
<font color="#787878">~ Did you know about Miss Lewton, or what?
~ Why do you think I was hiding?</font>

672
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,312
<font color="#787878">Billy told the FBI
he saw you running from her house.</font>

673
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,189
<font color="#787878">I was running because they blame me.</font>

674
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,484
<font color="#787878">They blame me for Tod, they blame me for her, for the plane crash.</font>

675
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:15,989
<font color="#787878">The fire, like, caramelized her blood, Alex. Your shoe prints were in it.</font>

676
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,242
<font color="#787878">~ Your fingerprints were on the knives.
~ I told you they were not....</font>

677
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,997
<font color="#787878">I'm not talking about whether or not you did it. Or even if you knew she was dead.</font>

678
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,208
<font color="#787878">Did you know she was gonna be next before she was?</font>

679
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,258
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I did.</font>

680
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:39,596
<font color="#787878">~ I knew.
~ All right.</font>

681
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:43,558
<font color="#787878">Out of us, who's next to see it?</font>

682
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:47,645
<font color="#787878">Please, tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win a Super Bowl.</font>

683
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,107
<font color="#787878">It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.</font>

684
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,529
<font color="#787878">I knew I should have felt up Tammy in the pool that time.</font>

685
01:07:56,697 --> 01:08:01,493
<font color="#787878">~ What are you whining about? I'm next.
~ He didn't say anything. Just drive.</font>

686
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,454
<font color="#787878">You have a responsibility to tell me.</font>

687
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,165
<font color="#787878">Do you think it's gonna make it
easier to know, Carter?</font>

688
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,503
<font color="#787878">Huh? It's not,
it's gonna make it fucking harder.</font>

689
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,672
<font color="#787878">You know, you get off
having control over me.</font>

690
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,052
<font color="#787878">~ You let me decide how to deal with it.
~ It doesn't matter who's next.</font>

691
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,846
<font color="#787878">Because we're all
on the same list. All of us.</font>

692
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,018
<font color="#787878">Oh, fuck. Really?</font>

693
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,861
<font color="#787878">All right, then why bother?
What's the fucking point, right?</font>

694
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:40,698
<font color="#787878">Me and Terry, we'll be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?</font>

695
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,785
<font color="#787878">Carter, what are you doing?</font>

696
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,747
<font color="#787878">Carter, slow down.</font>

697
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,041
<font color="#787878">~ Slow down, Carter!
~ Fuck you.</font>

698
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,547
<font color="#787878">~ Knock it off.
~ May as well go out on my own free will.</font>

699
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,215
<font color="#787878">Not with us in the fucking car.</font>

700
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,890
<font color="#787878">~ Jesus, Carter, no.
~ Stop it.</font>

701
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,351
<font color="#787878">Carter, stop the car.</font>

702
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,562
<font color="#787878">Hey, what's the worry
if it ain't your time?</font>

703
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,398
<font color="#787878">I could get nailed
and you all wouldn't give a shit, right?</font>

704
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,526
<font color="#787878">~ It's only me.
~ It doesn't work that way, Carter.</font>

705
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,245
<font color="#787878">And I fucking hated French class.</font>

706
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,582
<font color="#787878">~ Control yourself.
~ That's what I'm doing.

707
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,418
<font color="#787878">I know what you're doing.
And it's all right to be scared.

708
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,171
<font color="#787878">I'm not afraid, all right?
I decide when it's time.

709
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,090
<font color="#787878">I control my life, I control my death.

710
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,843
<font color="#787878">You don't have to prove to us
how big your balls are. Not now.</font>

711
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,600
<font color="#787878">~ Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.
~ What are you doing?</font>

712
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,355
<font color="#787878">Fuck it, Carter, Jesus Christ.
Carter, put your hands back on the wheel.</font>

713
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,608
<font color="#787878">~ Carter, stop.
~ Hands on the wheel, Carter.</font>

714
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,777
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

715
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,573
<font color="#787878">Okay, Carter, easy.</font>

716
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,534
<font color="#787878">I am so close to puking
right now, you don't even wanna know.</font>

717
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,915
<font color="#787878">We're afraid too, Carter,
but we're not going to quit.</font>

718
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:15,168
<font color="#787878">Stop what you're doing
and stop this fucking car.</font>

719
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,297
<font color="#787878">Damn it, Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.</font>

720
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,816
<font color="#787878">~ Billy.
~ Move it.</font>

721
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,778
<font color="#787878">~ Hey, open the door, Billy.
~ Move the fucking car!</font>

722
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,822
<font color="#787878">~ Hey, open the fucking door.
~ Move the car.</font>

723
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,032

724
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,159
<font color="#787878">~ Open the door.
~ Easy, easy, open the door.</font>

725
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,662
<font color="#787878">~ Open the door.
~ Billy, open the fucking door!</font>

726
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,664
<font color="#787878">~ Billy, open it!
~ Open the door!</font>

727
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:53,915

728
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,672
<font color="#787878">Carter, listen to me. Don't do this.</font>

729
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,721
<font color="#787878">Goddamn it! Get out of the fucking car.</font>

730
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,474
<font color="#787878">Carter, listen to me. Hey, listen to me.</font>

731
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,684
<font color="#787878">This isn't the way.</font>

732
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,644
<font color="#787878">It's not the way. Get out of the car.</font>

733
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,604
<font color="#787878">~ Come on!
~ It's coming, it's coming!</font>

734
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,152
<font color="#787878">~ Carter.
~ It ain't my time.</font>

735
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,540
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

736
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,002
<font color="#787878">Carter, listen to me. This isn't the way. Get out of the car, Carter.</font>

737
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,713
<font color="#787878">Carter, get out of the car.</font>

738
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,465
<font color="#787878">Come on, get out!</font>

739
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,224
<font color="#787878">I can't get out!</font>

740
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,688
<font color="#787878">Alex! No!</font>

741
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,487
<font color="#787878">Man, he really is next.</font>

742
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,199
<font color="#787878">~ Get out!
~ Get out!</font>

743
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,909

745
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,352
<font color="#787878">I saw it. I saw the belt.</font>

746
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,771
<font color="#787878">~ Scared now?
~ It broke.</font>

747
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,732
<font color="#787878">Bullshit. He saved your life again.</font>

748
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,108
<font color="#787878">That's right.</font>

749
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,279
<font color="#787878">You're next, Carter.
I'm staying the fuck away from you.</font>

750
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,782
<font color="#787878">~ Shut up.
~ We don't need this shit right now.</font>

751
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,285
<font color="#787878">I don't need it ever. What are you doing? Get away from him, he's next.</font>

752
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,120
<font color="#787878">Hey, fuck you, Billy. I'm not dead.</font>

753
01:12:56,288 --> 01:13:00,458
<font color="#787878">Oh, you will be.
You're dead, you're dead.</font>

754
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,294
<font color="#787878">And you ain't taking me with you!</font>

755
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:09,050
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</font>

756
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,561
<font color="#787878">Jesus fucking Christ!</font>

757
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,941
<font color="#787878">You should've been next.
You should've been next after Lewton.</font>

758
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,901
<font color="#787878">That's the plan. That's the design.</font>

759
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,278
<font color="#787878">~ You should be dead.
~ You're the fucking devil.</font>

760
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,114
<font color="#787878">I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip.</font>

761
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,200
<font color="#787878">That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.</font>

762
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,743
<font color="#787878">Just like the explosion, I saw it.</font>

763
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,912
<font color="#787878">~ The police are coming.
~ Fuck, I saved him.</font>

764
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,122
<font color="#787878">Because I saved him....</font>

765
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,834
<font color="#787878">....it skipped Carter, went to the next in the path of the explosion, Billy.</font>

766
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,502
<font color="#787878">I have to see it.</font>

767
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,673
<font color="#787878">And if I see it, then I intervene. And if I intervene, I cheat the design.</font>

768
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,300
<font color="#787878">What, intervene?
What are you, God now?</font>

769
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,469
Gods aren't afraid to die.</font>

770
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,972
<font color="#787878">Gods don't die. We do.</font>

771
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,015
<font color="#787878">~ You know?
~ Baby, you're losing it, okay?</font>

772
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,726
<font color="#787878">The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.</font>

773
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,854
<font color="#787878">You can hide,
and get your head together.</font>

774
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:06,899
<font color="#787878">Okay, after Billy, I'm next. I'm next.</font>

775
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,695
<font color="#787878">~ And then me.
~ Hey, hey, hey, listen.</font>

776
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,488
<font color="#787878">I'm not gonna let it happen, okay?</font>

777
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,949
<font color="#787878">~ Listen to me, all right?
~ Hey, hey, hey.</font>

778
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,869
<font color="#787878">Why don't you two
just get the fuck out of here?</font>

779
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,419
<font color="#787878">Rusted.</font>

780
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,880
<font color="#787878">Tetanus.</font>

781
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,841
<font color="#787878">Nice one.</font>

782
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,136
<font color="#787878">I overlooked it.</font>

783
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:28,893
<font color="#787878">You tried to capitalize.
But I caught you, you fuck.</font>

784
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,562
<font color="#787878">I can beat you.</font>

785
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:37,777
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I mean, not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you now!</font>

786
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:33,249
<font color="#787878">~ She was there a minute ago.
~ What are you talking about?</font>

787
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,793
<font color="#787878">I'm not turning him in.</font>

788
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,796
<font color="#787878">It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.</font>

789
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,427
<font color="#787878">~ I go with you.
~ You can't.</font>

790
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,348
<font color="#787878">Clear, you just tell us where he is.</font>

791
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,142
<font color="#787878">Wait at home, I give you my word....</font>

792
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:54,478
<font color="#787878">....that we will bring him in safely in protective custody.</font>

793
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,427
<font color="#787878">I never moved.</font>

794
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,181
<font color="#787878">Christa asked me to change seats but I never moved.</font>

795
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:33,142
<font color="#787878">I would've been up next to Tod.</font>

796
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,895
<font color="#787878">Fuck, why didn't I remember that?</font>

797
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,355
<font color="#787878">I never moved.
Clear's seat was in front of mine.</font>

798
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,540
<font color="#787878">She's next.</font>

799
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,580
<font color="#787878">Alex!</font>

800
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,042
<font color="#787878">Alex!</font>

801
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:43,379
<font color="#787878">Come on, get in the car.
We're going around. Get in the car.</font>

802
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,588
<font color="#787878">Come on!</font>

803
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,757
<font color="#787878">~ Go!
~ Move!</font>

804
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,829
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

805
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,824
<font color="#787878">~ There!
~ Come on, let's go, over here.</font>

806
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,247
<font color="#787878">Alex!</font>

807
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,124
<font color="#787878">Alex, we're trying to help you.</font>

808
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,962
<font color="#787878">Fritz, get away from it.</font>

809
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:20,768
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

810
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:25,689
<font color="#787878">Alex!</font>

811
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:52,883
<font color="#787878">Run!</font>

812
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,472
<font color="#787878">We lost him.</font>

813
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,267
<font color="#787878">From the direction,
there's only one place he's heading.</font>

814
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,768
<font color="#787878">No shit.</font>

815
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,483
<font color="#787878">Clear!</font>

816
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,956
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

817
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,379
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God.</font>

818
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,470
<font color="#787878">Don't move. Stay there.</font>

819
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,558
<font color="#787878">Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.</font>

820
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,685
<font color="#787878">You're grounded by the tires, okay?</font>

821
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,758
<font color="#787878">The car's gonna explode.</font>

822
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,432
<font color="#787878">I can only hold on for so long,
you know what to do.</font>

823
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,100
<font color="#787878">Don't!</font>

824
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,561
<font color="#787878">When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll be over.</font>

825
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:36,398
<font color="#787878">~ It's the only way we can cheat death again.
~ No, don't!</font>

826
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:40,110
<font color="#787878">Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both. You know what to do.</font>

827
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,073
<font color="#787878">I'll always be with you.</font>

828
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:49,536
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

829
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,627
<font color="#787878">Alex! Alex, get away from there.</font>

830
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,254
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

831
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,775
<font color="#787878">Alex. Alex.</font>

832
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:25,614
<font color="#787878">Damn it, you can't do this to me.</font>

833
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,158
<font color="#787878">Come on, baby. Come on.</font>

834
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,701
<font color="#787878">Alex, Alex?</font>

835
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:33,914
<font color="#787878">Alex, Alex?
Oh, shit, he's not breathing.</font>

836
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,833
<font color="#787878">Hold on, Alex. Come on, stay with me.</font>

837
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:16,665
<font color="#787878">~ Well, we made it.
~ Paris, I can't believe it.</font>

838
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,875
<font color="#787878">I just can't believe
we got on a plane again.</font>

839
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,044
<font color="#787878">You know what I'm saying?</font>

840
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,323
<font color="#787878">Wow.</font>

841
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,241
<font color="#787878">It's weird being here, huh?</font>

842
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,744
<font color="#787878">We finally completed a puzzle.</font>

843
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,082
<font color="#787878">It's just there's something missing, you know?</font>

844
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,170
<font color="#787878">~ To Terry.
~ Yeah.</font>

845
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,340
<font color="#787878">~ To Tod.
~ To all of our friends that can't be here.</font>

846
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:08,842
<font color="#787878">~ Cheers.
~ Cheers.</font>

847
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:12,763
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

848
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:15,766
<font color="#787878">If you would have told me
six months ago....</font>

849
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:19,061
<font color="#787878">....that the three of us
would be sitting here having a drink....</font>

850
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,354
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah.
~ I don't know.</font>

851
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,023
<font color="#787878">I mean, sometimes it just feels
like the two of you....</font>

852
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,776
<font color="#787878">....are the only ones
who can really understand.</font>

853
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:33,700
<font color="#787878">You were right, Browning.
It did skip us. There was a design.</font>

854
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:36,370
<font color="#787878">We beat it. You know, we won.</font>

855
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,749
<font color="#787878">I think the only thing we won, Carter, is a chance at a full life.</font>

856
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:44,669
<font color="#787878">A chance that I won't ever waste.</font>

857
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:48,131
<font color="#787878">Yeah, there's just something....</font>

858
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:50,384
<font color="#787878">You know, something I can't figure out.</font>

859
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,886
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ About the design.</font>

860
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,847
<font color="#787878">Alex, just let it go. All right?</font>

861
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:58,266
<font color="#787878">I swear.... Just hear me out, all right?</font>

862
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,020
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, my God.
~ It's just.... Listen.</font>

863
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:06,608
<font color="#787878">Now, the path of the explosion determined the order of our deaths, right?</font>

864
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,777
<font color="#787878">When I intervened and saved Carter....</font>

865
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:12,447
<font color="#787878">....it skipped him and went to the next person in the path. It went to Billy.</font>

866
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,241
<font color="#787878">All right, and then it was Clear.</font>

867
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,412
<font color="#787878">But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me, but in my case....</font>

868
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,081
<font color="#787878">....no one intervened, right?</font>

869
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,209
<font color="#787878">I was thrown from that power line by the explosion.</font>

870
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:27,129
<font color="#787878">~ So....
~ So why did it skip you, right?</font>

871
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,590
<font color="#787878">How do we know that this isn't exactly what was meant to happen?</font>

872
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:34,594
<font color="#787878">That out of everyone on Flight 180, you, me and Carter were meant to live.</font>

873
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,140
<font color="#787878">Maybe that was the design all along.</font>

874
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,685
<font color="#787878">~ Or you could still be next.
~ Shut up, Carter.</font>

875
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,229
<font color="#787878">What? I didn't make up the rules.</font>

876
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,898
<font color="#787878">Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.</font>

877
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:50,318
<font color="#787878">Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.</font>
