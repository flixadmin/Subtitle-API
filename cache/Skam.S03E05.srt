1
00:00:01.085 --> 00:00:04.060
Emma, you're damn beautiful.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.060
It's Magnus' birthday on Saturday. I and Mahdi are planning to arrange something cool for him.

3
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.057
Yes! I'm all in, man!

4
00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:14.077
I've talked to Sonja, and she was wondering whether we could pre-drink at your place.

5
00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:17.040
Stop surveilling me.

6
00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:19.082
Let's go!

7
00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.082
Uhm, where?

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.094
Anywhere...

9
00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:55.068
SATURDAY 15:15

10
00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:39.097
-Which one was it?
-It's just a Nicolas Cage movie... in which he doesn't overplay.

11
00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:45.002
-Is that even possible?
-I think so...

12
00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:53.011
I actually think life is like a movie. That one can sort of be the director of one's own life.

13
00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:56.022
Do you get what I mean?

14
00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:59.025
-I do... I don't quite agree, though.
-You don't agree?

15
00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:06.037
-Nah... What's really interesting is the infinity.
-What?

16
00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:15.071
All the parallel universes, and all, kind of, how big everything is, and how small we are compared to the infinite parallel universes that exist, and...

17
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:21.074
everything that can happen is going to happen. Or not just going to happen it is happening.

18
00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:36.038
I'm sure that in a parallel universe there's an Isak and an Even who's lying in the exact same way in the exact same place, only, like...

19
00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:43.010


20
00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:43.090
...the curtains are of a different color or something...

21
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.012
So... yellow curtains, then?

22
00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.042
Yeah.

23
00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:53.078
No...

24
00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:58.074
-I think you've had enough jay [joint] now.
-Haven't you ever thought about that?

25
00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:03.080
Yeah, but I'm just starting to feel so... I don't know, lonely.
-It's so interesting, though!

26
00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:06.052
No, I don't like it, man.

27
00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:10.032
-Why not?
-I don't know.

28
00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:14.014
It often freaks me out.

29
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.040
-Jesus, in what way? It freaks you out?
-Not freaked out like you get from watching horror movies, but...

30
00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:28.022
Like... Feeling alone, that sort of freaked out, I guess.

31
00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:34.072
That like... it's your head... it's you and your head... and all of your thoughts.

32
00:03:36.068 --> 00:03:40.072
-Alone in your head, what do you mean?
A "The Mind is Alone" feeling.

33
00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.068
A, what feeling? The mind is alone?

34
00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:49.090
Because the only thing that exists is you and your thoughts, right? You can't escape from your own thoughts.

35
00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:53.036
The only way to do that is to die.

36
00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:57.042
That's dark, though.

37
00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:01.056
-Yeah, but haven't you ever thought about that?
-No.

38
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.056
Jeez! I'd forgotten how young you are, man!

39
00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:08.056


40
00:04:09.092 --> 00:04:11.048
What is it?

41
00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:14.050
Are you just going to spend your whole day in there?

42
00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.060
I'm sleeping!!!

43
00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:24.016
Okey...? Whose shoes are those in the hallway?

44
00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:30.090
They're... they're Jonas'. I borrowed them.

45
00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:37.086
-Okay...
-Damn... Fucking babysitter, man.

46
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.094
How did you end up in this ap... in this flatshare?

47
00:04:44.052 --> 00:04:52.046
I... It was actually just... hehe... There was this one night when I was fucking shitfaced drunk and then I met Eskil...

48
00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:58.050
-Okay... So, he seduced you, then?
-No!

49
00:04:58.094 --> 00:05:02.024
Or, what the fuck do I know, I actually don't remember.

50
00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:08.068
I think he just felt sorry for me, because, as I said, I was completely blacked out, and...

51
00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:16.064
...my dad had just left my mom, you know. So... yeah.

52
00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:23.032
He... The thing was, I didn't want to go home.

53
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.010
So, he brought... me here. And then, blah, blah, blah.

54
00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:34.028
Okay, blah, blah blah. Good story.

55
00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:40.060
-You can have it. Make a movie.
-I am going to make a movie about you.

56
00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:42.030
Okay...

57
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.070
-Do you wanna know what it's called?

58
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.070


59
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.022
"The Boy Who Couldn't Manage to Hold His Breath Under Water."

60
00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:58.006
That sounds like a pompous, totally shitty movie!

61
00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:05.058
Yeah, and anyway, I can, in fact, hold my breath under water. But I just got a drop of water in my throat.

62
00:06:07.018 --> 00:06:10.064
-Drop of water in your throad, is it? Yeah.
-Yeah...

63
00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:12.064


64
00:06:23.004 --> 00:06:25.074
So, that's that.

65
00:06:27.034 --> 00:06:30.022
I'm so fucked right now.

66
00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:45.062
Can't I just...

67
00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:48.066
...stay in here with you forever?

68
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.024
Can I?

69
00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:55.076
You can...

70
00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:37.060
SUNDAY 09:32

71
00:07:56.072 --> 00:08:07.004
YOU ARE HOT â¤
DROP OF WATER â†’ 
AT THE SAME TIME, AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACE IN(?) THE UNIVERSE.

72
00:08:33.024 --> 00:08:35.036
Hey!

73
00:08:36.002 --> 00:08:37.036
Hello.

74
00:08:37.098 --> 00:08:39.020
What are you doing?

75
00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:42.098
-I'm cleaning...
-Good morning!

76
00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:44.076
The wall...?

77
00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:46.058
[TV or radio about politics in Bergen is on in the background.]

78
00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:49.038
Yes, that's...

79
00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:53.020
-So... hi, good morning, Isak!
-Good morning!
-So...

80
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.020
That guy Even was really cool!

81
00:08:57.088 --> 00:09:00.056
-Oh, you met him?
-Ye... I mean... yeah!

82
00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:03.034
In the bathroom this morning.

83
00:09:05.008 --> 00:09:06.072
So, yeah, wh... who's that?

84
00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:10.070
Uhm, just a bud... buddy.

85
00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:14.046
Okay...?

86
00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:24.018
MONDAY 11:52

87
00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:36.092
-Excuse me, isn't Even at school today?
-No, I haven't seen Even today.

88
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.064
-And it's inside [incomprehensible].
-No, but it's not inside [incomprehensible]. It's in a sort of room, by the side.

89
00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:49.018
-[Incomprehensible]
-Because when we got closer to her, she had sort of... stubbles in the face.
-She wasn't a full ten, but...
-A girl?!

90
00:09:49.044 --> 00:09:52.008
-Yeah, didn't you see her? 
-No!
-It was on your birthday, though.

91
00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:54.080
-Yeah, I know, but I was so fucking stressed...
-Fuck!!!

92
00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:59.050
You had your birthday.. Sorry, bro!

93
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.076
Yeah, I... Congrats!
-Thanks.
-You're 17 now, man!

94
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:11.016


95
00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:17.008
I was at this fucking family gathering, man... So boring...

96
00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:24.088
-So what happened, guys?
-Well, these dudes hooked me up with Vilde, you know.

97
00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:28.028
-No?!! Did you hook up?

98
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.044
-No, almost.
-Right, almost!

99
00:10:31.044 --> 00:10:35.072
-That was almost, what the fuck!!!
-Yes, yes, that was almost.
-Huh, what happened?

100
00:10:35.072 --> 00:10:38.070
No, it was just... It was a long story, bro.

101
00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:42.036
-But, that girl with a mustache...
-Oh, fucking hell...
-I don't believe you, a mustache, I saw...

102
00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:47.012
You had to have seen her! I mean, like, when you, like, got close to kiss her, that's when you noticed.

103
00:10:47.012 --> 00:10:49.092
-Why kiss a girl if she has a mustache?!
-Because she was fucking hot!!

104
00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:54.062
But when you got close, you're not keen on [incomprehensible] right!

105
00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:56.032
Fuck!

106
00:10:56.032 --> 00:10:58.032


107
00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:02.084
WEDNESDAY 10:34

108
00:11:33.072 --> 00:11:36.040
-Hi.
-Hey.

109
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:55.020
Where have you been?

110
00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:02.025
I....

111
00:12:02.034 --> 00:12:04.051
...have told Sonja about you.

112
00:12:05.082 --> 00:12:09.085
And we have decided to take a break.

113
00:12:19.017 --> 00:12:22.022
What are your thoughts on that?

114
00:12:26.054 --> 00:12:30.005
Cool.

115
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:33.017
Yeah?

116
00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:41.082
Or, if... If, or... If, if that's making you sad, then of course that's, of course... I hope that's not my fault then.

117
00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:48.005
Of course I'm not sad!

118
00:12:48.057 --> 00:12:50.034
No...?

119
00:12:50.034 --> 00:12:52.034
No!

120
00:13:15.077 --> 00:13:22.097
What...do you think your parents would say if I became your boyfriend?

121
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:37.031
I... think it would have been fine.

122
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:39.031
Yeah?

123
00:13:43.074 --> 00:13:47.097
Or... My dad would probably not object to it.

124
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:52.097
But your mom would?

125
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.097
My mom is nuts.

126
00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:04.031
In what way?

127
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:08.068
She... No, I mean, it's all crazy.

128
00:14:08.068 --> 00:14:11.080
She thinks the world is about to end.

129
00:14:13.014 --> 00:14:16.082
That my uncle is Donald Trump, like, it's...

130
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.065
My uncle is not Donald Trump.

131
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.068
Okay...

132
00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:31.062
But anyway, yeah. She doesn't mean shit, I haven't talked to her since I moved out.

133
00:14:33.082 --> 00:14:36.068
So you're not in contact anymore?

134
00:14:36.068 --> 00:14:44.008
No... Well, I've decided that my life is better without mentally ill people around me.

135
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:06.008
What do you think your parents, then, would say about... me?

136
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.080
I think they'd love you.

137
00:15:27.062 --> 00:15:30.080
[Incomprehensible.]

138
00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:32.080
- I need something to drink.
[Incomprehensible.]

139
00:15:33.002 --> 00:15:35.022
- Come on, guys, let's go to Kiwi [supermarket.]
-Kiwi, yeah, alright.

140
00:15:35.037 --> 00:15:37.090
Did you see Helene today?
[Incomprehensible.]

141
00:15:38.056 --> 00:15:41.068
THURSDAY 17:15

142
00:16:14.004 --> 00:16:22.072
Hi. I've now been washing stairs for six hours and am dying of an OD-day* overdose. What have you done today? Nice to see you yesterday, wanna hang?

143
00:16:30.068 --> 00:16:34.088
-Hello, little buddy! Hi!
-Hi.

144
00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:39.054
Hey, I've got a little prize for you, for being so nice and paying your rent on time.

145
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:43.054
-You have a prize for me?
-Yes. Do you want it?

146
00:16:43.054 --> 00:16:45.054
Uhm, yeah!

147
00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:49.062
I'm gonna let you choose a hand.

148
00:16:49.062 --> 00:16:51.062
Uhhhhm, right.

149
00:16:52.017 --> 00:16:56.060
-You can choose the left one.
-I'll take the left one, then.

150
00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.031
VoilÃ ! For you!

151
00:17:00.017 --> 00:17:03.074
An air purifyer, huh? Funny.

152
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.042
So it's a lavender fragrance that I thought you could have here in your room.

153
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:15.014
-Yeah, thanks so much.
In case you get any more...

154
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.068
In case you get any more visits from that guy... that guy Even.

155
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.071
Or whatever his name was...

156
00:17:32.037 --> 00:17:37.034
-Uhm... Eskil?
-Yeah?

157
00:17:39.068 --> 00:17:42.082
I guess I'll say it... Well...

158
00:17:45.037 --> 00:17:55.020
There is.... In a way, there's a... a thing, between Even and I.

159
00:17:57.002 --> 00:18:01.022
We... are doing stuff...

160
00:18:02.022 --> 00:18:05.057
You don't say? That's...

161
00:18:06.017 --> 00:18:09.014
Hey, that's awesome, Isak.

162
00:18:09.014 --> 00:18:14.054
Hey, that's absolutely fantastic!

163
00:18:15.068 --> 00:18:19.028
You're not surprised?

164
00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:24.094
Isak, the first time I met you, you were sitting alone in a gay bar at 2 in the night, and didn't wanna go home.

165
00:18:25.045 --> 00:18:30.037
I've told you, I didn't know it was a gay bar.

166
00:18:32.065 --> 00:18:37.028
-But it doesn't mean I'm gay, though.
-No, I mean...

167
00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:42.037
That's... That doesn't matter. The most important thing is that you've found someone you like.

168
00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:47.011
There's nothing wrong with being gay either, it's just, I'm not like, a gay-gay, though.

169
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:52.040
-Okay, like what?
-Well, like... like you.

170
00:18:55.034 --> 00:19:00.074
Okay... Yeah... And what... What is it that I'm like?

171
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:11.011
You know what I mean, right? I mean, you talk loudly about sucking cock, and Kim Kardashian and lavender scent.

172
00:19:13.034 --> 00:19:20.082
Well, I absolutely respect that you go all the way on the gay-thing, but it's just... I'm not like that.

173
00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:25.034
Well, there's no "gay-thing" that I try to go all the way on...

174
00:19:25.091 --> 00:19:29.031
I'm just trying to... I'm just trying to be myself, Isak.

175
00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:32.005
Yeah, man. My God, yeah I get that.

176
00:19:32.068 --> 00:19:36.082
I didn't mean to...
Yeah, of course you are completely yourself.

177
00:19:37.054 --> 00:19:45.044
What I mean is that it seems everybody has to associate being gay with being like that. And...

178
00:19:46.077 --> 00:19:52.048
...that kinda sucks, for those who are not like that.

179
00:19:52.077 --> 00:20:01.037
Because, it's not like I'm gonna wear mascara and... tights and join Gay Pride just because I like Even.

180
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.062
Okay, let me...

181
00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:15.042
I need to tell you one thing about those people who you don't want to be associated with, Isak.

182
00:20:15.084 --> 00:20:21.040
About those who have worn tights and mascara and went out and fought for the right to be who they are.

183
00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:29.020
They're people who, throughout the years, have chosen to endure harassment... and hate...

184
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.068
...who have been beaten up and killed.

185
00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:39.011
And that's not because they're so insanely keen on being different.

186
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.028
But because they'd rather die than pretend to be something they're not.

187
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:51.060
And that, Isak, requires courage on a whole other level than...

188
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:56.051
...most human beings understand. 
And I...

189
00:20:57.002 --> 00:21:00.085
I think...

190
00:21:00.085 --> 00:21:05.025
I think that before you've fought that battle yourself...

191
00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:08.071
...before you've dared to stand up for who you are...

192
00:21:09.008 --> 00:21:13.000
...you should be fucking careful with talking and raising yourself above Gay Pride.

193
00:21:17.014 --> 00:21:26.080
-Yeah, I didn't mean to raise myself above it.
-Yeah. Yeah, Isak... you did.

194
00:21:30.017 --> 00:21:34.008
And now...

195
00:21:34.008 --> 00:21:39.068
Right now I don't really want to talk to you much more.

196
00:21:40.022 --> 00:21:46.082
So now... You can sit there and think about what I've said.

197
00:22:11.042 --> 00:22:30.094
Hi. It was nice to see you too. I don't really know, but maybe tings have happened too quickly.. I know it's my fault, but I need some time, sorry.

198
00:22:35.024 --> 00:22:36.058
FRIDAY 21:32

199
00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:42.008
[Incomprehensible.]

200
00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:42.014


201
00:22:42.014 --> 00:22:45.028
-Oh, yeah, this fucking hot third grader at Nissen!
-We're bros, and you haven't told us?!

202
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.004
-Yeah, what the fuck!
Yeah, so what happened was that we we're at a party at GrÃ¼nerloÃ¸kka.

203
00:22:48.036 --> 00:22:53.074
-Yeah, so what happened?
-And we're just, we haven't done shit the whole party, just going around chilling. She comes, and I'm like "Oh fuck, it's her!"

204
00:22:53.074 --> 00:22:57.066
-So she takes my hand, and drags me into the toilet!
-No!!
-In. To. The. Toilet.

205
00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:57.074


206
00:22:57.098 --> 00:23:02.044
MAHDI: It was a dream?
MAGNUS: I was like, pinching myself while I was hooking up with her.
JONAS: No!
MAGNUS: To check that it wasn't a dream.

207
00:23:02.044 --> 00:23:07.010
-Maaan, so you hooked up with her?
-And then what happened?
-Yeah, we hooked up, and she took of her blouse. And I took off my shirt.

208
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.012
Yeah, yeah!
Like...

209
00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:12.070
-No!
-And we hook like crazy, and then like...
You finished?

210
00:23:13.006 --> 00:23:15.052
-No, we didn't get to fuck, because there was no toilet seat on that fucking shit toilet.
-Damn...

211
00:23:15.078 --> 00:23:18.082
-So what if there's no toilet seat?
-I tried to sit on it, but I just started to sink, like...

212
00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:23.016
-Take her from behind, man!
-Yeah, oh fuck! I could have done that.

213
00:23:23.036 --> 00:23:27.008
-Fuck.
-He's an amateur, man!
-I didn't think about that. But alright. So we hook up...

214
00:23:27.014 --> 00:23:31.012
And a bunch of people want into the toilet, and I'm puking in that fucking poop, shit and piss, and whatever the fuck it's called.

215
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.040
-And that's when you freaked out?
-Yeah, yeah. I freaked out. I had to get out. And we both jumped out the window.

216
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040
-No?!
-She went around...
-Yeah...
-...up on the porch, I went through the door...
-Yeah...
-...and that was right by the toilet...and then a guy came and was like: "Hey, damn, someone's fucking in the toilet, what should we do?

217
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.040


218
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.040


219
00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:46.048
And I was like: "For real...?" Actually me!

220
00:23:48.002 --> 00:23:51.032
-That was fucking hilarious!
-But guys, seriously, what's up tonight?
-I'm wearing a shirt, man!

221
00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:53.044
-We have to find at least one place.
-You're looking really fucking good tonight.
-Thanks, thanks, thanks.

222
00:23:53.074 --> 00:23:58.004


223
00:23:58.004 --> 00:24:01.086
Yo! Hey! What's up?

224
00:24:03.012 --> 00:24:04.076
Yeah, you guys are going out, right?

225
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.094
You've got a place?

226
00:24:07.094 --> 00:24:11.040
-Where?
-Who?
Yeah, who? Who's coming?

227
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:16.018
-Who's hosting, who's hosting?
-'00 Nissen.
-Yeah, done! You know them. yep!
-Yeah, so who's hosting?

228
00:24:17.046 --> 00:24:19.088
It's at Emma's? Emma?
-Yeah, done!!

229
00:24:20.028 --> 00:24:22.080
Yeah, okay, right!, yo! But where is it, though?

230
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:28.026
-The address, just in a message.
-Yeah, the address. Yeah. just send a message, okay? Yeah, we are just three people. Okay. right. Bye.

231
00:24:28.064 --> 00:24:32.058
It's at Emma's. 
Yes!
Emma in the first grade. You can get us the entry, Isak. You know Emma!
-No, she hates me now.

232
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.088
-Huh, why is that?

233
00:24:35.072 --> 00:24:39.018
-Just, what the fuck!
-I have seen you, man, you have mad skills, just talk to her!

234
00:24:39.082 --> 00:24:46.042
-Vilde is gonna be there and stuff. Just get us in, Isak!
-No, it's not gonna work. It doesn't fucking matter that I know her, she hates me.

235
00:24:47.076 --> 00:24:51.030
-No, the boy needs to attend a family gathering, apparantly. Then we'll just go there, the rest of us.

236
00:24:51.062 --> 00:24:52.090
What the fuck...?

237
00:24:53.022 --> 00:24:57.082
-That's all there is to it!
Alright, just forget... I forgive you for forgetting my birthday, alright?

238
00:24:58.028 --> 00:25:04.030
-No, it's not gonna work, man!
-'00.
-Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma!

239
00:25:06.054 --> 00:25:09.032
Rap a little bit about Emma.

240
00:25:09.064 --> 00:25:15.016
Emma... very hot...real nice, short hair... chillin' the...

241
00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:22.096
'00 party Emma G, Isak gets us in, I-sak, gets us in at Emma, '00.

242
00:26:06.062 --> 00:26:09.016
You're not gonna put on shoes, though?

243
00:26:10.054 --> 00:26:13.020
-Hey guys, what's up?!
Who are you, man?

244
00:26:13.044 --> 00:26:16.084
-"Who are you?"?
-Who are you?
-Whoops.
-What are you're doing?
-We're gonna party right now.

245
00:26:17.022 --> 00:26:21.052
-It's Emma who lives here, right?
-Yeah, are you invited, or what?
Yeah. Actually.

246
00:26:21.078 --> 00:26:24.050
-Who are you, then? Are you, like... Are you a bouncer?

247
00:26:24.062 --> 00:26:28.044
-I'm actually just a friend of Emma.
-So are we, so it's a great match.

248
00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:33.040
-Which grade are you in?
-We're in second.
-Can't you just see if Emma's there, and then confirm that we're invited.

249
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.056
It's alright, I know them.

250
00:26:36.056 --> 00:26:39.094
Emma! Has anyone seem Emma?

251
00:26:41.052 --> 00:26:44.062
Guys, I don't know, it's starting to get really crowded in here...

252
00:26:44.092 --> 00:26:49.002
-This is no day parade!
-It's no day parade!
It's a normal house party. [Incomprehensible.]

253
00:26:49.002 --> 00:26:54.004
-So, just go get Emma.
- There's no stress, man, just get Emma. 
-Just let me in. 
-Why would I let you in?

254
00:26:54.004 --> 00:26:58.078
-My name is Isak, I'm in the second grade and I know Emma, she's in first grade, just let me talk to her.

255
00:26:58.078 --> 00:27:03.028
-And her last name is...?
-Her name is Emma Larsen, I know her well, just let me in!

256
00:27:03.052 --> 00:27:06.072
And these guys can stand outside in the meantime, and I'll be right back.

257
00:27:06.098 --> 00:27:12.046
You do get that it's getting fucking full here now, right? So you've got one minute, and they'll wait here. Alright?

258
00:27:46.068 --> 00:27:49.024
Hey!

259
00:27:50.038 --> 00:27:52.056
What are you doing here?

260
00:27:52.092 --> 00:28:03.040
Hey... It was fucking shitty of us when we bailed on you on Halloween. I get it if you think I'm an asshole.

261
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:06.074
It's not because of that that I think you're an asshole.

262
00:28:07.038 --> 00:28:13.086
I think you're an asshole because you allowed me be interested in you, even though you're gay.

263
00:28:15.032 --> 00:28:19.036
It's 2016, Isak. Go get yourself out of the closet.

264
00:28:41.018 --> 00:28:45.096
-Have you hooked up with anyone today?
-No!
-No?
-No!
-Nobody?

265
00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:49.024
-Why not?
-There was no one at the party I wanted to hook up with.

266
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.014
-There was nobody you wanted to hook up with?
No!

267
00:28:51.078 --> 00:28:53.078
-What's up, man?
-Let's get out of here!

268
00:28:53.078 --> 00:28:57.024
-Huh?!
-He's going to a family gathering, let the guy jet!

269
00:28:59.074 --> 00:29:02.000
-No!
-Wow!

270
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
-Do you have to so cheeky?
Huh?!!
-What's going on?
-Hey, what the fuck, what's going on with you, man?

271
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.018
-What's going on right now?

272
00:29:08.018 --> 00:29:10.018
-What the fuck just happened?

273
00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:16.062
-Relax, though, buddy!
Yeah, what the fuck!
-I was just kidding, like, what's his deal?
