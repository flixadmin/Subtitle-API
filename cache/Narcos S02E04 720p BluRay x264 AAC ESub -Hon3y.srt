Let's trust the boss.

157
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,367
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

158
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,408
[phone ringing]

159
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,965
- Hello? <i>Who is this?
- Get me Don Pablo. Fernando Duque.</i>

160
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,411
- Fernando.
<i>- Get</i> him now.

161
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,962
Yes, sir, right away. Limén, please.

162
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,086
[Limén] Boss?

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,923
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

164
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,169
- How many were published?
- [Fernando] Don Pablo,

165
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,881
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

166
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,764
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

167
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,241
Yes. Uh, none.

168
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
<i>They're very, very well written.</i>

169
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,286
It's not about how well written they were,
Fernando. It was the fucking truth!

170
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,410
[sighs]

171
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,410
<i>[Steve] If it seemed like Escobar's world
was crashing down around him,</i>

172
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,562
<i>it was actually about to get worse.</i>

173
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,247
<i>Remember when Pablo collaborated
with M-19 communists</i>

174
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,561
<i>during the Palace of Justice siege?</i>

175
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,802
<i>By doing that,
he pissed off the Autodefensas...</i>

176
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,931
<i>an extreme right-wing paramilitary group</i>

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,765
<i>that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.</i>

178
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,129
<i>[man speaks Spanish] This is why
we saw ourselves forced to take up arms</i>

179
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,690
and defend ourselves...

180
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,207
<i>[Steve] The leaders of the Autodefensas
were the Castafio brothers:</i>

181
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,884
<i>Fidel and Carlos.</i>

182
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,361
<i>Carlos is the one
barking orders at people.</i>

183
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,526
<i>In the late 70s, their father, JeslJs,</i>

184
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,082
a <i>prominent landowner,
was kidnapped by the FARC guerrillas</i>

185
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,289
<i>who demanded 50 mil/ion pesos
for his ransom.</i>

186
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,364
<i>But his sons were
only able to come up with 16.</i>

187
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,891
<i>Well, that didn't cut it.</i>

188
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,645
<i>So the guerrillas
beat the elder Castafio to death.</i>

189
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,410
<i>From that day forward, the right-wing,</i>

190
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,121
<i>psychopathic, commie-killing
Castafio brothers</i>

<i>swore never to rest
until their father was avenged...</i>

192
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,242
[man shouts in Spanish over loudspeaker]

193
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,644
<i>and every last guerrilla
driven from the countryside was killed.</i>

194
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,081
[in Spanish]
Move it, you sons of bitches!

195
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,649
<i>[Steve] Even innocent villagers
who simply lived in guerrilla strongholds</i>

196
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,167
<i>were put to death because
they lived under communist subjugation.</i>

197
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,769
<i>And in their efforts to wipe out
the communist guerrillas...</i>

198
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,649
<i>the Castafios caught the attention
of some like-minded friends.</i>

199
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,690
- [in English] Mr. Stechner.
- Good to see you, my friend.

200
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,923
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

201
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,888
[in Spanish]
All right. Very good.

202
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,362
[chuckles, speaks English] These weapons
are better than the last ones.

203
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,282
They should be.

204
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,569
Thank you, Mr. Green,
for the continued support of your country.

205
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,290
I haven't used that name
since the School of the Americas.

206
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,447
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

207
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,087
We will not stop
until the last communist is dead.

208
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,810
[Bill]
Another struggle is emerging.

209
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,201
One that is essential to our, uh...
shared cause.

210
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,402
Escoban

211
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,801
[Carlos]
Escobar deserves to die.

212
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,522
But our fight is here in the jungle,
against the guerrilla.

213
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,002
Yes, and Pablo's still strong in Medellin.

214
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,243
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

215
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,562
An alliance is forming...
with the objective of taking out Escobar.

216
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,806
<i>Who'?</i>

217
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,201
Rival elements from the trafficking world.

218
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,446
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

219
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,491
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

220
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,281
And that strategic Colombian resources
and revenue streams...

221
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,288
don't fall into the wrong hands.

222
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,524
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

223
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,161
[in Spanish]
Guys.

224
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,804
Ms. Judy.

225
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,687
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

226
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,521
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

227
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,682
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

228
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,930
We know you all joined forces against him.

229
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,925
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

230
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,608
Why? What do you want out of this?

231
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,729
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it'?

232
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,202
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

233
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,650
is also allied with the guerrillas,
whom he has helped on many occasions.

234
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,762
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

235
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,845
[Carlos]
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

236
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,324
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

237
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,201
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

238
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,481
No, no, no, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad? No. An army.

239
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,722
And when this army gets to Medellin,

240
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,690
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

241
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,127
It'll be a matter of weeks.

242
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,686
What do you say, Pacho?

243
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,242
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

244
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,127
All of this sounds interesting.

245
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,170
With all due respect, gentlemen,

246
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,451
our organization already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

247
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,251
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

248
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,642
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

249
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,327
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

250
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,006
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

251
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,846
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

252
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,130
Excuse me.

253
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,529
[rooster crows]

254
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,250
[mooing]

255
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,088
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

256
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,049
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

257
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,484
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

258
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,722
He's back there, looking for you.

259
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,527
If he finds out I'm here, he'll want to
kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

260
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,521
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellin.

261
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,965
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

262
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,123
- my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax, relax, relax!

263
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,969
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

264
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,725
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

265
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,883
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

266
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,043
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

267
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,241
You killed me, Jhon.

268
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,369
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

269
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,923
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

270
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,608
I really am sorry, Maritza.

271
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,684
Believe me, I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

272
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,761
What is it?

273
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,606
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

274
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,286
[scoffs]

275
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,163
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

276
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,127
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.

277
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,965
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

278
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,849
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

279
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,803
Dofia Liliana.

280
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,042
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

281
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,602
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

282
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,728
so you can leave with your daughter.

283
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,124
[sighs] And you?
What do you get out of this?

284
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,091
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

285
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,491
I'm afraid.

286
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,003
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

287
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,884
[Tata chuckles]
All right. My turn.

288
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,727
[Pablo] Mmm.

289
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,484
You both look beautiful.

290
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,050
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

291
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,043
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

292
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,170
Velasco told me.

293
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,569
[Pablo sighs]

294
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,001
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

295
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,329
Yes, Pablo... 2O strangers.

296
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,760
Let's see.

297
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,806
How do you hold it?

298
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,402
What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

299
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,326
- It's not a joke, Pablo.
- Tata.

300
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,086
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

301
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,805
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

302
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,046
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

303
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,125
All right.

304
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,969
But I think you need
more practice with that.

305
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,169
- [in Spanish] Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

306
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,766
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- Now?

307
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,969
I can't right now. I'm working.

308
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,882
Don't be like that.

309
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,406
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

310
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,123
[in English] Get the lecture from Messina
about not leaving base?

311
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,241
Yeah.

312
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,685
Crosby must've really laid into her
on that one.

313
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,324
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

314
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,686
Okay, I guess it means "Fuck that."

315
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,250
[knocking at door]

316
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,487
[in Spanish]
Hello.

317
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,524
- L've got half an hour.
- Wait.

318
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,605
- Javi... Javi, Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

319
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,046
Hello.

320
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,088
Hi.

321
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,964
She's a friend of a friend.

322
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,288
Maritza, meet Javier.

323
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,441
And...

324
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,804
why are you introducing rne
to a friend of a friend?

325
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,648
She's in trouble.

326
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,404
- Just hear her out.
- [sighs]

327
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,723
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

328
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,848
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

329
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,763
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

330
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,650
Wait. It's important.

331
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,005
Please.

332
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,445
Hear her out.

333
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,366
What's your name? Maritza?

334
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,446
What kind of trouble are you in?

335
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,483
Who are you in trouble with?

336
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,248
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

337
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,327
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

338
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,687
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

339
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,607
Why does he want to kill you?

340
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,604
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

341
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,725
And how are you going to do that?

342
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,127
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

343
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,688
[in English]
Her name is Maritza Rincén.

344
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,963
She works at the market across from
the brothel where the girls were killed.

345
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,327
Where we almost had La Quica
and the other guy...

346
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,050
Jhon Burgos. Goes by "Limén."

347
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,091
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

348
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,051
This girl Maritza was actually
in the back seat serving as a cover

349
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,043
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

350
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,885
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

351
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,771
[Carrillo scoffs softly]

352
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,041
So this guy Limén,
there's no record of him.

353
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,964
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

354
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,008
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

355
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,289
Makes sense for La Quica to hire someone
the police didn't know about.

356
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,647
What does she want out of this?
A ticket to Disneyland?

357
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,200
She knows she doesn't get shit
if it doesn't pan out.

358
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,721
[in Spanish] If this is true, she can tell
us when Limén and Escobar go somewhere.

359
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,931
[in English]
You were there. You trust her?

360
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah.

361
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,485
Yeah, I do.

362
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,122
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

363
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,361
[in Spanish]
Let's go.

364
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,246
- [in English] All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

365
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,764
[in Spanish]
Can you explain this?

366
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,890
A subpoena.

367
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,931
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

368
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,081
You mean your witch hunt.

369
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,848
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

370
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,482
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

371
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,250
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

372
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,566
He must have paid someone off.

373
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,611
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

374
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,245
This is about transparency, truth, law.

375
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,687
And I sense from your reluctance to speak

376
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,641
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

377
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,691
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

378
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,401
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

379
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,723
but we're talking about a national crisis.

380
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,285
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

381
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,129
[sighs] Look, sir... [clears throat]
I ask you to please trust me.

382
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,445
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

383
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,163
is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

384
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,201
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

385
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,928
[resumes typing]

386
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,088
[phone rings]

387
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,562
Hello?

388
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,529
[softly] Hello, Maritza. It's me.

389
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,928
- I spoke with Pefia.
- Pay attention.

390
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,448
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

391
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,886
He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

392
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,168
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

393
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,770
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

394
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,166
But I need you to trust me.

395
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,841
Give me the address.

396
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,729
Write it down.

397
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,091
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

398
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,886
Got it.

399
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,607
My love. Do it again. [laughing]

400
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,046
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

401
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,168
Thank you, Limén. A kiss.

402
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,609
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and... [grunts]

403
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,564
Everything all right, boss?

404
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,730
[phone rings]

405
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Pefia.

406
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,326
9th Street. 98-3.

407
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,562
Okay. Got it.

408
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,089
[in English] I need to know
if there's activity around this address.

409
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,527
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

410
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,125
Okay. You got it.

411
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,006
[distorted voices over recording]

412
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,451
- This was recorded about five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

413
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,521
Let me clean it up.

414
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,647
[Pablo <i>speaks Spanish] All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.</i>

415
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,449
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

416
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,648
- Yeah.
- [Messina] You two are staying here.

417
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,651
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

418
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,525
Crosby finds out you went on another raid,
we all get a ticket home.

419
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,211
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

420
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,645
It's not negotiable.

421
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,323
We'll be in radio contact.

Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

463
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,561
This ain't on you, Javi. It's on Escobar.

464
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,007
And one way or another, he pays.

465
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,809
We all do. Right?

[ambulance siren wailing]

[knocking at door]

468
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,322
This isn't your fault, Pefia.

469
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,807
- No?
- No.

470
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,083
- I got played.
- We all got played.

471
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,124
We all had the information,
it was backed up by Centra Spike...

472
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,247
Stop.

473
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,960
Just"

474
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,364
You know, you coming here...

475
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,448
you say all the right things.

476
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,841
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

477
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,602
Colonel Carrillo's funeral
will be tomorrow.

478
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,482
[door closes]

479
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,608
I don't do funerals.

[slow Latin guitar music plays]

481
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,330
[in Spanish] They're saying
that Pablo himself killed Carrillo.

482
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,368
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

483
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,006
Or me, or you, Pacho.

484
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,084
N0, no.
We've got to come up with another plan.

485
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,448
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

486
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,722
Pacho, we need to call the Castafios.

487
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,643
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

[thunder rumbles]

490
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,922
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...
and they're already asking for my head.

491
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,808
They want a scapegoat.

492
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,284
And we have to give them one.

493
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,686
[sighs]

494
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,441
That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

495
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,849
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

496
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,925
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

497
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,048
when I entered La Catedral.

498
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,924
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

499

[Gaviria]
I don't accept your resignation.

500
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,448
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

501
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,000
We have to do it, César.

502
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,771
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

503
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,810
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

504
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,444
And it's not going to be you.

505
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:29,123
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

[softly] Good luck.

Limén told me you have a daughter.

509
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,606
How old?

510
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,329
- Two.
- And what's her name?

511
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,169
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

512
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,521
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

513
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,330
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

514
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,611
Thank you.

515

Know that... you have a friend in me.

What did you do?

517
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,485
I took care of it.

518
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,490
You're safe now.

Where's Olivia?

523
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,170
She's at home. With my sister.

Hey, you okay?
