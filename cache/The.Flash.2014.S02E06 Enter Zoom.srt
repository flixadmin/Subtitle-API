<i>To the outside world,</i>

<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:32,332
There is, indeed, a hole in our universe

15
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,069
which leads to his Earth.

16
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,089
Meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

17
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you think we've reached
the good-night kiss stage?

18
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:47,080
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

19
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,850
He has been sending
meta-humans from your world

20
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,685
through the breaches to fight me.

21
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,554
Her name is Doctor Light.

22
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:54,588
Hello, gorgeous.

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,756
What do you want from me?

24
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,393
- Your life.
- [both grunt]

25
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,777
I saw myself.

26
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,947
Sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

27
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,700
Where are you? [grunts]

28
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:08,702
I'm right here.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

30
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,708
I'm here to kill you, Flash,
so get ready to fry.

31
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,410
[grunts]

32
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,461
Bring it on.

33
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:20,247
Hmm. [chuckles]

34
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,549
[both grunting]

35
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:40,067
Told you.

36
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,769
Zoom always wins.

_

39
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,200
Zoom sent me here to kill you,

40
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,369
but I didn't want to.

41
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,488
But you were fine with killing Linda Park.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,958
It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,710
Leave her body for Zoom to find,

44
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,846
he'd think I was dead, and I'd be free.

45
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,633
How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

46
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,135
Just let me go.

47
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,638
Let me disappear.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,889
You would spend the rest of your life

49
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:19,973
looking over your shoulder,

50
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,675
never knowing when Zoom is coming.

51
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:26,063
Okay. And what's your great idea?

52
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,481
How were you supposed to contact him

53
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,615
after you killed me?

54
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,017
I was supposed to get something...

55
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,203
something I could only get
if you were dead...

56
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,372
and then throw it
through the breach as proof.

57
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,074
- And then what?
- Then he'd come for me.

58
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,409
Confirm the kill and bring me home.

59
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,662
- Why do you want to know?
- Because I want to find him.

60
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,879
You really don't.

61
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,881
He's gonna keep coming for me.

62
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,667
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you,

63
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,919
forcing them to do what he wants.

64
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,222
I have to stop him before more people die.

65
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,891
- You can't stop Zoom.
- Yes, I can.

66
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:58,345
I will, but I need your help.

67
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,437
Zoom wants Doctor Light
to send him your new emblem.

68
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,155
Yes. We need it for bait.

69
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,375
If we can get Doctor Light
to take my emblem,

70
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,189
throw it through the breach,
then Zoom will come

71
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,224
to collect my body, and we can trap him.

72
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,309
You know it took a lot of work

73
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,860
to make that emblem, right?

74
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,729
This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

75
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,197
in order to escape Zoom,

76
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,399
but now she's willing to help us catch him?

77
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,984
She knows it's the only way.

78
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,620
Before I left Earth-2,

79
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,189
I worked on a serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

80
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,907
All we would need is for Ramon

81
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,576
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

82
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,028
Oh, great, that could be
this year's cold gun.

83
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,413
Maybe another criminal can get it,

84
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,031
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

85
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,549
I would never let that happen.

86
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,301
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

87
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,254
Are we forgetting how much more powerful

88
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,505
than Barry Zoom seems to be?

89
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,391
I mean, if Barry can catch bullets,

90
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,843
what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

91
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,230
Surprise... the element of surprise.

92
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,731
All we would do is rig a projectile

93
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,184
to fire as Zoom crosses into the breach.

94
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,552
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

95
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,720
- That's great.
- Thanks.

96
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,106
Joe, voice of reason here?

97
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,076
We need a plan. That's as good as any.

98
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,411
As long as he can deliver.

99
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,528
Don't underestimate me, Detective.

100
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,863
[phone vibrates]

101
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,200
Oh, Patty needs us back at the station.

102
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,619
I'll meet you there, all right?

103
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,010
Are you just forgetting
everything Jay told us

104
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,294
and supporting Wells now?

105
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,929
Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

106
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,514
I just want to see what he's up to.

107
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,466
I figure we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

108
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,718
Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

109
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,688
Look, my hunch after interrogating suspects

110
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,109
all these years, something's
not right with this dude.

111
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,145
Barry told me about this thing you can do?

112
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,481
- Vibing.
- Oh, God, just relax.

113
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,950
Can you do it with Wells?

114
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,902
I can try.

115
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,544
<i>Incapable?</i>

116
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,329
<i>Well, let me tell you something.</i>

117
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:03,583
<i>If you are incapable
of aligning the quantum helix</i>

118
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,302
and, by the way, the sole purpose

119
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,087
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

120
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,255
could you save me some time and effort?

121
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,140
Could you go out there and find someone

122
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,478
who can actually do your job for you?

123
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,180
There it is.

124
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,983
Work voice.

125
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,668
When I was little and you used to bring me

126
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,869
to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

127
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,521
it used to freak me out

128
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,823
how differently you talked here
than when you were at home.

129
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,526
You and your mother both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

130
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,912
I graduated high school when I was 15, Dad.

131
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,997
- Right.
- Can miss a day of college.

132
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:38,368
Ah, that's my Jess, always so quick.

133
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,505
- So?
- So?

134
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,457
Is it true?

135
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,092
Is what true?

136
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,161
What The Flash said about you
at the press conference?

137
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:52,299
That your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

138
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,307
- It is... Jesse...
- Why didn't you just tell me?

139
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,890
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

140
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,493
is much faster at assigning blame

141
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,523
than he is at actual heroics.

142
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,725
- Dad, The Flash is a hero.
- Uh-huh.

143
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,061
Okay, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much,

144
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:13,331
but now I know it's because
he knew what you'd done.

145
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,866
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs

146
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,785
is change the world, Jesse,

147
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,871
unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

148
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:23,291
And when you don't have the key to the lock,

149
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:27,245
sometimes you have to kick in the door.

150
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,247
You should get to school.

151
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't worry. I got my education today.

152
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,094
You're my joy, Jesse Quick.

153
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,118
[elevator bell dings]

154
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,769
- All right. Talk to you later.
- See you, Joe.

155
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,488
Great, you're here.

156
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,706
Good morning to you too, Patty.

157
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,740
Yes, I was up all night

158
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,908
working on the Doctor Light case.

159
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,126
I... I've been trying to anticipate

160
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,627
all the powers she might throw our way,

161
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,829
you know, on the premise

162
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,380
that she can manipulate light energy.

163
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,998
- I appreciate it, but...
- Did you know

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,301
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

165
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:07,552
I mean, that doesn't even sound
like a thing, but it is.

166
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,137
Seriously, Patty...

167
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,222
No, and on the other end
of the spectrum is invisibility.

168
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,458
Look, it... it's just
hypothetical, but I think that...

169
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,262
The Doctor Light case is closed.

170
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:20,231
Oh, uh, okay.

171
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,183
Can you tell me why?

172
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,801
No.

173
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,106
No?

174
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,691
- Okay.
- Hey.

175
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,025
- Hi!
- Are you good?

176
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,360
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

177
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,496
Your dad just shut me down in a big way.

178
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:37,365
- What do you mean?
- I... I don't know. It just...

179
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:42,787
You don't think it's because
you and I kissed?

180
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:43,922
Uh, no, I don't think he knows.

181
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,457
I didn't say anything,

182
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,875
but I can talk to him if you want.

183
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:48,326
No, no, no, I'll talk to him.

184
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,594
You know, he's my partner.

185
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,212
We should have trust and communication.

186
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,214
Are you sure? I don't mind
talking about that kiss.

187
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,466
It was a good kiss.

188
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:58,720
Yeah, yeah, although the memory...

189
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,722
it's a little foggy.

190
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,307
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:06,010
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

192
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:09,013
Okay.

193
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,207
- Hey.
- Hey.

194
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,742
Have you had any word from The Flash

195
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,329
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

196
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:27,999
No, not yet, but I know he's working on it.

197
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,918
You know, maybe I could talk to him.

198
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,170
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

199
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:34,055
Look, Larkin is dead,

200
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,723
which makes it really hard
for me to concentrate

201
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,875
on field goals and doping scandals.

202
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,677
I don't want to sit around
being told not to worry

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,146
my pretty little head about it.

204
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:44,048
I get that. Believe me, I do.

205
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,733
Then tell him I want to help.

206
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,153
Please, I can't let this woman
who looks like me

207
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,155
hurt anyone else.

208
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,157
I'll ask again.

209
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,110
But trust me, Flash has
everything under control.

210
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,952
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

211
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,370
Crap.

212
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,880
[breathing heavily]

213
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,593
Doctor Light's gone invisible.

214
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,645
Lock the doors.

215
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:33,481
Shut the doors!

216
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,650
The doors aren't responding.

217
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:38,069
None of the security protocols
are responding.

218
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,287
She's hacked the system.

219
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,272
Barry, Doctor Light is escaping.

220
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,745
Where is she?

221
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,188
Doctor Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

222
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,924
The whole building runs on fiber optics

223
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,842
that operate on pulses of light,

224
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,428
so she turned off the dampeners
and used her powers.

225
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,896
I told you how dangerous she was.

226
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,431
You should have listened to me
and sedated her.

227
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,166
I thought I had convinced
her that helping us

228
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,568
was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

229
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,602
- Well, you thought wrong.
- Yeah.

230
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,187
Okay, look,

231
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,972
Doctor Light is gone,
so instead of assigning blame,

232
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,690
let's try to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

233
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,659
Do you think she's gonna try
and take Linda again?

234
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,327
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,

235
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,196
just in case, to keep an eye on her.

236
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,647
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

237
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,249
I think we isolated the composite.

238
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,533
And we're modifying the dart The Arrow used

239
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,785
to take down Wells.

240
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,320
He's not Wells. I'm Wells.

241
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,922
Whatever, Harry.

242
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,707
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

243
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,342
Until we try it, no.
This will be a field test,

244
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,460
so can we end
this scintillating staff meeting

245
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,045
and get back to work?

246
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,713
Or how about I say
what everybody's thinking?

247
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,432
Maybe it's a good thing
that Doctor Light is gone.

248
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,833
Maybe it's the universe stopping us

249
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,385
from doing something really stupid.

250
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,271
No. No. Keep going.

251
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,525
I'm gonna figure out
another way to get Zoom.

252
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,527
Hey, slow your roll. I want to talk to you.

253
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,447
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

254
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,482
Okay, I don't, so why don't you clue me in?

255
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,984
I'm trying to stop Zoom.

256
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,184
I thought you were on board with that.

257
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,203
I'm keeping my options open.

258
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,289
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

259
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,957
Zoom wants me dead.

260
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,659
The meta-humans that
he's sending from Earth-2,

261
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,494
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

262
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,579
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

263
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,882
He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war.

264
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,051
The next time, that could be you or Iris.

265
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,753
I'm just wondering if going
after him now is premature.

266
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,672
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

267
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,890
Wells does.

268
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,891
You're putting a whole lot of faith

269
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,975
in the man wearing the face

270
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,727
of your mother's killer.

271
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,346
I think we should find Jay,
get him to help us on this.

272
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,348
Yeah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't want to help

273
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,600
get me killed, and we can't just sit around

274
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,602
and wait for Zoom
to make his next move anymore.

275
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,071
We can't.

276
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,272
Aren't you the one who told me

277
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,690
life isn't about playing defense,

278
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:41,941
sometimes the only way to succeed

279
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,359
is by working the offense?

280
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,577
I think at the time we were talking about

281
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,995
your high school football tryouts.

282
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,698
You said you'd never bring that up again.

283
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,674
Hey.

284
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,427
I just wanted to say using
the, uh, tungsten composite

285
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,464
to dampen vibrations, that was, uh...

286
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,799
that was pretty brilliant.

287
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,521
What are you doing?

288
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm congratulating you.

289
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,858
Don't touch me.

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,310
Wow, try to give a guy a compliment.

291
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,728
You're not trying to give me a compliment.

292
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,862
You're trying to meddle into things

293
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,147
that are none of your business.

294
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,648
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

295
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,118
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

296
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,403
God, why? What's there to vibe on?

297
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,326
Don't touch me.
If you have questions, ask them.

298
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,912
Otherwise stay away from me.

299
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,421
So?

300
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,141
God, you'd think the serial killer version

301
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,926
would've been the bigger jerk.

302
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:50,977
What happened when you touched him?

303
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,095
What did you see?

304
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,229
Oh, I didn't see anything.

305
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,964
Go touch him again.

306
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,316
No, he's onto me now.

307
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,634
Well, you have to keep trying.

308
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,020
I mean, I think Joe's right.

309
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:04,607
Something must have happened
between Wells and Zoom,

310
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,243
made this personal.

311
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,246

00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,531
Barry, hold up.

487
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,383
Hey, what?

488
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,034
You saw what happened in there.

489
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,336
Linda's not ready.

490
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:09,971
She is. She's ready enough.

491
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,090
Why are you pushing this?

492
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:14,142
What... why do you think? I want to get him.

493
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:15,760
Get who, exactly?

494
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,345
Is that a real question?

495
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:18,763
You tell me.

496
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,899
I'm... I'm not sure this
is even about Zoom.

497
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,216
I'm starting to feel like
you're still chasing

498
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,718
the Reverse Flash.

499
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,186
Reverse Flash is dead.

500
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,654
Yeah, but after all he did to you,

501
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,657
you weren't the one that stopped him.

502
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:30,992
We all worked together.

503
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:33,945
Yeah, and Eddie got him in the end.

504
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,413
I mean, did that make you feel cheated,

505
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,865
like you didn't get your revenge,

506
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:41,119
and stopping Zoom is the next best thing?

507
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,787
Look, all I'm saying is,

508
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,339
if you're gonna ask people like Linda

509
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:45,907
to risk their lives, you better be sure

510
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,292
of exactly why they're doing it.

Look, I'm sorry I'm a terrible supervillain.

513
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,644
I don't need you to come here
and make me feel worse.

514
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,397
That's not why I'm here.

515
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,201
Doesn't matter, I... I can't do this.

516
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:14,702
I just don't have it in me.

517
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,404
That's not true.

518
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,289
You're one of the strongest
women I've ever met.

519
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,824
You can do anything.

520
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,127
And you know that about me
based on what exactly?

521
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:25,630
[sighs] Linda,

522
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:29,116
you are trusting me.

523
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:32,303
So I need to trust you fully.

524
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:35,456
I know that you can do this...

525
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,650
Because I know you.

526
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,236
[whispers] Barry. Holy crap.

527
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,775
I've made out with The Flash.

528
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:10,744
Listen, I just want to bury the hatchet

529
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:13,963
and say thank you for all your work.

530
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:17,200
You're welcome.

531
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:19,302
Okay.

[sighs]

533
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,390
I think maybe the trigger
mechanisms are just sticking.

534
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,041
It's not the trigger mechanisms.

535
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:26,259
- I think...
- It's not the... don't, no...

536
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:27,260
It's just a little bit of oil.

Ugh, I'm just gonna
clean this up really quick.

- I'm just trying to help.

I know Wells went to the other Earth.

00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:52,952
Why?

00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:55,255
I don't know, I swear.

Joe, Doctor Light.

- I thought we settled that.
- No, we didn't.

She's still out there on the loose...

551
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:27,937
a meta-human who just murdered a man.

552
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:29,772
Why aren't we doing something about it?

553
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:30,957
Look, none of this makes any sense,

554
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,308
and you're not talking to me.

555
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,409
All right, all right, all right, look.

556
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,044
It's a bit complicated,

557
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:38,381
but we're not going after
Doctor Light right now.

558
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:40,383
I need you to trust me, Patty,

559
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,669
for a few days or so.

560
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,421
Are you somehow involved in this?

561
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:48,007
If you're asking if I'm dirty, no,

562
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,095
but I need some time
to take care of some things.

563
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:53,513
I trust you, I do.

564
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:56,149
I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't.

565
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,817
This is about you not trusting me.

566
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:02,405
- Patty, I trust you.
- Not enough.

567
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:06,025
A few days.

568
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:12,582
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:14,000
Do you want to maybe grab dinner tonight?

570
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,618
I could use your opinion about something.

571
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,836
I can't tonight. I'm sorry.

572
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:17,921
- [phone vibrates]
- Sure.

573
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:20,173
I... I would. Joe and I actually...

574
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:23,293
Joe and I have a thing
that we've gotta do tonight.

575
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:24,844
Some other time.

576
00:25:24,846 --> 00:25:27,380
I would much rather be
spending the evening with you.

577
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:31,935
Seriously, if I could cancel
these plans, I would.

578
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,521
Can we do dinner tomorrow?

579
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:35,671
Yeah, I would like that.

580
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:37,473
All right, I'll see you.

581
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,192
Good luck with your thing.

582
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:42,228
Thanks. I think I'll need it.

583
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,415
I'm here to kill The Flash,
and no one can stop me!

How's that?

00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:05,084
Uh, it's a little too much.

00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:06,719
Uh, stop messing with the earpiece.

587
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,222
Yeah, you don't want to dislodge it.

588
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:11,540
Right, you... you told me that. I'm sorry.

589
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:15,845
No, no, you're doing great, Linda.

590
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:19,098
All right, Doctor Light, here I am.

591
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,934
But we're gonna skip the part where you say

592
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:23,019
you're gonna kill me
and go right to the part

593
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:24,387
where I don't let you.

594
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,606
I'm here to kill you, Flash.

[whispering] Wait, what are you doing?

We're skipping that?

[whispering] Yes.

Uh, I am loyal to Zoom,

599
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,400
so get ready to fry.

Next time we're doing this,

601
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,620
I'm writing better dialogue.

Zoom always wins.

- [whispers] You're okay, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

613
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:32,388
I had to make it look good.

614
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,892
Here it is, Zoom, I did what you wanted.

615

Now bring me home.

Come on, Zoom.

620
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,062
Hey, stop fidgeting.

00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,547
Sorry, it's been an hour.

He's probably just waiting
to see if you're really dead.

625
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:43,022
Any minute now, he's gonna strike.

00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,276
No.

627
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,450
Sorry, I probably screwed up somehow.

- Mm-hmm.
- How about you?

632
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,968
Yeah, it just sucks, you know.

633
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,220
You were right a little bit

634
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:16,272
about this not being just about Zoom...

635
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:19,475
about it being about the Reverse Flash.

636
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:20,760
Okay.

637
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:21,978
But not for the reason that you think,

638
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,780
not because I didn't beat him.

639
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:26,933
It's... Wells...

640
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:29,452
he said something to me on that video

641
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:31,120
before he confessed to my mom's murder.

642
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:34,908
He said that even if he was dead,

643
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,245
that he still won because I wasn't happy,

644
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,581
that I'd never really be happy.

645
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,082
How the hell would he know?

646
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,919
He knew me. He knows future me.

00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:47,887
That's future you.
This is the you here and now.

I still think that Wells is right.

00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:00,003
But she's alive?

817
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:02,673
Yeah.

818
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,924
[sighs]

819
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:05,876
Zoom sent you here like the others?

820
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,796
You kill The Flash, and you
get your daughter back?

821
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:10,163
The only way I get my daughter back is,

822
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:11,465
I capture Zoom.

823
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:15,519
Do you understand? You love Barry.

824
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,771
I love my daughter.

825
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,357
And none of these children are
safe as long as Zoom is here.

826
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,477
I tried on my Earth to capture him.

827
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:24,778
I failed.

828
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,115
I thought I could bring him down here

829
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:32,202
with Barry's help.

830
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:34,455
I was wrong.

831
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:37,374
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

832
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:49,536
Hey, I think he's waking up.

833
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:53,307
Barry. Barry?

834
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:56,560
Can you hear me?

835
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:58,095
Hey.

836
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:00,564
[chuckles]

837
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:02,816
You scared the crap out of us.

838
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:04,852
You were gone for a long time.

839
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,553
How bad is it?

840
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:08,272
Bad.

841
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:11,742
If you didn't heal so quickly,
I'd be very worried.

842
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:14,394
- Linda... how is she?
- She's fine.

843
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,498
She's staying with some
friends out in Coast City.

844
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,733
Zoom?

845
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:24,588
Let's... Let's worry about Zoom
when you're up and about, okay?

846
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,125
Oh, no, you're staying put.

847
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:30,627
Yeah, seriously, you got your ass kicked.

848
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:34,047
No, guys, I can't feel my legs.

849
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:40,587
I can't feel my legs.

850
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,781
