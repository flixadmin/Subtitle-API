1
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,966
I've fooled them. Job done.

2
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,567
So, how are things back at the Palace?

3
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,802
Fine, but guess
who's still living in my guest house?

4
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:04,832
Ooh, Bin Laden?

5
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,542
Yes, Osama.

6
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,240
Bin Laden flooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

7
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,217
And how hard is it to put a bath mat
down, Bin Laden?

8
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:19,214
Hey, do you remember
my favourite sports car?

9
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,849
You mean your Porsche?

10
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,416
Yes... the 911.

11
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,928
911, it's the best!

12
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,523
So I was driving my 911 near the
palace one day...

13
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,832
and I totally crashed!

14
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,205
It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.

15
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,212
A brand new 9112012.

16
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,549
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights...

17
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,747
such as the Empire State Building...

18
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,722
and Yankee Stadium.

19
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,387
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

20
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,563
Hey, have your old back problems been
bothering you?

21
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:08,368
It's been terrible! It got so bad that
I made myself a back brace.

22
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,968
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.

23
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,047
Hey, my English is getting good...

24
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,745
I bet I can count down from five
faster than you can!

25
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,986
Five, four, three, two, one!
