1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,882
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,847
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,691
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,451
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,528
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,281
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,050
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was</i>

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,969
<i>only to find things
weren't as I left them.</i>

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,128
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,971
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,969
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,767
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,927
What is that?

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,691
Another epidermal husk.
A fully intact human pelt.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,042
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,287
I am Alchemy.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,442
Well, what do you want?

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,650
To help people
achieve their true potential.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,649
<i>I know you want this
more than anything.</i>

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,842
But you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,610
There's a whole multi-verse of
Harrison Wells out there.

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,801
Call me H.R.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,128
- You're a fake.
<i>- Let me prove my worth.</i>

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,011
If I fail, I will...
Right back to my Earth.

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,322
If I succeed,
I will have done some good with my life.

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,364
<i>Caitlin, these powers you have,
the more you use them,</i>

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,370
<i>the more difficult
they're going to be to reverse.</i>

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,930
<i>I'm fast, really fast.</i>

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,527
<i>I might even be the fastest man alive.</i>

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,969
<i>And when I'm running,
there's no greater feeling in the world.</i>

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,766
<i>I can move through the city
like a guardian angel,</i>

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,962
<i>protecting people who need me.</i>

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,569
Whoa, you gotta slow down
and watch where you're going, okay?

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,249
- Cool skateboard, though.
- Thanks.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,810
They even have a name for me.
They call me Kid Flash.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,001
"Kid Flash"?

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,288
Yeah, the name needs some work.
But, Dad, I'm telling you,

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,723
it all just felt so real,
like it was actually happening.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,244
And how often
are you getting these dreams?

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,566
Uh, last couple nights.

42
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Last couple?

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,529
Wally, this is exactly what
Frankie Kane said happened to her.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,047
She had dreams, a lot of painful ones,

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,049
and then she started hearing
Alchemy's voice in her head

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,366
until she became Magenta.

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,568
Yeah, this is totally different, Dad.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,888
No, no, it's not.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,003
Yes, it is. I'm a speedster in my dreams,

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,521
I'm not an evil split personality.

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm helping people, not hurting them.

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,526
Dad, this could mean
that my powers are finally manifesting.

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,250
No, I think this means that you
have a lot in common right now

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,006
with people who either
ended up in prison, or dead.

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,568
Except for the fact
that I got hit by the dark matter

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,564
from the particle accelerator explosion,
just like Jesse.

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,731
I'm going to class.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,083
Hey, Julian, do you want me to
get started on the DNA analysis for you?

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,242
Mmm. Why would I need you to do that?

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,761
I don't know, I just figured we worked
so well together last time.

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,764
What?
That I'd want to do it again?

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,085
One shared case and one shared drink
does not make us mates, okay?

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,084
- Miss Horton.
- Mr. Allen.

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,725
- Mr. Albert.
- Morning.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,206
New one?

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,602
Uh, yep, number six. Found it last night.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,729
Well, this should come as
a welcome surprise.

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,764
You've been reassigned to meta-human
crime scene investigation full time.

69
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,962
Full time?

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,122
We're pouring all the resources we can

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,442
into figuring out
this husk problem, especially

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,570
considering the last one turned out
to be that evil speedster, the Rival.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,531
Any questions, concerns, you guys
direct them to Judge Hankerson, yeah?

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,966
All right. Thank you.

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,201
Joe.

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,640
- Cecile.
- Hi.

77
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,291
I didn't know you were gonna be over here.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,807
Any excuse I have to run into you,
I take it.

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,203
You know, I'm really looking forward
to tomorrow night.

80
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,441
- So am I.
- Yeah?

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,802
- Yeah.
- Okay, good, then I, uh...

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,327
- I'll see you then.
- Great.

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,081
Yo, is that what I think it was?

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,811
You asked her to movie night with us?

85
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,247
That's awesome.
When did you do that? How'd you do it?

86
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,284
As much as I'd like to gossip
with you like a teenager right now,

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,801
there's something else
we need to talk about.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,001
What?

89
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,164
Wally. He's been having dreams.

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,561
Dreams?

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,647
Of saving people, becoming a speedster.
He called himself Kid Flash.

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,764
Kid Flash? He said that name specifically?

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,166
He's in trouble, isn't he?

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,687
If Wally's having dreams
of being Kid Flash, then,

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,841
yeah, he's in trouble.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,527
Yeah, but don't worry, okay?
We'll figure it out. I'll see you later.

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,841
All right.

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,002
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, we do.

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,440
He's still here.

100
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,847
Cisco, comedy of the obvious,

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,324
I made a pact to justify my presence
on your Earth,

102
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,488
and I think I got something.

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,961
We're all ears.

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,369
Okay, I read every news report
I can get my hands on,

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,011
<i>and I have come to the conclusion that</i>

106
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,885
this very operation
is a ticking time bomb.

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,321
What do you mean?

108
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,885
You can't spend all your time working on,

109
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,009
working on whatever, whatever this is.

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,161
This, this is a very delicate set
of power dampening cuffs.

111
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,050
We need them to stop the meta-humans.

112
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,090
My point exactly! It's not gonna be long

113
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,249
before people start putting
the pieces together

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,845
and figure out what you're doing here.

115
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,042
You're working with the Flash!

116
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,561
Okay, so what's your idea?

117
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,290
<i>The perfect disguise!</i>

118
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,285
We reopen this laboratory,

119
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,051
and I become the face of
the new S.T.A.R. Labs Museum!

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,363
There's only one problem with that.

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,767
It's your face.

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,241
You're kind of a known murderer
around these parts.

123
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,723
You see, the evil Wells,

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,651
not to be confused with
the dick-ish, but not evil, Wells,

125
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,247
he confessed to killing Barry's mother.

126
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,724
So basically, if you step foot
outside this lab, you'll be arrested.

127
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,287
You're just telling me this now?
You two rascals.

128
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,289
<i>What about the cryptogram?
What about the message,</i>

129
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,601
"Come to this Earth, get a fresh start"?

130
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,327
Well, what about your resume
as a world renowned genius scientist?

131
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,761
That's a good point. I guess we're even.

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,809
"If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it."

133
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,287
"Patience can do lots of things,
have you ever tried it?"

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,442
<i>My dear ma used to say that
to me all the time,</i>

135
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,171
anytime I had a problem.
Now I have a problem.

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,607
I guess I'm gonna use that adage
to figure it out.

137
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,920
S.T.A.R. Labs Museum. Think about it.

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,805
You think everyone on Earth-19

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,850
is missing crayons in the box,
or just him?

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,445
Paging Dr. Snow.

141
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,288
Wow. You are out of it.

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,481
Sorry.

143
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,927
Does it have anything to do
with your recent visit with Mom?

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,010
I just, I haven't been sleeping well,
but I'm okay.

145
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,921
Coffee.

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,366
Perfect.

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,127
So I did have powers. I was Kid Flash.

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,049
In Flashpoint, yes.

149
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,530
I knew that this was happening.
Why didn't you tell me before?

150
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,165
Because...

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,850
Because why?

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,044
All right, fine, Wally. Yeah, look.

153
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,808
In that timeline,
you were fighting the Rival.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,161
Edward Clariss?

155
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,840
Edward Clariss, yeah.
You couldn't stop him.

156
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,681
There was no S.T.A.R. Labs,
there was no team to help you.

157
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,120
It was just you and Iris.

158
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,366
The two of you were a brother-sister
superhero crime fighting team.

159
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,527
Why didn't you tell us this before?

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,371
You didn't wanna know about
your Flashpoint lives.

161
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,170
But, look, listen to me.

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,521
You got hurt.

163
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,361
All right? You got hurt bad.

164
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,969
So what? That's that me, it's not this me.

165
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,363
And I wanna be a speedster.
I mean, I wanna be a Flash.

166
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,124
No. No. No, no, you don't.

167
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,282
Yes, I do.

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,887
Are you not hearing what he's saying?
He's telling us it's not safe.

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,969
Who cares what Barry's saying?

170
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,565
How do we even know
he's telling the truth?

171
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,206
Wally, come on. This isn't because
of the particle accelerator,

172
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,487
it's because of Doctor Alchemy.

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,722
It's the same thing
that happened to Frankie Kane.

174
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,211
<i>- You don't know that.</i>
<i>- Yes, we do,</i>

175
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,442
and we need to try
to keep it from happening.

176
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,722
Why don't we just say
what this is really about?

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,570
You're okay with Barry having powers,

178
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,087
you're okay with Barry running
into danger, fighting all these metas.

179
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,884
He can screw up over and over again.

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,448
You're okay with all of it.
Because he's Barry.

181
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,449
But you won't give me
the same amount of leeway,

182
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,610
because at the end of the day,
you just don't trust me.

183
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
You know that's not true, Wally.

184
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,282
I don't need you fighting
my dad's battles for him.

185
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,965
Say it, Joe.

186
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,922
You don't trust me, do you?

187
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,926
Wally!

188
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,004
That's what I thought.

189
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
Hey, hey...

190
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,641
No, you're not listening to me.

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,929
I said the shares are undervalued,

192
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,845
so if the stock drops,
you should buy more, not less.

193
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,128
No, that's... not how it works.

194
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,129
Look, just look at its balance sheet.

195
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,607
If you sell now,
you're going to lose a lot of money.

196
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,045
I understand that.

197
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,010
No, of course, it's your money.

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,964
Just hold onto it then.

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,646
You know what?
If you're not gonna listen...

200
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,722
<i>Petechiae around eye,
the crushed larynx.</i>

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,406
This poor chap,
he's got fingerprints around his neck,

202
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,801
he's clearly been strangled.

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,487
I heard multiple witnesses said
the man was attacked by a shadow.

204
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,164
Huh? So a meta from Neverland's made
the trip to Central City. Fabulous.

205
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,687
So far there's no forensic evidence
that there was an assailant.

206
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,320
No laceration marks, no fingernail marks.

207
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,682
No DNA evidence underneath
the fingernails even?

208
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,006
Nothing yet, we'll have to wait and see.

209
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,326
There's always something.

210
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,927
Ah... Bag the body up,
and I'll meet you back at the lab.

211
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,161
- Yeah.
- See ya.

212
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,770
Oh, Julian, uh, I'm going to that
Movie in the Park thing with Joe and his...

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,004
Or my... Iris and some other friends.

214
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,083
Uh, if you felt like going,
it starts at 8:00.

215
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,608
All a bunch of nerds,
so you'll fit right in.

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,888
That's a very enticing offer, Allen,

217
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,088
but I'm actually seeing
my girlfriend tonight, so...

218
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,442
Oh, you have a girlfriend?
I didn't know that.

219
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,409
I'm sure there's lots about me
that you don't know. Cheerio.

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,127
- Yeah.
<i>- Albert.</i>

221
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,321
Detective.

222
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,760
- Hey.
- Anything?

223
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,686
Nothing yet at least.

224
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Have you seen Wally this morning?

225
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,367
No, why?

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,125
He left the house in a huff,

227
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,731
he won't answer my calls.

228
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,206
Iris is out there
looking for him right now.

229
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,601
Do you want me to run around the city?

230
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,451
Maybe if I can't get a hold of him.

231
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,882
What Wally said, it's partially true.

232
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,560
I didn't answer his question
because I don't trust him

233
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,161
with these powers the same way
I trust you with them.

234
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,522
You gotta talk to him about that.

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,087
You know, tell him why. Especially now.

236
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,203
I will. I mean,
I just gotta find him first.

237
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,801
Look, I'll just keep calling him,
he's gotta answer at some point, right?

238
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,247
Man, I feel bad, too.
It's your first date with Cecile,

239
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,487
and you gotta worry about this.

240
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,170
Don't worry about that.

241
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,044
That's one part of my life I can control.

242
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,441
Yes?

243
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,046
Have you seen H.R.?

244
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,924
Maybe he's meditating in his room?

245
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,610
No, he's not there.

246
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,609
H.R., you're needed in the speed lab, now.

247
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,644
He could be doing
inversion stretches in the intake.

248
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,969
You saw that, too, huh?
H.R.? He's not there.

249
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,288
Probably just brewing another
pot of coffee, it's all he drinks.

250
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,084
- Not that, either.
- Okay.

251
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,924
Why do you need him so badly?

252
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,486
He's going through my stuff,

253
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,401
but now he's just being stupid about it!

254
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,284
Stupid about what?

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,766
God, I swear I fixed the security system.
Who the hell are you?

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,286
H.R.?

257
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,244
Um, apologies.

258
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,524
H.R.! See?

259
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,291
Ah! What you've just been witness to

260
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,966
was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.

261
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,049
Okay, I see what's going on here.

262
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,404
You don't have facial transmogrification
on this planet, do you?

263
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,045
No, we certainly do not.

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,442
Well, then,
it's a good thing for me

265
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,005
I found this little contraption
in my satchel.

266
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,686
Forgot I'd brought it. It's so fun.

267
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,166
So fun. How does this work?

268
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,124
Light refraction technology.

269
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,651
Light refraction?

270
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,730
I think, I don't...
Randolf, my business partner,

271
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,406
he's sort of more with the science,
but this little sucker

272
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,002
is gonna go a long way to solving
my Harrison Wells facial issues.

273
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,488
I'm gonna hang onto this
until I get my power cuffs back.

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,848
Wait, your power cuffs?

275
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,769
Your meta-human power dampening cuffs?

276
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,770
Those very ones,
the ones that are missing all of a sudden.

277
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,291
Wait, you think I took 'em?

278
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,285
I didn't take 'em.
What do I need cuffs for?

279
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,726
I just got to this Earth, I came alone.

280
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,206
I haven't met anyone yet.

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,601
It's gonna take a while,

282
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,848
even when I do meet them,
to get to the cuff stage.

283
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,366
<i> Hey, guys?</i>

284
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,484
<i>Guys, I need you in the Cortex.</i>

285
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,486
Killed by a shadow? That's a new one.

286
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,523
Maybe that's what killed Edward Clariss.

287
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,486
Clariss was a meta-human.
This victim doesn't appear to be.

288
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,091
Do we know if this shadow meta

289
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,204
is from the particle accelerator explosion
or from Doctor Alchemy?

290
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,121
Not yet, no. We actually haven't found
any evidence to process.

291
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,722
If only we had a way, Francisco,
to see what happened.

292
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,967
Where's the crime scene located?

293
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,324
In Chubbuck. Uh, Palmer and Racine,
around 11:00 last night.

294
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,171
<i>Whoa!</i>

295
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,691
<i>Ooh, that's gonna
give me night terrors.</i>

296
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,847
Shade.

297
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,007
What?

298
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,645
Well, we had a meta-hominid on my planet.

299
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,081
He could do virtually the same thing,
called himself Shade.

300
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,607
What did he do?
Throw his side eye at his enemies?

301
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,325
No, I know,
it's a terrible nickname, right?

302
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,000
But what Shade could do was
vibrate at such a high frequency,

303
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,811
he created the illusion
that he was a shadow.

304
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,371
It's how I phase.

305
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,046
Do you think he's doing the same thing?

306
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,086
He has to be. Heat signature's
fluctuating, redshift is ridiculous.

307
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,327
Okay, so, he is.

308
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,251
He must be slowing down
his molecules whenever he attacks.

309
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,330
So we just have to figure out a way
to keep them slowed down,

310
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,124
and that should be enough to grab him.

311
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,481
All right, can you get started?

312
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,767
Okay, but, like, right this minute?

313
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,803
Yeah, I'm sorry, we just,
we gotta stop this guy fast

314
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,729
so we can focus on Alchemy. We've got...

315
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,364
Wally has been having dreams
about being a speedster.

316
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,204
Alchemy dreams.

317
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,924
He was a speedster in Flashpoint?

318
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,246
Anyone else gonna have powers
we should know about?

319
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,161
No.

320
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,360
- All right. I'm gonna work on Shade.
- I'll supervise.

321
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,561
You're gonna find my cuffs.

322
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,841
Hope to find some cuffs.

323
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,488
All right, I gotta get back to work
before Julian loses his mind.

324
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,889
Wally, it's your dad again.

325
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
Just give me a call back, all right?

326
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,488
Or a text.
I just need to know you're okay.

327
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm okay.

328
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,321
Wally.

329
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,244
You can't do that.
You can't just disappear.

330
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,770
I just wanted to let you know
I'm fine, so...

331
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,123
Come here.

332
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,362
Listen, you were right.

333
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,803
I do treat Barry differently
than I treat you.

334
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,042
But not because I think
Barry's better than you.

335
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,366
Then why?

336
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,767
Wally, you're a lot like I was as a kid.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,810
You're fearless, and you take risks,
and that makes you a handful,

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,161
just like I was.

339
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,846
And now, you're getting powers.

340
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,401
<i>That alone would make me nervous,</i>

341
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,847
because I know what
I would've done if I got powers.

342
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,608
But you're not getting your speed
the same way Barry got his.

343
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,162
You're getting your speed the way
Magenta and the Rival got theirs.

344
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,601
<i>So it's not that I don't trust you,
Wally, it's just,</i>

345
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,371
I don't trust what's going on
with you right now,

346
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,523
<i>and that scares the living hell out of me.</i>

347
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,286
I know, Dad. I get it.

348
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,603
Okay, so, let's get you
to S.T.A.R. Labs and see what we can do.

349
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,847
All right.

350
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,124
<i>Wallace.</i>

351
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,689
<i>Wallace West.</i>

352
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,521
Wally. Wally!

353
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,563
CISCOI <i>Ah.</i>

354
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,847
<i>Hey, Cisco.</i>

355
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,121
Yes?

356
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,290
I took your cuffs.

357
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,561
Why?

358
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,887
Because I need them.

359
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,520
Is this some sort of,
um, bold fashion choice,

360
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,485
'cause you're not a meta-human...

361
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,846
Surprise.

362
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,369
It started a few months ago.

363
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,801
That's why you went to see your mom,
to see if she could help you.

364
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,691
But she can't. I've run every test.

365
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,922
There's nothing that anyone can do.

366
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,366
<i>I need a favor.</i>

367
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,401
I need you to vibe me in the future

368
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,562
because I need to know if I become her.

369
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,762
You're not gonna become her, okay.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,002
Just because you have these powers

371
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,567
doesn't mean you're gonna
turn into Killer Frost.

372
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,251
I think it might.

373
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,047
Please, I just need to know for sure.

374
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,286
I need to know if I become evil,
because if I do,

375
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,091
I have to leave and never come back.

376
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,115
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

377
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,486
And?

378
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,811
I didn't see anything.

379
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,131
You're fine.

380
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,164
Oh, thank goodness. Thank you.

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,126
Please, um, don't tell anyone
about this yet, okay?

382
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,205
- Of course.
- Okay.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,810
According to this,
all your vitals are fine, Wally.

384
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,331
Wally, what did you see?

385
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,723
I was Kid Flash again,
but this time it wasn't a good dream.

386
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,681
I was fighting with the Rival
at some abandoned sawmill.

387
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,684
That's what happened
in Flashpoint before you got hurt.

388
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,009
They're not just dreams,
they must be memories of that life.

389
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,004
A lot more people are getting powers.

390
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,401
<i>Okay, so how do we stop this?</i>

391
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,529
I mean, is there any stopping it, even?

392
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,047
If Alchemy could reach you at C.C.P.D.,

393
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,406
he could probably reach you
from anywhere, right?

394
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,086
I have a suggestion.
Why don't we throw Wallace

395
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,845
in The Pipeline till we figure
this situation out?

396
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,241
You wanna lock him up?

397
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,687
Yeah, I agree with Joe.
We lock him up because, think about this,

398
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,884
we can't stop Alchemy from
getting into Wallace's head,

399
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,201
but put him in The Pipeline,

400
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,250
then we control the situation
from there on out.

401
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,167
As much as I don't like it, Dad,
maybe he's not wrong.

402
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,211
But only till we figure out
a better way to make you safe.

403
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,606
Yeah, I agree with Joe.

404
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,002
I'm gonna cancel this movie with Cecile.

405
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,444
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
You've got a date with Cecile?

406
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,763
Yeah, I was gonna bring her
to Movie in the Park tonight.

407
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,087
Well, don't not go.

408
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,249
<i>You've put your life on hold
for all of us long enough.</i>

409
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,570
Yeah, Dad, he's right. I mean,
go be "Joe West," you're always "Dad."

410
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,722
Yeah, we'll stay with Wally,
make sure nothing happens.

411
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,689
I told her all of you were coming with me,

412
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,251
am I gonna be the only one that shows up?

413
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,405
Uh, I would love to see a movie.
What movie is this?

414
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,601
<i>The Shining.</i>

415
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,803
<i>The Shining!</i> Oh, I love that movie.

416
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,041
That movie freaks you out!

417
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,720
<i>You've never made it past
the part with the Grady twins.</i>

418
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,241
That was... I was younger.

419
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,765
I might go with you.

420
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,128
- You sure you don't wanna stay?
- No, I wanna be with you.

421
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,725
Either way, the more the merrier.

422
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,968
Let's do it! Yeah, this'll be
great fodder for my novel.

423
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,601
Hold on. You guys didn't tell him about...

424
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,127
Joe, no, they told me.

425
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,243
Finally! The little scamps.

426
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,923
But I think that I have worked
my way around that little problem.

427
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,407
Watch this.

428
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,647
Oh...

429
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,288
Oh, um, let me just...

430
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,441
What did you do?

431
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,806
Did you just neuralyze us?

432
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,284
No, I gave you a simple retinal adjustment
so all of you can see me,

433
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,962
H.R., while the rest of the world sees.

434
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,565
Randolf Morgan.

435
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,488
Joe, I promise, I'll be so quiet.

436
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,802
You won't even know I'm there.
Silent observer.

437
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,363
All right. Wally, keep me posted.

438
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,403
Yeah, I'll be fine. Just go have fun.

439
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,721
That's great.

440
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,530
All right, we wanna be two-thirds
to the back, right in the middle.

441
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,210
That's a very small screen!

442
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,084
Like, I don't know
if we're gonna be able to see...

443
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,368
No, H.R., the screen is perfect, okay?
We'll be able to see fine.

444
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,325
That's where the engineer sits
when he mixes the sound, all right?

445
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,369
You know, when you wanna get
the Kubrick experience,

446
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,641
that's is the sweet spot, right there.

447
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,410
I don't know, maybe we could get
a little closer...

448
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,005
Why don't you let us worry
about the seats,

449
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,366
you take care of the snacks
and the drinks.

450
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,766
Great idea.

451
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Any time.

452
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,046
Oh, I don't...

453
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,006
I'm pretty sure
they're not gonna take

454
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,731
the money from my Earth, I don't think.

455
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,888
- What is this?
- That's a hellbink.

456
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,889
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna get us what we need,

457
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,003
you're gonna do that.
Go over to that stand over there.

458
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,571
- Great idea.
- You're gonna get us some

459
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,843
- licorice sticks, some Jujubes and...
- Jujubes.

460
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,841
Yeah. And coffee. Do you want anything?

461
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,411
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

462
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,406
<i>Okay.</i>

463
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,201
You okay, Cisco?

464
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,091
Yeah, yeah. You know,
just trying to deal with H.R.

465
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,886
Yeah? 'Cause you've been on edge
ever since you vibed me.

466
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,447
- Are you gonna tell me what you saw?
- Yeah, I told you what I saw.

467
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,602
No, but for real.

468
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,248
I can tell when you're not being
honest with me. Am I her?

469
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,806
Yeah.

470
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,085
Yeah, you're her.

471
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,369
I saw the both of us,

472
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,086
fighting.

473
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,405
Like, full on, Vibe versus Killer Frost.

474
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,963
It's like we're meta-frenemies.

475
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,241
Well, have you ever vibed anything

476
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,727
from the future that didn't come true?

477
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,969
Just Earth-2 being ripped to shreds,

478
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,924
but that doesn't mean
that can't happen again.

479
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,928
Caitlin, you have to tell them.

480
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,851
You have to tell the team.
We have to figure out what's going on.

481
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,560
No, it's too late,
there's nothing you could do.

482
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,604
Nobody else needs to know.

483
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,808
<i>I haven't been
to a movie in forever.</i>

484
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,967
<i>I come whenever I can.</i>

485
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,969
I mean, it's sort of
a summer tradition with the kids.

486
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,607
Yeah? You know, it's funny.
You don't really peg me for

487
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,644
a horror movie type. I thought maybe
you'd be more of a chick-flicky.

488
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,968
- Oh, you got jokes.
- Yeah.

489
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,969
I'd be mad if you weren't so gorgeous.

490
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,681
"Gorgeous," really?

491
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,321
If I'm so gorgeous then how come
you're spending more time

492
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,204
looking at that than you are at me?

493
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,330
You know what? You're right.
Cecile, I'm sorry.

494
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,521
My son, Wally, he's...

495
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,606
Going through some changes,
and I'm just, I'm just really concerned.

496
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,966
Hey, Joe, we can do this another time.

497
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,844
No, no, no.
I really wanna be here with you, I do.

498
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,281
It's just that
when one of my kids is hurting, I'm...

499
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,171
Can't think about anything else. At all.

500
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,964
Completely understand.

501
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,327
You have kids?

502
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,891
Yeah, a daughter.

503
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,645
- Oh.
- Just turned 18.

504
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,286
I have less than a year before
she leaves me for college.

505
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,522
- Oh, man, you should've brought her.
- Yeah?

506
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,121
I dragged you away from her
so you can watch a horror movie.

507
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,651
Not many men could.

508
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,326
I'm just glad you finally
figured out what you want.

509
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,086
Me, too.

510
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,084
<i>Wally, you okay?</i>

511
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,403
- I hate that we have to do this.
- Mmm-hmm.

512
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,005
He so badly wanted powers,

513
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,481
and now to keep him locked up
so he doesn't get them, it's...

514
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,881
It's hard, I know.

515
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,730
I don't know if you actually do.

516
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,011
What does that mean?

517
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,846
All Wally wants to do is to help people.

518
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,844
And to see you do that every day,

519
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,168
while all he can do is stand by and watch?

520
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,727
It's hard being a bystander sometimes.

521
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,010
You don't feel that way, too, do you?

522
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,281
Barry...

523
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,841
Come on.

524
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,441
My contributions here are limited.

525
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,963
I don't know science, I don't have powers.

526
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,045
I don't know how to help you.

527
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,884
I couldn't do this without you.

528
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,443
- That's not true.
- That is true.

529
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,284
Whether you realize it or not,
there is no Flash without Iris West.

530
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,247
I'm wolfing this.

531
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,448
- I'm telling you, it's so good!
- Ridiculous.

532
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,449
What is it about popcorn and the movies?

533
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,721
Hey, you okay?

534
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,921
- Hey.
- Yeah, fine.

535
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,930
- Hi. I'm Caitlin.
- Hi. Cecile. Nice to meet you.

536
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,082
And you must be Cisco.

537
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,446
- That's me, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

538
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,926
Don't forget about me!

539
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,088
Hello! I'm H.R. H.R. Randolf.

540
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,561
It's amazing to meet you.

541
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,721
All right, now.

542
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,121
Amazing.

543
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,326
And, those are...
And then she says, she says to me,

544
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,927
"Oh, so you are hot chocolate
from another land."

545
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,765
I said, "Okay, easy now."
Then she says, "Wait a minute.

546
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,008
"Do you speak a foreign language?"

547
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,651
- What did you say?
- Well,

548
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,084
I said...
"Sure, as long as I know the words."

549
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,929
<i>"As long as I know the words."</i>

550
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,364
I'm gonna smack somebody.

551
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,364
Everybody, move! Move!

552
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,731
It's Shade. He's at Hofherr Park.

553
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,489
<i>Wallace. Wallace West.</i>

554
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,400
<i>The time has come to restore
what was taken from you.</i>

555
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,322
<i>The time has come</i>

556
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,964
<i>to set you free.</i>

557
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,322
Hey, hey, the same thing
happened to Frankie.

558
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,323
You have to fight through the pain!

559
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,846
Are you okay?

560
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,845
I think so.

561
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,884
<i>Find me, and I will release you
from all of this.</i>

562
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,281
Wally, what is it?

563
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,521
You have to open the door.

564
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,609
I can't do that, Wally, I can't.

565
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,571
<i>I can make you whole again.</i>

566
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,525
Open the door! I need to get out. Now!

567
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,961
Flash, just who I came to see.

568
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,728
So you like shadows.
You wanna try and catch mine?

569
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,331
Barry, we're in the van. Can you hear us?

570
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,609
And I just got tossed on my ass
like a rag doll.

571
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,807
That's not good.

572
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,083
Guys, I cannot do anything
if I can't see him.

573
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,571
Can we light this place up?

574
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,843
Light's gonna slow down his
molecular vibration so we can catch him.

575
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,125
How are we gonna light this place up?

576
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,765
- See all these cars?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

577
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,251
- I'm gonna hack into their computers.
- Yeah...

578
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,130
- Park's overhead lights...
- Yeah...

579
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,288
Blast the sky with more lumens
than a Pink Floyd concert.

580
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,646
Yeah!

581
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,523
- What are you doing?
- He's gonna need these.

582
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,600
- She took the cuffs.
- She took the cuffs, okay?

583
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,926
Just drop it, all right?

584
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,207
<i>Barry, I'm in.</i>

585
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,484
Okay. All right, wait until my mark.

586
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,285
And by mark, I do mean
the next time that I get punched...

587
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,041
Mark!

588
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,121
<i>Flash!</i>

589
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,249
Don't like the light, do ya?

590
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,531
Nowhere to hide now.

591
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,486
Get me out! Get me out... Ah!

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,731
Help me! Please, make it stop!

593
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,491
Hey, Wally, Wally. Wally, look.
It's over, okay?

594
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,647
Come on, come on, come on.

595
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,086
<i>Find me.</i>

596
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,249
Stay out of my way.

597
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,082
Wally, stop.

598
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,560
Stay out of my way!

599
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,563
Wally wasn't himself. He was possessed.

600
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,046
Alchemy was calling for him.

601
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,441
I knew I shouldn't have left.

602
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,205
It's okay, Joe, nothing happened.

603
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,850
He's not okay, Barry!

604
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,520
This thing's coming after him and
there ain't a damn thing we can do?

605
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,570
Well, we stopped Shade and now
we can focus on Alchemy, all right?

606
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,841
Unless he sends another meta

607
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,565
to Central City to attack,
then we're in trouble.

608
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,921
You think Shade was a distraction?

609
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,724
I agree with Iris,
I think the attack on Wally

610
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,247
and the attack by Shade happened
at essentially the same time,

611
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,249
so that's not a coincidence.

612
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,090
If that's true, that means Alchemy
is gonna be sending

613
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,247
another one of his metas soon.

614
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,441
<i>We don't know that.</i>

615
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,563
Barry, we've found six husks.

616
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,081
So besides Shade, Magenta and Clariss,

617
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,770
there's still three unaccounted for.

618
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,042
Okay, well, if more come,
then we'll stop them.

619
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,084
But Alchemy can't get Wally
if he stays in the cell.

620
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,448
Barry, we can't just let Wally
suffer in there.

621
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,880
And besides, burying our head in the sand

622
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,809
is not gonna make Alchemy go away.

623
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,566
Ignoring the problem
does not get rid of it.

624
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,803
You have to face it, don't we?

625
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,727
What?

626
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,928
- Nothing.
- Come on, Caitlin.

627
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,004
Not right now, Cisco.

628
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,961
I can't just keep this in,
you have to tell them!

629
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,331
Tell them what?

630
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,806
I have powers.

631
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,081
What?

632
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,322
What kind of powers?

633
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,004
The cold kind.

634
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,647
Happy now?

635
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,922
So, what? We're just gonna
keep secrets from each other?

636
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,811
Yeah, well, this wasn't your secret
to tell, was it, Cisco?

637
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,206
I did that because I care about you.

638
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,284
If you cared about me, then you would've
let me tell them all when I was ready.

639
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,488
Because this is happening to me, not you!

640
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,489
I'm the one turning evil.

641
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,604
I'm the one who's gonna
have to leave soon.

642
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,520
I vibed the two of us
fighting each other in the future.

643
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,370
She was Killer Frost.

644
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,129
<i>- I'll go talk to her.</i>
- I got it.

645
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,245
How long have you known?

646
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,400
A few months.

647
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,571
First, I didn't wanna accept
what was happening to me.

648
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,525
<i>But then I had to.</i>

649
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,242
So then, I tried to suppress my powers.

650
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,083
There's no suppressing these powers.

651
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,002
I just can't believe that this is my life.

652
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,531
It shouldn't be.

653
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,887
None of what's happening
to any of you should be.

654
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,765
What do you mean, "Any of us"?

655
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,764
I mean...

656
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,011
Doctor Alchemy,

657
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,767
Wally, you getting powers.

658
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,924
<i>Even Dante being dead in this timeline.</i>

659
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,251
It's all because I created Flashpoint.
Even Iris, who...

660
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,249
I don't know, I think she's disappointed

661
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,363
that she doesn't have powers
and everyone else does.

662
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,404
And no matter what I do now,
everything's different.

663
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,042
So none of this happened before?

664
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,885
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

665
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,126
Wally's up.

666
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,406
Okay.

667
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,246
How you feeling?

668
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,726
I've been better.

669
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,566
- What do we do?
- We gotta come up with something.

670
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,286
Use me.

671
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,164
No. No, no, hell no.

672
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,607
Alchemy's calling for me to go to him.

673
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,921
Follow me to wherever he is,
and we can stop him.

674
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,481
No, we're not asking you to do that.

675
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,246
This is our chance to stop him,
we have to do it.

676
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,481
Wally...

677
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,326
Dad, he wants me, he's hurting me,
so let me fight back.

678
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,689
Wally?

679
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,766
<i>Find me!</i>

680
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,968
<i>Turn him on his side.</i>

681
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,281
All right, get him over, come on.

682
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,125
This should help. It's a mild sedative.

683
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,004
- What is that?
- Lorazepam. It works on seizures,

684
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,328
hopefully it'll work on whatever this is.

685
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,488
These episodes keep happening
more frequently.

686
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,966
<i>Yeah,
and this is just a temporary fix.</i>

687
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,209
If we don't stop it, he could suffer
from permanent brain damage.

688
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,805
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

689
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,845
We have to do what Wally wanted,
we have to use him to find Alchemy.

690
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,280
No, we're... It's too dangerous.

691
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,289
So is doing nothing.

692
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,644
Need I remind everyone that Doctor Alchemy
has a rock that shoots lasers,

693
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,689
so who knows what he has up his sleeve?

694
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,326
Cisco's right.
What if we're walking into a trap?

695
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,891
You guys aren't walking into anything.

696
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,326
You guys are gonna stay here.

697
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,050
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

698
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,327
What does that mean?

699
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,686
It means that if I'm gonna
put Wally at risk,

700
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,247
I'm gonna use everything
in my power to protect him.

701
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,201
Double-check your packs,
make sure we have everything.

702
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,731
- Good to go.
- Yeah.

703
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,880
So what's the plan, Detective?

704
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,481
This lunatic calls himself Alchemy.

705
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,250
He's the one responsible
for all these husks

706
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,845
we've been finding all over town.

707
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,327
But we believe we've found a way
to get his location.

708
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,561
How?

709
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,762
By using his next target.

710
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,321
Your son? We'll stop him, Joe.

711
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,841
Where's Julian?

712
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,240
He didn't come in today.

713
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,760
What? He never misses a day. You call him?

714
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,525
Yeah, it went straight to voicemail.

715
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,366
Well.

716
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,001
All right, gents, move out.

717
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,201
Let's roll.

718
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,528
All right, be safe. I'll see you in a few.

719
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,046
You ready?

720
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,201
Yeah.

721
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,126
Hey, you remember when I said that
you remind me of myself as a kid?

722
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,888
I was never this brave.

723
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,886
They've just left.

724
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,969
I'm almost done, I'll be right there.

725
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,602
Cisco, I'm so sorry about how I reacted.

726
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,567
I understand why you told everyone.

727
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,884
It never helps when we keep things
from each other.

728
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,971
You're right, and I'm glad
that you told everyone.

729
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,802
I'm just not very good at asking for help.

730
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,963
I get that from my mom.

731
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,164
You're better than your mother.

732
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,085
I don't know.

733
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,168
I'm just so terrified because
she said if I keep using my powers,

734
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,643
then it'll be impossible to stop them.

735
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,241
Your mother might be one of the most
accomplished scientists on this planet,

736
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,843
but when it comes to the impossible?

737
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,085
We're the experts.

738
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,763
We're gonna help you, Caitlin. Okay?

739
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,325
Okay.

740
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,005
Let's go help Wally.

741
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,001
You got it.

742
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,281
<i>We're moving in.</i>

743
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,601
<i>Just remember,</i>

744
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,006
<i>once you get in there,
we're not gonna have eyes.</i>

745
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,441
Copy that.

746
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,367
Of course dude uses
an abandoned subway to set up shop.

747
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,522
Of course he does.

748
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,121
- Where's Grodd when you need him?
- Grodd... Gorilla Grodd?

749
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,687
You have sentient gorillas
on your Earth, too?

750
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,844
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we do. Many. Many. Yeah.

751
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,570
<i>Come to me, Wallace!</i>

752
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,407
- Everybody set?
- We're good. Just lead the way.

753
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,366
You okay?

754
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,721
Yeah.

755
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,243
It's okay to be scared, Wally.

756
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,846
I am.

757
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,726
You are?

758
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,010
Keeps me alert.

759
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,170
Then I'm on high alert.

760
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,405
Let's do this.

761
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,371
Hello, Wally.

762
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,611
Are you him?

763
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,041
Are you the voice
I've been hearing inside my head?

764
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,725
I am Alchemy.

765
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,328
I've been having visions of another life.

766
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,724
Where I have speed, where I'm...

767
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,445
The Flash.

768
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,649
I can give you that back,
should you desire it.

769
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,684
I just want the pain to stop.

770
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,410
It will, child.

771
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,687
Whatever you desire, I will see it so.

772
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,120
Now tell me, do you wish for the life
that was taken from you

773
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,165
to return?

774
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,684
What I wish for

775
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,843
is all of you gone.

776
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,606
It's a trap!

777
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,121
No!

778
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,530
The boy has been chosen, Flash.

779
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,841
And you will not stand before
what must be,

780
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,560
<i>ever again.</i>

781
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,007
Now!

782
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,643
Get on your knees! Now!
Don't move! Don't move!

783
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,085
<i>Get down! On the ground.</i>

784
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,324
I said get on the ground.

785
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,847
That was a grave mistake.

786
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,163
- You okay?
- I'll be fine. Wally?

787
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,761
Yeah.

788
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,686
It's over, Alchemy.

789
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,171
Over?

790
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,729
You have no idea

791
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,331
what's about to begin.

792
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,601
What the hell?

793
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,762
Did you guys see that?

794
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,286
See what?

795
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,525
Go! Get the hell out of here!

796
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,922
Wally, move towards the door!
Stick with me!

797
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,971
- Move!
- Crap, the other way, the other way!

798
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,248
Go, go, go! Wally, no!

799
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,404
Barr! Are you all right?

800
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,126
<i>Wallace.</i>

801
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,244
<i>Wallace West.</i>

802
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,327
<i>Take your power.</i>

803
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,164
Wally.

804
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,410
- Wally, don't!
- Wally!

805
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,441
Who are you?

806
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,689
Savitar, the god of speed.

807
