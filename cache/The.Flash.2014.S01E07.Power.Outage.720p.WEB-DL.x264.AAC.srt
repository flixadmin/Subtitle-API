<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I'm the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother</i>

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:08,941
<i>killed by something impossible.</i>

5
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,309
<i>Run, Barry, run!</i>

6
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,849
<i>Then an accident made me
the impossible.</i>

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,183
<i>To the outside world,</i>

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,618
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,</i>

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,354
<i>but secretly I use my speed
to fight crime</i>

11
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,989
<i>and find others like me,</i>

12
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,592
<i>and one day I'll find
who killed my mother...</i>

13
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,161
<i>- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.</i>

14
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,930
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

15
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,832
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

16
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,434
Ronnie!

17
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,137
17 people died that night;
many more were injured.

18
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,539
I'm not the most popular person
in town these days.

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,341
We're just supposed to
get used to working

20
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,443
Above a makeshift prison

21
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,945
Housing evil people
with superpowers.

22
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,480
What is this?

23
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,682
Somewhere you'll never
hurt anyone ever again.

24
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,291
- Farooq!
- It's not safe.

25
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,093
Come down.

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,394
Farooq, I'm serious.

27
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,662
It's gonna rain.

28
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,997
Y'all are tripping.

29
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,732
This is the best seat
in the house.

30
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,000
Whoo!

31
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,668
You know, when I said
we should watch

32
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,270
The particle accelerator
turn on,

33
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:16,141
I just meant we should get naked
and howl at the moon.

34
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,709
It's already on.

35
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,044
Consider me unimpressed.

36
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,414
Whoo!

37
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,415
Yeah, baby.

38
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,686
Oh.

39
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,756
- This is awesome.
- Are you seeing this?

40
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,093
Oh, man,
I think I am tripping.

41
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,727
Oh, man.

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,507
Get in the car!

43
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,541
Get in the car!

44
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,917
Farooq!

45
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,721
- Farooq!
- Farooq!

46
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,857
Good day, Dr. Wells.

47
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,926
One can always hope, Gideon.

48
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,161
Bring up my log, would you?

49
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,096
Certainly.

50
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,764
Go ahead, doctor.

51
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,166
New entry.

52
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,269
It has now been 311 days
since lightning struck.

53
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:54,840
Subject has begun relying
on his speed in everyday life,

54
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,444
Using his extraordinary powers
to solve ordinary problems...

55
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,048
I'm late.

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,152
And accomplish ordinary tasks.

57
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:11,390
Unfortunately, his penchant
for the heroic persists.

58
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,025
I hate it
when they let the new guy train

59
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,826
during the morning rush.

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>- Did you get one too?
- Yeah.</i>

61
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,905
<i>Wow.</i>

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,074
<i>The fact is...</i>

63
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,309
<i>Don't try nothing.</i>

64
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,710
<i>He can be a bit of a showoff.</i>

65
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,246
Wallet.
Now.

66
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,014
Oh, this is awesome.
You've got to be kidding me.

67
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,482
Hold on, okay?
I'm just gonna...

68
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,917
I'm gonna set this down.

69
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,686
I mean, this is crazy.

70
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,988
There are literally
hundreds of thousands

71
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,822
Of people in Central City,

72
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,825
And out of everyone you could
have picked to rob, you pick me.

73
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,328
What, are you sick?
Money, now.

74
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,797
I just... you're really gonna
be kicking yourself, man.

75
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,999
I mean, if there was an Olympics
for bad luck,

76
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,500
You didn't just medal, pal.

77
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,302
You Michael Phelps-ed.

78
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,638
I'll count to three.
Then I'm gonna shoot you.

79
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,139
One...
Yeah.

80
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,774
Two.

81
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:11,717
And while his desire
to help others is commendable,

82
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,586
It is impeding him
from realizing the full scope

83
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,288
Of his abilities.

84
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,959
But there's still time,

85
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,895
As the future remains intact.

86
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,868
- Where's Barry?
- He's late.

87
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,639
Late is kind of
his signature move.

88
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,541
Hey, you guys
want to see my signature move?

89
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,613
Sorry, guys,
I got a little held up.

90
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,884
You had to be there.

91
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,553
I'm gonna need a moment
or two alone with Barry.

92
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,361
Ooh, you're in trouble.

93
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,564
Now, may I remind you,
Mr. Allen, we had an agreement.

94
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,366
We would help with your heroics
out there

95
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,001
While you would help us
research and develop

96
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,271
Your abilities in here, right?

97
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,306
Yeah.
No, I know.

98
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,007
I-I guess I've just

99
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,676
Gotten a little caught up
with being able to help people,

100
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,678
You know, put bad guys away.

101
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,878
It feels good.

102
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,513
Imagine how good it will feel

103
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,948
To cure diseases, stop aging,
reverse paralysis.

104
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,884
All good causes.

105
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,952
So how can I help you do that?

106
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,221
You need more MRIs,
more blood, or...

107
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,957
- I need more speed.
- Okay.

108
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,327
Speed is the key to progress.

109
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,799
You need to kick it up a notch.

110
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,468
There was a homicide.

111
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,803
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

112
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,805
This is not just about you.

113
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,541
Remember that, Barry.

114
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,775
Yeah.

115
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,823
I hope you both skipped
your breakfast.

116
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,324
Whoa.

117
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,293
What the hell could do that?

118
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,996
2,400 degrees, give or take.

119
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,898
This area's filled
with combustibles.

120
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,668
How come nothing else burned up?

121
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,436
Where you going?

122
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,005
You see the soot on the ground
where the cement is burnt?

123
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,442
- Yeah.
- That's evidence of arc blasts.

124
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,111
Happens when
high-amperage currents

125
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,780
Travel or arc through the air.

126
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,848
There's no live wires.

127
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,250
There's no utility poles.

128
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,085
So how was this guy
electrocuted?

129
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,424
Well, the first thing
we need to do is ID Him.

130
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,725
Yeah.

131
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,827
His face is melted off.

132
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,230
How's that picture
gonna help ID Him?

133
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,831
I got mad skills.

134
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,933
Please don't ever
say that again.

135
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,201
All right.

136
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,572
Hey, are you okay?

137
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,040
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

138
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,522
I don't know.
You seem a little off.

139
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,249
- No, I'm fine.
- All right.

140
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,921
Facial recognition software...

141
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,890
It's designed for archeologists,

142
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,426
And it should help us ID
Your crispy corpse.

143
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,628
The question is, how did he
get fried in the first place?

144
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,330
Is there a metahuman out there
that can control electricity?

145
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,132
It'd take a serious
electrostatic discharge

146
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,101
To cause that level
of tissue damage.

147
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,836
Guys,
according to the software,

148
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,640
There's an 82% chance
your victim looked like this.

149
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,241
82%?

150
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,610
Hey, it was zero
when you walked in here, pal.

151
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,412
Can you cross-reference that
with the DMV database,

152
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,647
Maybe get a name?

153
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,081
Absolutely.

154
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,683
This software can do
just about anything

155
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,585
Now that Felicity
reprogrammed it.

156
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,786
Casey Donahue.

157
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,621
No wife. No kids.

158
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,124
Used to work at the Petersburg
electrical substation.

159
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,493
- That can't be a coincidence.
- That's weird.

160
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,663
Someone just used his ID
To enter the substation.

161
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,665
The Petersburg grid
is experiencing a power drain

162
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,099
Right now.

163
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,101
Barry, be...

164
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,436
Careful.

165
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,022
I'm pretty sure
this is a restricted area.

166
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,068
Easy there, zappy.

167
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,637
I have to feed.

168
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,183
Whoa, what was that?

169
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,193
More of that.

170
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,528
I need more.

171
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,897
Barry, what's happening?

172
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,715
Too much.

173
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,217
Too much.

174
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,252
Get out of there.

175
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,958
Run, Barry.

176
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,564
I can't.

177
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,632
My speed...

178
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,634
Is gone.

179
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,216
He runs slow
even for a normal person.

180
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,752
You can't just
lose your powers, okay?

181
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,555
Your DNA was transformed by
the particle accelerator blast.

182
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,924
There's no way
to untransform DNA.

183
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,926
Yeah, tell that
to the uber driver

184
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,128
Who charged me 65 bucks
to take me here.

185
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,097
I had to tell her I was coming
from a cosplay party.

186
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,632
So we were wrong.

187
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,434
This metahuman
doesn't electrocute people;

188
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:06,371
He siphons electricity,
thereby removing your power.

189
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:10,875
All right, do we think
this is temporary or...

190
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,478
We have to run tests.

191
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,046
Yeah.

192
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,448
I've got to warn Joe.

193
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:23,288
Barry, we will find a way
to restore your speed.

194
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,289
I promise you that.

195
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,375
- You didn't catch it.
- I loved that mug.

196
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,876
And what part
of "a metahuman stole my speed"

197
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,444
Didn't you understand?

198
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,246
Barry, there's no part
of anything you can do

199
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,749
That I ever understand.

200
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,283
What does Dr. Wells say?

201
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,718
He's working on it.

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,121
Barry, you have to get
your speed back.

203
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,589
People in this city
need protecting,

204
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,291
And if you don't get your speed,

205
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,093
How the hell
are we gonna keep them safe?

206
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,695
Joe, the meta
who stole my speed,

207
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,131
He burned up the body
we saw in the alley today.

208
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,099
You need to tell the police
not to confront him.

209
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,468
- He's dangerous.
- Who's dangerous?

210
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,604
No one, just some thief.

211
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,874
Well, criminals
better watch out.

212
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,376
Cops in Central City
are the best there are,

213
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,145
And if you can't
protect this city, dad,

214
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,647
I know the Flash will.

215
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,049
What if he can't?

216
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,451
What if he's gone?

217
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,819
Gone?

218
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,454
Yeah, or maybe he's just done,

219
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,589
Or maybe it's like
whatever he could do before,

220
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,590
He can't do anymore.

221
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,792
- Huh?
- Barry?

222
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,361
Don't you have
someplace to be?

223
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,629
Yeah, going.

224
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,868
Aw, Barry loved that mug.

225
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,754
That's a quality
time piece, young man.

226
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,224
Oh, uh, thanks.

227
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,226
They took mine,

228
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,195
All of them.

229
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,329
I guess
you shouldn't have done

230
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,931
Whatever it is you did.

231
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,671
Come on.

232
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,743
Gideon, show me the future.

233
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,077
Certainly, doctor.

234
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,916
Run a complete search.

235
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,052
Show any references
to the Flash.

236
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,587
Zero references to the Flash.

237
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,888
Look again.

238
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,189
Zero references.

239
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,024
Show any references
to Barry Allen.

240
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,726
Zero references
to Barry Allen.

241
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,261
Look again!

242
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,698
I've searched 3,452 times,
Dr. Wells.

243
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,533
There's nothing.

244
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,375
You think I'll ever
wear it again?

245
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:01,012
I hope so.

246
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:05,283
I didn't have my speed
for very long,

247
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,155
But now that it's gone, it feels
like part of me is gone too.

248
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:14,726
With or without your speed,
you're still you, Barry.

249
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,628
But I'm not.

250
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,464
I'm not the best version of me.

251
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,633
I love being the Flash.

252
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,104
I love everything about it:

253
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,507
The feeling of running
hundreds of miles per hour,

254
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,678
Wind and power
just rushing past my face,

255
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
Being able to help people.

256
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,819
I'm not sure
I can live without it, Caitlin.

257
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,557
- Farooq Gibran.
- Who?

258
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,725
The powers vampire
who jacked your speed.

259
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,960
I hacked into
the surveillance footage

260
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,562
From the Petersburg substation.

261
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,330
Once I got his face,
it was easy to find a match.

262
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,798
He climbed an electrical tower

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,500
The night
of the accelerator explosion.

264
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,569
No surprise
where his powers came from.

265
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,677
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

266
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,078
This is not happening.

267
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,346
Dr. Harrison Wells,

268
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,848
I need to see you!

269
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,150
Come on,
I know you're inside.

270
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,018
Open the door.

271
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,654
I just want to talk, Dr. Wells.

272
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,389
Wells!

273
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,691
Let me in!

274
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,529
Joe.

275
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,231
Hello, Iris.

276
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,233
I am out.

277
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,301
I need you to cover for me
until the shift change.

278
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,369
Only one headline,

279
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,838
Prison transfer,
William Tockman.

280
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,426
Guns on the floor!

281
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,628
It should take you
less than three seconds

282
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,798
To discard any thought
of rebellion and comply.

283
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,404
I take it I don't need to
count out loud.

284
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,144
Hmm.

285
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,412
Striking resemblance.

286
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,964
He's inside.

287
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,176
Captain,

288
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,811
Tockman has
at least ten hostages.

289
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,781
Two officers down.

290
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,683
Copy that.
When is the power back?

291
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,118
We're on gennies for now.

292
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,089
- Not now.
- Wait.

293
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,924
Captain Singh,
I've been trying to get in touch

294
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,994
With Joe or anyone
at the precinct.

295
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,429
There's a hostage situation,
Barry,

296
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,430
And Joe's inside.

297
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,800
So's his daughter.

298
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,935
I'll call you when I know more.

299
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,336
Wait...

300
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,474
Joe and Iris are in trouble.

301
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,142
I need my powers back now.

302
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,177
I have a theory.

303
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,312
It's untested.

304
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm willing to roll the dice.

305
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,782
Okay,
you've lost your speed, yes,

306
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,451
But nothing has changed
inside you on a subatomic level.

307
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,755
In other words,
your cells are still primed.

308
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,323
They just need a jumpstart.

309
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,924
Okay, how do we do that?
How do we jumpstart me?

310
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,926
We need to replicate
the initial jolt to your system.

311
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,062
But that would mean
a peak current

312
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,930
Of at least 20,000 kilo-amps.

313
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,665
Are you insane?

314
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,167
That's more electricity than
they give to people

315
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,535
In the electric chair.

316
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,103
Caitlin,
with Farooq in the building,

317
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,571
We're all looking
at a death sentence here.

318
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,006
The spare generator's offline.

319
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,208
If we reboot it,
we could get a charge that big.

320
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,110
We need something
that can transmit the load

321
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,779
From the generator
to Barry's body

322
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,080
Without shorting out.

323
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,181
The treadmill.

324
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,682
My baby could take the charge.

325
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,184
What if Barry can't?

326
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,552
Well, that's up to Mr. Allen.

327
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,555
Where are you going?

328
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,159
I'm gonna talk to him.

329
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,760
No. No.

330
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,363
Okay, you didn't see him
at the substation.

331
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,165
He needed to feed.

332
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,767
I got super speed out of
the particle accelerator blast,

333
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,035
But his best friends died.

334
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,603
He woke up with a disease.

335
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,872
Earlier today,
you worked a crime scene

336
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,341
Where this metahuman
electrocuted an innocent man.

337
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,943
He's a murderer!

338
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,247
And you are powerless
to defend yourself against him.

339
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,149
He may just need help
like I did.

340
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,452
I don't need my powers
to offer him that.

341
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,953
I have to try.

342
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,126
Tockman?

343
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,894
Tockman.

344
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:17,962
Tockman!

345
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,330
I am presently in control

346
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,233
Of eight
of Central City's finest,

347
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,801
Three underpaid assistants,

348
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,070
And one very brave
civilian girl.

349
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,672
You've got demands;
I want to hear them.

350
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,408
But first let the civilians go.

351
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,145
Would you prefer
I sent them out alive or dead?

352
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,746
Please be more specific.

353
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,484
One helicopter,
one vegetarian takeout meal,

354
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,453
One laptop
with eight gigabytes of RAM

355
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,390
will be delivered on this roof
at exactly 53 minutes

356
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,793
and 27 seconds from now,

357
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,429
or I shoot a hostage.

358
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,631
There is a citywide blackout.

359
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,433
I'm gonna need more time.

360
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:59,837
Captain, you may delay,
but time will not.

361
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,540
Benjamin Franklin.

362
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,542
Very good, detective.

363
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,715
Hey, whoa, whoa.

364
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,316
Whoa, whoa, easy.

365
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,186
I'm not gonna hurt you.

366
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,054
You can't hurt me.

367
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,223
Where is Harrison Wells?

368
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,325
Look,
I know what happened to you.

369
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,895
The night of the accelerator
explosion, it changed you.

370
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,531
It changed me too.

371
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,404
You were the one
in the red suit.

372
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,506
I fed from you.

373
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,074
I have to keep feeding.

374
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,011
All right, I know
this has to be terrifying.

375
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,015
That's why I want to help you,
okay?

376
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,717
The night of the explosion,
when the light hit me,

377
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,986
It stopped my heart.

378
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,688
Jake and Darya...

379
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,123
They were your friends.

380
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,059
I woke up,
and they were beside me, dead.

381
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,527
They tried to give me CPR.

382
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,631
They were touching me,
and I electrocuted them.

383
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,002
This is not your fault.

384
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,240
I know.

385
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,378
Wells did this to me.

386
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,550
Farooq,
you need to listen to me.

387
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,029
Not sure
how long that will hold.

388
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,232
Done being noble, Mr. Allen?

389
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,634
Caitlin, get him
to the treadmill.

390
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,337
Cisco,
bring the generator online.

391
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,172
Make sure Barry gets the charge.

392
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:44,008
What?
You're not coming with me?

393
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,077
I am not leaving you.

394
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,012
Listen to me.

395
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,047
Of everything
I've done in my life,

396
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,482
Of everything I have invented,

397
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:54,518
My most important creation
is the Flash.

398
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,021
Barry Allen must have a future.

399
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,723
Now, go.

400
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,558
Go!

401
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,133
End this now,
and I'll talk to the DA.

402
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,072
It was your district attorney
that denied me furlough

403
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:20,444
So I could visit my dying sister
one last time,

404
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,246
Say good-bye to her in person.

405
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,362
That's time I'll never get back!

406
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,956
So however long
I have in this life,

407
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:38,262
I promise not one second more
will be spent in a prison cell.

408
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,298
Got him.

409
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,299
Eddie!

410
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,707
Eddie.
Eddie, Eddie.

411
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,909
An officer was just shot
9.2 seconds ago.

412
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,579
I'd pick up the pace in meeting
my demands, Captain.

413
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,655
I'm not healing fast anymore.

414
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,927
That's unfortunate.
Don't worry.

415
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,030
When Dr. Wells has a theory,
he's usually right.

416
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,800
What if something happens
to Joe and Iris first?

417
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,799
Come to check on your pet?

418
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,835
Why don't you just kill me, huh?

419
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,938
Get it over with.

420
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,640
Quid pro quo.

421
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,709
That's Latin, Mr. Woodward.

422
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,177
You've heard of Latin?

423
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,079
Quid pro quo means something
for something,

424
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,583
And in this case
that something is your freedom.

425
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08,219
I'm prepared to grant it to you.

426
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,822
How do you know
I won't kill you?

427
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,224
Let's call that
a calculated risk,

428
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,425
One I'm willing to take.

429
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,193
- Really?
- That's right.

430
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:17,561
Why would you do that?

431
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,164
Because there is
another metahuman

432
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,266
Loose in this facility.

433
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,737
I want you to kill him.

434
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,401
Did you know the human body
generates electricity?

435
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:01,605
The average person
gives off 342 watts,

436
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
And I can smell it
coming from you.

437
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:07,246
♪

438
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,001
- Turn on the treadmill.
- You're still hurt.

439
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,970
We don't have time!

440
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,815
Been dying to punch somebody.

441
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,629
Ouch.

442
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,297
- Caitlin!
- I can't.

443
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,799
We don't have a choice.

444
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,701
If I turn this on,
it could kill you.

445
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,302
If you don't,
we could all die.

446
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,638
I already lost someone
I cared about in this building.

447
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,906
I can't do it again.

448
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,578
Listen, someone once told me

449
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,914
That I was struck by that
lightning for a reason,

450
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,216
That it chose me.

451
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,552
I'm not sure I believe it.

452
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,854
Right now, it doesn't matter
what I believe.

453
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,994
What do you believe?

454
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,004
Come on.

455
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,151
My god, are you okay?

456
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,819
Did you feel anything?

457
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,929
It didn't work.

458
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,769
Please, he's bleeding.

459
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,470
You have to let us
get him some help.

460
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,239
You'll stay where you are.

461
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,341
And while you're killing time,
he's bleeding out.

462
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,946
As if you could kill time
without wounding eternity.

463
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,380
Henry David Thoreau.

464
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,282
Ooh, good.

465
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,525
A little battlefield trick.

466
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,360
Eddie.

467
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,202
If he lives long enough
to receive medical treatment,

468
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,439
They'll know the exact time
the tourniquet was applied.

469
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,876
What?
No "thank you"?

470
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,579
They call you the clock king,
right?

471
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,982
A somewhat florid appellation,

472
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,484
But I've grown to see
the humor in it.

473
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,052
You're going back to prison.

474
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,821
Really?

475
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,522
And... and how do you reckon?

476
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,491
Because the Flash is coming.

477
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,492
Oh.

478
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,330
Oh, where are you?

479
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,508
Tony.

480
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,010
Hey, Tony, what are you doing?

481
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,779
Oh, come on.
You know me, Allen.

482
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,848
I never run from a fight.

483
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,617
All right,
well, stay with me, okay?

484
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,987
You're good.

485
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,156
Run.

486
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,524
What?

487
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,093
Hey, Tony.

488
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,633
No.

489
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:50,934
Barry.

490
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,745
Early.

491
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,451
You ever seen the city
at night by helicopter?

492
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,053
It's quite spectacular.

493
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,562
You're winded.
That's not good.

494
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,804
I need to take your blood
and figure out what happened.

495
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,268
I can't believe he's dead.

496
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,103
Dr. Wells?

497
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,672
No, no.
Tony Woodward.

498
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,174
He escaped from the pipeline.

499
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,909
He must have got out
when the blackout hit.

500
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,610
Not possible.

501
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,412
The pipeline was designed
to withstand a power outage.

502
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,654
Someone had to have let him go.

503
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,517
I did.

504
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,020
I released him.

505
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,388
Why?

506
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,856
To divert
our intruder's attention

507
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,524
While we worked
to restore your speed.

508
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,259
You used him as a distraction?

509
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,728
An unnecessary one,
as it turns out.

510
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,396
It seems the plan has failed.

511
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,699
I...

512
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,739
I have his blood on me.

513
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,307
How could you do that?

514
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,008
You're showing a lot
of sentiment for a man

515
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,510
Who tormented you as a child.

516
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,178
Tony might have been
a bully then and now,

517
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,880
But he didn't deserve to die.

518
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,916
Does Caitlin or Cisco or me

519
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,118
Or you?

520
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,986
I had a choice to make,
him or us.

521
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,921
I chose us
without a second thought.

522
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,324
Well, all your talk
about miracle cures

523
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,658
And scientific breakthroughs,

524
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,228
But you don't care about people
at all.

525
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,629
Well, maybe you care too much,
Barry.

526
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,097
I know being a hero
is important to you,

527
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,632
And I respect your ideals.

528
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,667
I just don't have the luxury
of sharing them.

529
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:31,802
I forgot.

530
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,071
Your game's chess.

531
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:38,175
We're all just pawns to you,
right?

532
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:41,411
So what's your move, doctor?

533
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,514
Which one of us
gets sacrificed next?

534
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,299
We have to get
out of the facility.

535
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,001
We just left him on D level.

536
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,503
We'll never make it
to the main entrance from here.

537
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,072
What about the garage,
the mobile lab van?

538
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,607
It's my move, Mr. Allen,

539
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,976
And I say we make a run for it.

540
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,645
Oh, my god.
Barry, look.

541
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,414
Your cells, they're rapidly
regenerating.

542
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,288
I still don't have my speed.

543
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,225
It must be mental,
not physical.

544
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,428
Oh, you have the yips.

545
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,330
- The whats?
- You know.

546
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,399
When a second baseman all of
a sudden can't throw to first

547
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,067
Or a golfer tries to putt

548
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,069
And they get all embarrassed
and upset,

549
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,137
And then that makes
the yips worse,

550
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,672
And it's a hot mess,

551
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,674
And then they feel
like even more of a failure.

552
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,175
That's not helping.

553
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,913
Look, you asked if I believed

554
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,815
You were struck by lightning
for a reason,

555
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,817
If you were chosen.

556
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,152
I believe.

557
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,687
You should too.

558
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,124
Let's move.

559
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,964
Tockman, no.

560
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,298
No, don't do this, not her.

561
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,867
No, take me, please.

562
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,402
Something tells me you
will not be a docile passenger.

563
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,671
- She will.
- Dad. Dad.

564
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:17,841
Wait, wait!
Let her say good-bye.

565
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:21,545
This is her boyfriend
lying here dying,

566
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:26,350
And I think you and me both know
that he probably won't make it.

567
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,552
It's wrong that you didn't get
to say good-bye to your sister.

568
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,220
Give them what you deserved.

569
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,894
You have 20 seconds.

570
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,331
Eddie. Eddie.

571
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,666
Sorry, babe.

572
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,301
No, please.

573
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,303
You have to hang on
for me, okay?

574
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,905
I'm gonna be right back.

575
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,224
Let's go.

576
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,365
Second van, keys are inside.

577
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,402
Come on.

578
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,238
Get in!
Come on!

579
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,916
Come on.

580
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,718
He's here.

581
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,596
Barry.

582
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,231
Quickly.

583
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,400
Time and tide wait for no man.

584
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,639
Wait, let her say good-bye.

585
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,207
You have 20 seconds.

586
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,376
Ankle holster.

587
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,285
Iris!

588
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,286
Oh, my god, are you okay?

589
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,554
I'm okay.
Come on.

590
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,856
- Did he hit you?
- I'm okay.

591
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,091
Guys.

592
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,826
Oh, my god.

593
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,027
Oh, my god.
No, please.

594
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,028
Hey!

595
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,165
You're here for me.

596
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,437
Finally you show your face.

597
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:31,008
Well, I wasn't exactly eager
to be killed.

598
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,944
Neither were my friends.

599
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,379
I know.

600
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,847
I hurt a lot of people
that night.

601
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,015
People?

602
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,850
You don't even know their names.

603
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,285
Jake Davenport.

604
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,788
Darya Kim.

605
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,024
Ralph Dibny, Al Rothstein,

606
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,526
Grant Emerson, Will Everett,

607
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,630
Bea da Costa, Ronnie Raymond.

608
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,667
I know the names of every person
who died that night.

609
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,469
I know they all mattered,

610
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,339
And the fact that the world is
now deprived of their potential

611
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,341
Is something that I have to
live with every day,

612
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:07,611
But these people... these people
have done nothing wrong.

613
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:08,912
You want to punish me?

614
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,949
Fine, let's do that,

615
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,451
But let these people live.

616
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,091
You died that night too.

617
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,328
No!

618
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,431
You just didn't know it
till today.

619
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,997
Iris.

620
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,978
We could have called him
"blackout."

621
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,314
He had a name, Cisco.

622
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,082
I'm just not sure
what happened.

623
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:30,086
Why didn't he just siphon
all my powers like before?

624
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,323
Because you finally stopped
thinking about your powers

625
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,192
And just connected to them.

626
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,127
Look, this is a sample
of your blood

627
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,162
From just after you were struck
by lightning.

628
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:43,900
Now your cells are generating
more energy than ever before.

629
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:48,004
It was more energy than the meta
could safely handle.

630
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,806
It's almost like
he choked on you.

631
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,708
But what does that mean?

632
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,177
It means you've
kicked it up a notch.

633
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,256
Dr. Wells.

634
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,193
What I said about how you don't
care about people, I...

635
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,430
No, look, Barry.

636
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,569
There is a reason that
my biography describes me

637
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:24,741
As arrogant, prickly, brusque...

638
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,309
"at times contemptuous."

639
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,379
- I read it twice.
- You were right.

640
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,981
I don't care much for people,
Barry.

641
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,883
I find them misinformed,
shortsighted.

642
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,051
So why do you do what you do?

643
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,453
Why get up in the morning?

644
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,655
Because I believe
in a better future,

645
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,557
One that I very much
want to see,

646
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,058
One that you are a part of.

647
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,795
I might not much care
for people, Barry,

648
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,798
But I care about you.

649
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,242
Trauma team to the NICU.
Trauma team to the NICU.

650
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,546
Hey, Allen.

651
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,681
Hey, Eddie.

652
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,683
Flowers.

653
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:10,353
That's so nice.

654
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,322
Where were you all night?

655
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:15,859
Home, trying to eat all
the ice cream before it melted.

656
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,295
I love ice cream.

657
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,697
He is on pain meds,
lots of them,

658
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,300
But he's gonna be okay.

659
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,501
It's been some night.

660
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,869
I am gonna get some coffee.

661
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:26,970
I'll be back.

662
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,143
Dude.

663
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,049
Awesome.

664
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:41,017
I guess you're feeling better.

665
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,720
Oh, yeah.

666
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:44,821
Did you guys see that?

667
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,827
You're just high, partner.

668
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,196
Right, I forgot.

669
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,539
Oh, now you show up.

670
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,774
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you today.

671
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,211
- It couldn't be helped.
- It's okay.

672
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,247
A girl's got to be her own hero
every now and again.

673
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,250
I promise I'll never
be late again.

674
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,885
My best friend
is always saying that,

675
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,854
And he is always late.

676
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,859
You're worth being
on time for.

677
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,270
Honey, you all right?

678
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,939
Yeah, why?

679
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,607
You forgot your coffee.

680
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,678
Oh, uh...

681
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,185
Good day, Dr. Wells.

682
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,720
Yes, it is, Gideon.

683
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,522
Bring up my log, please,
new entry.

684
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:56,593
It has now been 312 days
since lightning struck.

685
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,695
In the past 24 hours,

686
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,030
Subject has taken
a great leap forward,

687
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:05,034
Causing me to revise
my initial thesis.

688
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:09,239
I thought... well, I thought
his attachment to people

689
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,776
Was a distraction
slowing down his progress.

690
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,945
Now I realize
the opposite is true.

691
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:21,518
Barry's attachment to people,
the people he cares about,

692
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,522
Is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

693
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:28,958
In the meantime, good news.

694
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,062
The future remains intact.

695
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,835
You're early.

696
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,069
Yeah, I know.

697
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,105
It feels weird to me too.

698
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,842
I thought after yesterday,
you'd want to sleep in.

699
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:48,578
Can't.
There's too much work to do.

700
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,280
I'm ready to do it.

701
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,948
I want to push myself,

702
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,984
Find out how fast
I can really go.

703
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,886
You were right.

704
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,089
This is not just about me.

705
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,925
Let's get to work.

706
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,099
Now, you...

707
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,172
Had the ability
to steal the Flash's powers,

708
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,907
And I...

709
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:02,051
Would love to know...

710
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,419
How you did that.

711
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,143
Greg, move your head.
