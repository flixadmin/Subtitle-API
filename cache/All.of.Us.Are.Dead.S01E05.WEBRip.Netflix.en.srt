1
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,701
Stay away from us.

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,120
Stay away!

3
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,040
Shit. We won't go to heaven now.

4
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,750
We're alive, so this is heaven.

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,529
JUNG YONG-HYEON

6
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:25,627
In some countries, they are sadder
when adults die than when children die.

7
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,672
And in others,
they are sadder when children die.

8
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,051
Which do you think our country is?

9
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,680
What do you mean?

10
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,727
When kids die, you lose hope.

11
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,979
When adults die, you lose their wisdom.

12
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,940
Hope and wisdom.

13
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,567
Which do we value more?

14
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,571
What?

15
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,495
They've been flying around
since yesterday.

16
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,082
If they wanted to save us,
they would have.

17
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,421
But even if they do come,
we won't be the first to be rescued.

18
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,093
We're not that important.

19
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,349
We're just students. Nothing more.

20
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,775
This is Chopper One.

21
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,736
Seven survivors confirmed
at Hyosan City Council.

22
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,414
RESCUE HEADQUARTERS

23
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,304
We have everyone.
We're heading to the quarantine camp now.

24
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,984
Around 11:00 a.m.,
the government announced

25
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,444
they've declared martial law

26
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,071
in order to control
the Hyosan Disturbance.

27
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,992
Since yesterday afternoon,
a strange infection began to spread,

28
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,619
leading to an evacuation order

29
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,329
and a lockdown of the city.

30
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,333
It's the first time in 41 years
that martial law has been declared,

31
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,252
since the Democratization Movement
on May 18, 1980.

32
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,005
I repeat. They have declared martial law

33
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,341
in order to control
the Hyosan Disturbance.

34
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,093
The sense of crisis
caused by the Hyosan acute epidemic

35
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,596
has caused the stock market to crash.

36
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,349
A sidecar that was activated
for both the KOSPI and KOSDAQ

37
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,017
due to the crash caused by Covid-19…

38
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,771
We don't want refugees from Hyosan!

39
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,857
-We don't want them!
-We don't want them!

40
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,486
People from Hyosan, return home right now!

41
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,406
We are the Lord's people
who have received salvation.

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,325
People will die as people,

43
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,786
and demons will die as demons
in these end times.

44
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,621
-Amen!
-Amen!

45
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,040
Stay away!

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,964
-Everyone will die!
-Everyone will die!

47
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,131
What's this?

48
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,092
-Wait.
-Everyone here will die!

49
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,636
-Why won't you let us in?
-Damn it.

50
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,013
-We refuse them!
-We refuse them!

51
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,307
Don't come here! Why are you coming here?

52
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,351
-Please help us!
-Go back!

53
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,894
Go back!

54
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,398
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

55
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,484
Our Lord Jesus Christ

56
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,779
will not ask whether you are his son
or the son of the Devil.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
He will not.

58
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:44,993
EVERYONE WILL DIE!

59
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,704
Those who do not act righteously

60
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,748
and those who do not love
their brothers and sisters…

61
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,084
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

62
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,086
…are not people of God.

63
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,170
-Amen!
-Amen!

64
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,171
-Amen!
-Amen!

65
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,427
We'll break a million views in no time.

66
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,521
With a false rumor that
the Hyosan epidemic has spread to Seoul,

67
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,524
the number of people leaving Korea
through Incheon Airport

68
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,026
rose to 228,000 in a day.

69
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,361
Hello. I apologize

70
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,905
to the people and to the viewers
who were scared

71
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,033
because of our zombie performance
on the subway.

72
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,453
I am on my knees begging for forgiveness

73
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:33,041
for unintentionally causing
a misunderstanding about the crisis…

74
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,336
Is that what you expected? Really?

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,631
SUBWAY ZOMBIE PERFORMANCE
APOLOGY VIDEO

76
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,011
We must expand martial law
to control the media.

77
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,555
There are rumors
that radiation from nuclear bombs

78
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,390
in the US military base
created the zombies.

79
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,268
That the heads of the top 30 corporations
fled the country.

80
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,521
Most of the media are spreading fake news

81
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,191
circulating on social media
without verifying it,

82
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,026
exacerbating the chaos.

83
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,403
The government
should not control the media.

84
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,489
The people control the media.

85
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,575
Our citizens have enough power to do that.

86
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,952
We will not expand martial law.

87
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,248
Let's focus on preventing the spread
and rescuing the uninfected.

88
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
That should be our focus.

89
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,045
-Su-hyeok.
-Hey, Bare-su.

90
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,089
Are you okay?

91
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,257
-Where's the phone?
-Where's Cheong-san?

92
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,227
Su-hyeok.

93
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,398
Where's Cheong-san?

94
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,279
We got separated in the teachers' office.

95
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,698
He'll be fine.

96
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,618
You got separated? Fuck.

97
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm sorry… for coming back alone.

98
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,097
Come here.

99
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,573
Were you bit? You were bit, right?

100
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,949
No, I--

101
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,135
Stop it.

102
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,596
Give me the phone.

103
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,264
You killed a person, you murderer.

104
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,974
You made me kill him.

105
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,603
-You said to prove I wasn't a loser.
-You crazy bastard.

106
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,131
Let go!

107
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,352
Do you want to live?

108
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,062
Do you?

109
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,692
Beg for your life.

110
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,776
Screw you.

111
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,779
Fuck!

112
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,823
Help me, fuck!

113
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,285
Cheong-san!

114
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,244
Fuck!

115
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,872
Please!

116
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,583
Cheong-san!

117
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,265
I'll kill you.

118
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,684
I will kill you.

119
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,269
I'll kill you.

120
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,438
I'll…

121
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,315
I'll kill you.

122
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,930
Shit.

123
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,058
There's not a single normal one.
They're all zombies.

124
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,100
Hey! In front of you!

125
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,728
Fuck. Shoot it already!

126
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,652
We're going to die
before we find your brother.

127
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
Let's go, Ha-ri.

128
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,631
Seriously--

129
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,741
Damn it.

130
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,373
I told you we should have stayed put.

131
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,417
It's crazy to think
we can find her brother.

132
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,502
And just as crazy to have followed her.

133
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,503
-I told you--
-Ha-ri!

134
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,005
-What?
-There's a computer.

135
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,381
Turn it on.

136
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,925
Post on Instagram or Facebook for help.

137
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,677
Shit.

138
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,492
Martial Law Command has acted swiftly

139
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,954
and thoroughly sealed off Hyosan

140
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:19,668
to prevent the situation
from spreading to other areas.

141
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,422
If you live outside
of the area under martial law,

142
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,008
please go on with your lives.

143
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,304
Martial Law Command is doing its best
to confirm and quarantine those infected

144
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,725
and to rescue and protect

145
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,353
those who are not infected.

146
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,354
EMERGENCY CALL

147
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,399
Every operation is being performed
in strict compliance with the laws

148
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,401
and principles in place.

149
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,903
EMERGENCY CALL
CONNECTING

150
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,324
Fake news about the Hyosan epidemic

151
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,494
is spreading uncontrollably.

152
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,956
Martial Law Command will block

153
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,710
all unconfirmed rumors,
and at the same time,

154
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,713
in the interest of improving
the efficiency of operations,

155
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
from this moment on,

156
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,010
all communication from Hyosan,
including all cell phone services,

157
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,515
landline services, and Internet services
in Hyosan will be terminated

158
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,808
from this moment on.

159
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,362
-The cable's connected. Why won't it work?
-I keep refreshing, but…

160
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,738
-Try the phone.
-Okay.

161
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,372
Fuck. Assholes.

162
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,750
They cut off our phones and Internet.

163
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,921
We at Martial Law Command
are doing our best

164
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,173
to suppress the spread.

165
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,344
Moreover, we are focusing
all of our resources

166
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,389
on rescuing the people who are trapped.

167
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,102
If you live in Hyosan
and are watching this now,

168
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:05,024
please have hope and wait to be rescued.

169
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,233
NO SIGNAL

170
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,277
OCTOBER 21, THURSDAY

171
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,209
WATER FLOW DETECTOR

172
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,260
What do we do?
On-jo and Cheong-san are really close.

173
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,720
They're going out.

174
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,972
On-jo says they're not.

175
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,475
I'm telling you they are.

176
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,811
They're always together.

177
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,189
Really?

178
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,358
NAM ON-JO

179
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,984
Poor On-jo.

180
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,043
I'm sure Cheong-san is fine.

181
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,338
You know how fast he is.

182
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,675
He never listens to me.

183
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,595
He's never done as I said
ever since we were kids.

184
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,518
I told him not to go, but he insisted.

185
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,895
I'm sorry.

186
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,607
I should've brought him back.

187
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,698
Where do you think…

188
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,244
he is?

189
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,790
I'm sure he's hiding somewhere safe.

190
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,639
Joon-yeong. Didn't you say
your science club made drones?

191
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,143
You want to look for Cheong-san
using a drone?

192
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,605
-Can't we?
-We can, but it's in the science lab.

193
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,898
We can go get it.

194
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,401
How can we get there?
It's full of zombies out there.

195
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,029
That.

196
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,326
You want me to climb up using that?

197
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,204
The science lab
is filled with zombies too.

198
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,165
There weren't any
in the supply room. Right?

199
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,791
That's true, but…

200
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,380
We have to find Cheong-san.

201
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,383
Right now, we only have

202
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,302
each other.

203
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,478
Yes. It would be good if we had a drone.

204
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,689
We can find Cheong-san
and see how things are outside.

205
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,735
We may even be able
to send a message asking for help.

206
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,030
That's all good, but

207
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,575
who will go?

208
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,868
I'll go.

209
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,497
I've had fire department training,
and I've climbed ropes before.

210
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,624
No, I'll go.

211
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,713
You went to the teachers' office already.
You can't keep putting yourself in danger.

212
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,134
The drone wasn't completed,
so we need a few more parts.

213
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,470
Do you know what to get?

214
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,810
I have to go anyway.

215
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,980
I'll go with On-jo.

216
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,064
No.

217
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,569
I'll really go this time.

218
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,113
You can't go.

219
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,365
Not with that body.

220
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,075
The rope will snap.

221
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,787
It was fine when I came down.
But it'll snap if I climb up, right?

222
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,623
-Right.
-It'll snap.

223
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,708
Right. Good boy.

224
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,169
Joon-yeong, let's go together.

225
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,967
It's too dangerous.

226
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,927
I'll go.

227
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,479
Thanks.

228
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,398
But I don't want you

229
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,359
to be in danger either.

230
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,530
I'm going.

231
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm going.

232
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,894
Be careful, On-jo.

233
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,315
Come back safely.
I'll be watching from here.

234
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,712
Do you think

235
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,840
everything's all right out there?

236
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm sure it is.

237
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,971
As you said,
the soldiers and the police are there.

238
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,978
I want to go to my dad's factory
and my mom's sundae restaurant.

239
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,273
Whatever.

240
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,734
You hate the smell of leather and sundae.

241
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,404
I just do.

242
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,115
I suddenly want my mom's sundae soup.

243
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,038
Did you finally grow up?
You should've been like that sooner.

244
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,376
It's too late.

245
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,135
Hey, look.

246
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,221
I bet there's a key in there, right?

247
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,933
I don't think so.

248
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,021
Wouldn't it be better to hide
somewhere safe and wait to be rescued?

249
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,275
Hey.
He said the solution is in his laptop.

250
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,236
We need to hurry and notify
Disaster and Safety Management.

251
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,906
The people with important information
need to survive.

252
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,700
So doesn't our survival come first?

253
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,120
Why do you keep acting
like a leader of society?

254
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,872
Did you go to Seoul University
or something?

255
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,500
-Yes.
-What? Why?

256
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,210
You really went there?

257
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,671
No, I haven't graduated yet.
I have to go back.

258
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,465
I see. Grad school?

259
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,467
-No. I'm a sophomore.
-What?

260
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,511
Did you retake your exams?
Four times? Five?

261
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,472
I see. Six times.

262
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,682
I went straight after high school.

263
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,604
My goodness. You must've studied hard.

264
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,481
Your face says it all.

265
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,152
Hey. You're smart,
so I'll only say this once.

266
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,237
Be quiet and follow me.

267
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,864
Wait.

268
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,699
Damn it!

269
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,792
Shut the door!

270
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,503
Damn it.

271
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,632
Why won't it start?

272
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,302
Hurry!

273
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,553
Please help me!

274
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,931
-This way!
-Stay away!

275
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,265
Get him off me!

276
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,268
-Come here!
-Yes, sir.

277
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,353
Hurry!

278
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,148
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW BUSINESS

279
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,360
Shit! Oh my God!

280
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,071
It's a zombie, sir.

281
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,697
There's a zombie inside.

282
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,665
-There's one inside?
-Yes.

283
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:43,917
Damn it.

284
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:55,136
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

285
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,221
It's okay. Come in.

286
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,099
Damn it.

287
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,684
Really?

288
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,353
It's okay. She's tied up.

289
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,650
A student should be in school.
Why is she in a chicken place…

290
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,985
Why is she tied--

291
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,027
Oh my God!

292
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,488
What? What is it this time?

293
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,115
Look. Over there.

294
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,369
What? What is that?

295
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,457
Shit.

296
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,172
Is it okay?

297
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,383
Is the baby a zombie?

298
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,471
No. It's alive.

299
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,120
Check the fridge
for some milk or something.

300
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,747
Why? Are you thirsty?

301
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,541
For the baby.

302
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,504
We need to feed the baby.
It looks exhausted.

303
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,924
What if there's no milk?

304
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,802
Just check the fridge first.

305
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,513
We can think about what to do
if there isn't any.

306
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,432
Oh. You're right.

307
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,270
-If there's no milk, what should I bring?
-Just check first.

308
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,648
Before I beat you up.

309
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,947
What do we do now?

310
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,371
What else? We have to go to headquarters.

311
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,457
What about the baby?

312
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,460
It's hard enough with just us.

313
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,920
Are you going to take it?

314
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,896
Careful.

315
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,857
-The drone and the bag are there.
-Okay.

316
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,864
Hang on. Where was it?

317
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,409
Where is the battery?

318
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,011
Have you thought about that?

319
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,930
About what?

320
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,188
What if everyone turned
and we're the only humans left?

321
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,150
No way.

322
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,694
What if that were true?

323
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,155
Come on.

324
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,616
That means we're the minority.

325
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,579
Minorities always go extinct.

326
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,792
I'm sure we're not.

327
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,920
But what if we are?

328
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,466
Can you endure this?

329
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,054
I don't know.

330
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,017
But I don't want to become a zombie.

331
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,436
They don't recognize anyone.

332
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:32,979
Then…

333
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,317
I won't recognize you either.

334
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,162
I have a favor if I do get bit.

335
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,831
No.

336
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,209
Don't get bit.

337
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,337
-If by chance--
-No.

338
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,714
Don't get bit. You can't.

339
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,967
Don't even think about it.

340
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,305
THIS DOOR DOES NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE

341
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,098
Damn it.

342
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,660
-Eat up, I-sak.
-Thank you.

343
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,538
On-jo. Which do you like better?

344
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,125
-They both taste good.
-They do?

345
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,969
Is this better

346
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,430
or is this better?

347
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,732
Why?

348
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,883
Fuck this.

349
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
MUSIC ROOM

350
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,913
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

351
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,087
Be careful, On-jo.

352
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,880
Take your time.

353
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,925
Hurry up. Hurry.

354
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,314
HELP, WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM
IN HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

355
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,907
Does it work?

356
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,450
Is it working?

357
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,743
I think it will.

358
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,595
You scared me! That's mad fast.

359
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,473
I'll take it outside
after I find Cheong-san.

360
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,892
If I find rescuers outside,
I'll land it in front of them.

361
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,564
Wait.

362
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,401
They say when people confirm
their situation is hopeless,

363
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,446
they truly fall into despair.

364
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,076
That's a cool saying.

365
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,162
But what does that mean?

366
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,627
Even if the entire world
has turned into zombies,

367
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,380
let's not despair.

368
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,924
I see. So that's what it means?

369
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,470
Prez.

370
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,556
It's best to have a plan
and act accordingly,

371
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,018
but we're not top students
or as smart as you.

372
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,521
Being logical
isn't necessarily being human.

373
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,940
We should be logical in crisis situations.

374
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,609
Right now,

375
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,029
we need hope more than logic.

376
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,201
Hey. I think

377
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,953
flying that is
what we need most right now.

378
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,458
-Try it.
-Here I go.

379
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,501
Okay.

380
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,776
Oh no.

381
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,112
Everyone's turned.

382
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,705
I wouldn't have studied
if I knew this was going to happen.

383
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,374
I can't take the CSAT anyway.

384
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,418
Fuck. I'm never studying again.

385
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,421
Can you please be serious
in serious situations?

386
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,298
I'm very serious right now.

387
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,469
What will you do?
Will you keep looking for your brother?

388
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,807
The archery training center
has an emergency phone.

389
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,976
It connects to 911 automatically.

390
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,269
-Really?
-Yes.

391
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,729
We got it installed
in case there were accidents.

392
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,858
What if it doesn't connect?
The phone and Internet are dead.

393
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,067
It doesn't matter.

394
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,696
That's where all the arrows are anyway.

395
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,741
I have less than 20 left. We need more
if we want to leave the school.

396
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,119
-I think--
-Okay, let's go.

397
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,997
Let's go to your training center
and get your arrows.

398
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,250
Then let's go home or to a supermarket.

399
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,003
You know, in zombie movies,

400
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,505
the ones that go to supermarkets
always live the best.

401
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,133
They have cigarettes too.

402
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,259
I think--

403
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,261
The dumpsters are below these windows.

404
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,639
I think we should jump down
rather than use the stairs.

405
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,475
Okay. Let's jump.

406
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,897
Falling from the third floor won't hurt
as much as failing to get into college.

407
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,940
Let me get a word in!

408
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,319
Min-jae. Go down first
and shoot any that come running.

409
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,528
Okay.

410
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,739
Then you two go down and help him.

411
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,991
I'll cover you in the hallway and go last.

412
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,079
-What did you want to say?
-Let's just stay here.

413
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,041
The adults will come to rescue us.

414
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,293
You can stay if you want.

415
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,463
But I don't trust adults.

416
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,137
Damn. That bitch is so my type.

417
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,972
I'm too scared to be alone.

418
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,225
Hurry up.

419
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,839
Look out! Behind you!

420
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,967
Move.

421
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,725
Damn.

422
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,185
Why is this so high? Fuck!

423
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,980
Jump already.

424
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,481
Damn. Okay, I'm going.

425
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,070
Whoa. Fuck!

426
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,339
There's no one in the infirmary.

427
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,383
Joon-yeong, go somewhere else.

428
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,139
Wait. Hold on.

429
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,266
Isn't that an arrow?

430
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,767
-Where?
-This.

431
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,186
You're right. It is an arrow.

432
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,646
Why?

433
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,566
My sister.

434
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,153
She had a competition today.

435
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,257
Where the hell is Cheong-san?

436
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,713
It's Cheong-san!

437
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,216
-What room is that?
-Cheong-san!

438
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,342
He can't hear you.

439
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,885
Be quiet.

440
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,679
-Hey, Cheong-san!
-I said he can't hear you.

441
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,972
On-jo, it's all right now.

442
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,308
Cheong-san's alive!

443
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,226
He's alive!

444
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,864
What's he doing? Where's he going?

445
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,866
Look this way! Over here!

446
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,952
Where are you going, moron?

447
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,161
He can't hear you!

448
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,206
Be quiet, will you? You're so damn loud.
You could get us killed.

449
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,457
My bad.

450
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,586
Didn't you say the battery was low?

451
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,172
Yes. I couldn't fully charge it,
so there isn't much juice left.

452
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,717
Since we confirmed where Cheong-san is,
let's look elsewhere.

453
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,345
We wanted to check outside
and ask for help too.

454
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,974
On-jo, is that okay?

455
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,477
Yes, since we saw that he's alive.

456
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:39,937
Here we go.

457
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,697
Damn.

458
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,574
Fuck. It's Zombieland out there.

459
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,536
I think we should look
outside of the school.

460
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,122
Let's go outside.

461
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,665
Okay.

462
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,263
Wait.

463
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,182
What is it?

464
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,433
Wait.

465
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,602
Wait.

466
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,240
What's wrong, Ji-min?

467
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,325
Wait.

468
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,912
I can't…

469
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,334
What is it?

470
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,589
This…

471
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,344
this is my dad's car.

472
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,014
Which one?

473
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,100
The white one? The black one?

474
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,061
This truck.

475
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,605
It's my dad's.

476
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,027
Don't worry.

477
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm sure there are lots of cars like that.

478
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,492
Let me check.

479
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,524
Ji-min.

480
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,558
11:47 AM
ABANDONED PRISON IN THE SUBURB OF HYOSAN

481
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:06,185
This announcement is for the citizens
of Hyosan who are in quarantine.

482
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:10,814
Please abide by the quarantine rules
and keep order…

483
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,359
-Don't you see us in line?
-…under the control of the military.

484
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,276
What about us?

485
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,697
Please cooperate with the tests
to determine if you are infected…

486
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,407
Who are they to get special treatment?

487
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,786
…and follow the rules
of living in this facility.

488
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,121
I repeat.

489
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:32,002
Please abide by the quarantine rules

490
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,506
and keep order
under the control of the military.

491
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:40,177
Please cooperate with the tests
to determine if you are infected

492
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,098
and follow the rules
of living in this facility.

493
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,433
EXAMINATION ROOM

494
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,602
Thank you for your service.

495
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,562
Where's the control room?

496
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,193
As per martial law,

497
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,987
you will be quarantined
until you are examined.

498
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,741
Why must she quarantine?
She just returned from a battlefield.

499
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,702
It's okay. That's enough.

500
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,538
Where is the control room?

501
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,665
You will be examined first.

502
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,917
I'm not refusing to be examined.

503
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,919
Please follow the rules.

504
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,005
I'm Capt. Nam So-ju
of Rescue Team One at Hyosan Fire Station.

505
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,633
I was responsible for their rescue--

506
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,718
Hey!

507
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,679
Does it sound like I'm asking?

508
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,765
-Take them to the examination room.
-Yes, sir.

509
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,489
What is this place?

510
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,492
This isn't an examination room.

511
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,620
There are too many awaiting examination,
so you must wait.

512
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,332
Then you should've explained
the situation and asked her to wait

513
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,710
and then escorted her.
What is wrong with you?

514
00:45:55,461 --> 00:46:00,090
Others are sitting on mats
on a concrete floor.

515
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,344
We're offering the best we can
since you are an assembly member.

516
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,224
The wait time
for an examination is 12 to 72 hours.

517
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,851
Wait.

518
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,979
My daughter is at her school.

519
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,523
It may be too late if we delay any longer.

520
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,234
Please rescue them.

521
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,196
We're doing the best we can.

522
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,323
Wait here.

523
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,923
Fuck.

524
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,634
Did I die?

525
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,805
Am I fucking dead?

526
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,869
Hey.

527
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,462
Aren't you going to eat me,
you zombie bastards?

528
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,012
I gave them serotonin injections
for a week, but it had no effect.

529
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,849
The Jonas Virus evolves
as soon as it detects antibodies

530
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,810
so the antibodies lose their target.

531
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,272
The only explanation is
that the virus learns and evolves.

532
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,068
If this virus

533
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,947
manages to learn the human mind…

534
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,794
a new breed of human may be born.

535
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,097
Cheong-san, you son of a bitch.

536
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,600
I'll kill you.

537
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,316
What the hell?

538
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,739
This means…

539
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,495
ONE HEART

540
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,788
…I'm in heaven.

541
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,506
Hey, Cheong-san!

542
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,163
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

543
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,998
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

544
