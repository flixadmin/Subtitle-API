1
00:00:00,915 --> 00:00:02,482
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:04,762
Killing Falcone would only create chaos.

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:07,896
<i>I need to siphon his strength.
So, when the time is right,</i>

4
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,743
<i>taking over his organization
would be like slipping on a glove.</i>

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,919
I'm so angry all the time.
Will that ever go away?

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,099
Alfred, can you teach me how to fight?

7
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,061
You've been through a lot.

8
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:21,529
I'm scared, Jim.

9
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:22,664
Everywhere I go,

10
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:24,866
<i>I can feel that monster, Zsasz.</i>

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,335
<i>ALVAREZ: Gordon, some
unis brought in a perp.</i>

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,837
<i>Claims to know you.</i>

13
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,105
Hey, Detective.

14
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,041
Miss me?

15
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,714
Barbara?

16
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:43,618
Whoa.

17
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,420
Sweet crib.

18
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:48,823
You must be one rich cop.

19
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,692
It's my girlfriend's place.

20
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:51,960
Where is she?

21
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:54,062
I don't know. Barbara?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,701
So... what?

23
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,002
I get to stay here alone?

24
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,807
I'm hungry.

25
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:07,742
<i>BARBARA: Dear Jim,</i>

26
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,512
<i>I thought I could be strong
and brave for you, but I can't.</i>

27
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:14,316
<i>Every place I go, I see Falcone and Zsasz.</i>

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,651
<i>I'm nervous and needy and screwed up,</i>

29
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,720
<i>and I know that's not
what you need or want,</i>

30
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,989
<i>so I'm going away for a
while, to get myself together.</i>

31
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:23,058
(cell phone ringing)

32
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,730
This is Gordon.

33
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,566
Uh... uh, right. Yeah.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,902
We're in the penthouse. Come on up.

35
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,877
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,779
Why's she worried about Falcone?

37
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,348
None of your business.

38
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:48,049
So what happens now?

39
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,851
You gonna get the charges
against me dropped?

40
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,854
I will, but you're my only
witness to the Wayne murders.

41
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,023
You gonna cuff me to a drainpipe again?

42
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:56,925
No, I'm not gonna hold
you against your will.

43
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,727
GCPD, juvie... you'd just break out.

44
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,695
So I do get to stay here.

45
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,631
No, I have someplace else in mind.

46
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,299
(knocking on door)

47
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,368
That's the sketch artist.

48
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:08,403
I need you to describe the
man who shot the Waynes.

49
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:11,673
Wait, where am I going to stay?

50
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,108
Wayne Manor.

51
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:23,718
Do not speak to the inmate.

52
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:26,321
Do not touch the inmate unless
in the service of your job.

53
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,990
Do not accept anything from the
inmate under any circumstances.

54
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,792
Who is this guy, anyway?

55
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,094
<i>Name's Ian Hargrove,
some genius bomb maker.</i>

56
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,563
<i>Took out over a dozen
buildings in and around Gotham.</i>

57
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,599
<i>He's the one that blew up
the commissary last month?</i>

58
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,367
Yeah, and he did it with match shavings

59
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:40,535
and apple cider vinegar.

60
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,404
So no mistakes today, got it?

61
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,056
Put your hands up.

62
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,432
(latch slides, clicks)

63
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,941
She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

64
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,110
She said she saw his face.

65
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:24,579
Do you recognize him, Bruce?

66
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,982
No.

67
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:32,153
- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.

68
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,056
- Do you believe her?
- Yes, I do.

69
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,392
So, she saw...

70
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,027
everything?

71
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,733
And you want her to live
here with us now?

72
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,201
A common street criminal.

73
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:47,502
She's hardly older than Bruce.

74
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,372
She's just a kid who's seen too much.

75
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,040
This is for her safety.

76
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,842
GCPD is full of moles...

77
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:56,244
Right, and how long would
you have us put her up, then?

78
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,646
I don't know.

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,814
No. The answer is no.

80
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,150
Her being here will put
Master Bruce in great danger.

81
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,852
Alfred.

82
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:06,755
She is the witness to
a murder, Master Bruce.

83
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,989
You do understand that, don't you?

84
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,557
She's also the best chance we have

85
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:10,792
of finding who killed my parents.

86
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:13,261
Isn't she?

87
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,195
Yes, she is.

88
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:16,865
Then she can stay.

89
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,168
As long as it takes.

90
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,074
I've made my decision.

91
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,477
Yes, Master Bruce.

92
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:35,283
Look, I know this is a lot.

93
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,285
But I'm doing everything I can.

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,953
Montoya and Allen and I are meeting

95
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,922
with an ADA they trust this afternoon.

96
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,891
Oh...

97
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,726
a trustworthy lawyer.

98
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,728
In Gotham.

99
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:49,731
Look, if we find this guy, we'll need her.

100
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:53,335
She'll have to testify. Go
before a judge. It won't be easy.

101
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,304
Witnesses back out all the time.

102
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,906
The ones that stick it out do so

103
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,374
because they care about the victims.

104
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:03,044
We'll do our best to be
nice to her, then, won't we?

105
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,691
It's from the Chinese Ming dynasty.

106
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,895
Five...

107
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,867
500 years old.

108
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,337
You can get one just like it
for five bucks, in Chinatown.

109
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:40,915
I'm Bruce Wayne.

110
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,787
Selina Kyle.

111
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,791
People call me Cat.

112
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:51,993
Nice to meet you, Cat.

113
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,639
What are you doing?

114
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,574
Nothing.

115
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,576
What's in your hand?

116
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,612
I said, what's in...

117
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:22,924
What the hell...?

118
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,127
(tires screeching, horn honking)

119
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:51,419
Hargrove!

120
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:56,424
Ian Hargrove, time to go.

121
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,342
<i>MAN: Kid, you screwed up, big-time.</i>

122
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:11,212
But you're still young,
you deserve a second chance.

123
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:12,580
So I have a bet for you.

124
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,983
You call heads or tails.

125
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,152
You lose, you go to jail.

126
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:20,621
You win, we let you go.

127
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,256
- Bet.
- Hold on.

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,991
There's a catch.

129
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,161
You have to make a
promise to God right now.

130
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,864
If you win, you're gonna
take this as a sign from him

131
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:31,866
telling you that you
need to go back to school

132
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,934
and get your life straight.

133
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,268
Can you promise that?

134
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:35,803
Do you promise that?

135
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,538
Yes, sir.

136
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,044
Okay then.

137
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,115
- Call.
- Heads.

138
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:50,120
Walk away, kid.

139
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,290
Somebody up there loves you.

140
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:55,125
Hey, Harvey.

141
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:58,829
Go.

142
00:07:58,863 --> 00:07:59,830
Remember your promise.

143
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,866
Jim Gordon, GCPD.

144
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,534
I hear good things about you, Counselor.

145
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,803
Harvey Dent, likewise about you, Detective.

146
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,705
That was some trick with the coin.

147
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,575
What if the kid guesses wrong?
You gonna send him to jail?

148
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,410
Teenagers, they nearly always call heads.

149
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,544
I don't know why.

150
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,615
Two-headed coin.

151
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,417
Whatever works, right?

152
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,319
<i>DENT: So who is he, Jim?</i>

153
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,354
Who really killed the Waynes?

154
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,457
This is what we have.

155
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:29,026
No I.D.

156
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,594
But this is from an eyewitness?

157
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:31,995
That you have in safe custody.

158
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,565
It's not nearly enough
to go to the law with.

159
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,967
Even if we had I.D. on this guy,

160
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,568
it's the people who
hired him we really want.

161
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:39,903
I agree.

162
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,372
Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom.

163
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:44,207
But the idea of your witness

164
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:46,076
could be immensely valuable.

165
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:50,857
Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft?

166
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:52,726
Sure. Billionaire.

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,594
Property, construction, chemicals.

168
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:55,795
And as corrupt as they come.

169
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,100
Falcone, Maroni, even Wayne Enterprises,

170
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,302
Lovecraft has dealings with all of them.

171
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,037
Since the Waynes' deaths,
he's doubled his fortune.

172
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,939
Including a huge piece of the Arkham deal.

173
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,108
DENT: Lovecraft had a
long feud with Thomas Wayne

174
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:09,943
over deals and politics.

175
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:11,978
They couldn't have had a more
different vision for Gotham.

176
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,847
I'm willing to bet my career...

177
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,315
on his involvement in the Wayne murders.

178
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:16,449
That's a big bet.

179
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,219
I want to use your witness
to go after Lovecraft.

180
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:22,255
How? My witness can't
connect Lovecraft to the perp.

181
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,358
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

182
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:27,127
I'll let it leak out

183
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,895
that we have a secret eyewitness

184
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,031
who's going to blow the case wide open

185
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:32,899
and connect Lovecraft
to the Wayne killings.

186
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,567
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

187
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:36,803
And the people around him will get nervous.

188
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,205
And that's when people start
talking; you know how that goes.

189
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,374
Unless Lovecraft wasn't
involved in the Wayne murders.

190
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,009
If so, which I doubt, we still win.

191
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:44,544
Whoever was involved in the Wayne killings

192
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,313
will get their cage rattled

193
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:48,348
like the dickens, won't
they? I bet he makes a move.

194
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,250
You like to bet a lot.

195
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,519
Well, what do we got to lose?

196
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:54,054
My witness becomes a target.

197
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:57,190
No. That's the beauty of it.
We never actually file papers.

198
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:59,359
We never name names.

199
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:01,494
It's just a powerful story.

200
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:02,962
Your witness is perfectly safe.

201
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,331
And you're on board with this?

202
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:07,100
We've been on board,
Jim. Harvey's one of us.

203
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,069
I want what you want, Jim.

204
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,539
I want to make this city a better place.

205
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:18,178
No names.

206
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:21,348
Not mine, not my witness,
nothing... just a story.

207
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:24,117
Just a story.

208
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,319
All right.

209
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:27,554
Let's try something.

210
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,028
Hey, I thought I was gonna have
to work this case without you.

211
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,229
Where the hell have you been?

212
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,630
You know what?

213
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:39,299
On second thought, never
mind, I don't want to know.

214
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,335
- What do we got?
- A biggie.

215
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,237
Blackgate prisoner escaped
while in transit to St. Mark's

216
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,538
for psychiatric care.

217
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:48,174
His name's Ian Hargrove, clinically insane,

218
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,343
with a compulsion for blowing things up.

219
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:53,213
He exploded a bunch of old
buildings around Gotham.

220
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:55,415
Last one, two janitors were killed.

221
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,117
Says here he was busted out by four gunmen?

222
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,153
Yeah, which is odd... Hargrove
never used accomplices.

223
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:02,922
All right, so who did Hargrove
spend time with at Blackgate?

224
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,991
Who did he communicate with on the outside?

225
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,328
His entire stretch, he
was isolated from gen pop.

226
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,096
Never made or received phone calls.

227
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,898
Only one visitor in those two years...

228
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:12,899
his brother John.

229
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,568
- Got an address?
- We do.

230
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,504
Unis are bringing him in
right now for questioning.

231
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:20,006
We're lucky you deigned to show up.

232
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,408
Yeah, sorry.

233
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,910
No problem.

234
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:26,579
Girl trouble?

235
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,214
Yeah.

236
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:29,849
I told you.

237
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:33,019
Those high society dames...
get you all twisted.

238
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,258
Keep your guard up. Knock lumps out of ya.

239
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,559
Watch your feet.

240
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:41,027
Right... jab, jab, right.

241
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,262
(grunting)

242
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,263
Lead with the... Hey!

243
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,497
Jab, jab, right. Jab, jab, right.

244
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,799
- (grunting)
- Jab, jab, right.

245
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,133
Keep that guard up... jab, jab, right.

246
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,602
Lead... jab, jab, right.

247
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:50,737
Jab, jab, right.

248
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:52,472
Now keep that...

249
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,808
- (grunts fiercely)
- Yes.

250
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:55,809
(laughing) Oi!

251
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,043
Sorry, Alfred.

252
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,144
- Hello.
- Bruce.

253
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:02,248
That hurt.

254
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,450
Yeah, it's supposed to, isn't it?

255
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,118
Taking a punch is

256
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,253
just as important as
throwing one, Master Bruce.

257
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,855
What you doing?

258
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,523
Alfred's teaching me to fight.

259
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:11,725
Why?

260
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,194
So I'll be prepared if
something bad happens.

261
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:18,832
Yeah, 'cause you live in a
pretty rough neighborhood.

262
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,433
Not here, in Gotham.

263
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:23,103
In Gotham, people don't
fight with gloves on.

264
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:28,174
How's your room? Everything good?

265
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,344
It'll do.

266
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,912
I'm hungry, though.

267
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:34,114
Right.

268
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,783
Well, breakfast was served at 8:00, Miss,

269
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,052
which you slept through.

270
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:40,220
Lunch shall be served at 12:00.

271
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:41,588
There's plenty to eat in the kitchen.

272
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:42,989
And Alfred will be happy
to fix you something.

273
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,190
No, he won't be, will he?

274
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:45,558
Because it's not a bloody hotel.

275
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:49,296
Relax, old man.

276
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,797
I'll figure it out.

277
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,165
Yeah, you can mind your manners as well,

278
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,833
you cheeky little minx.

279
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:56,136
Be nice to her, Alfred, she's our guest.

280
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,105
Well, I'm terribly sorry, Master Bruce.

281
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,940
Didn't realize you fancied her.

282
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,877
What do you mean? N-No.

283
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,278
Well, it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

284
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:06,880
It's only natural, isn't it?

285
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:08,448
But you watch her.

286
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:11,651
She's a lairy one.

287
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,586
Right... left, left, right.

288
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:17,057
- (grunts)
- Keep your guard up, son.

289
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,059
You know about girls, do you, Alfred?

290
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,860
Fair sight more than you.

291
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:23,129
And she, mate,

292
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,831
is trouble... watch.

293
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:26,666
Oi! Oi, oi!

294
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:51,057
Liza, Liza...

295
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,093
what are you up to?

296
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,593
(inhales deeply)

297
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,003
(inhaling)

298
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:44,344
(quiet laugh)

299
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,246
Lilacs.

300
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:31,057
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about his escape.

301
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,092
I haven't talked to him.

302
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,126
Your own baby brother

303
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,228
busts out of prison, and doesn't call you,

304
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,030
the only person he's
talked to in two years?

305
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,698
What happened?

306
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,866
You two have a falling out?

307
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,602
No, Ian and I are close. Always have been.

308
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,638
Even after he bombed those janitors?

309
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:45,905
That was an accident.

310
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,241
<i>BULLOCK: That's what they all say.</i>

311
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:49,542
<i>JOHN HARGROVE: It's the truth.</i>

312
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,778
(timer dings)

313
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:54,614
My brother's not a killer. He never was.

314
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,317
He blew up 12 buildings in Gotham.

315
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:00,320
Yes, munitions factories and their offices.

316
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,889
<i>Places that made guns
and bullets and missiles.</i>

317
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,158
<i>I know he was wrong,</i>

318
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:07,994
<i>but Ian thought that what
he was doing was good.</i>

319
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:12,899
<i>He didn't hurt a soul
until the last bombing.</i>

320
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,801
And he felt terrible about it.

321
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:18,405
He practically handed himself in
to the cops and pleaded guilty.

322
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,476
Ian has had mental problems
ever since he was a kid.

323
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,544
<i>My parents didn't have the money</i>

324
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:26,279
<i>to get him the help he needed.</i>

325
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:28,515
And he sure as hell wasn't
getting it at Blackgate.

326
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,852
<i>Look...</i>

327
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,388
my brother's not a bad man.

328
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:37,857
Then what is he?

329
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,795
He's sick.

330
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:43,830
<i>There's a difference.</i>

331
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,869
<i>GORDON: Okay...</i>

332
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:52,305
<i>so who would want to bust him out?</i>

333
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,673
I don't know.

334
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,408
But my brother needs help.

335
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:57,243
You have to find him.

336
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,381
(door opens)

337
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:05,218
It's done.

338
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:37,217
I have a delivery for you.

339
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,221
I'll take that.

340
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,195
Oh.

341
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,197
Who sent this, anyway?

342
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:51,932
Who cares?

343
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,199
Hmm.

344
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,135
(timer ticking)

345
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,137
Wait a second.

346
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:58,471
You hear that?

347
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,507
Sounds like ticking.

348
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,877
(timer dings)

349
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,912
(explosion booming, men screaming)

350
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,160
_

351
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,011
- Good morning.
- Uh-huh.

352
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,005
- How'd you sleep?
- Your house makes noise.

353
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,407
It's old.

354
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:33,410
You didn't come here with much.

355
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:35,126
If you want, Alfred can
buy you some clothes.

356
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:36,541
Pass.

357
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,351
Detective Gordon told me
you live on the streets.

358
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:46,620
Yeah.

359
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:47,955
So?

360
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,589
What's it like?

361
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:52,025
Not as nice as here.

362
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,794
Do you live alone?

363
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,797
Are you going to ask me
questions all morning?

364
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,801
Aren't you supposed to
be in school or something?

365
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,803
I'm developing my own curriculum.

366
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:05,839
It lets me move at my own speed

367
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,641
and focus on academic
areas that interest me.

368
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:09,643
Why?

369
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:11,111
You're a billionaire, what's to learn?

370
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,512
That's a strange attitude.

371
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:19,920
So, where are your parents?

372
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,924
They alive?

373
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,926
Um...

374
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,894
Sure.

375
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,496
They're around.

376
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,531
Where?

377
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,033
What's that to you?

378
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,067
Nothing, I just thought...

379
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,869
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

380
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:39,172
I'm not an orphan.

381
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,208
I got family all over.

382
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:53,453
This was bad enough when
it was just a prison escape.

383
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:55,122
Now we've got five dead security guards,

384
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:58,025
and the press is calling
Hargrove an urban terrorist.

385
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,027
Did you get anything from the bombing site?

386
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,595
BULLOCK: Forensics is
still looking into it,

387
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:03,664
but the entire office was destroyed.

388
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,565
GORDON: Including all security footage.

389
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,867
Yeah.

390
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,969
We do know that Hargrove
and his guys made off

391
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:11,004
with a compound called HMX.

392
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,472
GORDON: It's military grade.

393
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,174
Ten times more powerful than C-4.

394
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,475
Nasty stuff.

395
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,178
Using explosives to steal explosives.

396
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,346
What's that about?

397
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,281
Trading up?

398
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:22,549
He must have another target in mind.

399
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,584
Some place difficult to crack.

400
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:24,918
You know what I'm gonna say.

401
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,054
So, go, do it.

402
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,089
(cell phone ringing)

403
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,827
This is Gordon.

404
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,128
ALFRED: Yes, Detective.

405
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,130
It's Alfred.

406
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:38,832
Alfred, is everything all right?

407
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,067
Is Selina okay?

408
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,468
Well, she's safe.

409
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:43,470
But?

410
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:46,807
But I'm afraid, Detective,
this isn't gonna work out.

411
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:49,743
She's a... a tough nut, this one.

412
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:51,445
Well, look, we need her help

413
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,447
if we have any chance of
catching the Waynes' killer.

414
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:56,149
Just hold onto her for now,
and I'll be out to check on her

415
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,684
as soon as I can.

416
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,754
We shall patiently await your arrival,

417
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,189
Detective.

418
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:07,661
Everything good?

419
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,664
Right as rain.

420
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:12,766
You sure you want to go through with this?

421
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,836
Butch, don't you go
getting scared on me now.

422
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,437
Never, boss.

423
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:18,705
(door opens)

424
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:24,611
Oswald, you're back.

425
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:26,446
(chuckling)

426
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:29,049
I'm starting to think you enjoy being hurt.

427
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,617
(chuckles)

428
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:33,187
I was passing by. Thought I'd say hello.

429
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:35,722
Well, you said it.

430
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,124
Now why are you here?

431
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:41,161
Honestly, I'm just trying to be friendly.

432
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:44,998
(inhales deeply)

433
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,735
(sighs with satisfaction)

434
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,070
Lilacs.

435
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:51,905
Mmm.

436
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,875
- You smell good.
- You don't.

437
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:59,079
(laughing)

438
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:00,814
Snappy as ever.

439
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:03,350
Oh! (chuckles)

440
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,786
Well, good-bye then.

441
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,788
Sorry you're still grumpy with me.

442
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:10,724
But, you know,

443
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,977
reaching out in friendship is never wrong.

444
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:22,436
Man, that dude's creepy.

445
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,406
Forget him.

446
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,442
He's nothing.

447
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,145
Hargrove's contacts and phone records

448
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,380
from before he went to Blackgate.

449
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:34,915
Uh-huh. Yeah.

450
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:38,352
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

451
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,925
Barbara left.

452
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,060
<i>Left left?</i>

453
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,195
Yeah.

454
00:22:48,229 --> 00:22:50,998
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

455
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:53,867
It's a ploy.

456
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:56,670
She wants you to set a date.

457
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:57,704
It's a standard move.

458
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,772
She'll be back.

459
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,073
Do you play video games?

460
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:03,710
<i>Ed, don't ever do that again.</i>

461
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,112
My apologies, Detective.

462
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:06,880
Do either of you play video games?

463
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:07,948
I do, I...

464
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:09,683
(giggles) I love video games.

465
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:12,820
I find that each one presents
a new challenge, a puzzle.

466
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:14,855
It's a lot like detective work in that way.

467
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:15,822
Ed.

468
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:17,124
Oh, sorry.

469
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:19,026
Uh, I had a chance to analyze the shrapnel

470
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,093
from the security office.

471
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,229
And I found something. It's a nameplate.

472
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,031
It was damaged in the bombing,

473
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:25,732
but you can still read the information.

474
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,367
It's from an abandoned metal factory

475
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:30,103
here in Gotham.

476
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:33,040
That's really good work, Ed.

477
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,041
Thanks.

478
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:35,542
<i>Thank you, Detective.</i>

479
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:37,744
Let's go check this out.

480
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:06,273
GCPD!

481
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:07,808
Freeze!

482
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:09,910
Don't shoot!

483
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:11,912
You found the nameplate, thank God.

484
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:13,947
BULLOCK: Is anyone else here?

485
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:16,049
No, but they'll be back soon.
Please, you got to help me.

486
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:18,318
They broke me out of prison,
they kidnapped me, they told me

487
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:21,054
they'd kill my brother and his
family if I didn't help them.

488
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:23,123
- Who's "they"?
- Russians.

489
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:24,892
One of their names is-is Kasyanov.

490
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:26,393
They're planning something against Falcone.

491
00:24:26,427 --> 00:24:27,961
- Falcone?
- Yeah.

492
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:29,930
It's a, it's a big job, a vault.

493
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:31,832
That's why they needed
me to build explosives.

494
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:33,066
(men shouting)

495
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:34,167
Behind you!

496
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:35,369
Get down, get down!

497
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:50,884
(man shouting)

498
00:24:55,423 --> 00:24:56,690
- (men shouting)
- Help me!

499
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:02,362
(men shouting)

500
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,059
BRUCE: If you want to go somewhere,

501
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:28,527
we can call you a taxi.

502
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,565
You move quiet.

503
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,433
So do you.

504
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:39,572
Are you leaving?

505
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:42,608
Thinking about it.

506
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:46,145
I'm sorry if talking about
your family upset you.

507
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,580
I wasn't upset.

508
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,648
You seemed kind of upset.

509
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,196
That's your mom, huh?

510
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,733
She looks nice.

511
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,468
She was.

512
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,472
You saw her...

513
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:16,175
the night she was killed?

514
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,645
Uh-huh.

515
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,414
And you saw me?

516
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,420
What I did? What I didn't do?

517
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:30,356
What are you talking about?
What could you have done?

518
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,724
I don't know... something.

519
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:35,327
You're dreaming, kid.

520
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,663
A gun's a gun.

521
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,703
My mom's in show business.

522
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:47,406
Oh?

523
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,809
Yeah.

524
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:52,845
She sings and dances and does magic tricks.

525
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,882
Gets paid, like, millions.

526
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,884
But that's just a cover.

527
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,986
Really, she's a secret
agent for the government.

528
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,456
Wow.

529
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,725
Yeah.

530
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,728
She's on a secret mission.

531
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:12,932
But when she's done, she's
coming back to get me.

532
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,469
That's good.

533
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,240
Yeah.

534
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:23,976
Did you ever kiss a girl?

535
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,445
No.

536
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,247
Do you want to?

537
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:30,015
Why-why do you ask?

538
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,585
Just curious.

539
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,028
Time for your studies, Master Bruce.

540
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:44,296
Thank you, Alfred.

541
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,999
You're more than welcome
to join, Miss Kyle.

542
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,369
Right.

543
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,772
I'll see you later.

544
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:55,041
Do you have any idea how
many angry phone calls

545
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:56,575
we've been getting this week?

546
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,977
Got a terrorist out there.

547
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:58,978
And that's our fault?

548
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,746
Jim!

549
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:04,417
No, no, please.

550
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:08,387
You tell me, Detective...
how is this my fault?

551
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:09,955
Well, for starters,

552
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,857
you have the mentally
ill housed at Blackgate,

553
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:13,859
a prison with no facilities for them.

554
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,361
So, you send them out for treatment,

555
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:16,696
which was exactly where

556
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,548
Hargrove was headed when he was broken out.

557
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,501
I want him found.

558
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:23,602
Yes, sir.

559
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,805
- Today.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,008
What is wrong with you?

561
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,479
By the way, Hargrove's brother John,

562
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:36,082
I went ahead and put him and
his family in protective custody.

563
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,650
That'll help.

564
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:38,884
Yeah, only problem is...

565
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,786
Hargrove doesn't know that.

566
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:44,423
All right, Dent.

567
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,326
You dragged me down here, now what?

568
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,300
I got the last piece
of the puzzle in place.

569
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:55,668
I'm bringing charges against you.

570
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,937
Oh, that old song again?

571
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:00,573
You will never prove fraud.

572
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:03,142
You know that, and I know that.

573
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,044
Fraud charges are only part of it.

574
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,513
Oh, really? What, then? Jaywalking?

575
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,715
Conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.

576
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,283
Murder?

577
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,852
So, tell me, Dent...

578
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,287
who did I kill?

579
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:16,455
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

580
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,391
(scoffs): Oh, God...

581
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,826
I have an eyewitness who
can tie you to the crime,

582
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:23,396
you and all the others involved.

583
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,364
That's absurd.

584
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,440
Help yourself out here, Dick.

585
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,011
Think about your options.

586
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,880
This is gonna get ugly.

587
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:43,649
(scoffing laugh)

588
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:46,218
You're a fool.

589
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:50,957
And you have no idea who or
what you're even dealing with.

590
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:53,492
Don't you ever threaten me!

591
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,495
I will rip you open.

592
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,511
It was good to see you, Dick.

593
00:30:12,546 --> 00:30:13,479
<i>BULLOCK: Jim!</i>

594
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:14,814
Got it.

595
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,048
Yeah?

596
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,884
Meet Gregor Kasyanov. Long rap sheet.

597
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,353
Worked for Nikolai before he died.

598
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,788
- Who does he work for now?
- Beats me.

599
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,123
All right.

600
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,125
Hargrove said it's a
big job, right? A vault.

601
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,793
Somebody's got to be bankrolling it.

602
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,929
Yeah, someone with cash and
pull and beef with Falcone.

603
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:31,597
Problem is... in Gotham,

604
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:33,733
anyone with cash and pull
has beef with Falcone.

605
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:34,700
GORDON: Hmm.

606
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:35,835
So, who is it?

607
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:53,653
(Mooney clicks tongue)

608
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,488
You kept me waiting.

609
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,924
Ran into a little trouble.

610
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,558
Nothing to worry about.

611
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:02,194
Good, I've got a lot riding on this job.

612
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:03,696
You've said.

613
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,998
MOONEY: Your boss Nikolai is dead

614
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,000
because of Falcone.

615
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,368
You want to get back at him,

616
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:12,405
you hit him where it hurts... his money.

617
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,706
Ain't that right, Butch?

618
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,041
Yep.

619
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,809
The root of all evil.

620
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,578
We'll take his money.

621
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:19,946
No problem.

622
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,515
As long as it's there, like you said.

623
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,517
Oh, it's there.

624
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,353
I'm positive.

625
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,021
The truck you needed.

626
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:32,858
And Gregor...

627
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,128
break a leg.

628
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,968
(water burbling)

629
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,976
(heart beating)

630
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,145
(heartbeat increases)

631
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,351
(Selina scoffs)

632
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,821
You're the weirdest kid I've ever met.

633
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,261
Why are you doing that?

634
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:19,630
Training.

635
00:32:19,664 --> 00:32:21,265
Oh...

636
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,300
Like the boxing.

637
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:25,970
So, if anyone mugs you with a diving board,

638
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:27,538
you'll be ready, huh?

639
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,273
Yes.

640
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:31,275
I mean, no.

641
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,377
I'm developing
self-discipline and willpower.

642
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,612
Why?

643
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:36,680
So I can be strong.

644
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,850
I get you, but it won't work.

645
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:42,853
Not on the streets, not in Gotham.

646
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:43,954
Why's that?

647
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,723
Out there on the streets,

648
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,924
it's not enough to be strong.

649
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:50,227
You gotta be mean.

650
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,530
Gotta be ruthless.

651
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,766
Do you know what ruthless means?

652
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,334
Of course I do.

653
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,869
Yeah?

654
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:00,004
Well, you ain't.

655
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:02,173
You're a nice kid.

656
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,809
Five minutes on the
street, you'll be mincemeat.

657
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:07,344
And holding your breath
won't do a damn thing.

658
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:23,327
HOST: The subject of
today's category is numbers.

659
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,328
Here we go.

660
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,197
How many bones in the human arm?

661
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,198
Thirty-two.

662
00:33:27,232 --> 00:33:28,199
WOMAN: Thirty-two.

663
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,200
(bell dings)

664
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,768
HOST: Correct.

665
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:34,805
Next, how many elements
in the periodic table?

666
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,040
118.

667
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:38,642
WOMAN: Uh... 118.

668
00:33:38,677 --> 00:33:39,877
(bell dings)

669
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,645
HOST: Yes, again.

670
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,880
Now for a tough one.

671
00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:46,083
How many eyes are there on cards in a deck?

672
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:47,084
Forty-two.

673
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,352
WOMAN: 21.

674
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:49,653
(buzzer sounds)

675
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:51,322
HOST: No, I'm sorry.

676
00:33:51,356 --> 00:33:54,258
The number you were looking for is 42.

677
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:56,093
You forgot to double it for two eyes.

678
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:57,762
(lively music playing)

679
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:01,098
(whoops, laughs)

680
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,700
HOST: Well, that concludes
our show for today.

681
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:03,934
We'd like to thank all the contestants

682
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,836
that participated here in studio

683
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,638
and those of you playing along at home.

684
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,607
We'll be back right after this.

685
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,108
BULLOCK: Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

686
00:34:11,143 --> 00:34:12,276
What about the explosives?

687
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,612
It-it's a very specific type.

688
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:16,147
It's highly volatile,

689
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,049
and it's very difficult to manufacture.

690
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,118
It's for one use, and one use only.

691
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:22,753
To penetrate iron.

692
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:24,155
Like a vault in a bank.

693
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,623
Mm-mm, no, they're all steel.

694
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:27,258
No one makes anything out of iron anymore.

695
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:29,260
Not for... a hundred years, at least.

696
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:31,328
The Gotham Armory.

697
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:32,530
Yeah.

698
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:33,931
Yeah, they have those iron vaults

699
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,399
they used to keep the gunpowder in.

700
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:36,801
A few years ago,

701
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:38,169
a private investment group bought it.

702
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,970
Ten to one, Falcone's behind it.

703
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,007
Hmm...? Do you...?

704
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:53,250
How much longer?

705
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,486
It's ready.

706
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:17,541
It didn't work.

707
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:24,582
(laughter echoing)

708
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:28,753
Hey, hey...

709
00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:30,388
promise me nobody else is gonna get hurt.

710
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:31,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

711
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:32,390
Sure, no problem.

712
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:33,424
Cross my heart.

713
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:50,941
You're surrounded!

714
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,943
- (sirens approaching)
- There's no way out!

715
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:54,378
(sirens whooping)

716
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,614
Drop your weapons!

717
00:35:56,648 --> 00:35:58,616
KASYANOV: Don't do it! Get back!

718
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,118
Hargrove!

719
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:04,188
Ian Hargrove!

720
00:36:04,222 --> 00:36:06,023
Your brother and his family are safe.

721
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:07,758
We have them in protective custody.

722
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:10,561
KASYANOV: If he runs, shoot him!

723
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:11,629
Don't shoot!

724
00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:12,763
MAN: You shoot him, they shoot us!

725
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,799
Drop your weapons!

726
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:24,108
(cell phone ringtone playing)

727
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:28,346
Get away from the truck!

728
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,313
Everybody down!

729
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:09,512
Why'd you do that?

730
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:11,114
Bet you can't hit me.

731
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,916
I could.

732
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,117
But why would I want to?

733
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:15,251
Try.

734
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:16,252
What for?

735
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:20,190
Hit me, and...

736
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:22,092
Hmm...

737
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:24,060
I'll let you kiss me.

738
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,868
Ha!

739
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,476
You didn't get me.

740
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,311
Ah, no!

741
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,452
- Oh!
- (laughing)

742
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,793
(Bruce shouting playfully)

743
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,931
(cell phone ringing)

744
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:06,402
GORDON: Morning, Alfred.

745
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,837
Ah, Detective.

746
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,272
I've been trying to get out there.

747
00:38:09,306 --> 00:38:10,807
I'm sorry, uh... Is everything okay?

748
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:12,175
Is she behaving herself?

749
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,511
Well, uh, not really, no.

750
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:15,712
That's all right.

751
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,013
It is?

752
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,248
Yes, well, she's...

753
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:21,284
a breath of fresh air, I might say.

754
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:23,720
Glad to hear it.

755
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:26,089
I'll be out there as-as soon as I can.

756
00:38:26,123 --> 00:38:28,625
Very good, sir.

757
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:38,067
(surprised gasp)

758
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:40,069
Oh...

759
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:41,438
Forgive me for the intrusion,

760
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:43,139
but it's urgent that I speak with you.

761
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:46,075
(laughs)

762
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,477
You know who I am.

763
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:49,913
Yeah.

764
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:52,348
And Falcone would kill you
if he knew you were here.

765
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:56,086
Perhaps.

766
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,088
What would he do if I told him

767
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:00,390
that you were spying
on him for Fish Mooney?

768
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,659
You don't have any proof.

769
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,195
No.

770
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:11,534
But suspicion, it's a funny thing.

771
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:13,203
Hmm?

772
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:16,106
Falcone might not choose
to believe me at first,

773
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,208
but every time he looked at you,

774
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:22,178
he'd ask himself... is she?

775
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:24,047
Could she?

776
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:25,548
Would she?

777
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,183
You're wrong.

778
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:28,485
He cares about me.

779
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:31,654
Let's call him and find out, shall we?

780
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:36,392
(keypad beeping)

781
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:38,595
Stop!

782
00:39:49,006 --> 00:39:51,975
Your secret is safe with me.

783
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:55,078
I won't tell,

784
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:57,480
because you...

785
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:01,985
are gonna keep working for Fish.

786
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:05,655
And you are not going to tell anyone.

787
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:07,690
Or you'll die.

788
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,395
GORDON: Messages for Gordon.

789
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,464
Thanks.

790
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,499
Jim. You have a minute?

791
00:40:16,534 --> 00:40:18,168
Uh, yeah.

792
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:24,240
- I met with Lovecraft.
- How'd it go?

793
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:26,609
He was scared. He's involved, all right.

794
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:28,978
Scared isn't proof. You didn't see him.

795
00:40:29,013 --> 00:40:31,181
Told the same story in a few other spots.

796
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,348
All the big players will know by now,

797
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:33,349
someone will start talking.

798
00:40:33,384 --> 00:40:35,018
If and when they do,

799
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:36,719
neither of us makes a
move without talking first.

800
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:38,021
We move together on this.

801
00:40:38,055 --> 00:40:39,589
Absolutely.

802
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:40,990
Hey, nice work on the Hargrove case.

803
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:42,192
You saved the poor guy's life.

804
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:43,726
- You're a regular saint.
- Thanks.

805
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,195
Uh, we'll be talking again soon, I hope.

806
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:46,663
You bet.

807
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:47,997
Thanks, Counselor.

808
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:50,633
Finish up with Hargrove?

809
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:52,635
Yeah.

810
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,137
He's on his way to Arkham.

811
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:55,338
Arkham?

812
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,207
Mayor's directive.

813
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:59,109
He's taking all the criminally
insane inmates from Blackgate,

814
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:00,443
sending them to Arkham,

815
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:02,145
so they can get appropriate treatment.

816
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,613
That's nuts.

817
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,415
Appropriate tr... The
building's 200 years old.

818
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:07,217
Welcome to Gotham.

819
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:09,119
Oh, and get this...
Hargrove said that the bomb

820
00:41:09,153 --> 00:41:10,620
that blew up the money wasn't his.

821
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:13,289
- Whose was it?
- He didn't know.

822
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,664
How did it go?

823
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:23,166
Cops were everywhere.

824
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,368
Our guys had no way out.

825
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:27,003
I had to make the call.

826
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:28,271
Is everybody dead?

827
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:30,040
Gregor? All his men?

828
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,975
Every last one.

829
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:33,943
Good.

830
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:35,945
I can't stand loose strings.

831
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,347
You're not mad?

832
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,215
That's a hell of a lot
of money we just lost.

833
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,517
Mad?

834
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,485
I couldn't be happier.

835
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,721
The point wasn't to
steal that money, Butch.

836
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,489
It was to hurt Falcone.

837
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:50,994
Well, that you did, Fish.

838
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:52,395
That you did.

839
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,732
Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you all for coming.

840
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,967
As you well know,

841
00:41:58,002 --> 00:41:59,369
the people of Gotham

842
00:41:59,403 --> 00:42:02,706
<i>have been shaken by tragedy in recent days,</i>

843
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:07,377
<i>tragedy no citizen should have to endure.</i>

844
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:10,580
<i>What has happened these past
few days is a direct result</i>

845
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:14,150
<i>of Gotham's criminally insane not getting</i>

846
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:18,588
<i>the appropriate treatment
and help that we owe them.</i>

847
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,024
<i>That is why I am moving forward with plans</i>

848
00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:24,928
<i>to turn the recently
renovated Arkham Asylum</i>

849
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:26,763
<i>into a remedial facility...</i>

850
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,331
All right, let's go, here, man; let's go.

851
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:30,433
<i>For the criminally insane.</i>

852
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:34,571
<i>GORDON: Barbara...</i>

853
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:36,373
it's me.

854
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,942
I got your letter, and I, um...

855
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:43,780
I know you said you needed
some time away from Gotham.

856
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:45,849
From me.

857
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:48,885
But I want you to come back.

858
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:53,523
I need you... to come back.

859
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:56,860
I don't have anything without you.

860
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:01,898
And I love you.

861
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:23,621
