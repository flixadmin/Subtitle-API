1
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,833
Helsinki, get out of there.
Take shelter in the museum.

2
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,166
I'm making a trench!

3
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,875
Helsinki, do you copy?

4
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,833
Helsinki, are you there?

5
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,791
Fatty!

6
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,125
I'm alive.

7
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,166
Get out of there now!

8
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,625
Leg trapped.

9
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,375
Open wound.

10
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,750
Blood.

11
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,666
Lots of blood.

12
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,791
Don't fall asleep. We're almost there.

13
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,250
I promise you, once we get out of here,

14
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,541
I'm going to show you,
three nights in a row,

15
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,958
why Argentinian meat
is the best in the world.

16
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,583
And then what?

17
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,208
You'll take me to the movies?

18
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,791
Yes, but only if you don't fall asleep.
Promise me you'll stay awake.

19
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,166
I'm awake.

20
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,500
Squadrons three and nine, now!

21
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,833
Move! Come on!

22
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,125
They're here.

23
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,583
We don't know what just happened.
It looks like a terrible explosion.

24
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,541
There are hundreds of people
here at the Bank of Spain…

25
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,291
LIVE
HEIST AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

26
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,083
This is the Professor.
The stormwater tank is safe.

27
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,875
I request an assessment
of the situation. Palermo!

28
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,291
They blew up the roof! Bogotá,
Rio and I are going to the top floor.

29
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,416
Helsinki's trapped.

30
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,041
Lisbon, location.

31
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,666
Second floor, with Stockholm.

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,833
Tokyo, location.

33
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,000
About to go out onto the roof.
We'll attack them from behind.

34
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,000
-No, don't open that door!
-What?

35
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,125
-And Helsinki?
-They'll kill you.

36
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,416
They're coming down!

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,250
Cover the flanks and stay together.

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,375
If you don't go, they'll kill Helsinki.

39
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,291
Go!

40
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,458
Should we go out or not?

41
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,000
There are 100 snipers aiming
at the roof, and they're soldiers.

42
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,666
They won't let you attack
from behind. They'll blow your heads off.

43
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,041
Professor, you're sacrificing a man!

44
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,041
The only way to save him
is to attack on two flanks.

45
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,125
We'll use the hole in the roof.

46
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,166
But you have to get out there
without getting killed, and I know how.

47
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,500
Go get the hostages.

48
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,791
Maintain your position!

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,000
Fire at three o'clock!

50
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,666
Come on!

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,250
Gandía!

52
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,458
Come on!

53
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,291
Take cover! Quick!

54
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,375
Now!

55
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,333
Everyone take cover!

56
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,541
We'd often thought we were at war.

57
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,416
But that was simply because

58
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,000
we didn't know what war actually was.

59
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,500
Frederiksborg Castle.

60
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,083
It has tight security measures.

61
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,958
Just to get in or out, you must go through
two arches with metal detectors

62
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,791
and armed security guards.

63
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,541
All that's before you reach the party.

64
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,708
It'll be the perfect soiree.

65
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,208
Fancy cars, tuxedos,

66
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,291
cocktails, classical music
and 12 kilos of gold.

67
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,416
Tatiana's fingers will work their magic.

68
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,041
And all we have to do is enjoy the party.

69
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:49,166
Why? By then, the trickiest part
of the job will have been taken care of.

70
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,500
In fact, you'll have done it
the day before.

71
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,041
-Me?
-Yes, you.

72
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,958
You're the only one among us
with the plain, inconspicuous appearance

73
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,291
of a piano tuner.

74
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,541
What's this?

75
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,458
Well,

76
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,250
it's a magnetic stripe card reader,
a skimmer for cloning cards.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,916
Exactly!

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,333
This will be concealed, right?

79
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:20,333
This is normally used to steal
card information at ATMs and all that.

80
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,666
Tatiana will suddenly feel indisposed.

81
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,166
Nerves, the concert…

82
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,375
I need some air.

83
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,458
So you'll be left on your own
with a magnificent grand piano.

84
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,041
You'll need help.

85
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,083
This type of magnetic stripe card cloner

86
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,500
requires you to be within ten centimeters

87
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,541
of the card you want to clone

88
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,500
for 30 seconds, obviously.

89
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,791
That's easy,
they'll be hanging from their necks.

90
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,541
Nothing a stubborn B-flat can't fix.

91
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,958
Then your tool cart comes into play.

92
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,208
That's where we'll hide the fake pieces.

93
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,250
It's coated with barium sulfate,

94
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,916
so an X-ray machine won't detect anything.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,500
They'll escort you to the safe place
where the pieces will be kept.

96
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,583
From then on,
Hans will be the only problem.

97
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,500
-Hans?
-The security guard at the gold room.

98
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,500
He's always by the door.

99
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,333
He never leaves.

100
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,083
This man has no wife,

101
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,458
no dog, no kids,

102
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,833
and his father is senile.
What's his weak spot?

103
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,250
I don't know. A second-degree relative?

104
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,875
Why resort to a second-degree relative?
His father is senile.

105
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,958
His father.

106
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,125
His father's senile.

107
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,708
He's in a sanitarium.
He doesn't recognize anyone anymore.

108
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,958
-Bring in Cristoff.
-Copy that.

109
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,458
Rafael.

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,166
The briefcase.

111
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,541
Thank you.

112
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,583
We're in.

113
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,958
Set Cristoff free.

114
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,958
Walk towards the music, Cristoff.

115
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,375
Towards the music.

116
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,125
Cristoff is on the move.

117
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,541
-Cameras?
-I'm accessing the system.

118
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,666
Music.

119
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,291
Music.

120
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,541
I got it.

121
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,750
It's on a loop.

122
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,125
Music.

123
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
Picture Hans's astonishment.

124
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,291
He thinks his father is in a sanitarium,

125
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,458
in slippers, watching Wheel of Fortune,

126
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,791
and all of a sudden…

127
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,666
Music.

128
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,166
Music.

129
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,708
This is Bear 3. Emergency in Room 1.
I need an immediate replacement in Room 1.

130
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,708
Copy that, Bear 3.

131
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,041
On my way.

132
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,416
Rock and roll.

133
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,625
There's something I haven't told you.

134
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,708
I have absolutely no idea

135
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,625
what's in there.

136
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,583
Music.

137
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,833
You never know
what you'll find in a secret vault.

138
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,750
It's beautiful.

139
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,708
Let's do it.

140
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,500
They're encrypted safe-deposit boxes.

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,958
Excuse me.

142
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,708
And that is the key
that opens all the doors.

143
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,125
Good. Which box contains the gold?

144
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,041
The information is in here.
It's a matter of coding. I can hack it.

145
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,166
This box is attached to a beam.
It's a fixed structure.

146
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,416
Because the walls move.

147
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,666
This is the most fascinating
security system I've ever seen.

148
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,583
He just found his father.

149
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,333
Don't grow too fond of it, son.
You've got one minute to blow it up.

150
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,166
I can't do this in one minute, Dad.

151
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,791
Jakov, it's an emergency.

152
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,583
We need three minutes.

153
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,708
-I can't do it in three minutes either.
-It's okay, don't worry.

154
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,791
You'll have plenty of time
to figure it out in jail.

155
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,125
Excuse me.

156
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,375
I'm a doctor.
I think this gentleman doesn't feel well.

157
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,250
He's disoriented.
It's nothing serious. Thanks.

158
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,708
Come on, Dad.

159
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,958
-Come on!
-I found the gold. I'm breaking the code.

160
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,875
-How much longer?
-I don't know.

161
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,708
Jakov.

162
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,833
Two minutes.

163
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,666
Got it!

164
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,791
Excuse me.

165
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,375
Out there…

166
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,500
One minute, Jakov.

167
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,958
He crossed the line with some ladies.

168
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,500
What?

169
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,583
The president of the foundation
almost called the police.

170
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,583
What did he do?

171
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,083
He said

172
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,541
inappropriate things.

173
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,541
What things?

174
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,000
About…

175
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,250
genitals.

176
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,458
Did you see if he was with someone
or how he got here?

177
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,625
Move aside.

178
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,500
Come on, Dad.

179
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,875
Andrés, Hans is suspicious.

180
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,166
They're headed your way.

181
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,166
Excuse me.

182
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,125
Jakov, it's done.

183
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,250
We're out.

184
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,750
The adrenaline,

185
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,583
the endorphins…

186
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,416
You feel powerful. Don't you, son?

187
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,458
It's amazing.

188
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,500
The most important lesson comes now.

189
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,166
That's it.

190
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,208
What are you doing? No.

191
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:06,750
Dad?

192
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,375
Dad!

193
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,166
-Why?
-I'm teaching you a lesson!

194
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,541
A lesson? I can't believe this.

195
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,750
You just threw away 12 kilos of gold.
That's 15 million euros.

196
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,750
Teach me a lesson, my ass.

197
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,375
Look at you.

198
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,750
Only a thief can feel
that something they don't own is theirs.

199
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,750
Now you know you're one of us.

200
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,791
So, next time,

201
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,541
leave that arrogance
and moral superiority behind

202
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,166
and don't you ever
call your father a cynic again.

203
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,041
Now it's time to enjoy ourselves.

204
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,791
I came here to listen to Tatiana play.

205
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,708
Bravo!

206
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,083
The dream of any thief is

207
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,125
to leave the place of the heist
surrounded by applause,

208
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:19,125
people taking pictures, smiling,

209
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,125
calm, determined

210
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,291
and in love.

211
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,458
And, above all,

212
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,500
free of any suspicion.

213
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,083
We'll leave the country undetected,

214
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,541
in a beautiful, small boat,
celebrating Tatiana's success,

215
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,333
headed to Malmö, Sweden.

216
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,958
What's wrong with him?

217
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,333
A tantrum.

218
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,833
I never know
whether he's tired, hungry or gassy.

219
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,375
My love, are you ready?

220
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,708
Of course.

221
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,083
Let's have a look!

222
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,083
You expected us
to walk out the door with it?

223
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,083
I never took you to play tennis.

224
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,708
We never cycled up
a mountain pass together or went rowing.

225
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,458
You wouldn't have learned anything new
from doing that with your father.

226
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,375
But here, you will.

227
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,666
If you really want something in life,

228
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,416
you have to steal it from whomever has it.

229
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,708
That's how the world works, my son.

230
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,541
Now!

231
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,791
We're here, Fatty. Don't worry.

232
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,083
Stay calm, Fatty. I'm here.

233
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:28,958
Arteche.

234
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,166
Arteche!

235
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,166
I can't hear anything. Tosco's injured.

236
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,291
His pulse is very weak.

237
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,500
It hit the femoral artery.

238
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,833
We gotta make a fucking tourniquet.

239
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,583
Breathe, Fatty.
We'll get you out of here, you hear me?

240
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,958
Put it higher. Higher. Come on.

241
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,375
Sagasta, do you copy?

242
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:01,000
-What the hell is going on?
-It was a hostile rocket.

243
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,708
I want a damage report now!

244
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,833
Shut your fucking mouth, Colonel.
I have wounded men in here.

245
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,166
Canalejas, we have to make
a trench to secure the perimeter--

246
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,583
Hey, look at me.

247
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,625
This is going to hurt. Ready?

248
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,625
Three, two, one.

249
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,750
Get the bomb disposal robot.
Any second now, we'll go in from below.

250
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,208
We're going up!

251
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,500
It's your lucky day.
We're running a drill, like in school.

252
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,375
So keep quiet and get in line.

253
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,250
You're the infantry now.

254
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,833
Matías, the backpacks with the equipment.
We're going to the roof.

255
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:41,750
Copy that.

256
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,625
Come on, move!

257
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,291
Palermo, cut my fucking leg off.

258
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,208
Cut it off.

259
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,000
Look at me.

260
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,583
I won't cut your leg off,
you hear me? I won't.

261
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,916
Palermo,

262
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,041
my femur, tibia and knee are shattered.

263
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,166
Everything.

264
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,333
They'll cut it off in the hospital.
You know damn well, Palermo.

265
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:18,416
This will make you feel better.
We'll get you out. Stop being stupid.

266
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,083
Fatty, stay calm. I'm here with you.

267
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,208
Look at me, Mirko.

268
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,041
Hey, look at me.

269
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,875
He's right.

270
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,000
It's a marble column.
It weighs at least two tons.

271
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,375
We can't move it, Palermo.

272
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,166
I'll cut it off.

273
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,833
No, let's find a fucking lever
and move the statue!

274
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,750
We need something strong.

275
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,250
Back stairs.

276
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,458
The snipers have to think you're hostages.

277
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:20,291
Have half of them remove their masks.
You've got one minute to get up there.

278
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,958
You're going to play
the role of your lives!

279
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,250
I want an Oscar-winning performance!

280
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,208
Is that clear? Come on!

281
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,708
That's it.

282
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:30,625
Come on!

283
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,833
Ms. Tokyo, wait. I have a stitch.

284
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,541
Come on, we're almost there.

285
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,541
Pass me a bandage, Bogotá.

286
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,666
-Don't fall asleep.
-Hang in there.

287
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,166
-Stay calm, Fatty.
-Hang in there.

288
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,333
It looks much better.

289
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
Fatty, hey.

290
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,166
You're with me, right?

291
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,083
-Palermo.
-Open your eyes.

292
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,125
Keep your eyes open, Fatty.

293
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,500
Helsinki. Look at me, Fatty, please.

294
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,375
Look at me. Come on, Fatty!
Fatty, look at me, for fuck's sake!

295
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,250
Don't go. Look at me.

296
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,666
Palermo, would that beam work?

297
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,791
Cover us.

298
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,166
Thank you.

299
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,875
Lisbon, hurry up. We need covering fire.

300
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,166
We're going out. Everybody ready?

301
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:33,791
-They're going to kill us!
-Nobody's going to kill you.

302
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,916
I might kill you
for being so annoying, but they won't.

303
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,250
They won't kill any of you

304
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,291
'cause half of you will remove
your masks. Is that clear?

305
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,583
Make sure they can see you're hostages.

306
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:47,833
You'll remove your mask.
You too. You and you too, darling.

307
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:48,875
Okay, good.

308
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,333
Masks.

309
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,708
Professor.

310
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,958
Bomb squad. They're preparing
to enter at the ground floor.

311
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,208
Let's go!

312
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,833
They're preparing a second attack.

313
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,375
Why'd you release the governor?
Tell me there's a plan.

314
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,875
We hid a microphone in the handcuffs.

315
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:18,208
I thought we'd have a chance
if the handcuffs were removed

316
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,083
before they were searched
with the radio frequency detector.

317
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,833
We're getting him out.
And I'll tell you why.

318
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,541
And?

319
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,208
We've got Tamayo by the balls.

320
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,166
Contact Pakistan.

321
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:40,708
You're the sexiest woman in the world,
but I love you for your mind.

322
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:45,041
I'm a little busy with a war here.
Let's talk dirty later.

323
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,291
Sounds good.

324
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,875
Benjamín, call your men.

325
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,041
Let's prepare the foundry.

326
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,208
Alicia.

327
00:26:55,291 --> 00:27:00,000
Marseille, go out and buy pacifiers,
diapers, a crib. Anything that's needed.

328
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,166
Are you breast- or bottle-feeding?

329
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,083
Breast and bottle, okay? Let's do it all.

330
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,083
And bring something for his foot.
He didn't notice that I shot him.

331
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:15,083
By the way, I think you should give
your cartridge clip to Marseille.

332
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,291
For everyone's safety.

333
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,250
Thank you.

334
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,750
Professor, we're on the roof.

335
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:47,375
Good. Tokyo, it's important
that they don't see you're armed.

336
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,833
Keep the equipment inside the weapon bag.

337
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,750
Tie one end of a rope to the bag
and the other end to one of you.

338
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:57,708
You'll get to the hole in the roof
by hiding among the hostages.

339
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,625
Matías, we need your help.

340
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:03,208
As soon as I say "stampede,"
shoot to distract the snipers.

341
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:06,458
Then pull the rope
and retrieve the bag. Understood?

342
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,750
Palermo. Stockholm and I are in position.

343
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,041
Lisbon, smoke in five,

344
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,000
four,

345
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:22,541
three,

346
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,291
two, one.

347
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,666
Good luck.

348
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,083
Now!

349
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:32,666
Smoke!

350
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,083
Covering fire!

351
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,625
I have no visual!

352
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,500
Come on, Rio.

353
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,625
Tokyo, now.

354
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,375
Don't shoot!

355
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla
from Totana, Murcia.

356
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,958
They're on the roof
and are removing their masks.

357
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,791
If anyone goes near the hole, open fire.

358
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,833
Copy that.

359
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:16,000
The robot. Enter through the door now.

360
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,083
They can't handle the commando
and hostages at the same time.

361
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,875
-Now's the time.
-You got it.

362
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,750
Don't shoot!

363
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,291
Exit achieved, Professor.

364
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,625
Come on!

365
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,166
Bandage, now!

366
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,250
We're running out of smoke. Hurry!

367
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,541
Come on, Rio! We have to get out of here!

368
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,583
-Come on!
-Come on!

369
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,666
Bogotá! Are you okay?

370
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,166
Hang in there!

371
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,916
I'm waiting for the green light.

372
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,666
Palermo, give the order.

373
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,166
Give the order now!

374
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,125
Hold on up there. We're freeing Helsinki.

375
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,750
We don't have much time.

376
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,583
Once we get him out, we'll be the bait
to lure them out of the trench.

377
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,916
Chuikov!

378
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,375
Don't get close
to the hole until I tell you to.

379
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,041
Don't shoot!

380
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,291
-Get ready to intervene.
-Copy that.

381
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,458
Let's go!

382
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,916
In position, sir.

383
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,875
UNKNOWN NUMBER

384
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,708
Sir, we're ready.

385
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,708
Wait a minute.

386
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,000
Hello?

387
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,041
You're connected.

388
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,125
Don't raise your tiny hand

389
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:26,000
because you don't want anyone
to overhear this conversation.

390
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,041
Tell me, do you do yoga
or something like that?

391
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,041
Capoeira.

392
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,916
That's why you're so flexible.

393
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,125
You're so flexible that you can dodge
problems, resignations, responsibilities.

394
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,958
With such flexibility,
you must be an excellent lover.

395
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,291
I am, but this conversation
is starting to disgust me a bit.

396
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,041
Tell me what the fuck you want.

397
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,500
Proceed.

398
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,958
They didn't revive anyone,
and they killed him in cold blood.

399
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,041
It would be best if he died
in the next ten minutes.

400
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:01,166
This is a gift, and I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!

401
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,583
We'll shoot them in the back
even if they surrender!

402
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,291
And that's why

403
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,333
I need everyone
to think they're fucking murderers.

404
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,416
What are you after?

405
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,791
-I want a just war.
-That doesn't exist.

406
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,458
Tamayo, you sent
eight elite soldiers into the bank.

407
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:23,333
I have ten thieves inside.
I think it's quite balanced.

408
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,333
I don't want to see any more movements.

409
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,750
You think that recording will stop me? 

410
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:33,583
Colonel, you started a war
to save yourself without qualms or ethics.

411
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,541
I'm only asking that you continue.

412
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,083
Either you stop the second attack,

413
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:44,666
or I'll prove it was you who fabricated
evidence against Alicia Sierra,

414
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,708
that it was you who ordered
payment from the reserve funds,

415
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,916
and I'll transfer ten million to a company
in the Dutch Antilles, in your name.

416
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,708
And, believe me, that operation
will link you directly to me.

417
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,125
Postpone the intervention.

418
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,333
That's not the order I expected.

419
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:26,708
You don't get calls from the president
or report to the government, do you?

420
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:31,916
Then go munch on some fucking cookies
and let me give the orders.

421
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,458
-Help!
-Tokyo!

422
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,583
Don't shoot!

423
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,958
Don't shoot! We're hostages!

424
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:53,041
What's wrong?

425
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,708
-I'm fine.
-What happened?

426
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,208
-Nothing.
-What happened?

427
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:00,041
All this might be
just a bit too much for me,

428
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,791
but I'm fine, really.

429
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,083
I used to rob gas stations, man.
And now the Army is out there.

430
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,625
It's okay. You're not alone.

431
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,875
It's okay.
I'm not alone. Everything's fine.

432
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:12,875
Let's go.

433
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,041
Relax.

434
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,041
It's okay.

435
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,750
Look at me.

436
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,541
Don't close your eyes, okay? Look at me.

437
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,541
-Tell me a story.
-What?

438
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,833
Whatever you want. 
How did you end up here?

439
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:29,875
Well, the other heist went so well.

440
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,291
But this one, not so much.

441
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,291
And I wanted
to spend time with this weirdo.

442
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,625
But from the time I got to the monastery,

443
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:42,125
I knew this wasn't going to go well.

444
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,583
Why is that?

445
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:53,875
Because you were there
with your wife, with a child, like…

446
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,458
You looked like a picture-perfect family.

447
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,583
And I felt so stupid…

448
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:02,875
Stupid? Why?

449
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,041
Because I've been in love
with him all my life.

450
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,666
Stop fooling around.
It's no time for jokes.

451
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,916
It's not a joke, sweetie.

452
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,458
It's not a joke. But since we might die,

453
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:15,875
because this is getting ugly,
I'm saying it.

454
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,791
No, I'm saying it to get it off my chest.

455
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,625
No, okay? Listen to me.

456
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,625
Nobody's going to die. You hear me?

457
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,375
-Say it.
-Nobody's going to die.

458
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,250
-Good. Okay?
-Okay.

459
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,416
Life goes on, right?

460
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,750
-Life goes on.
-That's right.

461
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,250
Pull him as if you were an ox!

462
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,208
Professor, Helsinki's out.

463
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:01,083
Matías, get ready to shoot on my command.

464
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,500
Yes, Professor.

465
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,500
Tokyo, Manila, Denver, get ready.

466
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,916
Let's get ready.

467
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Follow me, okay?

468
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,583
Matías, stampede.

469
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,333
By the door! Shoot!

470
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,625
Fire!

471
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,666
They're approaching the hole.
I request permission to shoot.

472
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,125
You can't shoot. They're hostages!

473
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,958
I have a visual, sir.

474
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,916
Visibility is reducing.
I request permission to shoot.

475
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,416
They're civilians running
from the line of fire. Permission denied.

476
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,416
Bogotá, Rio, let them advance.

477
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:00,625
They're backing off.
Full-court press, now!

478
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,500
Tokyo.

479
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,833
They left their nest. Wait for my signal.

480
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,541
Not yet.

481
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,958
-Now!
-Now!

482
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,291
Fire at six o'clock!

483
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,208
Let's go!

484
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,250
Fuck, girl.

485
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,041
We get an hour to rest and they all fuck.

486
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,416
What is this? A camp for teenagers?

487
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:49,166
If Rio were here,
what do you think you'd be doing?

488
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,625
There are a ton of saints
and Jesuses in here.

489
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:57,083
They're my boyfriends. And my bodyguards.

490
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,375
They protect me and Helsinki.

491
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:03,833
Shit.

492
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,625
This one should stay behind.

493
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:11,416
Sorry to say, but I don't know if I want
them all showing up the day I die.

494
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:12,750
I see.

495
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,833
What do you think happens?

496
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,291
When we get shot in the head?

497
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:27,791
Do you believe in heaven?

498
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:31,958
Actually…

499
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:32,916
no.

500
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,833
Really?

501
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,375
Nothing.

502
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,416
That's what you believe?

503
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:42,541
That everything's over?

504
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,708
Not everything.

505
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,083
Your memory lives on.

506
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,541
How would you like to be remembered?

507
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,708
I don't know. I guess…

508
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,750
I'd like people to say

509
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,875
they felt things with me.

510
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,208
But real things.

511
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,541
I don't know,
like friendship, for example.

512
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:18,375
You know those people who say,
"I have tons of friends"?

513
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,583
So?

514
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,000
You don't need to have them.

515
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,541
You need to feel them.

516
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,416
Don't you think Helsinki will remember me
every fucking Christmas?

517
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,500
I'll remember you saying…

518
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,541
"I'll go."

519
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,500
I'll go where?

520
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:48,208
Into the lion's den
to rescue my boyfriend.

521
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,000
Come on.

522
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,708
Babe…

523
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,125
I do think there's something.

524
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,458
Actually,

525
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:13,750
I think…

526
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,875
that you keep living
in the last thought you have before dying.

527
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,125
That's why, when things get crazy,
I think of when I was happy.

528
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,625
And in those memories,

529
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,416
I'll stay and live forever.

530
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,541
That's a great plan.

531
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:49,875
-What? Who's next door?
-Come on. Who do you think?

532
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,166
-No.
-Of course!

533
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,541
Yeah, Aikido, Professor!

534
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,500
Aikido all the way, man!

535
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:57,041
Shut up!

536
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,666
Who's in charge here?

537
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,416
Major Sagasta.

538
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,333
Sagasta, you're surrounded.

539
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,791
Throw your weapons
into the middle of the room, now.

540
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,541
Come and get them, pillow-biter!

541
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,416
Sagasta, update.

542
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,416
Send in the second detachment.
The whole gang is here.

543
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,791
Even the postman and his mom
could walk in the main door right now.

544
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,958
Sagasta, you have to resist.

545
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,041
There won't be a second detachment.

546
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,375
They snuck in right under your nose
and now you leave us high and dry.

547
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,791
Over and out.

548
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,750
Arteche, what do you think?

549
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:53,000
We're between two fronts.
We need to get rid of one.

550
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,666
Sagasta, you've got ten seconds.

551
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,125
Gandía, can you activate
the museum's security lock?

552
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,250
Affirmative.
There's a fingerprint reader in the room.

553
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,416
Seven seconds!

554
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:14,083
Okay, four corners. Wait for my order.

555
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,750
Five seconds!

556
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:24,791
Four!

557
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,625
Three!

558
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,375
Two!

559
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:36,500
All right! We'll drop our weapons.

560
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:40,000
Hands on your heads!
Get down on the ground, damn it!

561
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,166
Okay.

562
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,958
We're going to drop our weapons.

563
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,666
I don't like this one bit.

564
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,041
Now!

565
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,083
Grenade!

566
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,583
Get back!

567
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,333
Fuck!

568
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,375
-What's happening, Lisbon?
-Grenades!

569
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:33,833
-We've retreated to the museum.
-Don't lose sight of Tokyo's group.

570
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,166
Tokyo, keep going!

571
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:45,708
Impossible.

572
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:46,833
I have no visual.

573
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:10,083
They're lowering the doors.
There's a security lock.

574
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,375
A security lock?

575
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,375
That's impossible. It's not in the plans.

576
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,541
They must have installed them afterwards

577
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,166
'cause three doors are closing, Professor.

578
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,333
Come on!

579
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,750
Go to the kitchen.

580
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,916
Tokyo!

581
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,541
A little bird just told me Nairobi

582
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:43,000
is saving you a place in heaven.

583
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,125
