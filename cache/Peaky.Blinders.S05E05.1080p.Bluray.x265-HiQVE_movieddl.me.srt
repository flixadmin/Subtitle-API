of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

166
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,560
These are policies that could not
be pursued by British statesmen

167
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,200
unless they were mad
or the servants of Jewish finance!

again and again by politicians!

the Jew war for nothing,

you brave men,

177
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,360
you will join hands
with the angry youth of Birmingham

and Manchester and London
and Liverpool

I say all this to you now...

...because I believe
it is in places like this,

184
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,400
with people like you, that we will have
to pass on our message directly.

185
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,320
Our message can be summarised
with these words -

186
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Britain first.

And because this is our message,

189
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,520
I doubt it'll be reported
fairly in the press.

190
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country

191
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,120
are owned by the same vested interests
who took your money.

192
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
They sell to the people false news...

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,920
...to raise the interests of the faction
and the section

194
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
above the interests of the nation.

- So hear my words

And be reminded
that when the new decade begins,

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,720
there will be the birth
of a new political party

199
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,720
which will speak <i>for you.</i>

things like that will have to stop.

220
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,280
It's very lower class.

221
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,720
It's all been cleared up, Mr Mosley.

222
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,040
So, did you learn anything
from my speech tonight?

223
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,880
Yes.

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
Yes, I learned many things.

225
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,720
MOSLEY: Religion was a beast,
but it's dead.

226
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,280
You have to ride the new thing

227

and Savile Row suits,

231
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,760
and bitterness.

232
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,640
<i>They are</i> my people.

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,560

Yes, I do.

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,480
Things will begin to happen now.

239
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
So...

240
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,720
...there are some things
we need to discuss.

241
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,400
I've been looking
into your companies.

242
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,200
The Shelby portfolio.

243
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,760
Your company lawyer is a Jew.

244
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,440
He will have to go.

245
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,320
Of course.

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,800
Also, our friend Jimmy McCavern

247
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,800
has asked for control of the racecourses
north of Wincanton.

248
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,840
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

249
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,160
so I said yes.

250
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,040
In return for what?

251
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,920
No return.

252
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,560
None.

253
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,480
When our campaign begins, the country
will be divided into distinct areas.

254
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,680
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

255
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,160
controlling rallies
and breaking up demonstrations.

256
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,400
In the Midlands, it'll be you.

257
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,080
The south... Well, I have yet to decide.

258
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,360
Please understand what I'm offering you
as we go forward, Mr Shelby.

259
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,800

even the King will not be above us.

Oh, and also, Shelby...drink less.

266
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,160

some certainty in the south.

659
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,680
Some of my people were attacked
by members of the Titanic,

660
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,040
who've heard about a cargo.

661
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,320
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion

662
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,240
regarding who he can rely on
to offer him support in London.

663
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,880
Well, I would suggest the most competent
organiser of men in the south...

664
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,920
...is Alfie Solomons.

665
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,040
(LAUGHS) He's dead.

666
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,360
And he's Jewish!

667
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,960
And I'd say as far as
our boss is concerned,

668
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,480
him being dead would be less
of an obstacle than him being Jewish.

669
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,320
I think he'll give London to the Italians.

670
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,600
He likes Italians.

671
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,080
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

672
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,200
but you're going to have
to accept it, tinker boy.

673
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,560
I like Wincanton.

674
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,320
It's a grand old racecourse.

675
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,840
And that brother of yours,

676
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,600
the one who left me a hand grenade...

677
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,080
...he'd be the first of you tinkers
I'd go for if our truce should end

678
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,560
and the whistle blew.

679
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,440
Good. He's in the mood for a quarrel.

680
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,080
- We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.
- Yeah, I heard.

681
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Yeah. Fun night. Got noisy, though.

682
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,120
And to think they all said I was mad
to take me dad with me, eh?

683
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,400
Your dad? Who's your dad?

684
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,800
This is my fucking dad.

685
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,840
Right here.

686
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,520
This is my fucking dad.

687
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,960
Where's Aberama?

688
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,120
He got off at Solihull.

689
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,360
Said if he sees Billy Boy here...

690
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,480
...he'll cut his fucking throat.

691
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Tell the tinker

692
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,800
he's welcome to come and try it
any time.

693
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,200
Mm.

694
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,480
Is it all aboard?

695
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,480
Yeah.

696
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,840
It's all there.

697
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,480
We weighed it at the wharf.

698
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,920
We used cockney scales.

699
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,080
I wouldn't trust 'em.
They're probably crooked.

700
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,000
- But, er, I reckon seven tons.
- Curly?

701
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,360
Put ten sacks of flour

702
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,280
- onto Mr McCavern's boat.
- Tom!

703
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,760
I-I don't think it's really flour.

704
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,160
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.

705
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

706
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,800
Curly?

707
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,000
Hey, Arthur?

708
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,520
Someday, yes?

709
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,920
You and me.

710
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,600
Oh, Tommy, hey?

711
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,280
Fascists, hmm?

712
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,080
Look at 'em.

713
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,320
I fucking hate 'em. Always have done.

714
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,520
But you...

715
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,000
You, Billy Boy...

716
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,480
...oh, you're special.
Y'know, I fucking like him, Tommy.

717
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,480
I like yer.

718
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,360
I do. You're a man after me own heart.

719
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,520
- Someday, Mr Shelby.
- Yeah.

720
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,760
- Someday.
- Yeah.

721
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,960
Yeah.

722
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,000
You just tell me when, Tom.

723
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,520
You just tell me when.

724
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,960
So, er...

725
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,160
- ...so you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?
- Yeah.

726
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,640
Barney Thomason...

727
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,560
...is gonna kill...

728
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,880
...Oswald Mosley,
shoot him in the fucking head.

729
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,200
Yep.

730
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,000
While he's on stage.

731
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,880
While I'm stood next to him.

732
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,280
And then I will take over
as leader of the party...

733
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,720
...and you and Aberama can take care
of that bastard McCavern.

734
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,120
I had more complicated strategies in mind
for Mr Mosley.

735
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,280
Then he spoke badly

736
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,760
to my wife.

737
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,640
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

738
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,960
Yeah.

739
00:54:53,984 --> 00:54:58,984
