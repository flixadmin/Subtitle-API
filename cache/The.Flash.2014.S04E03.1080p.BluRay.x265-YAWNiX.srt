00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,127
The Flash is back!

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,622
<i>How did you get your powers?</i>

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:07,793
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

5
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,132
And do you too wanna know
the best part?

6
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,876
I wasn't the only one.

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,253
- Iris West, will you marry me?
- Yes.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,012
- This isn't goodbye.
- No.

9
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,134
<i>Will I see you later?</i>

10
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,638
He's right where you wanted him.
What do we do now?

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,761
We find the others.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,363
Begin recording.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,442
Observations on subject number two.

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,823
Name, Rebecca Sharpe,

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,404
<i>or as she prefers...</i>

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,119
<i>- The plebeian sobriquet Becky.
- Hey, I'm Becky.</i>

17
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,998
It's Becky with a "Y,"
not an "I-E" or an "E-E."

18
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,172
Just "Y." And you heard me
say no milk, right?

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,667
'Cause I am
severely lactose intolerant, like...

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,678
Subject was born in Sarasota, Florida.

21
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>The first indignity in a life
full of unfortunate circumstances.</i>

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,980
That is definitely not soy.

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,522
Subject lives with her boyfriend.

24
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,572
Almost there, almost there,
almost there!

25
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,322
Kenny!

26
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,784
We are going to deal with this
in five to 10 minutes!

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,039
<i>Correction.</i>

28
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,335
Subject previously lived
with her boyfriend.

29
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,460
<i>Subject's occupation,
blackjack dealer.</i>

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,638
Or should I hit?

31
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,090
Subject's temperament.

32
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,926
I don't know, man, I think
you should just hit. Why don't you hit?

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,010
Defeatist.

34
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,475
- Okay, I'll hit.
- Great. Perfect.

35
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,352
- And...
- Twenty-one!

36
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,479
It is here.

37
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,105
Oh, wow.

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,480
- Here you go, sir, congratulations.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

39
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,655
- Here you go.
- Sure.

40
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,280
Oh, that's nice, thank you.

41
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,868
- Looks like I found my good luck charm.
- Hey!

42
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,822
My appletini!

43
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,703
Oh, no, oh, no.

44
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,162
Can I maybe just get
a reference, you think?

45
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,416
No?

46
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,543
Subject believes
no matter what she does,

47
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,751
the universe will conspire
to punish her.

48
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,298
Another job... Ow!

49
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,468
<i>Or as she writes
on her Myspace page,</i>

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,761
"I am jinxed."

51
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,225
Great! There goes another car!

52
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,359
It's okay, I'm fine.

53
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:42,569
Subject's low self-esteem suggests
she will be easily manipulated.

54
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,825
Wait! Wait!

55
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,946
Ow!

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,121
Wait! Wait! Wait!

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,462
Come on! I'm here!

58
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,091
Hey! Yes, thank you, universe!

59
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,920
Finally, some good luck! Hi!

60
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,421
Okay.

61
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,465
Barry!

62
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,222
- Where are you?
<i>- I don't know!</i>

63
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,436
I lost Caitlin.
There's too many of them, man.

64
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,685
No, you can take them.
Just listen to me.

65
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,770
You just need to do one thing.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,186
Run, Barry. Run!

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,110
Come on!

68
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,863
They got me.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,536
You have failed this city.

70
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,084
For real, Chad? In the back?

71
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,634
Suck it, old man.

72
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,878
Oh...

73
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,965
Wait, did you guys die already?

74
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,301
- Well, Chad...
- He just told us...

75
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,470
Come on. Come on.

76
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,684
I don't know what's wrong with kids
these days. You're churlish.

77
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,317
You better watch yourself, Chad.

78
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,564
Come at me at the paintball field
next time, I'll kick your little a...

79
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,407
<i>Mrs. McConell, how are you doing?</i>

80
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,569
Chad's a treasure, he really is.

81
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,823
Pretzel for Caitlin...

82
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,281
Corndog for Iris.
Two franks for Cisco.

83
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,364
Yes, thank you.

84
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,335
Three burgers, five churros
and six funnel cakes for Barry.

85
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,123
Look at all of this junk.
Guys, I'm really sorry.

86
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,841
If the pipes in the house weren't
making this weird, annoying sound,

87
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,920
I would have just actually
had you all over for dinner.

88
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,130
Squeaky pipes at the West house,
what a surprise.

89
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,678
Really? You're familiar with this sound?

90
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,634
Oh, yeah, you mean the...

91
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,932
- Yeah.
- It's been doing that for 18 years?

92
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,235
Every house has a personality,
ours just likes to be heard.

93
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,824
Oh, my gosh, they broke up.
The Wexler-Waclawiks broke up.

94
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,900
- For real?
- Yes.

95
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,201
- Hell, yeah!
- Yes!

96
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,616
Who are the Wexler-Wa-claws-wilix,

97
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,413
and why are we happy
that their love is dead?

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,287
They are a couple that were
getting married at the Propizio

99
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,165
the weekend of the second,
which means now the venue is open.

100
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,621
That's amazing. What good luck.

101
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,956
Yeah, so, now, we just
have to put a deposit down.

102
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,837
- I'll run it over.
- No, already covered, babe.

103
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:44,917
Oh.

104
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,175
Oh, God. Breach alert, guys.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

105
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,522
Uh...

106
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,198
Hey, Harry. Um, is Jesse not coming?

107
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,610
So, um...

108
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,574
I thought Jesse and I
were having date night.

109
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,577
Yeah, that's what you thought.

110
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,075
<i>Let me just...</i>

111
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,994
Okay.

112
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,883
Let's... Just let me...

113
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,179
- Okay, so...
<i>- Ahem. Hey, Wally, it's me.</i>

114
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,601
Good to see you.

115
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,180
<i>So, I've been doing
some thinking, and...</i>

116
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,355
<i>You know, we've both been so busy...</i>

117
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,281
Stupid hologram,
it's the darn Atlantean plastic.

118
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,784
It's really shoddy workmanship.

119
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,577
- Sorry about this.
- What is this thing?

120
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,450
Break... Breakup cube.

121
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,333
You don't have breakup cubes
on your Earth?

122
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,466
It's not good. Okay, okay.

123
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,341
A breakup cube is, uh...

124
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,140
Kind of what it sounds like.
You know,

125
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,094
you record a message
for the person you wanna...

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,938
The person,
and you pick a music setting,

127
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,732
and then there's...
A tissue pops out, if you need that.

128
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,854
You know, a breakup cube.

129
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,938
Jesse's breaking up with me
with a cube?

130
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,901
Seems like a really convenient way
to break somebody's heart.

131
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,443
Exactly.

132
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,362
What did she say in the message?

133
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,580
Well, you know, you heard.
"You're a great guy,"

134
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,908
I don't remember.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,498
- Don't you have total recall?
- Yeah. No, no.

136
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,002
Don't. I did, I don't.
I did, but I don't.

137
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,626
Come on, don't make me...

138
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,845
She... You heard. She said that
you are a great, great guy,

139
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,766
and that she was busy on our Earth
and that you're busy here,

140
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,308
filling in for, you know...

141
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,730
On this Earth. And she just felt that
you guys were a little out of sync.

142
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,974
You know? And that she needed some time

143
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,357
to work on her stuff, you know?
"It's not you, it's me."

144
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,359
Not me. "Her" me. Her.

145
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,575
Not me, her. And she said, you know,

146
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:19,201
"I'll never forget you, Wally West,
because you're amazing," and then...

147
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,370
That you were her first.

148
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,667
And a bunch of other stuff,
not important.

149
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,673
So, the heeds talk,
you don't need that, right?

150
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,842
You're a tough guy, right, West?

151
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,594
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,921
Yeah. Um...

153
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,305
Doesn't want a cube. I don't blame him.

154
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,769
211s at First National
and O'Sullivan Bank.

155
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,982
Could be a spree.

156
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,110
The Central City Bank's on
that avenue, too. I'll check it out.

157
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,120
- We're not done.
- What?

158
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,042
I'm sorry, I don't know why the app
crashed, but this one's on the house.

159
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,670
Oh.

160
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,842
Find a penny, pick it up,
then all day, you'll have good luck.

161
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,513
So true.

162
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,803
Good afternoon, ma'am.

163
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,265
It is a good afternoon,
Mr. Security Man.

164
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,873
Please, don't touch the oven, Mom.

165
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,897
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

166
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,394
Aw... You waited for me!

167
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,183
I see her.

168
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,313
She's getting away in a Prius.

169
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,112
Last time I checked,
the Flash is faster than a Prius.

170
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,866
Oh!

171
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,877
What the hell?

172
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,005
That's the least secure
security footage I've ever seen.

173
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,261
Yeah, that's not even
the strangest thing she made happen.

174
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,559
I mean,
I slipped on a barrel of marbles.

175
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,977
It was like I was in a cartoon.

176
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,304
That's some seriously bad luck.

177
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,063
Yeah, no such thing as luck.

178
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,982
Yeah? Tell that to my cousin, Hector.

179
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,734
He got jinxed by an ex,

180
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,445
hasn't been able to find
a mall parking spot for three years.

181
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,775
Hey, so, we ran the sketches you made
us through the CCPD database, and...

182
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,786
Her name's Becky Sharpe,
she's 24 years old.

183
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,329
- No priors.
- No priors?

184
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,747
Then why is she in the database?

185
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,083
Because in the last three years
she has lived in Central City,

186
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,207
she's been rear-ended four times,
her identity stolen twice.

187
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,789
A cat burglar literally burgled her cat.

188
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,750
Okay, you see, Harry,
that is bad juju.

189
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,003
Okay, Ramon, what you call juju,

190
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,759
I call quantum entanglement.

191
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,177
<i>Discrete quantum particles</i>

192
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,759
are connected and when triggered,
they simulate a synchronicity

193
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,767
that to the untrained eye, to the
common eye, could seem like luck.

194
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,400
So, if Becky can affect the particles
around her in a positive way,

195
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,727
then their connected particles
start spinning negatively.

196
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,526
So, when good things happen to her,
bad things happen all around her.

197
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,448
Great, she's got a good luck field.

198
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,486
- She's a meta.
- Well, except, she can't be,

199
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,445
I mean, she's only been in
Central City for three years.

200
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,662
Yeah, so,
there's no way she was affected

201
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,115
by the particle accelerator explosion.

202
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,833
Well, neither was Kilg%re.
We saw firsthand what he could do.

203
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,373
Not to sound like a broken record,

204
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,580
but where the hell are
all these new metas coming from?

205
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,249
You know what, maybe the scanners
in the suit picked something up.

206
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,004
You said you took all the tech out.

207
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,552
Okay, well, I left something in.
Okay? Sue me.

208
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,172
Cecile needs me at the house.

209
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,632
You guys let me know
what you find out, all right?

210
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,716
All right.

211
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,769
- There.
- Yeah, I see it, okay.

212
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,973
The suit definitely registered trace
amounts of dark matter on Becky.

213
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,603
So, if there was another
dark matter incident...

214
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,356
We need to figure out how and where
it happened, ASAP.

215
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,405
I'll calibrate your satellite to scan
for the same dark matter in the suit.

216
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,948
- No, you won't.
<i>- Yeah, I will.</i>

217
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,152
- Don't touch the satellite. Don't...
<i>- I'll be touching it.</i>

218
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,414
Oh, something just arrived for me
at the loft. I gotta go.

219
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,038
What?

220
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,330
<i>You called the plumber?</i>

221
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,250
Joe West, I cannot keep
living with that sound.

222
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,923
You know, this house is, uh...

223
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,134
- Bitchin'?
- No. It's in need of some work.

224
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,433
In my certified opinion,
you need all new piping.

225
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,603
It'll set you back $15 thou.

226
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,180
Mmm.

227
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,142
Okay. Thank you so much.

228
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:03,235
You've given us a lot to think about.
And I mean a whole lot.

229
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,656
Fifteen thousand.

230
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,580
My great uncle paid less
for this whole place.

231
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,582
I guess I'm gonna have to break open
the piggy bank.

232
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,796
Or, you know,
we could take that fifteen,

233
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,214
we could put it towards
a down payment on something new.

234
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,043
Ooh...

235
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,218
You're suggesting that
we sell my house?

236
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,550
Babe, I'm just saying,
you know, this is...

237
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,720
This is a really big place for
a couple of empty nesters like us,

238
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,897
and there's always gonna be something
that's gonna need replacing.

239
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,148
Let me think about it, okay?

240
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,063
- Think about it.
- Think about it.

241
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,947
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

242
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,623
Barry! Oh, my God, turn around!

243
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,794
- I did.
- Did you see?

244
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,088
- No, I didn't see!
- You saw!

245
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,757
I did see, but just for a second.

246
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,176
Which is like an eternity
for a speedster.

247
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,929
You know it's bad luck to see a bride
in her dress before the wedding day.

248
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,423
Too late.

249
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,969
- What happened?
- The Propizio called.

250
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,063
We're not gonna be able to
have our wedding there.

251
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,598
What? Why?

252
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,191
Well, the villa burned down,

253
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,396
I guess a crème brûlée competition
got a little heated.

254
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,651
Okay, well, thankfully,
we have our backup.

255
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,488
No, another couple booked it
this morning.

256
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,783
It's okay, though, it's okay.

257
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,711
If we can stop evil,
time-traveling speedsters

258
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,039
from destroying the planet,
we can find a wedding venue.

259
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,919
Barry, our wedding is in six weeks!

260
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,966
It'll work out, okay?

261
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,296
I would marry you anytime, anywhere.

262
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,315
Kobe beef, my favorite.

263
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,653
Becky! What are the chances
I'd run into you?

264
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,981
Is this your secretary?

265
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,233
Funny, you said she was haggard.

266
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,444
- No, I never said that.
- Let me get that for you.

267
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,702
I don't understand.
Your plan revolves around this dolt?

268
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,254
<i>Who makes soup so hot?</i>

269
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,426
As lusterless as Rebecca is, she may
be the most formidable of them all.

270
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,378
Then why don't we get her now?

271
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,674
The capricious nature of her powers
warrants further observation.

272
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,065
<i>Oh, man, are those live lobsters?</i>

273
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,231
- Gimme that.
- Stop hovering, okay?

274
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,062
- You're not holding it...
- I know how to read a dark matter...

275
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,194
- Not from where I see, you don't.
- Oh, yeah, good one.

276
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,365
Don't you have
somewhere else to be? Like,

277
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,863
maybe breaking
another speedster's heart?

278
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,660
- Have one...
- Sorry I'm late.

279
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,409
Iris and I just lost two wedding
venues in less than 24 hours.

280
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,991
- Bad juju.
- Gimme that, okay?

281
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,001
It's more of a test. All right.

282
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,919
Here we go and adjust...

283
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,791
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

284
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,376
Here. Right here.

285
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,844
This was where Becky Sharpe
was exposed to dark matter.

286
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,301
- Here?
- Yes.

287
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,848
It can't be,
this is the middle of the street.

288
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,470
- It's not even an intersection.
- My scans are accurate.

289
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,893
- My scans are accurate.
- Accurate?

290
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,686
Explain how there's nothing
within miles of here

291
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,809
capable of even creating dark matter.

292
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,436
There was three weeks ago.

293
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,065
<i>This is where I came out
of the Speed Force.</i>

294
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,364
No, it isn't.
You came out in Ivy City.

295
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,660
No, I ran there after. I remember
now, this is where I came out.

296
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,033
This is where the portal opened.

297
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,291
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

298
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,493
I can only imagine
how many meta-humans you created.

299
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,291
My best guess...

300
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,543
A busload.

301
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,729
We did it? We brought dark matter
into Central City?

302
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,730
When you pulled me out
of the Speed Force, yeah.

303
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,612
All the people on that bus,
we turned them into metas.

304
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,987
Every time we try to do something
right, it goes horribly wrong.

305
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,067
We're cursed.

306
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,239
Maybe we should burn some sage.

307
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,411
Guys, we're not cursed.

308
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,789
You're not cursed.
You should be cursed at.

309
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,621
Okay, why should we be "cursed at"?

310
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,952
You should be cursed at
because you opened the Speed Force

311
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,503
- without consulting me.
- Okay, I don't think we need to...

312
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,747
All right.

313
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,457
Okay, I did consult you,
and you were the one

314
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,759
who gave me the calculations
in the first place.

315
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,460
I told you not to use them
without consulting me.

316
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,217
I said, Ramon,
don't use the calculations

317
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,763
- without consulting me!
- Guys!

318
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,265
I heard you,
I didn't see the need for that.

319
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,259
<i>And that's why
you should be cursed at.</i>

320
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,436
- What does that even mean?
- What does that mean? It means...

321
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,684
Okay, you know what, this is
exactly why we didn't contact you.

322
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,855
'Cause the last thing
we need around here

323
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,774
is more of your salty-ass attitude!

324
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,318
If you don't need my salty attitude,
maybe you should carry on without me.

325
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,317
- I'll let myself out.
- You're going back to your Earth?

326
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,239
- I'll breach you there right now.
- "I'll breach you there right now!"

327
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,400
That's not what I sound like.

328
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,285
That was really high.

329
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,658
Listen, Cisco,
I know Harry could stand to work

330
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,365
- on his bedside manner, but...
- You know what, we don't need him.

331
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,627
What we need is to focus
on catching this meta, am I right?

332
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,703
Yeah, you're right.

333
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,629
But Becky doesn't seem like
one of our typical villains.

334
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,880
I think if we could track her down,
maybe we could get through to her.

335
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,967
Hey, Cecile.

336
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,296
What?

337
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,672
I'm on my way.

338
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,717
I need you to run me to the house.

339
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,144
- You said you...
- I need you to run me to the house.

340
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,304
Yes, sir.

341
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,932
Ah...

342
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,893
What happened?

343
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,699
The ceiling went
from clanking to howling, and then

344
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,910
it just started pouring
all of this stuff down.

345
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,989
- We need to turn the water off, stat.
- Yeah.

346
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,956
So, the water valve
is in the crawl space. Um...

347
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,204
Don't ever go into the crawl space.

348
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,124
I hear you, loud and clear.

349
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,502
Barry, thank you very much
for your help.

350
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,424
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

351
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,216
Man, why is this happening?

352
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,351
- Did that girl jinx us?
- No.

353
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,600
No. Nobody jinxed us.
This house is just...

354
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,231
- What's another word for old?
- Vintage.

355
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,019
- Vintage.
- Cecile thinks I should sell it.

356
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,989
Yeah, what do you think?

357
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,449
I think she's got a point.

358
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,283
Life would be a hell of a lot easier
in a brand-new house.

359
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,826
Sounds like an easy decision.

360
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,033
It should be, but...

361
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,621
This house has got one thing
no other house will ever have.

362
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,963
Remember I measured you kids
every birthday?

363
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,888
Yeah, I outgrew Iris at 12.
She kept saying she'd catch up.

364
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,181
All of my memories of you kids
are tied into these walls.

365
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,186
- How can I give that up?
- You don't have to give that up, Joe.

366
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,309
You'll always have those memories
no matter where you live.

367
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,398
<i>Trust me.</i>

368
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,277
When I came to live here
after my mom died, I learned that

369
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,324
it doesn't matter where you live.

370
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,447
It only matters
that you have people that love you.

371
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,286
Hold on. What's up?

372
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,203
Great. Okay. I'll go there now.
Thank you.

373
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,084
We're not jinxed. If we were,
Cisco wouldn't have found Becky.

374
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,291
She's at Jitters, I'm going there now.

375
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,013
Winner, winner.
Another winner.

376
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,224
Becky? Hi, do you mind if I sit here?

377
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,150
Oh, today's my lucky day,
but you're not my type at all.

378
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,309
Can I sit?

379
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,645
Um...

380
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,948
Becky, you're probably wondering
how I know your name.

381
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,201
Mmm... It's written on my cup.

382
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,954
Right. Um...

383
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,326
But that's not how I... You see,
I work for the CCPD as a CSI.

384
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,546
I investigate very special people.

385
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,839
Celebrities?

386
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,680
No, not celebrities. Meta-humans,
which is what I think you are.

387
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,307
See, I think
you were exposed to dark matter

388
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,135
on a city bus three weeks ago.

389
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:18,768
I think I would know if I was
exposed to dark matter. That's weird.

390
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,365
Becky, I know, you've been having
a lot of luck lately.

391
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,318
And that you took some money
from the Central City Bank

392
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,778
that doesn't belong to you.

393
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,455
- How do you know all that?
- I just do.

394
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,167
Look, getting powers is overwhelming.

395
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,955
I'm sure you don't know how they work
or what you should do with them.

396
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,710
I have some idea.

397
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,709
Uh-uh-uh.

398
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,011
Do you really wanna test your luck?

399
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,219
Bad things happen to people
that get in my way.

400
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,900
Listen, CSI guy.

401
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:07,942
My entire life has been one piece
of crummy luck after the next.

402
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,902
Look, we all have ups and downs in life.

403
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,329
No, not Becky Sharpe.
I have only ever been dealt bad hands.

404
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:21,251
But I knew one day, the universe
would see it made a mistake.

405
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,091
And then I'd have the run of the table.

406
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:30,715
I got on that bus and Lady Luck
smiled on me.

407
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,310
Becky, this isn't some higher power
fixing a miscalculation.

408
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:39,106
You have powers and they're affecting
everyone around you,

409
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,649
making them feel as awful
as you used to feel.

410
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:47,698
I'm sorry about that.
But maybe it's just their turn.

411
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,944
Maybe for once, everyone else
can feel for a second,

412
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,869
how bad I felt my entire life.

413
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,460
Anyway, there is nothing you can do

414
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,411
to stop me.

415
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,672
<i>Toodles.</i>

416
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,269
<i>So, what are we gonna do?</i>

417
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,021
I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure yet.

418
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,524
I can't get close enough to her
without triggering bad luck.

419
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,325
Seriously, that girl's a hazard.

420
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,367
Hazard. That's the one.
Maybe that means the jinx is gone.

421
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,832
Her powers only work
in her immediate vicinity.

422
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,909
She didn't jinx us.

423
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,537
And the house
is still falling to pieces.

424
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,833
It's been falling apart for years,
just like, really slowly.

425
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,546
Plus, Jesse dumped me, too.

426
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,678
I know, dude. And, you know, that sucks.

427
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,927
And we're up against a meta
we can't even touch,

428
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,758
and we're the ones
who made her in the first place.

429
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,095
Guys, do you have any idea
how ridiculous you all sound?

430
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,806
We have not been jinxed,
or cursed, all right?

431
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,517
We make our own luck, right?

432
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,403
So, what do you say we focus,
and we figure this out?

433
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,616
Hey, Iris, you're where?

434
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,955
- Oh, come on. Hey.
- Hey.

435
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,296
Why did you want me to put on a shirt
and meet you at a funeral?

436
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,248
No, no, I wanted you
to meet me at this church.

437
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,458
- What?
- We're getting married.

438
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,792
Here, put this on.

439
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,967
- Excuse me?
- Barry,

440
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,462
we've had the worst luck, okay?

441
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,674
From the Dominators and Savitar,
to gorillas, and now, these bus metas.

442
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,927
And on top of everything else,
now, we're cursed.

443
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,101
Iris, we're not cursed.

444
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,475
Barry, look, you said that
you would marry me

445
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,181
- anytime, anywhere.
- Well, this is...

446
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,359
And I just feel if we don't get
married now, it's never gonna happen.

447
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,936
That's not true, okay? I mean...

448
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,063
Oh. Our turn. Our turn.
Go, go, go.

449
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,815
Sorry.

450
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,861
- Sorry.
- Excuse me. Beautiful service.

451
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,949
- So sorry.
- I love this coffin...

452
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,496
Hey, that's...

453
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,200
- Hi.
- Hello.

454
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,330
Can I help you?

455
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,835
- Ah, yes, we would like to get married.
- Yes, we would.

456
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,086
- Right now.
- Oh.

457
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,010
Would you give us a moment
to reset the altar?

458
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,802
Oh, no, no, that won't be necessary.
Look, we'll just... Watch. Watch.

459
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,097
Hey? Okay.

460
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,474
She's excited, sorry.

461
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,472
Flip that around.

462
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,686
- Yes.
- You shouldn't have done that.

463
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,017
I know, it's fine.

464
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,484
Okay.
We are here today to join...

465
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,940
Um...

466
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,526
- That's you.
- Me? Bartholomew Henry Allen.

467
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,115
- And...
- Iris Ann West.

468
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,867
...in holy matrimony.

469
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,624
- Excuse me.
- You okay?

470
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,000
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

471
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,509
Kevin, did you use
the cinnamon incense?

472
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,428
You know he's allergic to it.

473
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,840
Shame on you!

474
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,970
- No need to shame the little boy.
- No, you're fine.

475
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,053
You're fine. Walk it off, Father.

476
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,597
It's fine.

477
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,559
- That did not just happen.
- You know, it was a...

478
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,195
- Very nice funeral.
- Really, Barry?

479
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,246
That was golden!

480
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,462
Don't shoot, okay?
I'm here to apologize.

481
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,845
I know you're trying to help us
fix our own colossal screw up.

482
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,093
- Yeah, like always.
- Yeah, I know.

483
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,640
I mean, I actually thought
you'd be at home by now,

484
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,183
but here you are, working away.

485
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:49,557
Well, things are a little complicated
on Earth-2.

486
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,023
Huh.

487
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,934
- Everything okay with Jesse?
- Yes.

488
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,736
I mean, yes. If you must know,

489
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:59,863
I spent the summer assembling
a support staff for her, so...

490
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,825
- Oh, like Team Quick.
- No.

491
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,285
- Team Jesse.
- No.

492
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,988
- Jesse and the Quicksters?
- They're not called that.

493
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,493
Well, they should be, that
sounds like an awesome team.

494
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,370
It is an awesome team
because I assembled it.

495
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,745
But then Jesse goes
and kicks me off the team, all right?

496
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,004
Apparently, I'm too much like me,
whatever that means.

497
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:20,303
I push too hard, you know? Too many
tests, too many training sessions.

498
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,007
And I don't allow the team enough
time for their personal bonding.

499
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,764
I don't understand Millennials.
Anyway, they took a vote.

500
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,096
I'm out. I don't even have
a home to return to now.

501
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,523
I can't even go back
to my own Earth.

502
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,771
I'm sure you can empathize,
right, Ramon?

503
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,276
'Cause you know what I'm like. Well,
you know what? We'll handle Sharpe.

504
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,031
And then I'll be out of your hair.

505
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,952
Guys, there are low probability
events happening all over the city.

506
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,459
- Becky's quantum field is expanding.
- Okay, that's not possible.

507
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,791
- Yeah, no, her powers were localized.
- Not anymore.

508
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,926
Babe, you in there?
The door's jammed.

509
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,474
One sec!

510
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,392
Guys, the quantum field
is getting higher.

511
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,108
My boss said you were
bad luck, sir, but I figured

512
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,033
what are the odds a pilot has
a goose fly into his engine twice?

513
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,034
Bird strike!

514
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,410
Mayday.

515
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,417
<i>This is Flight 512 to tower. We lost
an engine and are coming down.</i>

516
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,044
When did Hazard get so powerful?

517
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,966
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction. So...

518
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,466
The more good luck she experiences,
the more bad luck she spreads.

519
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,592
She must be experiencing
an extreme level of good luck

520
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,344
for her quantum field
to be expanding like this.

521
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,268
- Where is she now?
- She went back to work.

522
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,057
Snake eyes!
For the 37th time.

523
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,942
Bringing your winnings to

524
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,146
- $1.2 million!
- ...million!

525
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,151
Give me those things.

526
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,985
Hi. Okay, here we go.

527
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,070
Come on, mama!

528
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,290
Guys, if Becky keeps winning,
then bad luck will keep spreading.

529
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,412
This could destroy the whole city.

530
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,913
- Okay, keep calm, all right?
- Okay, keep calm.

531
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,460
Nothing's going wrong here.

532
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,832
Guys, the particle accelerator
turned back on.

533
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,085
It's gonna explode.

534
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,013
Four minutes
to particle accelerator activation.

535
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,140
<i>Harry, Cisco, status report?</i>

536
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,267
Generators turned themselves on,
we gotta shut 'em down.

537
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,976
Flight 512 to tower,
we're attempting a water landing.

538
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,352
Cecile!

539
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,271
Damn it.

540
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,279
Barry, you've gotta find Hazard.

541
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,492
<i>I'm almost at the casino.</i>

542
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,244
Hazard's quantum field is increasing.

543
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,324
How much worse can it get?

544
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,668
Hello, my old friend.

545
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,416
Let's keep this winning streak
going, shall we?

546
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,214
Yes. Okay, cherry. Here we go, cherry.

547
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,392
Cherry, cherry, cherry,
cherry, cherry, cherry.

548
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,137
Cherry. Cherry! Cherry,
it's a cherry.

549
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,980
Gimme two, gimme two.

550
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,934
Cherry, cherry, cherry,
cherry, cherry, cherry.

551
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,862
How is that even possible?

552
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,277
Wait, no!

553
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,077
Starboard's fan blade
is just disintegrated.

554
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,332
We're not gonna make it to the water.

555
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,538
- Barry, what happened?
<i>- Well...</i>

556
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,045
She's playing the slots
and I cuffed myself.

557
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,752
- Oh, honey.
- I know. We need to get 'em off.

558
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,633
<i>They're dampening my powers.</i>

559
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,089
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying.

560
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,140
Hydrogen particle hatch.

561
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,633
<i>We need to seal it.</i>

562
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,013
Here we go.

563
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,440
Cherry, bang bang.
Cherry, bang bang. Cherry!

564
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,394
Cherry, bang bang, cherry.
Cherry, bang bang.

565
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,604
There's two cherries.

566
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,235
- Come on.
- Hey, look, it's the Flash!

567
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,575
No, hey, there's no fire.
It's not a fire!

568
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,902
Someone set off the alarm! Calm down!

569
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,705
- Babe, you okay?
- I think so.

570
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,116
Damn it, out back.

571
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,577
- Out back. Be careful.
- Okay. Okay.

572
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,206
<i>- One minute to activation.</i>
- Got it.

573
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,249
- Nope, don't got it.
- That just opened the electron hatch.

574
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,879
Yes, I am on fire, I know.

575
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,843
There's no fire!

576
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,219
Come on, cherry, pop.

577
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,972
Cherry, pop, cherry.
Cherry, pop, cherry.

578
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,226
Damn!

579
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,326
Barry, I can't get the cuffs off.

580
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,696
Yeah, well, now, we have a sign
to get off of me, too.

581
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,282
Cherry number three.
Pop, cherry, pop.

582
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,537
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

583
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,374
<i>Thirty seconds to activation.</i>

584
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,417
Nope, nope.

585
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,511
- What're you doing? Come on.
- Wait, wait.

586
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,754
- Let it go.
- What?

587
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,093
- Let the accelerator turn on.
- Harry!

588
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,096
Let the accelerator turn on.
Trust me.

589
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,302
Ten seconds to activation.

590
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,604
This is it. Last one!

591
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,728
<i>Five, four,</i>

592
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,522
three, two.

593
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,395
Here we go.

594
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:36,865
<i>Cherry, pop, cherry!</i>

595
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,786
No. What? Star?

596
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,130
No, I don't understand. I lost?

597
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,883
The starboard thrusters are alive.
We're gonna make it.

598
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,380
Good.

599
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,469
What just happened?

600
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,228
The hydrogen electron collision
released a charge

601
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,986
that temporarily negated
Hazard's quantum field.

602
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,783
We did it.

603
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,151
You did it.

604
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,658
How did you know to do that?

605
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,706
Lucky guess.

606
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,631
Okay.

607
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,050
- Hi. Um...
- Hi.

608
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,880
Is there, like, any chance that
you're not gonna arrest me?

609
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:39,970
No?

610
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,972
- I understand. Sure.
- Come on.

611
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,852
- Okay.
- Okay.

612
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,266
- Right this way.
- Yep.

613
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,822
Ramon.

614
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,669
I owe you an apology.

615
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,499
Okay.

616
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,294
- That was it.
- Okay, all right.

617
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,879
How about something like...

618
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,641
"I am sorry for blaming
everything on you"?

619
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,303
Or, "I am sorry for 'cursing' at you."

620
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,189
Yep, that's good.

621
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,226
That's good. That.
Pretend I said that.

622
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,938
Guess I'll take it where I can get it.

623
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,439
All right, good talk.

624
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,945
<i>- Hey?</i>
- Hmm.

625
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,780
You don't have to go back to Earth-2.

626
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,571
What?

627
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,323
You saved the day.

628
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,042
That's your get-out-of-jackass-jail
free card.

629
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,286
Plus, you're family.

630
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:52,997
You'll always have a home here.

631
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,626
Thank you...

632
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,926
I appreciate the sentiment,
it's just that...

633
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,684
- This is not my world.
- Oh, and Earth-2 is?

634
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,095
<i>Did you make a bunch of friends
there that I don't know about?</i>

635
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,024
Are they all tall, brooding dudes
with bad haircuts?

636
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,851
I have...

637
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,608
I have colleagues.

638
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,063
<i>Work colleagues.</i>

639
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,734
And some of them, I don't dislike.

640
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,663
Exactly my point. You've spent
so much time worrying about Jesse

641
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,741
and talking to dead people,

642
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,996
that you never even stopped
to make a life for yourself.

643
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,834
Wait a second, Ramon, are you
literally saying I don't have a life?

644
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,462
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You don't have a life.

645
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,886
But you can make one.

646
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,173
With us, right here. We'll help you.

647
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,261
'Cause God knows
you're gonna need that help.

648
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,564
- No, I don't think so.
- I don't think so, either.

649
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,659
Becky is locked up in the meta wing
at Iron Heights.

650
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,283
Something tells me our bad luck
streak has come to an end.

651
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,831
Good. We can't afford
to blow this place up a third time.

652
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:13,248
So, look at these heat scans taken
from the satellite three weeks ago.

653
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,920
<i>That's the Central City bus.</i>

654
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,506
- That's the bus?
- That's the bus.

655
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,879
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

656
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,045
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

657
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,550
Now that we know how many there are,

658
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,848
we won't have to wait for them
to come to us.

659
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,134
- We can go right to them.
- Well, two down.

660
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,844
Yep, we got this.

661
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,845
Yeah, you do.

662
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,849
What's wrong, Wally?

663
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,898
You guys tell me. I mean,
the city was about to blow up,

664
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,157
no one realized I wasn't here?

665
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,614
Where did you go, Wall?

666
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,865
I went to Earth-2, I had to talk
to Jesse, hear it from her.

667
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:54,001
She told me she needs to focus
on herself, and I get it.

668
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,629
<i>And I think I have to do
the same, right?</i>

669
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,420
So, I'm leaving Central City.

670
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,589
Where are you going?

671
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,387
I'm gonna go stay with a friend
in Blue Valley for a while.

672
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,062
Every hero has their own journey.

673
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,107
If yours is taking you on a new path,
you owe it to yourself to go.

674
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,685
Yeah.

675
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,034
Good luck.

676
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,654
Kid Flash.

677
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,333
I don't want anything more

678
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,920
<i>than for you to find
what you're looking for.</i>

679
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,099
But I've spent so much time

680
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,347
without you in my life.

681
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,558
I don't wanna lose you.

682
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,646
You'll never lose me, Dad.

683
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,857
Plus, I'm a speedster.
You need me and I'll come running.

684
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,030
I love you, son.

685
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,736
Yeah. Love you.

686
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,496
You sure?

687
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,707
Yeah.

688
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,963
Well, don't forget, Central City
will always be the home of Kid Flash.

689
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,839
I won't.

690
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,930
- Don't be a stranger.
- No.

691
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,729
- I love you.
- I love you more.

692
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,433
Okay.

693
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,787
West leaves.

694
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,454
Allen returns, West leaves.
Move, counter-move.

695
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,623
- What's your point?
- Simply that

696
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,539
a mysterious stranger comes to town

697
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,291
to seek out the Flash...

698
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,547
Causes us to open the Speed Force.

699
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,254
Which causes the creation
of a dozen new metas.

700
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,338
Right.

701
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,425
Hold on, you think the guy
behind the samurai robot...

702
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,509
Samuroid.

703
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,601
You think he wanted us to create
a busload of metas?

704
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,272
I think it's all connected.

705
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,351
Why would anyone wanna create metas?

706
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,560
I don't know.

707
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,443
Whoever they are, they've got
a seriously warped way of thinking.

708
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,532
They identified the targets
sooner than we planned.

709
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,991
Perhaps they're smarter
than you gave them credit.

710
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,204
Perhaps.

711
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,168
But I'm smarter.

712
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,606
Oh!

713
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,484
Just when I thought it was safe
to get back in the house.

714
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:13,067
Hey. I may not be a craftsman expert
such as yourself,

715
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,369
but I can handle plastering
a couple of holes in the wall.

716
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,288
Babe, you don't have to do this.

717
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,288
This is our home and it is
a disaster zone right now,

718
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,916
so, I'm doing my part to fix it up.

719
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,248
Oh... I appreciate that.

720
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,178
But, you know, Cecile...

721
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,098
- You were right.
- Hmm?

722
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,681
It's time for me to let this place go.

723
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,771
I... It took me a minute to get there,

724
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,770
I'm not good with change,
you know that, but once I did,

725
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,521
I realized that whatever house
I'm in with you,

726
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm gonna love.

727
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,279
So, we might as well get one
with a dishwasher,

728
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,952
and a Jacuzzi.

729
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,405
Jacuzzi.

730
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,998
Oh...

731
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,999
- I love you.
- I love you.

732
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,673
- Funny thing, babe.
- Hmm?

733
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,760
I've actually had a change of heart.

734
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,638
- What?
- Hmm.

735
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,220
You wanna stay?

736
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,850
- Really?
- Yeah.

737
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:28,059
You told me that you couldn't have
asked for a better place

738
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,235
to raise your kids and

739
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,731
it made me look at this house
with new eyes.

740
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,076
Especially after I found out...

741
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,410
Joe...

742
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,667
I'm pregnant.

743
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,877
Joe?

744
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,180
Joe?

745
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:07,204
