The Pripyat River,

152
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,510
which feeds into the Dnieper.

153
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,150
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

not to mention crops and livestock,

155
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,150
would be... unusable.

156
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,090
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

157
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,190
to lower to core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

I'm told that we will need...

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,450
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

190
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,120
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

191
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,430
At the levels some of them were exposed?

192
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,330
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

This is followed by a latency period.

Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

201
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,460
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

202
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,270
the organs and soft
tissue begin to decompose.

203
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,370
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

204
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,910
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

205

206
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,850

Well, we've...

We've gotten a steady
dose, but not as much of it.

211
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,440
Not strong enough to kill the cells,

212
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,540
but consistent enough to damage our DNA.

213
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,240
So, in time... cancer.

214
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,550
Or aplastic anemia. Either way, fatal.

215

Of course they've been
here the whole time.

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,750
Do these work?

359
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,620
To an extent.

360
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,830
Of course.

361
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,810
So what's the job?

362
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,610
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

363
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,780
underneath this concrete pad.

364
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,780
There's no way to approach from
the interior of the building,

365
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,290
so you have to get at
it from underground.

366
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,790
- And what's above the pad?
- The core of the nuclear reactor,

367
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,830
which is melting down.

368
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,460
What? Like...

369
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,230
Essentially.

370
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

371
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,470
Not if you're done within six weeks.

372
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,340
Dimensions?

373
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Break ground here,

374
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,610
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

375
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,850
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

376
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,580
for the heat exchanger.

377
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,790
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

378
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,720
you can't use any heavy machinery.

379
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,190
It has to be done by hand.

380
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,560
Then I need more men.

381
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,400
Four hundred at least.

382
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,030
We'll have to work around the clock.

383
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,940
How deep do you want
this tunnel? Six meters?

384
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,970
- Twelve.
- Twelve? Why?

385
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,540
For your protection.

386
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,450
At that depth, you'll be shielded
from much of the radiation.

387
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,780
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,920
No.

Now, I'm afraid, a long war must begin.

588
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,740
There is an enormous
amount of radioactive debris

589
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,940
and contamination
spread out across a zone

590
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,470
of approximately 2600 square kilometers.

591
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,940
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

592
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,120
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

593
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,050
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

594
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,090
whether domesticated or wild,

595
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,100
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

596
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,530
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

597
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,040
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

598
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,610
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

599
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,880
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

600
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,650
which will be carried by the
wind and the rain if left exposed.

601
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,080
So we will have to raze entire forests.

602
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,220
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

603
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,620
and bury it under itself,

604
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,190
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

605
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,260
Um, and finally, we
will need to construct

606
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:38,300
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

607
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,900
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

608
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,480
There will be deaths.

609
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,650
What amount of time,

610
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,320
and how many men do you require?

611
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,190
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

612
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,560

00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,390
Yes, Professor?

621
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,290
My associate was arrested last night.

622
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,590
Oh?

623
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,930
I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.

624
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,300
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

625
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,170
She was arrested by the KGB.

626
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,300
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

627
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,840
I am.

628
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,810
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

629
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:57,310
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

630
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,120
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

631
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,280
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

632
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,360
Comrade, I know you've
heard the stories about us.

633
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,760
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

634
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
But we are not what people say.

635
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,600
Yes, people are following you.

636
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,100
People are following those people.

637
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,430
You see them?

638
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,570
They follow me.

639
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,740
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

640
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,040
Nothing more.

641
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,510
You know the work we're doing here.

642
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,580
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

643
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,630
But you know the old Russian proverb:{\c}

644
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,730
"Trust but verify."

645
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,530
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

646
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,960
Can you imagine?

647
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,530
It was very nice speaking with you.

648
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,200
I need her.

649
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,370
So you will be accountable for her?

650
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,510
Then it's done.

651
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,410
- Her name is...
- I know who she is.

652
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,320
Good day, Professor.

653
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:22,560
No, that went surprisingly well.

654
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,800
You came off like a naive idiot.

655
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,970
And naive idiots are not a threat.

You want to stop?

Is that a choice I even have?

Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

I don't know. A 40% chance maybe.

Maybe the miners who I've
told to dig under the reactor

will save millions of lives.

But I can't.

I don't think you have a
choice any more than I do.

- Yeah.
- There's something else.

Akimov says they shut the reactor down,

694
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,080
and Toptunov confirms it.

695
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,800
- They pressed AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

696
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,410
No.

697
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:37,110
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

I think it's what I would say if I
was trying to cover my own mistakes.
