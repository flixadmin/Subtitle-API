Because I stared into

I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

815
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,662
But we knew they were lying.

I'm not really
who you think I am.

I ever heard.

There's no such thing.

absolutely right, young lady.

There is no such thing.

'Cause if there were,

822
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,646
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

a lot more than make tea

Like what? Show us.

(SIGHS) Maybe later.

831
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,500
I kept all your stuff.

832
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,835
I'll go get it.

833
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,421
You want to give her
a hand with that?

834
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:28,797
Hmm?

835
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,731
You don't remember anything?

Little moments.

But I can't tell what's real.

839
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:01,121
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

840
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,957
maybe it'll all make sense.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

842
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:10,297
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

Your usual move.

844
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,177
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

845
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,180
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

846
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,891
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

847
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,184
at doing something
that mattered.

848
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,103
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

849
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,229
and I wasn't about to argue,

850
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,106
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

851
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,400
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

852
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,110
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

853
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,320
Since it violates
the predetermined

854

I definitely
don't remember those.

00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,532
Hmm. Of course you don't.

857
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,909
(BOTH LAUGH)

858
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:47,709
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

859
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,921
She said
she had lives to save.

860
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,298
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

861
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,424
but you said that...

862
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:58,136
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

863
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:02,557
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

864
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,144
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

865
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,649
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

866
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:15,487
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

867

I know
this must be hard for you.

No. No. Mmm-mmm.

870
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,794
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

871
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,629
in a mission so secret

872

they act
like it never even happened.

873
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,387
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

874
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,347
too damn stubborn to die.

875
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,434
And now you come up in here
after six years...

with your supercharged
fire hands...

and you expect me
to call you...

I don't even know what. Vers?

with your parents...

so Mom said
we became your real family.

you graduated.

I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

if you mind
if I bring the boys over

- Yeah.

but I'm sure
that you understand

I had to take
some precautions.

974
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:49,928
decoding some coordinates.

975
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,930
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

976
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:55,266
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

977
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,188
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

978
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,815
Deal.

979
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:02,941
(PURRING)

980
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,901
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

981
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,403
How'd that get in here?

982
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,612
Hmm?

983
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:09,989
- The cat?
- (WHIMPERS)

984
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,241
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

985
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,867
That's not a cat.

986
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,037
- That's a Flerken.
- FURY: A Flerken?

987
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,747
- (LAUGHS)
- MONICA: Mom?

988
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,256
MARIA: Monica.

989
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,966
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

990
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,203
What's happening?

991
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,955
It's loading.

1001
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,855
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

1002
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,024
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

1003
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,108
Yes, ma'am.

1004
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,325
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

1005
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,035
I never should have
brought you along.

1006
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,249
Here come some G's.

1007
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,935
(BEEPING)

1008
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,521
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

1020
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,372
Help me out, will ya?

1021
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,461
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

1022

VERS: Lawson?

1023
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,883
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

1024
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,136
To end wars?

1025
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,931
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

1026
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,601
Damn it!

1027
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,186
My name is not Lawson.

1028
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,690
My real name is Mar-Vell,

1029
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,568
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

1030
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:34,819
(EXHALES)

1031
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,946
I would say
that you're delusional...

1032
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,740
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

1033
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,325
and your blood is blue.

1034
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,038
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

1035
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,040
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

1036
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,333
any more regrets.

1037
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,585
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

1038
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,754
You gotta save 'em without me.

1039
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,963
Save who? How?

1040
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,008
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

1041
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,468
What are you doing?

1042
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,637
- (GUNSHOT)
- (GASPS)

1043
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,933
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1044
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,490
We have no interest
in hurting you.

1045
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,200
No?

1046
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:25,036
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

1047
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,039
The energy core.

1048
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,124
Where is it?

1049
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,001
Pararescue's on the way.

1050
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,712
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

1051
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:37,674
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

1052
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,883
VERS: No, wait!

1053
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,683
You mean that energy core?

1054
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,355
(SHOUTS) No!

1055
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:39,360
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

1056
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,528
Hold your fire.

1057
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,415
MINN-ERVA:
There's nothing left.

1058
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,250
The core has been destroyed.

1059
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,845
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

1060
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,891
She's coming with us.

1061
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,282
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1062
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,121
He lied to me.

1063
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,709
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

1064
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,378
Now, you understand.

1065
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,048
What?
What do I understand now?

1066
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,091
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1067
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,384
He killed her...

1068
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,054
'cause she found out
that she was

1069
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,349
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1070
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,475
VERS: No.

1071
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,186
Your people are terrorists.

1072
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,854
They kill innocents.

1073
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,773
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1074
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,193
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1075
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,863
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1076
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,617
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1077
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,786
and they destroyed our planet.

1078
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:15,540
And the handful of us
that are left

1079
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,667
will be slaughtered next...

1080
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,838
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1081
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,549
The core that she found

1082
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,175
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1083
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,135
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1084
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:32,265
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1085
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,102
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1086
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,436
wasn't to fight wars...

1087
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,604
but to end them.

1088
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:44,777
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1089
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:46,821
Well, I already destroyed it.

1090
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,531
No, you destroyed the engine.

1091
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,701
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1092
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:56,163
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1093
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,874
we can find it.

1094
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,294
You'll use it to destroy us.

1095
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:06,549
(SIGHS)
We just want a home.

1096
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:16,017
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1097
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,019
Can't you see it now?

1098
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,562
You're not one of them.

1099
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,108
You don't know me.

1100
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,945
You have no idea who I am.

1101
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,325
I don't even know who I am!

1102
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,912
You are Carol Danvers.

1103
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,290
You are the woman
on that black box

1104
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,918
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1105
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,463
My best friend...

1106
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,549
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1107
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,092
when no one else did.

1108
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:55,806
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1109
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,226
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1110
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,480
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1111
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,649
You hear me?

1112
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,860
Do you hear me?

1113
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,119
Come here. Come here, girl.

1114
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,205
I got you.

1115
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,462
TALOS: <i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1116
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,839
but you were our only lead.

1117
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,258
We discovered
that your energy signature

1118
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,095
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1119
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,764
Now we know why.

1120
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:42,561
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1121
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,398
I just need your help

1122
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:49,026
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1123
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,780
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1124
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,865
For orbital position
and velocity.

1125
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,742
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1126
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,077
'cause it's not on Earth.

1127
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,328
VERS: That was the location

1128
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:00,496
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1129
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,039
If we track its course,

1130
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,417
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1131
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,293

Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

So, is it true?

1619
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:22,801
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1620
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:25,387
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1621
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:30,017
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

Understood.

I'm sorry to report

1624
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:34,980
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.
