160
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,666
Connect the pump, Palermo.
Let's begin extraction.

161
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,458
But there's 31 tons left.
The plan's to melt it all.

162
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,541
I'm here, so the plan's changed.
The priority now is to get it out.

163
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Our only chance will be
to extract the gold

164
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,875
we've managed to melt
up until that moment.

Oh.

I can't believe
you got me excited about Rome.

- And how long do we have?
- Three or four hours.

It's heading southwest from Guadalajara.
We're 11 minutes behind.

172
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,708
I can send an F18 from the base
in Torrejón and shoot it down.

173
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
No. That pilot's useless
to us if he's dead.

174
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,708
That helicopter's gonna land.
The moment it does, we'll be there.

You came in here under one condition:

00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,750
You wouldn't reveal your identity.
Just a hostage with hostages.

Did you see the guy holding an M16?

Arturo had the M16 and he's useless.
Arturo with a bazooka is useless!

00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,666
There was a protocol.

You know I kind of saved your life.

190

Maybe you could at least thank me for it.

If they caught us,
you'd stay with Cincinnati.

- No.

We trusted her
with the mission of raising our child,

198
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,208
and she wiped her ass with it.

199
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,458
It's never Arturo's fault.

200
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,916
No matter what he does.
I mean, even if he has an M16,

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,458
or rubs himself against you
with a hard-on,

Eight more hours at full blast
and we can melt it all.

The melting is secondary.
Now it's about extraction.

They said we had to melt 90 tons

Lisbon's in the bank now.

00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,291
That will force them
into an intervention we can't handle.

Either we take the gold out now
or we're done, brother. Understand?

Did you have that information before?

00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
That Lisbon's rescue
would jeopardize our plan?

Actually, three things.

318
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,750
Firstly, I couldn't find
the right moment during this conversation

319
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,750
to tell you that I'm taking a shit.

<i>And it doesn't matter now.</i>

321
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Secondly, I'll be there in 40 minutes.

322
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,250
And the last thing, I'll go in
with my operational team that I trust.

323
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
<i>The ones from Afghanistan,
Yemen, and Mali.</i>

324
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,458
I want them all.

If I take you to the police,

If I take you to prison, you'll escape.

Where are you taking the gold out?

A smashed corpse, full of bullets?

We can share it. Each of us
would get our own nice little portion.

Of course it's a colleague.
A former officer.

366
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,666
A traitor, Sierra. She ran away.
Obviously she's working for the Professor.

Are we new to this or what?

Martínez, get a hold
of Sierra's emails, okay?

373
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,875
We need to prove
that she leaked Prieto's conversations

374
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,791
with Osman and the stuff about Algeria.

375

Create a fake location signal
from her phone, near the National Court.

Irrefutable evidence
of her agreement with Murillo.

I'll need the phone carriers to cooperate.

The phone carriers will do
what CNI tells them to.

An army doctor should assume the report.

With all that,
I think we're gonna be covered.

I'd never find a love like that again.

You think I'm that stupid? You've been

521
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,458
- I'm just being polite to her.
- You're coming onto her.

- Yes or no, Rafael?

Well, I think she's very... pretty.

I'm your father.
I'll know if you're lying.

If the situation wasn't,
uh, like it is right now

It's flattering that a young man like you

would want to polish
my wife's beautiful thighs.

Would you look at that?

See how confusing life can get sometimes?

535
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,666
Paradoxical.

536
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,583
For example,

537
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,958
I could seem like a good parent
if I wanted to work with my son, but...

if that job were a robbery,

539
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,250
probably some prude asshole

You are just...

absolutely disgusting

554
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,250
and selfish.

555
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,750
You want a boring life
with schedules, meetings, emails,

556
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,250
with those endless shifts
that will completely exhaust your energy?

557
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,750
Then give you a month-long holiday
so you can get a glimpse of some freedom?

558
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,708
You're gonna want a glimpse of freedom
when you go to prison!

559
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,208
In my job,
you don't get killed or go to jail.

560
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,291
Death is simply just a word, a priori.

561
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,750
It comprises everything
that doesn't exist.

562
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:29,125
On the other hand, once you're dead,
you won't remember you were alive.

563
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:32,083
So that's why you wanted to meet, right?

564
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,166
That's why you wanted to see me again?

565
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,958
You say you love me
but don't care if I get killed.

566
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,041
What I don't want is for you to die
before you've even lived.

[lightly tense music plays]

568

What I'm offering you right now

569
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,500
is a guaranteed path to liberty.

570
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,000
With me, you'll find authentic liberation.

571
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,833
And if we ever have to pay a price for it,

572
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,583
then we pay it.

573

[tense music builds]

574
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,041
Madrid is not the Bermuda Triangle.

575
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,708
We can't make
an 11-ton helicopter simply disappear.

576
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,166
And Marseille will be watched
by all their radars, their satellites,

577
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,041
even NATO's ballistic missiles.

578
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,291
So as soon as Marseille drops off Lisbon...

579
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:31,875
he'll have nowhere to go.

580

- Where is it?
- [Martínez] It's in the countryside.

582
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,791
Near Guadalajara.
It looks like a cattle farm.

Forty degrees,

That would be the case, Benjamín,

if it wasn't for the continuation
of our astonishing illusionist act.

On the ground!

- Clear!
- [officer 2] Clear!

On your feet!

Your colleague killed my lamb.
Who's gonna pay for it? Huh? Who?

- Someone who lost a lamb.

[Benjamín] <i>He landed on my flock
at a crazy speed. He's nuts!</i>

613
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,500
He was alone?

614
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,333
In the helicopter? Yes, he was alone.

615
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,958
In the car...

616
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,625
Boris, in the car, how many were there?
Two, right?

617
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:46,208
No, just one. They both left,
but there was only one guy in the car.

618
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,791
The vehicle model?

619
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,375
It was like, uh, a funeral car.

620
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,083
[Professor] <i>In that moment,
they'll have only one lead, the red Volvo.</i>

621
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:59,958
The cameras back at the National Court
will record it when we get Lisbon out.

622
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,333
And that will be
the exact information you'll give them.

623
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,000
Ask him if it was
a Volvo from the '90s. A red one.

624
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:09,916
Was it a Volvo?

625
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,625
A red station wagon.
The make? I don't know.

626
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,916
Volvo, yeah, Volvo.
It left towards Albolleque.

627
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,333
That will be the climax
of our act of illusionism,

628
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,916
because from that moment on...

629
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,250
- [music ends abruptly]
- ...everything will change.

630
