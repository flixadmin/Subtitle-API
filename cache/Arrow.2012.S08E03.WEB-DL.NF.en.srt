CENTURIES OLD.

312
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,265
YEAH.

313
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,149
AL-FATIH TOOK GREAT PAINS
TO HIDE HIS SECRETS

314
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,609
LEST HE BE BETRAYED.

315
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,156
I BELIEVE THIS LEADS
TO AL-FATIH'S TOMB.

316
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,825
IT STANDS TO REASON
THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT

317
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,743
TO TAKE HIS SECRETS
WITH HIM BEYOND THE GRAVE.

318
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,119
SO IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT.

319
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,663
IT WOULD APPEAR SO, YES.

320
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,415
WHY CAN'T EVERYTHING
JUST BE EASY?

321
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,877
ATHENA: ACTUALLY, YOUR
SITUATION IS MORE
DIFFICULT THAN YOU THINK.

322
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,630
-ATHENA.
-YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

323
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,799
TREACHEROUS, TALIA,
BUT BRINGING OUTSIDERS

324
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,968
INTO OUR SACRED HEART
IS A BETRAYAL

325
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,305
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

326
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,850
I'LL TAKE THAT.

327
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,061
RELINQUISH IT OR PERISH.

328
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,482
AS YOU WISH.

329
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,028
ATHENA: ATTACK THEM!

330
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,985
ATHENA SHOWING UP
RIGHT WHEN WE DID
CAN'T BE AN ACCIDENT.

331
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,615
NO, AND NEITHER WAS
HER GIVING ATHENA
THE SPHERE.

332
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,867
IF YOU'RE ACCUSING
ME, I'D LIKE TO
POINT OUT TWO THINGS.

333
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,202
FIRST, ATHENA AND I
ARE BLOOD ENEMIES.

334
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,120
AND SECOND?

335
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,247
SHE WAS LIKELY
TRAILING YOU.

336
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,250
THE WOMAN WHO'S
DECLARED WAR
ON HER.

337
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,127
STILL, I DON'T SEE
WHY ATHENA WOULD GIVE

338
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,169
A CRAP ABOUT A RUSTY,

339
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,046
OLD SCROLL BURIED
WITH AL-FATIH.

340
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,340
SHE WOULDN'T.
SHE WOULD GIVE
A CRAP

341
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,884
ABOUT WHAT ELSE
IS BURIED WITH HIM,

342
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,594
NAMELY HIS SWORD

343
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,512
AS REVERED
AS THE RING OF RA'S.

344
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,389
WHOEVER WIELDS IT
COMMANDS ABSOLUTE
DEVOTION.

345
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,057
CLEARLY ATHENA WANTS
TO USE IT TO RESTART

346
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,934
THE LEAGUE
OF ASSASSINS.

347
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,059
YEAH. WELL, NOW SHE'S GOT

348
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,228
THE MARBLE OF DESTINY
OR WHATEVER.

349
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,855
ACTUALLY, IT'S A MAP.

350
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,941
THE MARKINGS ON IT
WERE CONSTELLATIONS

351
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,234
INDICATING
THE TOMB'S LOCATION,
BUT WE DON'T NEED IT.

352
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,361
I'VE MEMORIZED THEM.

353
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,447
OLIVER: WHAT?

354
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,741
-YOU MEMORIZED THEM?
-YOU DIDN'T?

355
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,245
OK. LISTEN. I'M GONNA
GO HEAD WITH TALIA.

356
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,622
I'D LIKE YOU TO GO
BACK TO HER CAMP

357
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,498
AND WAIT
FOR US THERE.

358
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,292
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

359
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,461
I WILL GIVE YOU TWO
A MOMENT.

360
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,132
OLLIE, I THOUGHT
WE WERE WAY

361
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,884
PAST THIS
OVERPROTECTIVE
BROTHER THING.

362
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,594
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

363
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,554
YOU CAME TO ME
FOR HELP.

364
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,222
I CAME TO YOU
FOR ANSWERS.

365
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,224
I WASN'T COUNTING
ON GETTING ATTACKED
BY ATHENA.

366
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,354
ATHENA AND I WERE
FIGHTING LONG BEFORE
YOU SHOWED UP HERE.

367
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,063
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

368
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,941
I KNOW YOU CAN TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELF.

369
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,652
IF ATHENA IS TRYING TO
RESTART THE LEAGUE
OF ASSASSINS,

370
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,529
THAT MAKES YOU
HER CHIEF RIVAL.

371
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,281
-I DON'T CARE.
-I CARE, THEA.

372
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,285
IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME,
JUST...JUST LET ME
HANDLE THIS.

373
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,424
QADIR MUST BE USING
TURNER'S FAMILY
TO LURE HIM OUT.

374
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,802
OK. THEN WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW.

375
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,512
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

376
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,890
IF BEN TURNER'S A TARGET,
THEN SO ARE WE,

377
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,433
AND EVERY SECOND
WE STAY HERE,
WE RISK BEING MADE.

378
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,101
WHAT ABOUT SANDRA
AND CONNOR?

379
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,979
CALL AN A.R.G.U.S.
TEAM, LYLA.

380
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,230
-EXIFL THEM.
-IT WOULD TAKE A TEAM

381
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,899
AT LEAST AN HOUR
TO GET HERE.

382
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,525
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
BETWEEN NOW THAT THEN.

383
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,569
OK, FINE, BUT WE
CAN'T RISK DOING
THIS ALONE.

384
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,863
-WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
-THEN YOU LEAVE.

385

GOING ON HERE?

YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ONE
TO SHY AWAY FROM RISK.

389
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,670
I'D NEVER SEEN A WORLD
JUST DISINTEGRATE
IN FRONT OF MY FACE.

390
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,178
I KNOW WHAT WE DO
REQUIRES RISK.

391
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,722
I'VE ALWAYS
ACCEPTED THAT,

392
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,434
BUT THIS IS
DIFFERENT, LYLA.

393
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:27,189
SEEING A UNIVERSE
JUST DISAPPEARING,

394

I DON'T KNOW, IT'S
LIKE...

395

LIKE LOOKING
INTO THE EYE OF GOD.

I CAN'T RISK
LOSING YOU.

399

I CAN'T RISK THAT.

00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,048
NO ONE KNOWS THE FUTURE.

401
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,217
ALL WE CAN DO IS
ENJOY THE TIME WE HAVE

402
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,054
WITH THE PEOPLE WE LOVE
AND MAKE OUR CHOICES

403
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:02,725
FROM A PLACE OF STRENGTH,
NOT FEAR,

404
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,811
AND IF THE WORLD
ENDS TODAY,

405
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,396
THERE IS NO ONE I'D
RATHER HAVE BY MY SIDE.

YOUR SISTER IS INVOLVED

IN THIS WHETHER YOU
WANT HER TO BE OR NOT?

409

SHE'S A DAUGHTER
OF THE DEMON.

410
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,038
SHE HAS A CLAIM
TO THE SWORD.
