- How'd you get it?
- [Berta] With my cousin's ID.

147
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,080
I stole it from her
at my nana's funeral. [chuckles]

148

You coming?

We need to talk, okay?

151
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
I... uh, we're both super late
and we can't miss this bus

152
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
or we're not going to make it.

153
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,760
But we've still got loads of time.
We're in! So where are you goin'?

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,600
Just down the street. Come on.
Hey, let's go, Gregory!

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,400
- Today? Yeah? That's awesome.
- That's what you gotta focus on.

162
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
[girl 1] Did I tell you,
it's the same chick?

163
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,560
[boy] Wait, how old are you?

164
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,760
- [girl 2] You have to say no.
- [girl 3] I was gonna tell her.

165
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Alma!

166
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,120
[hip hop music playing on speakers]

167
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,240
My bad. I didn't mean to scare you.

168
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,640
You know Alma, right?

169
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,120
- Yeah, everyone knows Alma.
- [Pablo] Was she here?

170
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
No.

171
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,360
Do you know where she might be now?

172
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,400

'Cause I got no more. No love ♪</i>

173
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,200
Her mother and I
are both pretty concerned.

174
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, she hasn't been here.

175
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Thank you all.

176
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
[girl 1] Dude, what the fuck?

177
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,640
[boy] I don't know. I thought
that was really fucking weird, honestly.

178
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,000
My mom has a date this evening, all right?

179
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,920
So I'm cheersing to the poor motherfucker
that wants to screw her.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,080
And that he will. [laughing]

181
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,720
And where do you two live now?

182
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,760
In the city, although we're both
sleeping over at Berta's for the night.

183
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,800
Elena and Lily are like my Alma and Greta,
but from primary school.

184
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,960
And just a little more artsy. [laughs]

185
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,120
[Greta] Yeah, you're all artsy
that's for sure.

186
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes, and one day
we're all gonna be famous.

187
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240
You know it.

188
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,920
- But I'll be the very greatest. [laughs]
- [Helena] Right.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, you know,
I almost chose art as a Sophomore.

190
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,920
[Lily] Really?

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,960
Yes, except I found out that I've got
no talent whatsoever for drawing.

192
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,360
So, yeah.

193
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,040
Um, I'm starving!
My stomach is growling like crazy.

194
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,240
I think I'm going to go for some sort
of super-processed, greasy pastry.

195
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,400
[Helena] I'm hungry too.

196
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,360
- Should we go grab something?
- [Greta] Yeah.

197
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,280
- You coming?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,800
- [Alma] I'll go with you.
- [Berta] No, no, no. Stay, please.

199
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
[Lily] Okay, we'll be right back.

200
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
I'll be all alone here watching Gregory.

201
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
[Greta] I'll get you something!

202
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,200
[Berta] Want some?

203
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Thanks.

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Alma, you're not wearing my necklace.

205
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
I forgot it at home.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,280
But um, yeah,
I really love the flying fish, though.

207
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
What metal is that?

208
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,760
It's brass. You wearing it
is important to me.

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
I'll post a photo wearing it.

210
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,040
I don't care about that. I just
wanna make sure that you are wearing it.

211
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
[sighs]

212
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,920
Whatever. I just have so many
other great ideas for necklaces.

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,120
But I'd need a lot of molds and an oven,

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,920
and my mom doesn't care about that stuff.

215
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,720
Well, you're super talented, Berta.

216
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
I've got a professor that says that I've
got the personality of a creative person.

217
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,600
And well, at the moment,

218
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,880
I fit the profile of an artsy teenager
to the "T," don't you think?

219
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,440
Parents are divorced,
problems with alcohol, with drugs,

220
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,360
misunderstood, therapy, loneliness...

221
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,440
We had a good time together
in school, right?

222
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeah.

223
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
[Alma] Hey,

224
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,840
do you like anyone in our class?

225
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
[Berta] Mm... no.

226
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,960
- [both laugh]
- Why not?

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, I mean, I like you.

228
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,360
- But not like in a gay way!
- Yeah, yeah.

229
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,120
I know what I like and I am into penis.

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,760
You know, I saw my dad's dick once.

231
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,200
What?

232
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah. He thought no one was in the house
so he was walking around butt-naked.

233
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,560
God!

234
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,480
- It was actually super small.
- Jeez, Berta!

235
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,480
- It was so disappointing!
- Oh, no!

236
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
[door opens]

237
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,480
- [Berta's mother] Hello! Berta! I'm home.
- [door closes]

238
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
Dude. Wait, wasn't your mom
in the hospital?

239
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Huh?

240
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,800
Well, you've spent the last few days
saying your mom is super ill.

241
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, today
you were crying in math class.

242
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,280
I just didn't have time
to do the homework for science class and...

243
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,640
People were so nice to me when I said it.

244
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
And I couldn't take it back and so...

245
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,000
You really are a fucking liar.

246
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,400
You going to tell?

247
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
No.

248
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,880
[laughs] No. I love it.

[Berta] <i>Why did we stop hanging out?</i>

251
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,160
Not sure. It's just normal, right?

252
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,960
You switch schools and you just
stop hanging out. It's normal.

253
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,920
Yes. But Greta switched schools like I did

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,080
and you still see
each other every weekend.

255

Why, Alma?

256
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,040
Why did we grow apart?

257
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
No idea.

258
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,440
Ah shit, Alma! The bus!
Run, or we'll miss it again! Run!

- Come on!

Yeah, I don't know. What do you think?

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Mmm... That maybe she likes you
more than a friend.

271

No. It's not that.

- [Vero] It might be for the best, Pablo.

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,080
I went to the park, but I didn't see her.

Okay, that's enough then.

Her park friends don't know
where she's been either.

She'll return soon. You'll see.

I thought that you guys had grounded her
and she didn't have permission to leave?

[Vero] <i>Yeah, she was. But she snuck out.</i>

And I really need to speak to her.

Any idea where she is
or who she's out with?

I don't know, Vero. She's not here.

I swear, so sorry.
