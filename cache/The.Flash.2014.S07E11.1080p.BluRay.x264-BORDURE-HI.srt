00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,590
[Barry softly] Oh, God.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,677
No.

Iris.

5
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,814
[Bashir] So that worked.

6
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:23,942
What just happened?
How are we still alive?

7
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:26,985
Iris.

8
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,077
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I.

9
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,207
What did you do?

10
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,337
Mrs. West, as soon as Nora came in,
I knew you were right.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,089
I could see the hate in her eyes.

12
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,716
Real anger issues.
I mean, no match for me,

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,427
but I wanted to protect you all.

14
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,221
So I took care of it.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,973
You made her think we were dead?

16
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,474
You made us all see it.

17
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,143
It wasn't a nightmare.
That was an illusion.

18
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,147
- I didn't know you could do that.
- [softly] Yeah, it's...

19
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,733
[scoffs]

20
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:07,776
Neither did he.

21
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,907
You were just trying
to save yourself, you jerk.

22
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:11,948
Hey, hey, hey.
How about "Thank you, Bashir.

23
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,743
That was baller, the way you stopped
that mean lady from murdering us."

24
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:18,538
I don't get it.

25
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,332
Why would Nora attack you?

26
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,004
I think she sees me as competition.

27
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:45,938
[thunder rumbling]

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,540
[Barry] Have we been able
to locate Nora?

29
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,694
There's no sign of her
on our satellites.

30
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,862
She could be anywhere.

31
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,364
She's probably out there somewhere,
Sith-corrupting Deon.

32
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,366
I'm the reason he ran to Nora.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,860
If anything happens to him...

34
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,120
He's a god, too. Won't he be safe?

35
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,122
None of us are. Not anymore.

36
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,373
Yeah. She's right.

37
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,042
It's only a matter of time

38
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,336
before Nora senses
the other Forces are alive.

39
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,129
Iris, it's up to us.

40
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:09,964
We have to protect them.

41
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,134
If Nora wants Bashir
and Alexa dead, then...

42
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:15,845
we need to hide them.

43
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,597
Hide them. Where? A.R.G.U.S.?

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,017
Guys, there's nowhere on Earth
to hide from the Speed Force.

45
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,478
Then we won't hide them on Earth.

46
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,648
There's only one place Nora can't go.

47
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,567
A place where she didn't exist
for a few months.

48
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,361
Like, in the past.

49
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,946
When Nora first died.
Does that place still exist?

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,198
It's a moment in time.

51
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,493
A dead zone that she can't access.
But a speedster can.

52
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,912
I can take Bashir and Alexa
and once they're inside...

53
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,080
Once we're inside.

54
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,833
They're my responsibility, too.

55
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:54,842
I swear, that kid of ours can sleep
through absolutely anything.

Multiple lightning strikes took out

Two dozen inmates escaped,

Oh, no, what about Frost?
You don't think that...

62

No... but this storm

If I hadn't I could've stopped this.

00:03:58,448 --> 00:03:59,532
It was.

78
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,078
It was nice of the Addams Family to
lend you their place for the weekend.

79
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,873
All right, I'm gonna go find Deon.

80
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,167
If Nora somehow
finds the three of you first...

81
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,711
Yeah. Use the transmat orb
that Cisco gave me.

82
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,422
The hyper-tachyon particles inside
will pull any organic matter

That was rude.

Yeah, I'm sure it's nothing.

00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,105
You should get some rest.

00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,675
Nora... what happened to you?

95
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,637
I couldn't feel you at all...
which shouldn't be possible.

96
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:05,847
You brought me here?

97
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,725
I had to make sure you were safe.

00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,184
From who?

99
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,811
From you?

100

You tried to kill them, Nora!
Even Iris.

101
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,650
And I let you live. For a reason.

102
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,904
Do you have any idea
what death is like?

103
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,450
It's an agonizing emptiness
that turns your soul inside out.

104
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,245
And that loneliness it brings?

105
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,998
- It burns.
- Iris and I brought you back.

106

You brought them back, too.

As soon as I was reborn,

I could feel those new Forces
trying to snuff out my existence.

But I won't let them.

Now bring my brothers

It's Nora.

She says she's gonna
tear the city apart

119
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,589
unless I bring her all three Forces.

120
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,048
I gotta find Deon before she does.

121
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,550
I got your back on that, Flash.

122

I rebuilt the isotopic sensor.

123
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,280
Now all you need to do
is sweep through the city

124
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,322
in a standard grid pattern

125
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,324

I need you and Chester on comms.

But Deon knows us. We can help.

131
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,358
Bringing Deon in
is my responsibility,

biotech interfaces for my work, so...

So you stole them.

Hey, if I can ignore your
stabby faults,

152

then the least you could do
is ignore my klepto ones, maybe.

We had so much fun last time.

You know, before the whole
attempted murder part.

Look, would you stop
bringing that up? Okay?

159
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,049
Yeah, you're probably right.

160
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,432
I will say this.

161

You are the first person
that I've met in a very long time...

00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,404
So how about that drink?

164
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,824
No, there's no freaking way
I would ever go out with you.

165
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,202
Wait. Hold on. Are you talking about
dinner and the whole nine yards?

166
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,955
Look, would you just stop doing that?
All right?

167
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,122
What?

168
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,003
- Just trying to get a little clarity.
- That. Right there. Just stop it.

169
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,336
It is okay if you're into me.

170
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,214
For the last time, I am not into you.

171
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,297
Mm.

172
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,597
Then why don't you stop
staring at my six pack?

173
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,198
[Caitlin] Tell me exactly what happened.

174
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,245
[Joe] Lightning shot through
the window. I mean...

175
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,621
It was like
someone wanted to hit her.

176
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,981
Maybe someone did.
Nora is controlling the storm.

177
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,983
Why would she do that to Cecile?

178
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,860
Why did she attack Iris?

179
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,070
Joe, don't worry.
I'm gonna do everything I can

180
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,423
to figure out
what's wrong with Cecile

181
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:50,847
and get her back on her feet, okay?

182
00:08:58,414 --> 00:08:59,498
[sighs softly]

183
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,638
[Bashir] Why do I feel like the Brady
Bunch might have died in here?

184
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,839
[Iris West] This place is an exact
replica of the house

185
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,132
that Barry and I grew up in.

186
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:13,095
It looks terrible now,
but it wasn't then.

187
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,306
What was he like back then?

188
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,976
Barry? [chuckles softly]
He was small for his age.

189
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,145
Bet he loved that growth spurt
when he was 13.

190
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,647
Not really. He was pretty clumsy.

191
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,316
Wow. Isn't this great?

192
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,818
Mom and the kids reminiscing
about old times.

193
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,612
[Iris West] Anyways.

194
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,492
He was pretty sensitive about it,
so I wanted to help.

195
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,453
I would place all of my books
on top shelves

196
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,056
where he thought
I couldn't reach them.

197
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,164
[Bashir] <i>Hey, baby sis.</i>

198
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,666
<i>Look what I can do.</i>

199
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,376
<i>Don't react.</i>

200
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,421
<i>This is just between us siblings.</i>

201
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,548
<i>Nora is not gonna stop
until we're dead.</i>

202
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,259
<i>We need to face her
and fight together.</i>

203
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,345
<i>First, we need to get outta here.
I know how.</i>

204
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,471
<i>Are you with me or not?</i>

205
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,723
He was so proud of himself
when he pulled them down.

206
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,141
It made me smile.

207
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,653
- [device beeping]
- [panting]

208
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,591
My life was supposed to be
on this field as a football god.

209
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,053
Then I became an actual god, and...

210
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,683
Somehow I still can't make
my life go in the direction I want.

211
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,601
[sighs]

212
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,316
I wanted you to die... not them.

213
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,903
I just wish I could take it all back.

214
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,282
You don't have to take it back.

215
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,369
Iris, Alexa, Bashir...

216
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,746
They're not dead.

217
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,414
What?

218
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,667
It was an illusion.

219
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,419
[scoffs]

220
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,462
Bashir...

221
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,131
It was him, wasn't it?

222
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,384
[scoffing]

223
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:24,643
Look, I just wanted you to feel
the same pain that I felt

224
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,062
when you called me a mistake,
all right?

225
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,586
Nora is the one who took it too far.

226
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,024
You're not a mistake, Deon.

227
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,194
I'm glad you're here.
I know that now.

228
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:35,696
[thunder rumbling]

229
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,076
Deon, Nora is looking for you.

230
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,871
Man. She's the devil, that girl.

231
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,332
Look, she's the one
that should have never existed.

232
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,768
You need to unmake her the same way
you were gonna unmake me.

233
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,270
All right, so come on,
let's do it together.

234
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,129
No. No, I can't do that.

235
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,964
But I'm gonna find
another way to stop her.

236
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,299
I promise. After you're safe.

237
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,718
Man, here's no hiding
from her crazy ass.

238
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,763
Look. Old man, either you
need to help me take her down

239
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,014
or I'll start running again.

240
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,849
Deon, I'm trying to protect you.

241
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,810
Killing her is the only thing
that's gonna keep us all safe.

242
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,355
- Why can't you see that?
- [loudly] I said...

243
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,396
[panting]

244
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,025
I said we'll find another way.

245
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,613
We... ain't doing jack.

246
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,616
- I am.
- Deon.

247
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,007
How are we supposed to keep
people safe and stop Nora?

248
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,093
C.C.P.D. is evacuating
people downtown.

249
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,177
Let's call Team Citizen,

250
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,782
have them help
get people to shelters.

251
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,930
I'm gonna find Deon again

252
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,515
before he does something
he'll regret.

253
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,142
Hey. What if he does
kill the Speed Force?

254
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,149
He could save lives.

255
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,460
Joe, you know that's not an option.

256
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,195
These are gods, Barr.
We're ants to them.

257
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,488
What are we supposed to do?

258
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,324
Just pray that it all works out?

259
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,451
These Forces exist
because of me and Iris.

260
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,370
I have to do everything I can
to protect them.

261
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,122
Well, at least you still can.

262
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,166
Joe.

263
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,715
Poor Joe.
First the job, now Cecile...

264
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,134
I know. But right now
I need you guys to stay focused

265
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,528
on finding a way to restrain Nora.

266
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,928
Restraining a Force of Nature?

267
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,489
Barry, we've been putting
our heads together,

268
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,140
I just... I don't know
if it's possible.

269
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,141
It has to be.

270
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:28,892
We're doing everything we can.
I promise.

271
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,954
All right. Well, call me
if you have something.

272
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,521
I'm gonna keep searching for Deon.

273
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,275
[thunder rumbling]

274
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,199
Leawood and Petersburg
are being evacuated.

275
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,576
Kamilla and I are gonna help.

276
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,579
Wanna come with?
Might take your mind off things.

277
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,665
Allegra, things like that...
It's not your responsibility.

278
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,542
Sometimes there isn't anything
we can do.

279
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:58,464
And that officially makes you
an old man feeling sorry for himself.

280
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,841
- [sighs]
- Yeah, I talked to Barry.

281
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,219
Look, Joe, you need to hear this.

282
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,596
You're not a cop anymore.

283
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,639
I know that.

284
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,726
So, what are you?

285
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,855
Because I still see the man
who sat on a bomb

286
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,523
to save Cecile's life.

287
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,611
Or who helped a juvenile delinquent

288
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,988
achieve her dream
of becoming a reporter.

289
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,615
You did those things.

290
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,159
Not because you had a badge,

291
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,162
but because you care
about helping others.

292
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,623
So...

293
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,959
what do you say?

294
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,381
I can't leave Cecile.

295
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,384
I get it.

296
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,719
It's your call.

297
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,443
Nice look.

298
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,153
Big improvement.

299
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,865
At least my alter ego doesn't
parade around in blue spandex.

300
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,868
You two really are like
brother and sister.

301
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,540
Iris, that device Cisco gave you.

302
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,167
What if Nora finds us
and it doesn't work?

303
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,089
Chester and Cisco designed it.
It will.

304
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,509
Okay, but if Nora did find us,
she could overpower you.

305
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:27,928
Maybe I should hold onto it.

306
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,262
[scoffs]

307
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,766
- What's up with you?
- Just give her the orb, Iris.

308
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,062
We're gonna take down Nora before
she gets to us.

309
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,854
We're trying to keep you safe.

310
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,857
The last time that happened...
[distorted] I died.

311
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,860
[grunts]

312
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,197
Give me the transmat now.

313
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,372
[gasps]

314
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,086
It was the only way.

316
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:02,907
[Bashir] <i>Are you sure about that?</i>

317
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,801
Wait, don't.

318
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,850
An Einstein-Maxwell gravitational
trap could hold Nora, but...

319
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,020
But the coils would need enough
current to power Las Vegas.

320
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,022
Exactly, so...

321
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,211
- Still no sign of Deon?
- [Barry] No.

322
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,568
And the storm's taken out
more electrical grids.

323
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,987
Please tell me you've got a plan.

324
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:31,200
No actual plans yet. Just theories.

325
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,370
Barry, look, we've been racking
our brains nonstop here.

326
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,080
You can give us weeks to solve this,

327
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,082
and we still might not know
how to stop her.

328
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,132
- I don't know how we win this one.
- [exhales]

[Chester] Kinetic isotopes.

331
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:50,052
It's Nora. What do we do?

332
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,597
The only thing we can.

333
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:05,859
You didn't bring them.
Do you want your world to end?

334
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,652
No.

335
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
And neither do you.

336
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,451
Nora, you and the other Forces
were created by something

337
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,036
just as powerful as all this.

338
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:20,165
The love that Iris and I
have for each other.

339
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,126
That love is a part of you.

340
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,547
That means you're more
than just a Force of Nature now.

341
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,925
Our humanity is inside you, too.

342
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,971
So please... stop!

343
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,558
You still don't understand.

344
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,975
[rumbling]

345
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,226
You feel that?

346
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,437
That wasn't me.

347
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,147
It never has been.

348
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,148
[rumbling]

349
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,113
That was a show of strength, Barry.

350
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,448
Just like what happened
to Cecile earlier.

351
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,579
Sage...

352
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,248
Just like what's happening right now.

353
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,256
The Still Force.

354
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,302
You didn't create this storm.

355
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,346
No. Your children did.

356
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,473
And that's why they must die.

357
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:19,766
[Deon] You first.

358
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,152
[grunting]

359
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,794
Help him.

360
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,967
- What happened?
- I found out the truth.

361
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,762
Everything that's happening
out there, Nora isn't doing it.

362
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,656
The other Forces are.
They have been the whole time.

363
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,559
Wait, so Alexa, Bashir and Deon
are the bad guys now?

364
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:03,894
I thought Nora was the problem.

365
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,748
[Speed Force as Nora Allen]
<i>You know I'm the solution, Barry.</i>

366
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,816
<i>Your children's sacrifice
is necessary.</i>

367
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,736
<i>Three of them
for three million in return.</i>

368
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,738
There's still time.

369
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,326
Now, bring them to me
before it's too late.

370
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,969
I couldn't stop him.

371
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,972
Just like I couldn't stop Nora.

372
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,433
What's even worse...

373
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,145
I'm not sure what the right thing
to do is anymore.

374
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,108
Hey, you're doing the best you can.

375
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,489
It's not enough.

376
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,449
[Iris West] Barry.

377
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,618
- Iris.
- Hey.

378
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,495
What are you doing here?
Are you all right?

379
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,163
They took off with the orb
and escaped.

380
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,540
I ended up halfway across town.

381
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,113
- Where are Alexa and Bashir?
- They're going after Nora.

382
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,504
Deon had the same idea.
Now he's wounded.

383
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,922
Barry, our plan didn't work.

384
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,549
What are we gonna do?

385
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,884
[softly] I don't know.

386
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,056
Why is all of this happening?

387
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,351
Nora says the Forces we created
are what's tearing the city apart.

388
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:28,729
And you believe her now?

389
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,273
We do, too.

390
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,277
For weeks, we've been experiencing
Strength Force earthquakes

391
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,611
<i>and Still Force time anomalies.</i>

392
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:40,824
But those were all Force events
on a cosmic scale leading up to this.

393
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,327
- And what about the Sage Force?
- The tests I ran on Cecile earlier

394
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,037
show that the lightning
she was struck by

395
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,123
was composed
of electrochemical isotopes.

396
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,626
- The sheer psychic energy.
- So it's not just one Big Bad.

397
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,546
We're fighting the Forces
of the universe itself.

398
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,424
Talk about a family feud.

399
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,137
Barry, how do we choose between
saving them and saving our city?

400
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,920
It's okay to admit that you like me.

401
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,691
I'm a likeable guy.

402
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,777
No, you're not. I changed my mind.

403
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,700
So you did like me.

404
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:31,750
Shut the hell up, Mark.

405
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,669
Okay. [panting]

406
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,841
Am I crazy or am I sensing
some wild chemistry here, huh?

407
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,844
Don't tell me you're not
feeling that.

408
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,139
The only thing I'm feeling
is my fist on your jawline.

409
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,197
Come on, Frosty.

410
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:03,990
I can counter everything you do.

411
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,076
You don't know everything I can do.

412
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,374
[grunts]

413
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,336
Chill out.

414
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,547
[people screaming]

415
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,935
- The entire city is terrified.
- I know.

416
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,564
No matter how hard I try,
I can't protect them all.

417
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,607
Barry, I can't lose anyone else.

418
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,277
Not like Nora.

419
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,238
Maybe we're not meant to be parents.

420
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,032
I mean, if we can't even keep
our own family safe...

421
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,158
That's a load of crap.

422
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,078
Look, I've been feeling so sorry
for myself

423
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,290
that I've been neglecting
the people that need my help.

424
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:57,377
Baby girl, you and Barry think
that you can help your kids

425
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:00,755
because parents are the only ones
that can keep a family safe?

426
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,133
- It's our job to protect them.
- She's right, Joe.

427
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,677
Barry, when you decided to be
the Flash,

428
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,555
I tried to talk you out of it.
Said you were just a kid.

429
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,139
Did you stop?

430
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,726
No. No, it just...

431
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,270
made me want to prove
I could make a difference even more.

432
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,688
And you sure as hell have.

433
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,357
But Iris,
when Barry can't do it alone,

434
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,681
or those times when he is gone,

435
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,111
like the first time
he went into the Speed Force,

436
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,114
who took charge of this crew
and kept us safe?

437
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:27,616
You did.

438
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,368
You're always there,
side by side with him,

439
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,078
just like now taking care
of business.

440
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,417
You two don't get it?

441
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:44,883
Sometimes, it takes a family
to protect a family.

442
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,348
Iris, we've been trying to keep
the Forces apart.

443
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,600
When we should be bringing
them together.

444
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,316
I couldn't stop her.

445
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,945
Because you're not supposed
to do it alone.

446
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,554
I thought you wanted to run and hide.

447
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,368
Not anymore.

448
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,292
[rumbling]

449
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,547
[Caitlin] Guys...

450
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,549
We've got company.

451
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:38,770
You both came back.

452
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,022
Things are different now,
aren't they?

453
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,654
I could feel it.

454
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,656
We both could.

455
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,205
Sorry for almost killing you.

456
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,084
I'll tell you what.
You help us survive,

457
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:02,627
we'll forgive you.

458
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,507
Maybe.

459
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,987
[Barry] All right. No more running.

460
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,095
No more hiding.

461
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,307
This time we face Nora,
only we do it together.

462
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,279
Everyone ready?

463
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,704
- Any sign of Nora yet?
- No. Not yet.

464
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,792
Nora!

465
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,045
I brought them.

466
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,470
I did what you asked!

467
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,472
[distorted] No, you didn't.

468
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,724
You're going to betray me.

469
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,392
We're connected, Nora.

470
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,813
All of us, whether we like it or not,
we're a family.

471
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,233
- That includes you, too.
- Stupid boy.

472
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,904
I can see
I'm going to have to kill you, too.

473
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,657
Barry!

474
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,418
- Where the hell are we?
- We're dead, right?

475
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,546
No. But somebody's about to be.

476
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,191
[Speed Force as Nora Allen]
<i>Your children did this, Barry.</i>

477
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,716
<i>This isn't how it should be.</i>

478
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,601
So...

479
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,561
It's family game night.

647
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,951
Frost! Oh, my God.

648
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:32,496
Are you okay? Are you a fugitive now
because of this jail break?

649
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,373
Yeah. Slipped out of Iron Heights,

650
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,834
just like the rest of the meta wing
during the storm.

651
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:41,005
But what... Why would you do that
after everything you've been through?

652
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,049
You know, get some
much needed exercise...

653
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,013
To beat up and put away
a dozen meta-humans?

654
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:51,265
And what about your sentence?

655
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,602
Even the DA's office has a heart
when it sees you

656
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,520
on the news saving lives.

657
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:58,772
That and a good word from Flash,

658
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,150
and I got out on probation
for good behavior.

659
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,319
That's incredible.

660
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,450
- What?
- Nothing. You just...

661
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,368
I don't know. You seem different.

662
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,207
- What?
- Fine.

663
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,376
I have a crush on someone.

664
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,172
Who?

665
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,549
He's a bartender.

666
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,358
It's weird that Alexa, Deon
and Bashir are just gone.

667
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,279
Yeah, everything feels different.

668
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:48,530
It's like...

669
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,618
I don't know. We lost a part of us.

670
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,912
[singing]
<i>Don't turn off the lights</i>

671
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,540
Is this what it's going to be like
when our actual kids go to college?

672
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,086
I mean...

673
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:07,174
We'd have to actually try and...

674
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:08,884
You know.

675
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,595
<i>Fluent in the sheet</i>

676
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:13,806
<i>You read in between me</i>

677
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:15,933
<i>I ain't a stranger to the foreplay</i>

678
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,810
It makes you wonder.

679
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,147
<i>So we can skip to word play</i>

680
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,693
<i>Leave the lights on</i>

681
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,027
Yeah, it does.

682
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,571
<i>Leave them lights on</i>

683
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:33,242
<i>Leave 'em, leave 'em lights on, on</i>

684
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,495
Iris?

685
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,205
Where are you going?

686
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,458
I'm tired of wondering.

687
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,752
Let's start a family.

688
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,297
I love that impulse.
