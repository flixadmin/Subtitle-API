1
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,530
People will say I am a monster...

2
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,365
...for what I've done.

3
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,035
And maybe they're right.

4
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,539
I always thought that I'd have more...

5
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,833
-...time.
-Dad?

6
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,585
Dad!

7
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,836
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,714
Peter?

9
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,981
He likes to sleep with the light on
at night.

10
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,733
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,655
Dad.

12
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,117
Be good.

13
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,505
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,717
-Are you uploading it?
-To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,594
Just in case we....

16
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,098
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,767
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,644
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,689
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,484
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,654
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,656
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
I know, I know. But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,287
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,012
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,222
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,516
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,561
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,318
Just planning ahead. Do you think
I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,445
Something you need?

31
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,739
Perhaps I can help.

32
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,365
I'd just like to radio ahead...

33
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,035
...and make sure everything's in order
for when we land.

34
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,790
I think we both know
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

35
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,767
-Richard.
-They say you're a genius.

36
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:27,851
Richard!

37
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,521
Not if you thought you could escape.

38
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,355
Richard!

39
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,649
Mary!

40
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,414
Mary!

41
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,552
Mare.

42
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,137
It's okay. It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

43
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,558
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

44
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,184
Just gonna make you safe.

45
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,895
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

46
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,773
-Roosevelt.
-What?

47
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,108
Roosevelt.

48
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,536
It's back up. It's back up.

49
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,289
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,749
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

51
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,257
What do you got for me today,
New York?

52
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,301
Reporting live
from New York 1 chopper.

53
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,888
An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium
has been hijacked.

54
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,931
A police chase is in progress.

55
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,558
All right. Let's get to work.

56
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,773
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

57
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,179
Spider-Man!

58
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,972
Hello, pedestrians.

59
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,826
Knock, knock.

60
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,828
Mr. Criminal?

61
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,330
Hey, my name is Spider-Man.

62
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,457
You can call me Web-Head,
you can call me Amazing...

63
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,709
...just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

64
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,713
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

65
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,383
-I am killer!
-Whoa, okay.

66
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,511
Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material...

67
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,346
...and is highly explosive.

68
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,181
Excuse me.

69
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,475
There's more room on the sidewalk,
folks, please.

70
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,519
-Watch it, man.
-I got blueprints here.

71
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,812
A little help?

72
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,189
A little help, please.

73
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,026
You having a problem with your gun?

74
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,528
Let me help you out with that.

75
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,196
Coming through.

76
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,533
Too much work....

77
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,244
Oh, this is bad.

78
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,704
I'm gonna be right back.

79
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,251
Heads up. Watch out.

80
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,797
Okay. Okay. There you go.

81
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,800
-You okay? You all right?
-You're Spider-Man.

82
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,344
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

83
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,430
"Max"? How do you know my name?

84
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,848
It's written on your badge.

85
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,099
I'm a nobody.

86
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,560
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

87
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,477
Lick that.

88
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,062
All right. Listen to me.

89
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,355
-Now I need you.
-Really?

90
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,065
-You're my eyes and ears out here.
-Okay.

91
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,233
-All right?
-All right.

92
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,610
I'll see you out there.

93
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,864
Warning. Violation of protocol.

94
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,646
Hands up!

95
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,902
Get him, Spidey!

96
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,115
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

97
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,621
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

98
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,373
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

99
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,961
Get the hell out of the way!

100
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,879
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

101
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,424
Oh, come on.

102
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,594
Hey, wait. Come back here.

103
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,138
Heel!

104
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,723
I got you.

105
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,822
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

106
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,866
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

107
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,450
-I know, I'm sorry.
-Where are you?

108
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,411
1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.

109
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,246
Five minutes. Ten tops.

110
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,207
-Are those sirens?
-No.

111
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,500
-Peter?
-No.

112
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,252
-Peter?
-No sirens.

113
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,920
No--

114
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,714
Peter.

115
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,507
What is happening?

116
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,884
Peter.

117
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,468
Peter.

118
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,766
Hello?

119
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,229
-Peter? Pe--
-I'll be right there. Promise.

120
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,901
This year's valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

121
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,083
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

122
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,211
...and families of my fellow graduates.

123
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,671
It's an honour to be
standing up here today.

124
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,846
Hello.

125
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,515
-Hey! Get off!
-I told you.

126
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,558
I am running a bit late.

127
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,393
It's over, Spider.

128
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,645
Really?!

129
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,855
I know we all think that we're immortal.

130
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,732
We're supposed to feel that way.

131
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,067
We're graduating.

132
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,987
But, like our brief four years
in high school...

133
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,490
...what makes life valuable...

134
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,867
...is that it doesn't last forever.

135
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,537
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

136
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,581
And I know that now more than ever.

137
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,626
And I say it...

138
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,379
...today of all days...

139
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,257
...to remind us that time is luck.

140
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,556
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

141
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,475
Make yours count for something.

142
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,853
Fight for what matters to you.

143
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,354
No matter what.

144
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,982
Because even if we fall short...

145
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,985
...what better way is there to live?

146
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,583
I'll take that. That's not yours.

147
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,551
This is not end, Spider!

148
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,098
Michael Oates.

149
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,436
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

150
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,065
Alexis Ortiz.

151
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,030
Bo Parisi.

152
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,117
Peter Parker.

153
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,494
Hey, I think I know that guy.

154
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,913
Peter Park--

155
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,709
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,430
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

157
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:54,102
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

158
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,523
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

159
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,525
-I am so proud of you.
-You earned it.

160
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,152
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

161
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,988
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

162
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,240
Yeah, I know too.

163
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,618
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

164
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,036
The second thing he would say:

165
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,956
"Don't just follow the path,
make your own trail."

166
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,457
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

167
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,251
-No.
-What do you mean, no?

168
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,461
Ben told me he made it up.

169
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,298
You really did learn something here.

170
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,846
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

171
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,266
Yeah, me too.

172
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,434
And my folks.

173
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,396
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,192
-Would've been good.
-Perfect d--

175
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,945
All right, you can go. Go on.

176
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,196
I'll be right back.

177
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,032
-Is that your programme?
-Okay, guys. Get together right now.

178
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,910
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

179
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,745
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

180
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,915
-Okay. I'll just be over here.
-Yeah, just give me two seconds.

181
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,750
-Don't go too far.
-It's good to see you.

182
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,460
-All right.
-All right.

183
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,337
Hey.

184
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,591
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian Mob...

185
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,804
...and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

186
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,056
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

187
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,017
-Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
-Yes?

188
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,101
Okay.

189
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,270
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

190
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,272
Can't keep me away.

191
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,857
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

192
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,317
-I won't be.
-Okay.

193
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,905
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

194
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,365
All night? I wanna hear it
all night long.

195
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,659
-Over and over again, all night long.
-Okay.

196
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,578
-Oh, my gosh.
-It was pretty good.

197
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,789
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

198
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:43,587
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

199
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,672
Hi.

200
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,260
You're gonna make enemies.

201
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,304
People will get hurt.

202
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,225
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

203
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,354
Leave Gwen out of it.

204
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,107
Promise me that.

205
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,069
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

206
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,251
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

207
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,213
What are you doing? What are you...?

208
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,675
Peter.

209
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:33,846
What is it?

210
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,391
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

211
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,725
Are you all right?

212
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,352
I don't know what I'm doing.

213
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,523
It's my father, isn't it?

214
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,191
Yeah.

215
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,485
I see him everywhere I go.

216
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:53,282
I can't-- I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

217
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,326
-Yeah, but we've talked about this.
-I know, but, Gwen--

218
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,453
-It's not his choice.
-Gwen.

219
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:02,624
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

220
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,878
And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner
with your family.

221
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,256
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

222
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,758
I don't know, what does that make you?

223
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,386
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

224
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,268
-I thought that it meant you loved me.
-I do love you.

225
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,646
I love you.

226
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,108
Then why isn't that enough?

227
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,945
Because what if
something happens to you...

228
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,698
...just like it happened to him
because of me?

229
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,118
-No, wait, wait, wait.
-Listen. No, n--

230
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,037
I cannot let that happen.

231
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,914
Listen to me.

232
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,832
You're Spider-Man...

233
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,627
...and I love that.

234
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,173
But I love Peter Parker more.

235
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:55,802
That's worth it to me.

236
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,889
I can't lose you too.

237
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:03,810
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together...

238
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,398
...who does that work out for, Peter?

239
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,819
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

240
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,118
You have done this to me...

241
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:24,831
...again and again, Peter.

242
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,334
I can't live like this.

243
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,421
I break up with you.

244
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,926
I break up with you.

245
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,426
Good morning, New Yorkers.

246
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,012
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

247
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,555
A few clouds to start us off....

248
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,058
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate...

249
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,686
...over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

250
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,937
How about that Spider-Man?

251
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,565
Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.

252
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,400
We wanna hear your calls.

253
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,987
I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

254
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,365
Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?

255
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,700
It's you and me, taxpayers.

256
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,493
-You make this?
-Yeah.

257
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,621
This is a wind turbine.

258
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,290
You made this? No way.

259
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,958
This is amazing.

260
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,669
It's good as new, right?

261
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,796
I'll walk you home.

262
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,840
-What's your name?
-Jorge.

263
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,301
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

264
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,471
I don't feel like my kids are safe
with him out there.

265
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,557
Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.

266
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,937
Some folks think that there might be
more than one Spider-Man.

267
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,397
What do you think?

268
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,316
One guy or many?

269
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,402
I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.

270
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:18,654
Hey.

271
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,364
-Nice outfit.
-Thanks.

272
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,408
We have a caller on the line named
Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.

273
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,828
Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

274
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,414
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

275
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,832
He saved my life one time.

276
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,210
We sort of became best friends.

277
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,463
How much?

278
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,923
Hey, you're that spider guy.

279
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,299
I'm Spider-Man.

280
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,139
I'm Spider-Man.

281
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,268
This Spider-Man.... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.

282
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,312
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

283
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,429
Peter, honey?

284
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,639
Can I come in?

285
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,601
No!

286
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,895
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

287
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,230
You said you would take my car
into the shop...

288
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,940
...because it keeps dying, remember?

289
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,110
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

290
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,154
Peter, please just let me in. All right?

291
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,405
I'm trying to get my--

292
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,825
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

293
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,745
-No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
-What are you do--?

294
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,414
Peter! For goodness sakes.

295
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,626
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee--!

296
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,837
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

297
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,214
I'm just--

298
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,007
I'm very naked right now.

299
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,468
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

300
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,803
-It is?
-Yes.

301
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,848
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

302
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:11,934
We have no chimney.

303
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,477
What?

304
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,187
-You're late.
-I know, I'm late.

305
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,064
Downstairs, now.

306
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,067
-Can you leave? Because I'm naked.
-All right, I'm leaving.

307
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,695
-Morning, I love you.
-l love you too. Hurry up.

308
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,030
Well, look who's here.

309
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,448
Spidey.

310
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,284
How was your morning?

311
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,619
Aces, Max, aces.

312
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,872
I've been out saving the world.

313
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,456
Protecting everybody.

314
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,459
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

315
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,005
That's why you're here.

316
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,174
You remembered my birthday.

317
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,095
All the crime-fighting you've been doing,
and all of a sudden...

318
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:33,849
...you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to--

319
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,894
But of course you would.

320
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,645
Why wouldn't you visit me?

321
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,731
We're best friends.

322
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:47,070
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

323
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,490
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

324
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,534
I know what they say about you
in the press...

325
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,912
...but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

326
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,788
Because you're amazing.

327
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,042
That's what the press needs.

328
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,128
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

329
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,214
You like that, Spidey?

330
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,382
I like it a lot, Max.

331
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,302
Good. Because today...

332
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,095
...is going to be...

333
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,347
...amazing.

334
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah. Circuit 39.

335
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,982
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

336
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,194
I just wanna know if you can find
another waitress...

337
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,114
...to replace me because I start
my training rounds at the hospital.

338
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,909
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

339
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,452
Because he'll worry.

340
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,080
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

341
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,873
Double shift on Thursday.

342
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:41,625
Okay, bye.

343
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,129
-Who was that?
-Harvey.

344
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,425
-Doing a double shift, huh?
-Sometimes.

345
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,928
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

346
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:56,557
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar.

347
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,979
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle                 , so that ought to help.

348
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:05,315
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

349
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,025
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

350
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,611
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

351
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:13,282
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

352
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,534
-I'm doing my laundry.
-No, I do the laundry.

353
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:19,288
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

354
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,164
I understand that. I'm in college now.

355
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,126
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

356
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,879
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red...

357
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,130
-...so no.
-That was a mistake.

358
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,383
Because I was washing
the American flag.

359
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,678
-My-- Can I please just--?
-No one washes a flag.

360
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:35,929
I do, and I won't anymore.

361
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,182
-This is my machine.
-Fine. It's just underwear.

362
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,851
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

363
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,394
Back off, eat your breakfast.

364
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:47,274
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

365
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,859
-I'll do it.
-No, forget it.

366
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,944
-Give it to me.
-I'll do it some other time.

367
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,530
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

368
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,865
Jerk.

369
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:57,993
Not gonna make it.

370
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:03,665
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

371
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,793
-Watch it, buddy.
-Hey, let's go.

372
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,925
Oscorp Industries...

373
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:17,596
...is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

374
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,184
By converting ageing power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers...

375
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:25,938
...we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy...

376
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:28,649
...to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs...

377
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,193
...and eventually the world
for generations to come.

378
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,446
-Dillon. You're late.
-Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

379
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,532
Don't you realise Oscorp
is now responsible...

380
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,325
...for the entire city's energy supply?

381
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,536
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

382
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,913
...and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

383
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,666
...and those power grids
were designed by me.

384
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,084
You designed them?

385
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,461
Sure you did.

386
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,213
And I'm Spider-Man.

387
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,508
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

388
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,886
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna rip
your well-groomed head off!

389
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,097
Now, get to work.

390
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:03,559
What floor, please?

391
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,103
-Seventy-four.
-Thank you.

392
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:07,646
Oh, hold that!

393
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,107
-Can you hold that, please?
-I got it.

394
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,317
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

395
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,361
Most people would have
just let those close.

396
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,238
Most people don't notice other people.

397
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,866
-What floor, please?
-Sixty-three--

398
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,701
I got it. I got it. What is it?

399
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:21,994
Sixty-three.

400
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,121
Sixty-three, please.

401
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,414
-Thank you.
-In a hurry.

402
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:27,875
Thank you very much.

403
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,922
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

404
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:35,507
I'm Gwen.

405
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,551
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

406
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,012
Is it your birthday?

407
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,225
Oh, yeah. Well, I-- They--
Friends of mine made this flyer up.

408
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:49,021
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club. A lot of celebrities.

409
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,316
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

410
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:55,777
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

411
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,654
-...dressed as Spider-Man...
-That's exciting.

412
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,198
...hanging out near the blaze.

413
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,868
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

414
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,330
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

415
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,416
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved...

416
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,667
...me.

417
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,544
He said he needed me.

418
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,797
That must be a good feeling.

419
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,342
Sixty-third floor.

420
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,844
It was nice to meet you, Max.

421
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,557
Wait. She remembered my name.

422
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,243
Welcome home.

423
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,673
It's dark in there.

424
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:00,008
Your eyes will adjust.

425
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,178
It's better this way.

426
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,542
Dad.

427
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:43,218
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

428
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,305
Looking at my son...

429
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,640
...and seeing a stranger.

430
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,562
You have such potential, Harry.

431
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,482
Such fierce intelligence...

432
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,568
...and you're throwing it all away.

433
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,820
No, you threw me away.

434
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:07,242
You kicked me off to boarding school
when I was 11.

435
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,038
On my 16th birthday...

436
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,998
...you sent me Scotch.

437
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,334
Or one of your assistants did.

438
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,420
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

439
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:23,050
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

440
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:26,011
I don't expect forgiveness from you...

441
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,763
...anymore.

442
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,600
I don't believe in miracles.

443
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,561
How could you possibly understand...

444
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,607
...that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

445
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,609
...for something greater?

446
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,278
And not just for me.

447
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:44,947
For you!

448
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,160
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

449
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,707
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming...

450
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,752
...hiding under your skin...

451
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,089
...waiting to show itself.

452
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,675
To show you...

453
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,719
...who you really are.

454
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,518
Retroviral hyperplasia.

455
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,814
I never told you...

456
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,067
...that it's genetic.

457
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,737
Our disease...

458
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,074
...the Osborn curse.

459
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,452
And it began at your age.

460
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,247
Let me see it.

461
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,334
Your hand. Give it to me.

462
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:50,804
The greatest inheritance
I can give you...

463
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,931
...isn't merely money.

464
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,183
It's this.

465
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,353
The sum total of all my work.

466
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:02,566
Everything I did to stay alive.

467
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,277
Maybe you can succeed...

468
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,529
...where I failed.

469
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:33,347
Norman Osborn, the legendary
founder and CEO...

470
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,724
...of Oscorp Industries, has died...

471
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,643
...the Osborn estate has confirmed.

472
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,187
He is survived by his only son,
Harry Osborn...

473
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,273
...who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.

474
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:44,733
Harry.

475
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,902
Osborn changed
the medical profession's approach...

476
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,195
...to human healing...

477
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,822
...and affected the lives of millions.

478
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:55,536
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:

479
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:58,247
"We can do better.
And we should do better."

480
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:03,877
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."

481
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,630
But change isn't just a slogan.

482
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:08,757
It begins with hard work.

483
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,427
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

484
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,181
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

485
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,686
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

486
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,603
But not today.

487
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,731
Today is for mourning.

488
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,109
-Hello?
-Is this Gwen Stacy?

489
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,485
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

490
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,571
I'm calling from
the Oxford Scholars Programme.

491
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,572
We have some exciting news.

492
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,913
-Dillon. You stay here.
-What?

493
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,875
There's a current flow problem in
the lab. Why don't you take a look?

494
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,752
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

495
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,297
-Because you're special.
-Smythe.

496
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:49,922
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

497
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:51,717
Happy birthday.

498
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,848
Bioelectrogenesis:

499
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,894
The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off--

500
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,188
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

501
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,439
The genetically manipulated--

502
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,524
At least somebody's partying.

503
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,360
All right. Just a little sick.

504
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:13,947
I got your medicine, though.

505
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:18,619
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

506
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:19,953
Designed the grid....

507
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,706
-Warning:
-I should've stretched.

508
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,626
-Malfunction in Sector 5A.
-I know. Just a little indigestion.

509
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,378
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, did you, Kari?

510
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,589
Think you can sing "Happy Birthday"
for me?

511
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,799
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

512
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,301
-Gilbert?
-What?

513
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:38,055
It's Max. Can we shut down power
on Sector 32, please?

514
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,431
Forget it. I'm out the door.

515
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,475
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

516
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,060
-Sorry, Max.
-Hello?

517
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,899
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

518
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,859
This is crazy.

519
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:51,003
System restored.

520
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,629
Have a nice day.

521
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,590
Harry...

522
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,675
...Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny...

523
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,094
...in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

524
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:00,429
...breach of trust.

525
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,014
You mean people are pissed off...

526
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:05,184
...because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

527
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,687
Given that...

528
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,357
...all the animal hybrid programmes
he was involved in were destroyed...

529
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,860
...to restore investor confidence.

530
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:18,697
That is the Osborn way.

531
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:22,534
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

532
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:26,288
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

533
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:29,666
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

534
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,668
Sure, sure. I get it.

535
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,171
Twenty-year-old kid.

536
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,089
Two hundred billion dollar company.

537
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,925
What was Dad thinking?

538
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,677
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

539
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:46,350
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

540
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,811
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

541
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,189
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

542
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,733
-Harry--
-It's Mr. Osborn.

543
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,111
We're not friends.

544
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:04,826
Hi.

545
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,583
You were his assistant, right?

546
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:16,547
What's your name?

547
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,465
Felicia.

548
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:19,883
Felicia.

549
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:21,718
From now on...

550
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,764
...everybody at this table
works for Felicia...

551
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:29,560
...because Felicia works for me.

552
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,896
Would anybody like to speak up?

553
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,527
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

554
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,156
Sir, there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

555
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,585
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

556
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,838
Every single one.

557
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,889
Peter Parker.

558
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,267
It's like seeing a ghost.

559
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,769
Hey, Harry.

560
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:14,813
Random.

561
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,649
-What, 10 years.
-It's eight.

562
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,235
But you're close.

563
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:22,571
What's up?

564
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,907
I saw the news, man.

565
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:28,368
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and--

566
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,623
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

567
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,375
I'm with some people.

568
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,130
I'm in a....

569
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:41,924
I'm in a meeting.

570
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:43,759
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

571
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,511
I know it's been a long time.

572
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,805
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

573
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,642
And you were so there for me
when my parents....

574
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,978
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

575
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:56,813
Thank you.

576
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,901
It's good to see you, man.

577
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,613
It's good to see you.

578
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,407
I'm sorry about your dad.

579
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:12,538
You got your braces off.

580
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,920
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

581
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:24,800
There he is.

582
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:26,802
There he is.

583
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,847
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

584
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,768
You know, one of my manservants
holds the hair dryer...

585
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,812
...but I work the comb, okay?

586
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:41,066
So at least I'm not completely helpless.

587
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,318
You're stupid.

588
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,202
After graduation, I went to Brazil,
then Singapore.

589
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:53,453
-That's right, yeah.
-Yeah.

590
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,497
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

591
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:56,874
I saw you.

592
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:58,959
What do you mean, you saw me?

593
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:01,420
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

594
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,422
You know what I'm talking about?

595
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:08,343
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

597
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:09,928
I know.

598
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,348
What?

599
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,559
You got a lady?

600
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:21,899
That's a question.

601
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,443
That's a question.

602
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:25,944
Whoa, buddy.

603
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,530
No, I don't.

604
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:30,699
Yeah.

605
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,160
I don't know. It's....

606
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,540
I don't know. It's complicated.

607
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,626
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

608
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,589
What's her name? Who is she?

609
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:46,965
Her name's Gwen.

610
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:48,884
Gwen Stacy.

611
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:52,387
-Gwen Stacy.
-She works for you.

612
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,097
Really? She works for me?

613
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,643
-She does work-study at Oscorp.
-Is she a model employee?

614
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,855
You know, when my father
sent me away...

615
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,983
...I tried to forget
everything about this place.

616
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:09,404
I guess that kind of included you.

617
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,035
You ain't gotta explain anything
to me, man.

618
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,330
We both got dumped.

619
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,336
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

620
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,092
My dad left a briefcase.

621
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,095
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

622
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,639
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

623
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,683
How's that working out for you?

624
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,726
Perfectly.

625
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,110
Dude. Nice arm.

626
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,988
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

627
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,407
You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.

628
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,950
Yeah, right.

629
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,704
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

630
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:01,039
Giant lizards...

631
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,542
...and spider guys.

632
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:08,463
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

633
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:12,009
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

634
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:16,346
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

635
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,682
I'm so impressed.

636
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,018
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

637
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:22,895
For what?

638
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,856
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

639
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,525
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

640
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:33,822
Who was he?

641
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,825
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

642
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,828
No associates or friends to speak of.

643
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,415
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

644
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:44,791
The guy was...

645
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,752
...invisible.

646
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:51,590
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

647
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,842
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

648
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:58,722
In the meantime, if the press gets hold
of this accident, our stock will crater.

649
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:02,809
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

650
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,439
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

651
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:15,674
Hey.

652
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:44,286
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

653
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,885
Hey. Hi.

654
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:02,930
Hi.

655
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:05,474
You look amazing.

656
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:11,146
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of....

657
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:13,857
No. I don't-- I-- Spontaneous...

658
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,235
...is all right. You know.

659
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,946
Well, I just figured it was time.

660
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,281
You know?

661
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,450
Time that we try to be friends.

662
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:25,953
Yeah.

663
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:30,207
Friends, yeah. That's...

664
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,334
...great.

665
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,837
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

666
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,256
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

667
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:39,091
Keep it simple.

668
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:43,053
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

669
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,555
Well, I mean....

670
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:51,687
If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

671
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,189
-Some ground rules?
-Yeah, some ground rules.

672
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,816
Like that.

673
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,276
Like what?

674
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,779
-That laugh. That laugh.
-What?

675
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,573
That's off the table.

676
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,533
-My laugh is off the table?
-Off the table.

677
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:07,077
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

678
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:11,248
That's still adorable.

679
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,001
-That was not adorable.
-It's adorable.

680
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,460
No, it's not adorable.

681
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,380
-Okay. I have a ground rule.
-Oh, good.

682
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,882
What is it?

683
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,759
Don't tell me that I look amazing...

684
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:27,055
...with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

685
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,100
I'm really serious about that one.

686
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,312
-Oh, no.
-What?

687
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,355
I just figured out the next ground rule.

688
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:36,773
What?

689
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,525
No more of this.

690
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:40,736
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

691
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,571
-This?
-Don't think I haven't-- Hey.

692
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,532
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

693
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,201
This is killing me.

694
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,953
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

695
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,455
Come on.

696
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,459
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

697
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:35,541
Yeah. So I did that.

698
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:40,671
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

699
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,590
-Yeah. No, I know.
-Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

700
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,260
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

701
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:50,681
How do you know that?

702
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,561
How do you know I love it there?

703
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:57,521
Because....

704
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,400
Because you told me.

705
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,697
It just opened last month.

706
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,286
Have you been following me?

707
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,126
I knew it.

708
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,003
How often?

709
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,091
Just once a day.

710
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:27,676
Sometimes.

711
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,763
Sometimes more.

712
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:37,895
Oh, boy.

713
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,396
Why?

714
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,485
Make sure I'm safe?

715
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,197
-And....
-And what?

716
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,867
And because it's the closest I can get
to still being with you.

717
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,215
I'm moving to England.

718
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:15,849
What?

719
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:17,809
Yeah.

720
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:21,855
I have a--
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

721
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:26,109
In molecular medicine.
And it's between me and this other kid.

722
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,237
There's this oral exam
that we have to do...

723
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:31,240
...and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

724
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,367
And-- And it's-- It could be him.

725
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,410
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

726
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:38,956
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

727
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,167
Yeah.

728
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,169
And I'm really excited.

729
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:46,922
That's....

730
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:51,510
England.

731
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,681
What?

732
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:54,114
Station, I need a 10-85.

733
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:57,367
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

734
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,494
Folks, could you step to the side?

735
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:01,872
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

736
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:05,751
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

737
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:08,921
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

738
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,131
Let me see your hands, please!

739
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:14,176
You stay right where you are!

740
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:15,636
Do not move!

741
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:18,013
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

742
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:37,533
Get down on the ground, now!

743
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:40,410
-Stop!
-Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

744
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,329
-It's not my fault!
-Sir!

745
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:43,956
-Stop!
-I'm gonna need for you...

746
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:45,916
-Please!
-...to get down on the ground, now!

747
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,378
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

748
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,257
Oh, my gosh.

749
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,302
They see me. You see me.

750
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:00,806
You see me.

751
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,891
They see me.

752
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,947
-No! No! Stop!
-On the ground now!

753
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:19,825
-Don't do that. Please!
-It's over, freak!

754
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:22,369
Wait! It's not my fault.

755
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:23,620
It's not my fault!

756
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:28,000
I said stop!

757
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,592
I'm glad you're not one of those cops
that rides a horse.

758
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,351
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

759
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,317
All units, hold your fire! I repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!

760
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,362
Stop. Stop it.

761
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:58,739
Yo, Sparkles!

762
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,658
Hey, how you doing?

763
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:05,162
-It's you?
-Yeah, I know it's me.

764
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:06,288
Who are you?

765
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,333
You don't remember me?

766
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:11,710
No. Should I?

767
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:15,756
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

768
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:17,424
You saved me.

769
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:19,343
You said you needed me.

770
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:22,262
-You're the guy with the blueprints.
-Yes.

771
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:23,722
Blueprints.

772
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:28,852
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

773
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:31,897
-What's your name again?
-How could you forget me?

774
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:34,566
-I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
-It's Max.

775
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:36,610
-Is it "Max"?
-Yes.

776
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,779
I'm sorry I didn't recognise you
with the--

777
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:40,697
You look different.

778
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,407
How are you?

779
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:44,493
I don't know what's going on with me.

780
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:46,787
I can see that. I can-- I believe you.

781
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:52,334
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much....

782
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,503
I got so much anger.

783
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:57,506
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

784
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,508
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

785
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,510
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

786
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:04,346
-It's gonna be all right.
-Got a clear shot. Standing by.

787
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:06,515
-I don't want them shooting me anymore.
-They won't.

788
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,268
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

789
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:12,855
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

790
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,357
You and me, okay?
It's just you and me talking.

791
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:18,986
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

792
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:20,237
I just--

793
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,866
I just wanted everyone to see me.

794
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:26,034
He makes a move, you take that shot.

795
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:28,203
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

796
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:30,247
Away from all these people, okay?

797
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:31,456
Yeah, yes.

798
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,251
No! No! Stop!

799
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,131
Max!

800
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,360
Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!

801
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:04,072
You stupid freak!

802
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:11,955
Electro dummy!

803
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:21,173
Get out of here, you freak!

804
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,424
Shut up!

805
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:26,720
You're so selfish.

806
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:29,097
Stay with me, Max.

807
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:30,641
You set me up.

808
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:32,100
No, I didn't set you up.

809
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,852
You lied to me!

810
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:35,854
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

811
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:24,987
Are you all right?

812
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,411
It's my birthday.

813
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:34,621
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

814
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,743
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

815
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:58,288
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

816
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:11,927
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

817
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:13,554
-Mike.
-Yeah.

818
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:15,055
-Big John.
-Nice job.

819
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:16,723
Nice work, fellas.

820
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,768
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

821
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:29,278
Spider-Man.

822
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:36,952
England?

823
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:39,705
Really?

824
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:50,966
Good talk.

825
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,819
Our coverage of this breaking story...

826
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:13,322
...begins with New York 1's
Jessica Abo at the scene.

827
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,991
That's right. We're standing here
with two eyewitnesses...

828
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,076
...who are going to tell us
what they just saw.

829
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:20,078
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

830
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,872
How do you think
he beat this creature?

831
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:23,916
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized,
Spidey's suit.

832
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,709
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.

833
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:28,253
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.

834
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,005
Thank you very much
to the two of you.

835
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:32,716
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.

836
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:35,427
We will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.

837
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,013
For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.

838
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:28,707
Online polls show a sudden uptick...

839
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,335
...in public sentiment
in favour of the web-crawler.

840
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:35,422
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

841
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:09,039
Next-generation military body armour.

842
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:13,293
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair...

843
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:15,838
...direct nervous system interface.

844
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:27,057
So the common household spider...

845
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:28,642
...unlike human cells...

846
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:31,478
...theirs contain the power
to self-heal...

847
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:35,274
...from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.

848
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:40,112
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

849
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:45,242
Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.

850
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,328
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

851
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:51,623
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

852
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,376
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

853
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:57,796
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

854
01:03:58,046 --> 01:04:01,800
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...

855
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,386
...the battery might explode!

856
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,221
Explode!

857
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:11,894
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

858
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:13,270
You're not invincible.

859
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,439
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

860
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:58,315
-Hello.
-Pete.

861
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:00,192
It's me.

862
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,152
Hey, Harry. What--?

863
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,947
What time is it?

864
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:08,992
Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

865
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:10,702
I need to see you.

866
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:12,162
You all right?

867
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,789
Not really, Pete.

868
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,499
I'm dying.

869
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:18,502
But I think you can help
save my life.

870
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:24,091
You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.

871
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:27,219
The hope is to extract the venom
from their glands...

872
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:29,888
...and turn that into a cure.

873
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:32,724
An agent that heals diseased cells.

874
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:38,105
And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases...

875
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:40,440
...like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

876
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,030
They never made it to human trials.

877
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:50,993
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

878
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:55,455
Except maybe this.

879
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:05,090
Spider-Man.

880
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,342
What about him?

881
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,013
He was bitten by one of those things,
and it worked.

882
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:15,267
I don't know how
and I don't know why...

883
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:19,146
...but he can do everything else
a spider can...

884
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:21,523
...including self-heal.

885
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:23,483
I need to find him.

886
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:25,861
I need his blood.

887
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:42,753
You need...

888
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,006
...Spider-Man's blood?

889
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:51,637
It'll save my life.

890
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:53,972
It may not, Har.

891
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:56,558
It may not be that simple.

892
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:58,560
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

893
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,811
Connors was weak.

894
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,314
This is me, Peter.

895
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:04,650
I don't think you can just set up a van...

896
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:06,818
...and have him donate.

897
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:12,282
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about
people shoving needles and--

898
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:13,659
He's sensitive, okay.

899
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,914
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is...

900
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:21,458
...and I will go ask him myself.

901
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:22,960
What?

902
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:27,965
-You took his picture.
-So?

903
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,217
-You know him.
-Harry.

904
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,762
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

905
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,222
I don't know him.

906
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:40,018
I put together what you said
at the river.

907
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:44,314
-What I--
-About how he gives people hope.

908
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:47,734
Come on.

909
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:02,541
What in the--?

910
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,047
Just say yes.

911
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:17,890
Don't turn your back on me!

912
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:21,685
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

913
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:24,813
Please.

914
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,024
Peter, please.

915
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:29,651
I can't.

916
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:34,698
Please.

917
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:41,205
I'm gonna try...

918
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:43,707
...and find Spider-Man.

919
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:56,761
-Hey, what's security doing over here?
-That's so weird.

920
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:57,888
She's right over there.

921
01:09:05,312 --> 01:09:06,772
Hey! Miss Stacy!

922
01:09:23,037 --> 01:09:24,038
Hi.

923
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:25,541
Hi.

924
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:27,167
What are you doing here?

925
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:29,252
What are you doing here?

926
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:32,296
Come here.

927
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:41,055
She's not here. Check another floor.

928
01:09:41,305 --> 01:09:42,683
-Got it.
-Yes, sir!

929
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,017
You're in trouble.

930
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:45,435
-Yeah.
-Who's that guy?

931
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:48,438
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

932
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:51,942
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

933
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:55,362
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

934
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:58,574
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way.
He was, like, a fanatic.

935
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:02,452
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

936
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:04,746
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

937
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:09,042
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

938
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:10,544
-My God.
-He's completely erased.

939
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,004
That's Oscorp.

940
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:14,131
And what about you? Why are you here?

941
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:15,424
Harry.

942
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:17,134
-Osborn?
-He's dying.

943
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:18,927
-What do you mean?
-He's dying.

944
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:21,597
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life...

945
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:24,516
...is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

946
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:27,227
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

947
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:29,271
Or something worse.

948
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,064
I know.

949
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:33,775
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

950
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:37,196
This is the most clichéd hiding place
you could've chosen.

951
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:39,406
-This is the stupidest hiding place.
-I'm sorry...

952
01:10:39,656 --> 01:10:43,619
...I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

953
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:47,623
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't....

954
01:10:57,341 --> 01:11:00,427
-You just kissed me.
-I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

955
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:02,471
How'd you like it?

956
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,306
It felt a little bit rushed.

957
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:06,683
I know. I know, I know.

958
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:10,687
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

959
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:11,855
Okay.

960
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:28,497
-God! Damn it!
-I'm so--

961
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:31,959
I just spilled a hot latte all over your--
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

962
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:34,044
And you too? I'm sorry.

963
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:35,796
-Miss! Stay right there!
-Sir.

964
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:38,298
-Just stay right--
-Wait, wait, wait.

965
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:39,550
Hey! Stop!

966
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,011
All right. On your way.

967
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,514
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

968
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,479
-Gwen Stacy.
-Oh, my God.

969
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:54,731
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

970
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,316
No, it's okay.

971
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,486
I'm-- I'm Harry.

972
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:01,196
Yeah.

973
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:05,576
-I'm an old friend of Peter's.
-Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

974
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,452
I was kind of rushing.

975
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:10,122
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

976
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,457
I thought you two had broken up.

977
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:17,671
Yeah. Yes, we had.

978
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,464
And it's....

979
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,592
-It's complicated.
-Complicated. Yeah.

980
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:25,053
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

981
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:26,305
Yeah.

982
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:28,098
Yeah.

983
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:30,267
Yeah, you're right.

984
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:32,603
But that's why he needs you.

985
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:35,439
Right?

986
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:40,110
To help him make his choices clear.

987
01:12:43,947 --> 01:12:44,948
Nice to meet you, Harry.

988
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,202
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

989
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:47,135
You've been in a terrible accident.

990
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:50,389
I'm Dr. Kafka.

991
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:52,975
I'm here to help you.

992
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,935
Course you are, doc.

993
01:13:55,978 --> 01:14:00,065
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

994
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:02,651
High-intensity capacitors.

995
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,112
The kind they make at Oscorp.

996
01:14:05,696 --> 01:14:08,282
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

997
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:09,700
You are correct.

998
01:14:10,075 --> 01:14:12,035
I'm here to study you.

999
01:14:12,286 --> 01:14:16,957
To understand what you are,
why you are.

1000
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,084
Und                 I will get results.

1001
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:26,300
I always do.

1002
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,470
You do realise...

1003
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:32,890
...you locked me in a prison...

1004
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:34,725
...that runs...

1005
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:36,810
...on electricity?

1006
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:41,940
I can feel it in the walls.

1007
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:44,109
I can feel it in my veins.

1008
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:47,654
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

1009
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:50,240
It's a force of nature.

1010
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:52,910
Like me.

1011
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,877
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1012
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:04,379
Well, so do I.

1013
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:12,179
I'm dying to know...

1014
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:14,014
...doc.

1015
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:17,768
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

1016
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:19,520
Because if you don't...

1017
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:22,189
...I'm gonna kill the light.

1018
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:26,902
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1019
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,613
A world without power.

1020
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:32,241
A world without mercy.

1021
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,034
A world...

1022
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:35,911
...without Spider-Man.

1023
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:40,707
And everyone will be able to see me
for who I truly am.

1024
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,377
And who are you?

1025
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:45,379
Don't you know?

1026
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,256
I'm Electro.

1027
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:55,806
Warning: Electrical restraint
capacity reached.

1028
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:58,809
Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1029
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,686
Very impressive...

1030
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:03,313
...Electro.

1031
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:05,941
Lockdown initiated.

1032
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,163
Aunt May?

1033
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:26,920
What are you doing?

1034
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:28,797
When did you do this?

1035
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,934
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1036
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:44,188
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1037
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,733
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1038
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:49,818
-I don't lie.
-I know you love me, but you do.

1039
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,445
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1040
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,239
You have to tell me, May.

1041
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,450
That's my father.

1042
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,118
Yes, he was your father.

1043
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:00,996
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1044
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:02,873
...here.

1045
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,001
I need the truth.

1046
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:10,797
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1047
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:12,799
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1048
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,761
...was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1049
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:20,766
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1050
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:24,603
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1051
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,104
Your father?

1052
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:27,523
No.

1053
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:31,902
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth...

1054
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:34,821
...and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1055
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:39,785
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

1056
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,662
...who has to take nursing classes...

1057
01:17:41,912 --> 01:17:44,790
...with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1058
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,125
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1059
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:48,502
I don't know how. And--

1060
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:52,464
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1061
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:55,384
...who was never here. No.

1062
01:17:56,552 --> 01:17:58,095
No, I won't tell you.

1063
01:17:58,387 --> 01:17:59,471
You're my boy.

1064
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,057
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1065
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:03,392
And I won't hurt you.

1066
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:14,736
I'm your boy.

1067
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:16,738
You're my everything.

1068
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:21,451
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1069
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:24,121
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1070
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:28,000
-I love you so much.
-I know.

1071
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,214
It's okay.

1072
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:36,675
It's okay.

1073
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:40,804
May.

1074
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:46,101
I need to know.

1075
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:51,940
All right.

1076
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:57,404
I'll tell you everything I know.

1077
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:01,867
But it will hurt you.

1078
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,077
Okay.

1079
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:09,208
A few days after the funeral...

1080
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:13,212
...two government men came to see us.

1081
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:18,175
They said the genetics research...

1082
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,887
...that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable...

1083
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:24,765
...and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1084
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:27,017
And that's why he ran off with it.

1085
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:28,977
They said he was a traitor.

1086
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:30,979
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1087
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:34,149
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1088
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:35,859
...for the money.

1089
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:38,237
I don't--

1090
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:43,075
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't--
This doesn't make sense.

1091
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,954
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1092
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:48,455
It doesn't make any sense.

1093
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:49,915
Peter, I don't know.

1094
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:53,377
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1095
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:55,879
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1096
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:58,632
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1097
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:01,969
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1098
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,888
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1099
01:20:05,138 --> 01:20:07,307
Came home at 6 every night.

1100
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:09,893
I don't know.

1101
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:13,689
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1102
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:17,234
Even from the people they love.

1103
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:24,616
Peter.

1104
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,162
Peter.

1105
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,710
Mr. Osborn.

1106
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:40,883
Look up.

1107
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:43,635
Think you're looking for me.

1108
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:48,557
I cannot believe my eyes.

1109
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:51,602
Spider-Man.

1110
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:00,903
Just the man I wanted to see.

1111
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:05,032
You...

1112
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:07,951
...talked to Peter?

1113
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:09,912
Yeah.

1114
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:19,213
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1115
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:23,926
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1116
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:25,302
Excuse me?

1117
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,013
It's too dangerous.

1118
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:31,266
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1119
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,520
I'm already dying.

1120
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:38,273
Your blood can't make me die more.

1121
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:40,275
But it could do something worse.

1122
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:44,196
Okay.

1123
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:47,574
All right, how much?

1124
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:50,118
-How much what?
-How much do you want? Name it.

1125
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:54,331
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1126
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:57,835
-I don't want your money.
-Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1127
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:59,670
I don't.

1128
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:03,382
I thought you....

1129
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:06,552
I thought you were supposed to
save people.

1130
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:11,265
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1131
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:13,809
You're-- You're just gonna let me die.

1132
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:17,271
-I'm trying to protect you right now.
-No. No, you are not.

1133
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:19,940
You're trying to protect yourself.

1134
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:24,736
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1135
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:26,655
-...to figure out something else.
-I do not have time!

1136
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:35,581
I'm sorry.

1137
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:46,925
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1138
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:03,442
-Hey! Hi.
-Hi.

1139
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:06,612
-Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
-I'm running late right now.

1140
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,448
-It's just gonna take a second.
-I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1141
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:12,993
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1142
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:15,204
Everything's a mess.
Everything's insane.

1143
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:18,040
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1144
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:20,834
Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1145
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,920
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do
with Harry.

1146
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,630
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1147
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,507
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1148
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:29,593
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1149
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:31,345
I don't know. I got no idea.

1150
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:35,849
-Oh, God.
-I got nothing. I got nothing.

1151
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:38,852
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is....

1152
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:41,647
Ms. Stacy?

1153
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:43,440
Shall I take you upstairs?

1154
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,068
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1155
01:23:46,318 --> 01:23:50,489
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1156
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:52,533
-Okay.
-Thank you. I'm sorry.

1157
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:55,953
-I'm-- Okay. I have to be--
-Where are we?

1158
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:57,579
I'm at my...

1159
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:00,999
...last interview for Oxford
right now.

1160
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:04,878
-Oxford. I didn't know.
-Yeah.

1161
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:07,422
Okay, well....

1162
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:09,550
I'm sorry to bother you...

1163
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,385
...my fair lady-- Madam.

1164
01:24:11,635 --> 01:24:13,387
But who am I?

1165
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:15,180
I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins.

1166
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:17,474
I'm one of the young professors
at Harvard...

1167
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:20,686
...and I've been trying to get her
to be in my....

1168
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:23,647
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1169
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:26,817
And she's just the best person I know
and a scientific genius.

1170
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,068
And....

1171
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:29,736
Anyway, God save the queen.

1172
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:31,780
-I'm sorry everything's happening--
-Can you wait?

1173
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,532
Peter. Peter.

1174
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:35,367
What do you want to say to me?

1175
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:37,661
What's the "one thing"?

1176
01:24:41,707 --> 01:24:43,584
I have to go to England, Peter.

1177
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:46,962
It's important to me.

1178
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,970
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1179
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,723
You know? I don't know.

1180
01:24:57,973 --> 01:24:59,308
Maybe we're just...

1181
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,351
...going different ways. I don't--

1182
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:03,687
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1183
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:07,816
Gwen.

1184
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:12,112
Good luck.

1185
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,951
Hi. Sorry.

1186
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:21,473
He took the D train every morning
at 7 to work.

1187
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:24,518
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1188
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:34,027
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1189
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:36,655
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension...

1190
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:39,616
...of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square...

1191
01:26:39,867 --> 01:26:43,495
...built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye...

1192
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:47,165
...to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1193
01:26:57,342 --> 01:26:58,635
Mr. Osborn?

1194
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,513
You all right?

1195
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:04,266
Is there anything I can get you?

1196
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:07,519
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1197
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:09,229
Spiders?

1198
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:11,440
The ones that they destroyed...

1199
01:27:12,608 --> 01:27:15,777
..."to restore investor confidence."

1200
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:18,989
Go home, Felicia.

1201
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,532
Take the day off.

1202
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:23,911
Harry.

1203
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:29,833
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1204
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:36,465
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1205
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:39,343
Before they destroyed the spiders...

1206
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:41,929
...they had the venom extracted.

1207
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,724
What?

1208
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:49,436
What are you saying?

1209
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:51,522
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1210
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:54,608
...but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1211
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:56,985
Where is it?

1212
01:27:57,361 --> 01:27:59,154
It's somewhere in the building.

1213
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:04,201
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1214
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,038
Special Projects.

1215
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:09,706
Most recent entry:

1216
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,250
One hour ago.

1217
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:14,169
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1218
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,341
Accessing Ravencroft Archive.

1219
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:26,265
File 713.

1220
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:30,143
What the hell?

1221
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,146
File 71.

1222
01:28:33,397 --> 01:28:35,607
Subject: Dillon, Max.

1223
01:28:35,858 --> 01:28:37,359
And then I'm gonna kill the light...

1224
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:41,697
...so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.

1225
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:43,907
A world without power.

1226
01:28:44,157 --> 01:28:45,367
A world...

1227
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,286
...without Spider-Man.

1228
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:48,954

He's busy.

1231
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,545
What did you do?

1232
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:59,214
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1233
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:03,510
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1234
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:08,140
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1235
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:12,186
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1236
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:14,354
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1237
01:29:14,605 --> 01:29:16,773
Progress has its stepping stones.

1238
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:19,818
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been--

1239
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:21,653
How do I put this gently?

1240
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:22,905
--fired.

1241
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:26,283
You are not going to bury me too.

1242
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:29,203
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1243
01:29:29,995 --> 01:29:31,622
It's only a matter of time.

1244
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,541
You're going to die a horrible death.

1245
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,543
Like your father.

1246
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:38,754
The difference is...

1247
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:41,089
...no one is going to miss you.

1248
01:29:44,134 --> 01:29:45,135
Get him out.

1249
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:46,386
Wait. Wait.

1250
01:29:53,727 --> 01:29:55,395
I know my way out.

1251
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:07,658
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1252
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:10,077
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1253
01:30:10,327 --> 01:30:11,662
I tried. Good luck.

1254
01:30:11,912 --> 01:30:14,706
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

1255
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:40,143
Test.

1256
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:42,479
My name is Richard Parker.

1257
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:44,815
Whatever lies will be told about me...

1258
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:46,942
...I would like the world
to know the truth.

1259
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:51,154
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...

1260
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:56,243
...when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organisation...

1261
01:32:56,493 --> 01:32:58,996
...to continue funding my research.

1262
01:32:59,246 --> 01:33:01,623
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1263
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:04,418
Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.

1264
01:33:04,668 --> 01:33:06,003
So I refused.

1265
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:09,381
And now, to eliminate me
from the picture...

1266
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:13,510
...Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me...

1267
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,264
...in order to take control
of my work.

1268
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:22,019
Can I help you?

1269
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:24,563
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1270
01:33:24,813 --> 01:33:26,106
I'm Harry Osborn.

1271
01:33:26,356 --> 01:33:30,360
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1272
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:33,488
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1273
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:36,325
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1274
01:33:40,037 --> 01:33:42,456
But it doesn't matter
because there's something else...

1275
01:33:43,498 --> 01:33:45,292
...that Norman doesn't know.

1276
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,504
The human DNA...

1277
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:51,632
...that I implanted in the spiders...

1278
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:54,635
...was my own.

1279
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,431
Which means that without me...

1280
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:01,350
...without my bloodline...

1281
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:06,230
...Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1282
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:09,024
Keep Electro incubated...

1283
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:13,445
...with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und                 phenobarbital.

1284
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:19,409
I have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives.

1285
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,620
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1286
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:25,082
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1287
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:29,127
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.

1288
01:34:29,378 --> 01:34:31,171
But as a father...

1289
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:34,675
...it means I may not
see my boy again.

1290
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:39,012
And nothing is as important to me...

1291
01:34:39,763 --> 01:34:41,765
...as my son, Peter.

1292
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,892
Nothing in this world.

1293
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:46,478
But I have a responsibility...

1294
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:48,772
...to protect the world
from what I've created...

1295
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:51,984
...and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.

1296
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,237
People will say I am a monster...

1297
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:57,823
...for what I've done.

1298
01:34:59,533 --> 01:35:01,034
And maybe they're right.

1299
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:05,914
I always thought that I'd have more...

1300
01:35:06,164 --> 01:35:07,249
...time.

1301
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,376
Dad? Dad!

1302
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:10,919
I'm sorry.

1303
01:35:29,855 --> 01:35:31,440
Sedation off.

1304
01:35:38,363 --> 01:35:40,365
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1305
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:42,784
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1306
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:44,703
Who are you?

1307
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:48,081
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1308
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:51,126
I should kill you.

1309
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:53,086
Oh, come on.

1310
01:35:53,587 --> 01:35:55,506
Think bigger, Max.

1311
01:35:55,756 --> 01:35:57,758
I'm not the one you want.

1312
01:35:58,008 --> 01:35:59,301
You want Spider-Man.

1313
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:02,638
And I can give him to you.

1314
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:07,559
But I need something first.

1315
01:36:08,936 --> 01:36:11,146
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1316
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:13,023
Get you in?

1317
01:36:13,482 --> 01:36:14,942
You own it.

1318
01:36:16,193 --> 01:36:17,194
Not anymore.

1319
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:18,695
Oscorp betrayed us both...

1320
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:22,783
...so I can't get in there without you
and you can't get out of here without me.

1321
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:26,328
-What's happening?
-Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.

1322
01:36:26,578 --> 01:36:29,122
Get a containment team up there now.

1323
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:31,500
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1324
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:33,460
You submitted the design for the grid...

1325
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,587
...and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1326
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:37,631
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1327
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:40,592
-How?
-It is all the power in the city, Max...

1328
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:42,761
...and it's right at your fingertips.

1329
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:44,805
And then once you shut down
the grid...

1330
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:48,976
...Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1331
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:51,979
Break it! Break it!

1332
01:36:55,065 --> 01:36:56,650
Max, we don't have much time!

1333
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,236
Go! Go, go! Go!

1334
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:01,530
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1335
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:02,823
Because I need you!

1336
01:37:04,741 --> 01:37:05,742
You need me?

1337
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:08,912
Yes. I need you.

1338
01:37:09,246 --> 01:37:13,292
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1339
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:14,459
You need me?

1340
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:16,628
Yes. I need you.

1341
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:18,881
I need you. Please! Please!

1342
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:21,800
Please!

1343
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:24,011
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1344
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:25,262
Please, Max!

1345
01:37:25,512 --> 01:37:27,431
I need you! I need you!

1346
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:18,857
No!

1347
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:24,530
You wanna be my friend?

1348
01:38:25,197 --> 01:38:27,366
I thought we were already friends.

1349
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,410
I had a friend once.

1350
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:33,247
It didn't work out.

1351
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:35,457
Yeah. Me too.

1352
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:39,044
Then let's go catch a spider.

1353
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:44,967
You have one new voice message.

1354
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:49,054
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1355
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:53,976
I got in to Oxford.

1356
01:38:55,143 --> 01:38:58,063
It's very exciting.

1357
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:01,900
I came by your house a little bit ago
and I....

1358
01:39:02,526 --> 01:39:03,569
You weren't there...

1359
01:39:03,819 --> 01:39:07,197
...and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now...

1360
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:10,117
...because there's this early
summer class that I found out about...

1361
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:13,453
...and I thought that
it would somehow...

1362
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:17,833
...be easier, I guess, this way.

1363
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:21,837
I think that maybe it's time...

1364
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:24,256
...to let this go.

1365
01:39:24,923 --> 01:39:27,217
And that's not because
I don't love you.

1366
01:39:27,467 --> 01:39:30,762
It's actually because I do, so....

1367
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:32,764
Okay, bye.

1368
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:49,698
-We have to move, now.
-Why? What's happened?

1369
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:04,254
Remember me?

1370
01:40:08,634 --> 01:40:09,968
Oh, my, oh, my.

1371
01:40:10,219 --> 01:40:12,179
How the tables have turned.

1372
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:15,140
I know it's hard to admit...

1373
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:19,728
...but how spectacular a move is this?

1374
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:23,565
-Am I right?
-Right as rain.

1375
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:27,819
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother...

1376
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:30,864
...it is time to grant me a wish.

1377
01:40:31,114 --> 01:40:35,327
-I want in to Special--
-How dare you come back in here?

1378
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:39,998
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective...

1379
01:40:40,249 --> 01:40:42,209
...urchin freaks.

1380
01:40:44,795 --> 01:40:49,967
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1381
01:41:03,605 --> 01:41:04,648
Clear.

1382
01:41:06,483 --> 01:41:09,027
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1383
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:13,949
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1384
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:21,123
The grid is all yours.

1385
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:55,824
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1386
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:03,248
What is all this stuff?

1387
01:42:03,498 --> 01:42:05,000
The future.

1388
01:42:18,764 --> 01:42:19,973
Load one up.

1389
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:25,812
It won't work.

1390
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:29,733
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1391
01:42:29,983 --> 01:42:33,946
You've actually already run human
trials. You're just too stupid to know it.

1392
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:40,035
Do it. Now.

1393
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:02,182
You had it all this time.

1394
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:32,773
It's Spider-Man.

1395
01:44:38,695 --> 01:44:39,863
Stop the cab.

1396
01:44:40,113 --> 01:44:42,157
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1397
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:14,314
-Hi.
-Hi.

1398
01:45:15,023 --> 01:45:16,775
-Did you get my message?
-What message?

1399
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:19,695
-The message right there.
-Oh, that. That was you?

1400
01:45:19,945 --> 01:45:21,738
-Don't do that.
-I couldn't make it out.

1401
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:24,116
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1402
01:45:25,784 --> 01:45:27,494
Because I love you.

1403
01:45:28,537 --> 01:45:30,956
-And no offence, but you're wrong.
-I'm wrong about what?

1404
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:33,041
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1405
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:35,627
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1406
01:45:36,712 --> 01:45:38,881
And you're always gonna be my path.

1407
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,385
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1408
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:45,387
But I'm tired of them.

1409
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:50,309
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1410
01:45:50,809 --> 01:45:52,728
We've all gotta make a choice.

1411
01:45:54,646 --> 01:45:56,106
Right? Well, I choose you.

1412
01:45:58,734 --> 01:45:59,985
So...

1413
01:46:00,235 --> 01:46:01,778
...here's my thought.

1414
01:46:03,405 --> 01:46:04,740
England.

1415
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,409
Both of us.

1416
01:46:09,244 --> 01:46:10,871
I'm following you now.

1417
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:13,248
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1418
01:46:13,832 --> 01:46:15,792
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1419
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,172
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1420
01:46:20,422 --> 01:46:22,090
-Yeah.
-They got tons of crime, it seems.

1421
01:46:22,341 --> 01:46:24,259
-Tons.
-They got...

1422
01:46:24,927 --> 01:46:26,470
...Jack the Ripper.

1423
01:46:27,304 --> 01:46:28,305
What?

1424
01:46:28,555 --> 01:46:31,099
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper
yet. You didn't know that?

1425
01:46:51,161 --> 01:46:52,329
What the hell is that?

1426
01:47:02,965 --> 01:47:04,508
Is that Max?

1427
01:47:05,092 --> 01:47:07,344
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1428
01:47:15,936 --> 01:47:17,646
PNA 322, you are--

1429
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:20,065
-I'm black.
-I have nothing.

1430
01:47:20,315 --> 01:47:22,651
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1431
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:25,404
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1432
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:27,573
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1433
01:47:27,823 --> 01:47:31,577
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1434
01:47:31,827 --> 01:47:34,663
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1435
01:47:34,913 --> 01:47:37,749
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1436
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,669
How will I stop him? Every time
I get close, he fries my web shooters.

1437
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:42,880
-Have you tried grounding them?
-Tried everything.

1438
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:45,174
-Rubber, plastic--
-Did you try magnetizing them?

1439
01:47:45,424 --> 01:47:47,885
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1440
01:47:48,135 --> 01:47:50,304
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1441
01:47:50,971 --> 01:47:53,599
If you magnetize a nail with a battery....

1442
01:47:54,016 --> 01:47:55,893
-It holds an electric charge.
-Yes.

1443
01:47:58,270 --> 01:48:01,481
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1444
01:48:01,732 --> 01:48:03,025
How do you hear?

1445
01:48:04,026 --> 01:48:05,360
Approach, do you copy?

1446
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:07,571
Radio's working. It's not us.

1447
01:48:14,494 --> 01:48:19,166
Do not panic. Everyone,
please return to your vehicles.

1448
01:48:19,416 --> 01:48:21,293
Go back to your cars.

1449
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:22,961
Remain calm.

1450
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:27,007
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1451
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:28,717
-Go into your homes.
-Officer!

1452
01:48:29,134 --> 01:48:30,260
Spider-Man!

1453
01:48:30,511 --> 01:48:32,763
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1454
01:48:33,013 --> 01:48:35,766
-I knew who he was. What can we do?
-Jumper cables.

1455
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:38,143
-Jumper cables?
-Yes. And copper wire.

1456
01:48:38,393 --> 01:48:40,812
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?!

1457
01:48:41,563 --> 01:48:42,564
Yes.

1458
01:48:43,398 --> 01:48:45,108
-Your suit'll ground you.
-All right, do it.

1459
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:51,698
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1460
01:48:51,949 --> 01:48:52,950
Okay, it works, good.

1461
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,868
That is why you were number two
at Midtown.

1462
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:55,911
Rub it in. Okay.

1463
01:48:58,372 --> 01:48:59,957
-I gotta go.
-I'm coming with you.

1464
01:49:00,207 --> 01:49:02,042
-You're not coming with me.
-Yes, I am.

1465
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:03,544
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm coming.

1466
01:49:03,794 --> 01:49:06,213
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1467
01:49:06,463 --> 01:49:10,425
-I'm coming with you! You need me!
-Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1468
01:49:10,676 --> 01:49:11,927
Shut the thing.

1469
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:14,054
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1470
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:17,182
Peter!

1471
01:49:17,432 --> 01:49:19,268
We still don't have backup generators.

1472
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:20,894
Get me Engineering!

1473
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:22,437
I need a respirator right now.

1474
01:49:22,688 --> 01:49:24,523
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1475
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:25,941
Hang on.

1476
01:49:26,692 --> 01:49:27,734
Okay.

1477
01:49:50,549 --> 01:49:52,801
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1478
01:49:53,093 --> 01:49:56,346
It's time to meet our destiny.

1479
01:50:11,486 --> 01:50:13,906
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1480
01:50:14,156 --> 01:50:16,658
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1481
01:50:17,117 --> 01:50:19,328
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1482
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:26,376
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1483
01:50:26,627 --> 01:50:29,880
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1484
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:31,840
-Time to impact?
-Four and a half minutes.

1485
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,217
Clock it right now.

1486
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:49,358
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1487
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:51,360
I designed this power grid.

1488
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:53,195
Now I'm gonna take back...

1489
01:50:53,445 --> 01:50:55,155
...what is rightfully mine.

1490
01:50:55,531 --> 01:50:57,699
I will control everything.

1491
01:50:57,950 --> 01:51:01,578
And I will be like a god to them.

1492
01:51:01,828 --> 01:51:03,121
A god named Sparkles?

1493
01:51:13,465 --> 01:51:14,758
Not this time.

1494
01:51:15,133 --> 01:51:17,594
Is that all you got? Come on!

1495
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:37,865
Come on!

1496
01:51:42,119 --> 01:51:43,328
You ready to give up?

1497
01:51:53,964 --> 01:51:56,466
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1498
01:52:07,144 --> 01:52:08,812
Just shake it off. It's just your bones...

1499
01:52:09,062 --> 01:52:11,190
...and your muscles and your organs.

1500
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:16,320
Oh, boy.

1501
01:52:23,702 --> 01:52:24,703
I hate this song!

1502
01:52:45,682 --> 01:52:46,683
Spider-Man...

1503
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,435
...bet you never saw this coming.

1504
01:52:56,109 --> 01:52:57,903
Really? You web me to a car?

1505
01:52:58,237 --> 01:52:59,530
What are you, a caveman?

1506
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:00,989
You shouldn't be here.

1507
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,825
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1508
01:53:04,076 --> 01:53:06,203
-What are you doing here?!
-I know the grid specs.

1509
01:53:06,453 --> 01:53:07,746
I can reset the system!

1510
01:53:07,996 --> 01:53:10,207
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1511
01:53:10,457 --> 01:53:12,167
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1512
01:53:12,417 --> 01:53:15,379
Nobody makes my decisions for me.
All right? Nobody.

1513
01:53:15,629 --> 01:53:17,673
This is my choice, okay?

1514
01:53:18,382 --> 01:53:20,801
My choice. This is mine.

1515
01:53:21,093 --> 01:53:22,344
Now, how do we stop him?

1516
01:53:22,594 --> 01:53:24,972
Okay, so he's electric,
he's like a battery.

1517
01:53:25,222 --> 01:53:26,890
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1518
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,141
-It explodes.
-Right.

1519
01:53:28,392 --> 01:53:29,977
So we use his power against him.
Perfect.

1520
01:53:30,227 --> 01:53:32,062
-Okay.
-I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1521
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:33,772
But I need you to reset the system.

1522
01:53:34,064 --> 01:53:36,900
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1523
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:39,486
-No matter what. No matter what.
-Peter.

1524
01:53:44,491 --> 01:53:45,826
Go, go!

1525
01:54:37,878 --> 01:54:39,922
Sixty seconds to impact.

1526
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,541
Now, Gwen, now!

1527
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:16,917
Do it now!

1528
01:55:42,526 --> 01:55:43,694
Uni 687--

1529
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:57,624
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1530
01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:01,336
You have incoming traffic. I repeat: 280.

1531
01:56:01,587 --> 01:56:02,880
Defend immediately.

1532
01:56:18,395 --> 01:56:19,396
Yes!

1533
01:56:20,022 --> 01:56:22,232
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1534
01:56:22,482 --> 01:56:23,859
I'll be back in a minute.

1535
01:56:24,401 --> 01:56:26,653
Oh, thank God. All right!

1536
01:56:26,904 --> 01:56:28,947
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1537
01:57:04,942 --> 01:57:06,735
I think we can still make your flight.

1538
01:57:15,577 --> 01:57:16,703
Gwen, stay there.

1539
01:57:42,771 --> 01:57:44,189
Peter.

1540
01:57:45,107 --> 01:57:48,277
When you said Spider-Man said no...

1541
01:57:48,777 --> 01:57:52,823
...you meant you said no.

1542
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:55,492
Harry, what did you do?

1543
01:57:55,742 --> 01:57:57,744
What you made me do.

1544
01:57:58,287 --> 01:57:59,788
You were my friend...

1545
01:58:00,038 --> 01:58:02,583
...and you betrayed me!

1546
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:04,001
No.

1547
01:58:04,459 --> 01:58:06,378
I was trying to protect you.

1548
01:58:07,129 --> 01:58:08,380
Look at me.

1549
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:10,716
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1550
01:58:11,133 --> 01:58:12,384
You don't give people hope.

1551
01:58:13,093 --> 01:58:14,636
You take it away.

1552
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:15,929
No, Harry.

1553
01:58:16,513 --> 01:58:18,473
I'm gonna take away yours.

1554
01:58:18,724 --> 01:58:19,975
No. Gwen, run!

1555
01:58:20,517 --> 01:58:21,685
Harry!

1556
01:58:22,311 --> 01:58:23,645
Harry, put her down!

1557
01:58:40,537 --> 01:58:42,372
Harry, stop this right now!

1558
01:58:42,623 --> 01:58:45,334
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1559
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:47,836
-Harry.
-Harry is dead!

1560
01:58:48,086 --> 01:58:51,048
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1561
01:58:51,298 --> 01:58:53,342
Fight me! Let her go!

1562
01:58:53,884 --> 01:58:55,010
Okay.

1563
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:56,845
No!

1564
01:59:05,145 --> 01:59:06,355
You okay?

1565
01:59:11,735 --> 01:59:13,987
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1566
02:00:34,234 --> 02:00:35,152
Peter?

1567
02:01:38,882 --> 02:01:41,093
Hey. Hey.

1568
02:01:44,346 --> 02:01:45,389
Gwen?

1569
02:01:48,058 --> 02:01:49,059
Hey.

1570
02:01:49,434 --> 02:01:50,561
Hey!

1571
02:01:55,399 --> 02:01:56,483
Gwen?

1572
02:01:58,527 --> 02:01:59,528
Hey.

1573
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:04,116
Breathe.

1574
02:02:05,659 --> 02:02:07,578
Hey, Gwen.

1575
02:02:08,579 --> 02:02:09,580
Hey.

1576
02:02:13,333 --> 02:02:14,376
Hey.

1577
02:02:16,795 --> 02:02:18,088
You're okay.

1578
02:02:21,842 --> 02:02:22,926
Gwen?

1579
02:02:28,849 --> 02:02:30,350
Stay with me, stay with me.

1580
02:02:30,601 --> 02:02:32,978
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1581
02:02:38,734 --> 02:02:39,818
Gwen.

1582
02:02:42,529 --> 02:02:43,572
Gwen!

1583
02:02:46,575 --> 02:02:49,119
No, please, please.

1584
02:02:51,663 --> 02:02:53,040
Please.

1585
02:02:59,922 --> 02:03:02,174
I can't do this without you.

1586
02:05:04,838 --> 02:05:06,256
Leave us.

1587
02:05:10,552 --> 02:05:12,137
You've made progress.

1588
02:05:12,387 --> 02:05:15,599
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1589
02:05:15,849 --> 02:05:17,935
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1590
02:05:18,185 --> 02:05:21,230
...this city will never be the same.

1591
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,024
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1592
02:05:24,274 --> 02:05:25,859
Speaking of progress...

1593
02:05:26,109 --> 02:05:27,152
...you're looking better.

1594
02:05:28,111 --> 02:05:29,947
It comes and goes.

1595
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:33,116
Tell me more.

1596
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:35,244
How many men did you have in mind?

1597
02:05:35,494 --> 02:05:37,496
I wanna keep it small.

1598
02:05:37,746 --> 02:05:41,166
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1599
02:05:43,043 --> 02:05:44,586
Access granted.

1600
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:46,755
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1601
02:05:47,047 --> 02:05:48,757
Who's our first volunteer?

1602
02:05:49,007 --> 02:05:50,801
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1603
02:05:51,051 --> 02:05:53,220
Currently serving a life sentence.

1604
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:54,680
He is...

1605
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:57,182
...most eager to join us.

1606
02:05:58,016 --> 02:05:59,309
Good.

1607
02:05:59,977 --> 02:06:01,979
Start with him.

1608
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:04,022
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich...

1609
02:06:04,273 --> 02:06:06,191
...was broken out of
a classified penitentiary...

1610
02:06:06,441 --> 02:06:09,611
...known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1611
02:06:09,862 --> 02:06:12,281
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity...

1612
02:06:12,531 --> 02:06:15,701
...since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1613
02:06:15,951 --> 02:06:19,204
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1614
02:06:19,454 --> 02:06:22,040
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department...

1615
02:06:22,291 --> 02:06:24,293
...has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping...

1616
02:06:24,543 --> 02:06:26,628
...for the return of the web-slinger.

1617
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:29,047
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1618
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:31,800
Where is Spider-Man?

1619
02:06:33,093 --> 02:06:35,512
Too bad about that spider guy.

1620
02:06:37,055 --> 02:06:39,933
Too bad he's disappeared.
Seems like everybody really needs him.

1621
02:06:41,935 --> 02:06:43,228
Where you going?

1622
02:06:44,438 --> 02:06:47,107
-Eat my cereal.
-Peter.

1623
02:06:47,524 --> 02:06:49,193
Where you going?

1624
02:06:59,161 --> 02:07:00,204
I don't know.

1625
02:07:02,456 --> 02:07:04,166
You know, it's so funny.
I've been--

1626
02:07:04,917 --> 02:07:07,753
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organised...

1627
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:12,382
...and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1628
02:07:13,175 --> 02:07:16,887
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1629
02:07:17,638 --> 02:07:19,681
-You're throwing his stuff away?
-No.

1630
02:07:19,932 --> 02:07:21,141
No. God, no.

1631
02:07:21,517 --> 02:07:24,645
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1632
02:07:25,521 --> 02:07:28,482
I'm just finding...

1633
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:30,901
...a better place for it.

1634
02:07:34,655 --> 02:07:36,573
I'm gonna take one last look...

1635
02:07:38,033 --> 02:07:39,660
...and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1636
02:08:04,935 --> 02:08:09,147
It's easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1637
02:08:10,357 --> 02:08:13,235
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1638
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:16,613
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1639
02:08:19,157 --> 02:08:21,577
And that's when hope is needed most.

1640
02:08:23,036 --> 02:08:25,080
No matter how buried it gets...

1641
02:08:25,914 --> 02:08:28,000
...or how lost you feel...

1642
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:29,960
...you must promise me...

1643
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:33,547
...that you will hold on to hope.

1644
02:08:35,257 --> 02:08:36,508
Keep it alive.

1645
02:08:37,426 --> 02:08:40,053
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1646
02:08:40,304 --> 02:08:41,763
My wish for you...

1647
02:08:42,014 --> 02:08:44,141
...is to become hope.

1648
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,059
People need that.

1649
02:08:47,394 --> 02:08:49,354
And even if we fail...

1650
02:08:49,730 --> 02:08:51,773
...what better way is there to live?

1651
02:08:53,358 --> 02:08:55,110
As we look around here today...

1652
02:08:55,485 --> 02:08:58,697
...at all of the people
who helped make us who we are...

1653
02:08:59,406 --> 02:09:01,825
...I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1654
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:05,037
But we will carry
a piece of each other...

1655
02:09:05,287 --> 02:09:08,040
...into everything that we do next...

1656
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:12,711
...to remind us of who we are...

1657
02:09:14,588 --> 02:09:16,381
...and of who we're meant to be.

1658
02:09:18,675 --> 02:09:20,844
I've had a great four years with you.

1659
02:09:21,094 --> 02:09:23,096
I'll miss you all very much.

1660
02:09:45,494 --> 02:09:46,578
Let's go! Move it.

1661
02:09:54,962 --> 02:09:56,421
Get down! Take cover!

1662
02:10:00,259 --> 02:10:04,555
I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.

1663
02:10:04,805 --> 02:10:07,015
A man in some sort of
weaponised armoured suit...

1664
02:10:07,266 --> 02:10:08,684
...is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1665
02:10:12,729 --> 02:10:15,357
I am the Rhino!

1666
02:10:15,607 --> 02:10:18,026
I told you I would be back!

1667
02:10:29,288 --> 02:10:31,415
-No! No!
-A kid!

1668
02:10:36,628 --> 02:10:37,379
Hold your fire!

1669
02:10:38,005 --> 02:10:39,631
Everybody, hold your fire.

1670
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:43,552
-Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
-Civilian in our line of sight.

1671
02:10:47,514 --> 02:10:48,557
Kid! You gotta get--

1672
02:10:50,726 --> 02:10:52,519
Look, New York!

1673
02:10:52,769 --> 02:10:54,605
Spider-Man is back.

1674
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:56,190
Leave the kid alone!

1675
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,400
That's my baby! Please.

1676
02:11:01,445 --> 02:11:03,530
Brave boy.

1677
02:11:03,822 --> 02:11:06,158
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1678
02:11:23,467 --> 02:11:24,968
Hey, Spider-Man.

1679
02:11:35,395 --> 02:11:36,688
I knew you'd come back.

1680
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:39,525
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1681
02:11:39,775 --> 02:11:41,860
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

1682
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:44,821
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1683
02:11:45,072 --> 02:11:47,616
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1684
02:11:54,665 --> 02:11:55,832
You fight me?

1685
02:11:56,166 --> 02:11:58,210
You fight me now?

1686
02:11:59,253 --> 02:12:02,589
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere...

1687
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,843
...I ask you to put
your mechanised paws in the air.

1688
02:12:06,093 --> 02:12:07,094
Never!

1689
02:12:07,344 --> 02:12:10,347
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1690
02:12:10,597 --> 02:12:12,099
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1691
02:12:12,391 --> 02:12:13,392
Yes!

1692
02:12:13,642 --> 02:12:14,852
I'll be right there.

1693
02:12:15,227 --> 02:12:17,020
There's no place like home.
