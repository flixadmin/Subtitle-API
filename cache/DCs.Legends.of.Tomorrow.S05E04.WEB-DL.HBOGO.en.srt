00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,560
<i>Previously,
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,240
<i>Some of the most evil souls
in all of history</i>

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
<i>have been raised from hell.</i>

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,960
Nate, Zari. Zari, Nate.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
<i>Your sister is the secret woman
from the hologram message.</i>

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,800
I know Behrad's
been lying to my parents.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,040
I know who you are.

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,840
<i>It's time they finally
heard the truth.</i>

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,040
Guys, meet Zari. She's my sister.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,320
Help!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,320
Freddy Meyers, you stand convicted
of seven counts of murder,

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,840
all occurring on June 2nd, 1989.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,400
You have been sentenced to death
by a jury of your peers.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,040
The State will now proceed
with your sentence.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,200
Do you have anything to say
before your sentence is carried out?

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Only...

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,240
that I love my mother.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
Freddy!

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,560
They took my Freddy!

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,840
<i>Oh, heaven is a place on Earth</i>

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
<i>They say in heaven, love comes first</i>

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,640
<i>We'll make heaven a place on Earth</i>

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
The hell was that?

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
What the...

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Who's there?

26
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Going somewhere?

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
Spare me the send-off, Lance.

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,960
{\an5}I'm leaving before you
and your band of botherers

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,960
{\an5}can suck me into another
world-saving sing-along.

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,560
Actually, I was just gonna say

31
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,080
we're still waiting
for you to move out.

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,200
{\an5}There's a box in the library
labeled "arcana"

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
that's been sitting there for months.

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
{\an5}I'd avoid touching that,
if I was you.

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
{\an5}Yeah. Behrad already tried
to move it

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
{\an5}and now he thinks he's being
haunted by a forlorn mariner?

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,160
{\an5}And he's right, but I can't stick
around to help the bloke.

38
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
{\an5}I'm off to research
a more lasting solution

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
to your Encore problem.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,400
Did someone say "Encore"?

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,840
{\an5}I also said no musical numbers,
so please, don't start.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,560
Listen, I might have a solution
to your problem.

43
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
{\an5}I can't take you with me
on this one, squire.

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
Where I'm going,
I need to walk alone.

45
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,960
With Gary.

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,080
{\an5}Okay. But, look, we're on a Timeship,
and let's be honest.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,640
We're a little past the whole,
"Should we change history?"

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
debate, right?

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,840
{\an5}So, what if we go back
to when the Encores were kids

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,840
{\an5}and reform them before
they break bad?

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,040
Ray, we're dealing with the villains
of history fresh out of hell.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,960
They can't just be reformed
like your...

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,200
Ray, where are you?

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,800
Like your Fairy God-girlfriend.

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,720
Speaking of which, I think that
your services are required, squire.

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,160
{\an5}Well, look who's finally
off-the-clock.

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Oh, no. Not again.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
It's the same thing every time.

59
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Kid gets a Fairy Godmother,
what do they wish for?

60
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,560
{\an5}"You get a pony, and you get a pony.
Everyone gets a damn pony."

61
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,520
{\an5}Well, maybe next time
you should say "nay".

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,480
{\an5}Well, right now,
it's all about what you want.

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,640
{\an5}Oh, what I want is to be
done with this gig.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,880
{\an5}I know.
But, look, at least with this job...

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,560
{\an5}you have the opportunity
to make people's lives better.

66
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,320
{\an5}How am I supposed
to help kids in need

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,640
{\an5}when these kids don't even know
what they need?

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
{\an5}Because, trust me, no one has ever
become a better person with a pony.

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,560
Probably true, But, look,
I'm setting the mood.

70
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,640
Gideon, dim the lights...

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,520
{\an5}and play "You're the Inspiration"
by Chicago.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,320
And now,
it's whatever you wish, Nora.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,560
Gideon, don't play Chicago.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
<i>I wasn't going to, Dr. Palmer.</i>

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,880
You sure being here doesn't bring
back some fond memories?

76
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,880
{\an5}If I had fond memories of this place,
I'd book a lobotomy.

77
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,560
Okay. Whatever you people do here,
just show me the exit.

78
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,960
I'm due for a content drop.

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,120
Oh, and also to tell Mâmân and Bâbâ
you're not really in business school.

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,560
{\an5}But before you do that,
let's make sure you can't do that.

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,720
- Look over here.
- Is that a camera?

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Wait!

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,920
I don't want my picture with him.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,560
You can't wipe her memory.

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
{\an5}All right? There's a timeline
where she was here.

86
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
Okay, so maybe her being here...

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,480
{\an5}she'll remember what we did
and who she was.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,520
Look, I know Zari

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,680
and there's no way she
was ever anyone but her.

90
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,040
Hey, what's with the Wi-Fi?

91
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,160
{\an5}I need to clap back
at Blue Ivy on Cat-Chat.

92
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,360
Cat-Chat's the chat app
that lets you clap back...

93
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,480
I didn't say tell me.

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,840
<i>Mr. Tarazi and Mr. Heywood,
you're needed on the bridge.</i>

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,280
Look, no one wants you out
of here more than I do.

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
But I need you to stay put
until we finish this job.

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,920
Wait. Wait... Are you keep...

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,640
Are you taking me prisoner?

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
I have a sneaker drop

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
and I'm supposed to be releasing

101
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
a new fragrance
for Dragonesque today.

102
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,520
We've been working on this
launch for months.

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
This is high stakes!

104
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,640
<i>A serial killer has been freed</i>

105
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
<i>from hell
and is on the loose in 2004.</i>

106
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,680
And somehow, the scariest thing
about this mission

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,000
is going back to the early 2000s.

108
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,520
<i>A coroner was found dead
while transporting the body</i>

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880
<i>of a famed serial killer.</i>

110
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, my God, it's Freddy Meyers,
the Prom Night Slasher.

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,200
Come on, guys. I ranked him number
five killer of all time on <i>StabCast.</i>

112
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,400
My podcast about serial killers.
Babe?

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
<i>As I was going to say...</i>

114
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
<i>Freddy killed seven
of his peers before...</i>

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
At his high school prom in 1989.

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,480
He used a kitchen knife,
and he wore a creepy mask.

117
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
I actually did a whole series on it.

118
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
So, none of you open my e-mails,
clearly.

119
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,200
<i>And following the murders...</i>

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,360
He spent 15 years on death row
before he was executed in 2004.

121
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
<i>Which is when the timeline changed,</i>

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,760
<i>starting with the death
of the coroner</i>

123
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
<i>and the disappearance
of Freddy's body.</i>

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
I don't even wanna think about

125
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
what a serial killer would
do with his second act.

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Tiffany.

127
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
She was the final girl.

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,120
The one target
that survived Freddy's attack!

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,080
It's informative and entertaining.
It's good.

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
See? Thank you.

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,680
Guys, check this out.
The Central City High class of '89

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
is planning to memorialize
their fallen peers

133
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,000
at their 15-year reunion
this Friday night.

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,600
We have to go. That's where
Freddy will be to finish the job.

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,160
Well then, babe,
grab your autograph book

136
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,960
because we're gonna go catch
a serial killer.

137
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,200
Gideon, take us to 2004.

138
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,280
And order one of these mattresses
using promo code "laceration".

139
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,640
<i>We're heading in.</i>

140
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,960
<i>You guys keep an eye out
for a crazy masked killer.</i>

141
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,040
The only thing killing it out here
is my wardrobe.

142
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,600
Can't believe I'm here. Seriously.

143
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,480
This is the lobby
where he stalked his victims.

145
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
You guys, he made his first kill
in this cafeteria.

146
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,720
- Babe.
- What? What?

147
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,920
Babe, that's the trophy that Tiffany
fashioned into a makeshift weapon.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
Why didn't you tell me we were
coming back to my old school?

149
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,560
- You went to school here?
- What?

150
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,040
Mick, this is why you need
to come to team meetings.

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
Do you remember anything
about Freddy?

152
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,360
- Yeah. He was... He was a loser.
- Oh, come on.

153
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,160
Frigging Mick Rory!

154
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,560
Ali, remember?

155
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
- Is that you, or...
- No.

156
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,520
Are you sure? 'Cause you look, like,
exactly like Mick... Mick Rory.

157
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
No. My name is Dick.

158
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm telling you, Dick,
team meetings work wonders.

159
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
It's her.

160
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
It's Tiffany.

161
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,760
Tiffany Harper. It's really you.

162
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,640
- Who are you?
- I'm...

163
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm Lisa, and this is Kelly,

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,320
and you wouldn't remember us
'cause we were losers.

165
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,040
Total zeroes.

166
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,880
I don't.

167
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
- Isn't time weird?
- So weird.

168
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,440
- Well, see you inside.
- Thank you.

169
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,680
And... Go, Cavaliers!

170
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,680
- Okay. Go. Keep going.
- Oh, my God!

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Hey, hey! Hope you're enjoying
your reunion out there.

172
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,280
Keep on dancing, class of '89.

173
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,880
No sign of Freddy.

174
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,800
But I got eyes on crudités.

175
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,520
Oh. Save me some raw broccoli.

176
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
I never thought I'd say this

177
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
but I think I've lost
my appetite for broccoli.

178
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,600
Guys, Freddy's on the scene.

179
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
And he's got his first victim.

180
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,600
- We're ready for him.
- Oh, hello. Hello, everyone.

181
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,760
Welcome back.

182
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,240
It means so much
to see all of you here tonight.

183
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,600
And here to unveil our memorial
to our fallen peers

184
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,720
is our very own survivor,
Tiffany Harper.

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,080
Has anyone seen Tiffany?

186
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
Something's wrong.

187
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Of course she makes
a dramatic entrance.

188
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,160
We didn't cover this in rehearsal,
Tiffany.

189
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,560
All right, that's it.
I'm unveiling it myself.

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,040
All right, everybody. Just stay calm.

191
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Look, he's here. We need backup.

192
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
That's him.

193
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,560
Guys, watch out.

194
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,960
You're stuck in a school
with the Prom Night Slasher.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,120
Master, I'm sorry I'm so late.

196
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,280
I tried a teleportation spell
to get here ASAP

197
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,400
and now, I'm stuck walking backwards.

198
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,320
Damn it, Gary.
Pull yourself together, will you?

199
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
We've got work to do.

200
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,520
And the answers we need
lie behind this door.

201
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
What is this place?

202
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Can't say I've ever had anything
as comfy as a home,

203
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,400
but I lived here once.

204
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,240
Not a soul has stepped
foot inside since I left.

205
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,280
What the bloody hell?

206
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
Oi!

207
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,760
What are you doing in my house?

208
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,680
Hey, go on. Get off my stairs.

209
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,680
All right.
Who's responsible for this?

210
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,200
And I thought I was the one
with the magic touch.

211
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,720
All right. Everybody out.

212
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,840
You wanna party,
you do it somewhere else, all right?

213
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,640
How did you even
find this place, Charlie?

214
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,040
You told me about it
when you were wasted once.

215
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
You found your way here.

216
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,280
You can find your way out.

217
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,360
What is with him, huh?

218
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
- What are you doing here?
- Do the Constantine trick again.

219
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,920
{\an5}All right, everyone. Stay sharp.
The killer could be anywhere.

220
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
We got to get everyone
out of here.

221
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,640
Thanks for the heart attack!

222
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,920
Sorry. Swiss Army knife.
Usually solves a jam in a jiff.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,880
But these doors
are telekinetically sealed.

224
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
No way in or out.

225
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,640
This place always smelled
like a prison.

226
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,520
Telekinesis. It makes perfect sense.

227
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,480
Killers often act
out of feeling powerless.

228
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,360
And now, he has the ultimate power.

229
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
- I need to adjust my rankings.
- Yeah.

230
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,800
And we need to save Ali.
I mean, the class of '89.

231
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,040
All right. Immortal killer.
How do we stop him?

232
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,760
We can't from in here,
but maybe you guys can.

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,520
Look, Ray, it's time to put
your crazy plan to the test.

234
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
You got to go back and fix Freddy.

235
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,880
All right. Let's find our future
Encore.

236
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,600
Freddy. Hey, Freddy!
Heard you couldn't find a prom date.

237
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,160
Guess your mom turned you down.

238
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Loser.

239
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,840
- Loser.
- Nice job, butterfingers.

240
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,200
Good one, Brad. Yeah.

241
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Losers.

242
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,160
- Brad's such a jerk.
- Oh, it's okay. You don't have to...

243
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,280
It's all right. I got it. Thank you.

244
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Actually, I wanted to ask you
something.

245
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Turns out I don't have a date
to prom tonight

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,280
and I was thinking...

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
Would you go with me?

248
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,480
What? Me... Me, go with you to prom?

249
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,480
Exactly. Meet me in front of school
at 8:00. Don't be late.

250
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,880
<i>Oy vey.</i> This is bad.

251
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,560
Why would the most popular
girl need a last-minute date,

252
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
let alone ask him?

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
She's working with those bullies.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,240
This could be what sets him off.

255
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Okay. We got to talk this kid
out of his dream date.

256
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
Let's rap, Freddy.

257
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,880
Who... who are you guys?

258
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,280
New teachers. Cool new teachers.

259
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,560
And judging by your
test scores here...

260
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,960
maybe you should skip the prom
and hit the books.

261
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
Turn this A into an A-plus.

262
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,040
Or maybe go to the movies.
1989 is a great movie summer.

263
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,080
<i>- Last Crusade, Ghostbusters II...</i>
- Yeah. I got to go, so...

264
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
Hey, no running in the hallway.

265
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,880
We're not just your teachers,
we're your pals.

266
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,440
Picture a dark hallway.

267
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,000
Feels like
the killer's there with you.

268
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,560
Shafts of moonlight claw
at the floor.

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,760
Glowing "exit" sign
you may never reach.

270
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,520
Come out here, Freddy.
We know you're there.

271
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah. Come on out.

272
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,640
There are gaps in your psychological
profile that you need to answer for.

273
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Babe.

274
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
And we're gonna send you
back to hell.

275
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Yeah!

276
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Did you find a way out?

277
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,280
Are you trying to get
yourself killed?

278
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,600
Get back in the gym.

279
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
There!

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,560
Freddy ran off on us.

281
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,680
We need his address.

282
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I got you.

283
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Nora?

284
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Nora, what's wrong?

285
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,440
I can hear them.
Their... their voices.

286
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,720
Fairy Godmothers
have sort of a special radar

287
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,400
that tunes in to kids' wishes,

288
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,000
and prom night
is a minefield of teenage need.

289
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,160
So when it locks on
to the kid with the deepest need,

290
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
I just go straight to...

291
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,880
No, no, no, no, no. It's happening.

292
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,760
Where the hell did you
come from, huh?

293
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,840
- Oh, Freddy...
- Huh?

294
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,920
I am your Fairy Godmother.

295
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
So...

296
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,480
Please don't kill me?

297
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,640
You're a Fairy Godmother?

298
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,920
My Fairy Godmother?

299
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Prove it.

300
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,240
You think I'd be wearing
this if I really had the choice?

301
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,600
- Huh?
- So, anything I ask for...

302
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
you have to do it.

303
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,440
So, you should really think
about what you want.

304
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,680
Especially, the consequences.

305
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
I already know what I want.

306
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,320
Prom's tonight, and...

307
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
Freddy, honey.

308
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Hide.

309
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,760
Hey, Freddy.
You ready, Freddy, for movie night?

310
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,080
I got the Jiffy Pop going.

311
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,040
- Actually, Mom...
- Ray, I'm with Freddy.

312
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,680
Nora. Good! That... That's great.

313
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
How is that great?

314
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm a serial killer's
Fairy Godmother.

315
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,160
This is perfect. Old Freddy didn't
have a Fairy Godmother.

316
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,040
So, if you give him the prom
every kid dreams of...

317
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,280
maybe he won't hurt anyone.

318
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,480
Except, this kid's dream
is for everyone to be dead.

319
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
...gonna go to prom.

320
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Prom.

321
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,960
Wow, Freddy.

322
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,480
Oh, do you need a ride?
Or, I could help you with your tie...

323
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,480
You know what, I got it, but...
Love you. Okay, I just got to go.

324
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Okay.

325
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Now...

326
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,000
Back to my wish.

327
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm gonna make it so those kids
never make fun of me again,

328
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,000
because I wish for...

329
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,960
A suit.

330
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
A suit?

331
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,600
Yeah. If I'm gonna take Tiffany,
I got to look good.

332
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,000
So, I want a cool suit.
Can you do that?

333
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,760
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Okay.

334
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
- Ready?
- Yeah.

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,080
Check it out.

336
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
Oh, my...

337
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,280
Okay.

338
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,600
Okay.

339
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,880
Now I got to show up in style.

340
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
- I want a pony.
- Oh. Seriously, kid?

341
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Hey, Freddy.

342
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,720
- Hey, Tiffany.
- Wow. Cool suit.

343
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,080
Thanks. Here.

344
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,320
- Thank you.
- Should we...

345
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,840
- Yes.
- Okay.

346
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,840
Looks like your plan just might work.

347
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,080
Well, only thanks to you.

348
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Hey, Palmer.

349
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
Will you go to prom with me?

350
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,080
Oh, shucks.

351
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
All right.

352
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Cool it.

353
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,200
I knew it.
You stole our family's totem.

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
It's not like that. I...

355
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I needed to take it.

356
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,640
You could've just asked for it.

357
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
Mâmân and Bâbâ would've given
it to you.

358
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,280
What's that supposed to mean?

359
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, you really don't know?

360
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,200
You're never around,
you don't do any work

361
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,680
and they still treat you
like you're some kind of hero.

362
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,320
If you only knew what I've done,
what I've survived,

363
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,320
without getting any credit...

364
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
Not that you'd understand,
'cause you only care about yourself.

365
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,480
Whatever. Don't tell me.

366
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,200
But wait till they see you've turned
it into a stupid stoner bracelet.

367
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
- Hey!
- "What up, Z-listers?

368
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,240
Turns out even a sacred totem

369
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,680
couldn't reverse
the sucking void that is my soul."

370
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
Hey, screw you.

371
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,680
I'm not a void.

372
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm a business.

373
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,920
Not like it works here anyway.

374
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,520
Everybody stay calm.

375
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,480
Once the power's back,
we'll get help.

376
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,120
I am freaked out.
I'm freaked out.

377
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Crazy.

378
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,160
Where do you think you're going?

379
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm gonna find a way out
of the school.

380
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
Look at them,
just waiting to be picked off.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Never fit in with them
when I went here,

382
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,920
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna die with them.

383
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,320
I like the way you think.

384
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,880
There's an old vent in the wood shop
I used to sneak out of.

385
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
I knew it.

386
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,400
Mick freaking Rory.

387
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Come on. Let's get the hell
out of this school.

388
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,880
You have a husband? Boyfriend?

389
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,520
Girlfriend?

390
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Nah.

391
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,440
No one's waiting at home for me.

392
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,920
Still haven't quite
gotten that together.

393
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
And you?

394
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh, it's behind here.

395
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Hey.

396
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,920
You ever wonder where we'd be if...

397
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,240
you know,
that prom had gone differently?

398
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Like if we...

399
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Ali!

400
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
You'd better be fixing this in '89.

401
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,840
So, this is prom.

402
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,440
I know it's lame, but...

403
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,280
No, no, no.
Actually, I think I kind of get

404
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,680
the whole nostalgia thing for once.

405
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,560
And we're gonna slow it down
for the next one.

406
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,400
So, everyone, grab your sweeties
and get on the dance floor.

407
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,480
I love this song.

408
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,280
Yeah. Me, too.

409
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,040
You know, you're a really
good dancer.

410
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Thanks. I...
I watch a lot of music videos.

411
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,240
They look so happy.

412
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,960
Yeah. But they don't.

413
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,960
So, that's the prank.

414
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,600
She leads him to the center
of the dance floor

415
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
and they drop trash on his head.

416
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,600
Classic <i>Carrie.</i>

417
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Bet these bullies
don't know how that ended.

418
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
We got to keep him
from walking in the drop zone.

419
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,320
I... think it's gonna be okay.

420
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,600
- It's a little crowded over there.
- Sure.

421
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

422
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,040
- Having fun?
- Yeah. Thanks a lot...

423
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Hey, Freddy.

424
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,960
Nice suit.

425
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,440
Would suck if it got ruined.

426
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,000
- Brad, wait.
- Come on, Tiff.

427
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,040
This is how the prank
was supposed to go, right?

428
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,520
Prank? What are you talking about?

429
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,200
He still doesn't get it.

430
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,680
You think she actually wanted
to go out with you?

431
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
It was a setup, butt-lump.

432
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,960
Tiffany, is that true?

433
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,240
No. I mean... not anymore, Freddy.

434
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,640
No. Freddy.

435
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,280
Freddy, it's gonna be okay.

436
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,480
This went from John Hughes
to John Carpenter.

437
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,600
I take it back.

438
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,000
High school sucks.

439
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,120
{\an5}Come out here and face me,
you bastard.

440
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Rory, are you trying
to get yourself killed?

441
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,480
He killed Ali. He's gonna pay.

442
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,000
She wasn't just some girl, was she?

443
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,800
She was my prom date.

444
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,040
We went to the same school together
and kind of had a thing.

445
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,040
Then I went to juvie, but we still
wrote letters to one another.

446
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,720
I was gonna break out
and take her to the stupid dance...

447
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,240
- but then, I blew her off.
- Rory.

448
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,920
What? I was young, stupid.

449
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,960
Mick, look, I'm sorry, okay?
But if this plan works,

450
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,400
then Freddy never becomes an Encore.

451
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,000
Maybe everything that happened
can be undone.

452
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,600
Maybe we can still save Ali.

453
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,120
- Freddy, wait.
- Leave me alone.

454
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,080
- What?
- You don't wanna be alone right now.

455
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,560
How would you know that?
How would you know what I want?

456
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,480
I've spent years
wanting these kids to be my friend,

457
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,680
and I couldn't even make it happen
with a Fairy Godmother!

458
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,480
I cannot wait to be done
with this stupid place

459
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,080
and I hope they all
get what they deserve.

460
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,320
No. You don't mean that.

461
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't!

462
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
Look, I get it.
I have given in to my demons,

463
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,320
I know what it's like to wanna
make the world feel your pain,

464
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,560
but that is not who you are.

465
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,120
I see so much more in you.

466
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Listen.

467
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,960
God, being yourself...

468
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,240
that is a magic stronger
than any wish.

469
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,560
Being truly okay with myself...

470
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
scars and all, is how
the right people truly found me.

471
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,600
Now, if you had one more wish...

472
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,120
to show all of them
who you really are...

473
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
what'll it be?

474
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,160
Oh, how concerned should we be?

475
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,040
I say medium.

476
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,920
Medium concerned.

477
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,120
<i>We're J.J. Fad and we're here to rock</i>

478
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,720
<i>Rhymes like ours could
Never be stopped</i>

479
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Hit it!

480
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,920
<i>Supersonic</i>

481
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,160
<i>Supersonic motivating
Rhymes are creating</i>

482
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,640
<i>We know you like us girls
So you better get stirl</i>

483
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,360
<i>'Cause we are the home chicks
That are rocking your world</i>

484
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,680
<i>Supersonic is a word
When people start to listen</i>

485
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
<i>Especially bigger people,
They pay close attention</i>

486
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,920
<i>You might not believe it,
You might not even buy it</i>

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,440
<i>But when it comes to our lady
You might even try it</i>

488
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
<i>Supersonic</i>

489
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,880
What the...

490
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,560
<i>So, you better listen good
To what we have to say</i>

491
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,240
<i>'Cause when it comes to J.J. Fad
You can get no play</i>

492
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
<i>Supersonic</i>

493
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,560
Computer, just tell me...

494
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,880
How many Cat-Chat followers
have I lost

495
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,240
since I've been stuck in this dump?

496
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,840
<i>I can't do that, Ms. Tarazi.</i>

497
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,640
It's probably best I don't know.

498
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
Wait, does this computer
get Internet?

499
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,560
<i>So, that computer program
I designed to act</i>

500
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
<i>as a temporal beacon...</i>

501
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,640
<i>How did you bypass
my encrypted security protocol?</i>

502
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,680
Oh, just by being a businesswoman,

503
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,640
makeup guru, bad bitch,
and overall genius.

504
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,400
Now, call me a ride, computer.

505
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,680
Hey, you were
really great out there, Freddy.

506
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,920
It takes some real confidence
to bust out backup dancers at prom.

507
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,840
So this gets to be, like, your job,
making things better for kids?

508
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Yeah.

509
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, it is.

510
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,240
Look, there's got to be
a bunch of kids out there

511
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,640
that could probably use your help,
and I...

512
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,280
I think I'm gonna be okay.

513
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,160
Thank you, Nora, for everything.

514
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, here's my ride.

515
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
Oh, vintage.

516
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,520
Well, at least the computer knows
I like to travel in style.

517
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,240
That was fun.

518
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah, and the night
is just getting started.

519
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,680
I know. Well, we can take my limo
wherever we wanna go.

520
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,080
- After you.
- Thank you.

521
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,960
She booked me a shared ride.

522
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
Guys, they fixed it.

523
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,600
Ray's plan actually worked?

524
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,080
Apparently, Freddy's
a really solid dancer

525
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,200
and he's not gonna go
on a killing spree at prom.

526
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Then who is that?

527
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Die, you bastard!

528
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Mick!

529
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
No.

530
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,720
Sara, look.

531
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,000
Cathy Meyers?

532
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,480
She must be the Encore.

533
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,120
They wanted to take
my Freddy away from me.

534
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,440
But when that girl asked
him to prom...

535
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,640
I knew I had to kill her
and all of his new friends.

536
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,480
Now, I get to finish what I started.

537
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,200
Hey, are you guys getting
any service?

538
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,040
I know what you guys are thinking.

539
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,360
Yes, it's me, the dragon girl.

540
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,000
Wait. Why aren't we moving?

541
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,280
Driver, what's going on?

542
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,320
Close it! Close it! Close the door!
Close it!

543
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,320
You killed our friend.
You killed those kids.

544
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,080
But you're not gonna
get away with it this time.

545
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,680
I won't let anyone stand between
me and my boy.

546
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,320
And you're next.

547
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Sara!

548
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Close the door!

549
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,600
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

550
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,960
Before you kill me...

551
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Just something I don't understand,
huh? How did you get here?

552
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,880
Come on.
Every... every killer has a story.

553
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,240
Why don't you tell me yours, yeah?

554
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,040
After I killed those brats...

555
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,400
my Freddy took the fall.

556
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,200
He wanted to protect me.

557
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,720
But I knew I couldn't live
without him.

558
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,840
And I was right,
because he's not the only one

559
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,760
who died the night of his execution.

560
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,040
I had a heart attack
right there in Iron Heights.

561
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,720
I died with him!

562
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,840
But then, I was sent back from hell!

563
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,440
Given a second chance.

564
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,760
A chance to bring Freddy home
where he belongs.

565
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,800
A chance to finish the job I started.

566
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,400
And no one can ever take us
away from each other.

567
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,720
Babe, it's happening.

568
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,040
We're final girls!

569
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
That's right.

570
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,880
Feel the burn of Dragonesque,
you psycho!

571
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Mom?

572
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,280
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

573
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,560
Freddy, I'm doing this for you.
For us.

574
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,240
I can't lose you, Freddy.
I can't live without you.

575
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
Let me do this, Freddy.

576
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,520
I can't move.

577
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,040
You don't need them, you need me.

578
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,160
We can get away with this together.

579
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,800
No! No.

580
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,280
I know who I am now,
and I'm not gonna lock myself away.

581
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,440
Then this is for your own good.

582
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
They did it.

583
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,840
Behrad?

584
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
Sorry. You okay?

585
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,920
I totally get why you stole that.

586
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Fair enough.

587
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,000
Wow, this was... a lot.

588
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,960
Ma'am, you were in the limo,
is that right?

589
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,240
- Yes.
- Thanks.

590
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I'll be back.

591
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,320
I know she needs help, but...

592
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,360
She was all I had,
and they took her away.

593
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,240
So, what do I do?

594
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
You survive.

595
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,320
Freddy, my upbringing
was only dysfunction.

596
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,360
But dysfunction doesn't get
to choose who you are.

597
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,400
You do.

598
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,680
- You hear me?
- Yeah. Okay.

599
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,640
We should head back
and check on the team,

600
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,400
make sure everything's
back to normal.

601
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,680
I know... you're gonna be okay, kid.

602
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,280
Dr. Gideon treating you right?

603
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,080
Pretty cool, huh?

604
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,320
So, this is what you do,
travel around time

605
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
and save people using wind? That's...

606
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,760
Well, I wouldn't say "cool",
exactly, but...

607
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,200
no wonder you're the favorite.

608
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
The favorite?

609
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Mâmân and Bâbâ only treat me how they
do 'cause they're worried about me.

610
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,720
I mean, I've been in business school
for five years.

611
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,560
You were a self-made millionaire
by the age of 19.

612
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,720
You're right, I am very impressive.

613
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,280
Like, how did you jailbreak
your way out of here anyway?

614
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,800
I was poking around
your weird little screens

615
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,960
and suddenly,
I knew how to hack my way out.

616
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,480
Right.

617
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah, time travel
always has these weird side effects.

618
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Huh.

619
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,200
Well, hopefully it wears off

620
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,360
because I was thinking of
sticking around for a while.

621
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,760
I weirdly wouldn't hate that.

622
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,120
<i>Hey, guys, we're still in 2004.
Where the hell are you?</i>

623
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
You coming?

624
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
How about this for a reunion?

625
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,520
And what's your sister doing here?

626
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
Probably Cat-Chatting.
No judgment here.

627
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
- Yes.
- Wait.

628
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Where's Mick?

629
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Mick?

630
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,320
Mick Rory?

631
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Ali.

632
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
Hey, Freddy.

633
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,000
- Hey, Tiffany. Congrats.
- Hi.

634
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,040
Nora, may I have this dance?

635
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,920
Oh, but of course.

636
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,320
I cannot believe I got to get
an exclusive scoop for <i>StabCast</i>

637
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
and I got to be the final girl.

638
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,280
Well, technically,
I never died, so...

639
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,520
Technically, you've died
more than three times

640
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,720
so just give me this one, babe.

641
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,440
You are my final girl.

642
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Hey, guys.

643
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,080
Photo booth.

644
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
- Oh, no.
- Yes!

645
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,280
Wait. Where's Mick?

646
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
Wow, Mick.

647
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
That's my gun.

648
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,960
I thought I told you to piss off.

649
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
Gary just filled me in
on that business with Astra.

650
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,960
So, why are you drowning your sorrows
instead of doing something about it?

651
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,480
What happened here, John?

652
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,040
Oh, I used to run with a bunch
back in the day.

653
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Became known as "the Newcastle Crew",

654
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,000
spent most of our misbegotten
youth in this place.

655
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,680
One of them was a powerful witch.

656
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,280
I'm back here to consult with her.

657
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,720
She's through there.

658
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,760
So, what are you waiting for?

659
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,040
Come on. Get off your arse
and go and do it.

660
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Because it's not that easy,
all right, Charlie?

661
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,080
That witch is Astra's dead mother.

662
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,760
Her spirit is waiting on
the other side of that door, and...

663
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,280
none too happy with me.

664
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,120
There are things in my past
that I haven't told anyone.

665
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,920
So, I get the whole
wanting to do it on your own.

666
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,160
But if there was some door

667
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,040
that I could walk through
to solve all my problems...

668
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,320
I sure as hell would take
that chance.

669
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,840
I call upon Hecate...

670
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,240
lady of keys and guardian
of crossroads.

671
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,000
Sever this seal.

672
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,800
By my blood, be open.

673
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,520
Don't look back, John-o.

674
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
You got this.

675
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,400
Let's hope you're right, love.
