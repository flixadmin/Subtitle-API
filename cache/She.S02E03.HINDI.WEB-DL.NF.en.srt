1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,920
Sir, cocaine is produced
largely in South America.

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,720
They cultivate it just like
we cultivate wheat and rice.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,920
These are coca leaves.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,680
<i>And in labs like these, they process it
and transport it in this form.</i>

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,160
Heroin, on the other hand,
is largely grown in South East Asia.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,320
And they bring most
of it to India via this route.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>Cocaine is far away.</i>

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,120
Bringing it here from
South America can be difficult.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
<i>If they wanna bring it in,
they have to do it by air.</i>

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
Now, Nayak.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,720
See, Mumbai has had its share
of the illegal drug trade for decades.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,400
<i>But small scale, unorganized.</i>

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,200
We've found out through Sasya
and the others that Nayak

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,280
is planning to make Mumbai
India's drug capital.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,720
Sasya has also told us
that this is a five-year plan

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,840
that is currently in phase two.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,200
And phase one was...

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,520
mass killings.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,920
If you have a closer look,

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,280
most of the drug gang lords have
been executed in the past five years.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,480
And we know that it was Nayak.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,840
He was just clearing out the space
before building his empire.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,200
Hey, stop!

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,480
The motherfucker's dead!

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,960
Look!

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,680
Look at him staring at me!

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
<i>I've seen his dead face!</i>

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
I can now die peacefully!

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,560
Leave her.

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,760
<i>She will be useful.</i>

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Leave her.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,000
Sir, in the past three years, we've
tracked around ten isolated events

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,840
concentrated around South Bombay.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,320
But where is it coming
from to South Bombay?

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
The same route, sir...

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Are you all right?

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,600
Yeah.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
Did they take you to the same location?

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
It was some other bungalow, sir.

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,720
Any idea where it was?

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Nambiar, relax.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,000
Bhumi...

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
your family had called.

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
I've spoken to them, sir.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,480
I didn't really get any important
information this time, sir.

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,000
I was there for two days.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,440
But I met Nayak just once.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,320
And he didn't talk much either, sir.

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
Shit.

50
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
That means we've wasted two days.

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,600
Sorry, sir.

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,600
Don't worry.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,240
It's okay.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
Sir, please excuse me.
I'll be back.

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,000
My phone's bugged, sir.
He can hear everything.

56
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,640
And he can see everything
through my phone's camera as well.

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
He records everything.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,240
He stops recording only when I'm with him.

59
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,320
Sasya's information is useless, sir.

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,160
<i>Nayak has completely
changed his operation, sir.</i>

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,160
<i>Shit!</i>

62
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
How did you go to Nayak?

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,280
We last saw you going to that
hotel room in the evening, right?

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,280
Sorry, raise your hands.

65
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
<i>First, they took me
to a different location.</i>

66
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
<i>I think it was outside Mumbai.</i>

67
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
<i>It was an open ground.</i>

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,680
Like a farm, maybe.

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
I saw...

70
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
them burying loads of dead bodies there.

71
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
Exact...

72
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,320
I didn't have the luxury of
counting the exact number of bodies.

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
But I'm sure there were more than 20.

74
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,800
Nayak is doing it again.

75
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
Mass graves.

76
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
We had seen the same pattern in Karwar.

77
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,800
And there's one more important thing, sir.

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
I saw Sasya's dead body.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,600
They buried him there as well.

80
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,080
But why would Nayak show it to you?

81
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
He trusts me, sir.

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
Why did he kill Sasya?

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
He must've killed him
because he saw his face.

84
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Sir, Nayak doesn't show
his face to any outsiders.

85
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,840
And maybe Sasya's job was done.

86
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
Well, that lets you
off the hook, Fernandez.

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,600
You can now officially
be a part of the team.

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
And good news, Bhumi.

89
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,760
You don't have to do the
prostitute charade anymore.

90
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
Nayak knows how to pick you up now.

91
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,640
The cheap clothes, make-up, attitude,
parading on that bloody strip,

92
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm sure it was hell for you.

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Bhumi!

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
Bhumi!

95
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,320
Are you all right?

96
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,080
Repeating the same
question is useless, sir.

97
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,800
It won't help you get rid of your guilt.

98
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
What guilt?

99
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,040
You threw me under the bus, didn't you?

100
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,080
-Why do you even care if I'm all right?
-Listen...

101
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,280
did they assault you?

102
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,480
Sexual?

103
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm gonna end up dead.

104
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,200
Forget about sexual...

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,880
I've seen his face!

106
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,160
He'll bury me in the ground as well!

107
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,400
We have found another set of
fingerprints on Bhumi's phone.

108
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
Could be Nayak.

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,800
I think we should check the police
database and see if we find a match.

110
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah.

111
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,240
Everything all right?

112
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,240
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,920
-Have you done what I had asked?
-Of course, sir. What are you saying?

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,840
This isn't official, Raja.

115
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,880
It's off-the-record.

116
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
Hey, Aanchal!

117
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,880
Get out of my way.

118
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Come on, sir.

119
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,360
Please come.

120
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,160
Hey.

121
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,520
Durga.

122
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,160
I have some questions.

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
Come closer.

124
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
Hey!

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,520
I can't hear him, man.

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,560
Nayak.

127
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
Who?

128
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
You work for him.

129
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,120
I know it.

130
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,600
Right now, you're the
only one I know, handsome.

131
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,600
Hey!

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
All right.

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,520
My source will inform Nayak...

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
that you aren't dead.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That might remind you.

136
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
What do you want?

137
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,800
You ruined all the fucking romance.

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,280
The whore is your source, right?

139
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,880
You saved me, so she can be safe, right?

140
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Are you fucking her?

141
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,120
He won't spare you.

142
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,760
I've saved you, right?

143
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
Come on, tell me about him.

144
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,320
We're playing for the same team.

145
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
But your whore...

146
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
she's on the other team.

147
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,520
She's with that asshole Nayak.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,680
I tried my best to
scare the fucking whore.

149
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,840
But she wouldn't betray Nayak,
not even to save her own bloody life.

150
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,360
Didn't say a word.

151
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,560
How do I get to Nayak?

152
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,520
He's the one who contacts me.

153
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,080
He doesn't give anyone
any information about himself.

154
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
And he won't contact you anymore.

155
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
So, you're useless.

156
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,280
No, I'm not.

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,680
Give it a try.

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,680
You'll love using me.

159
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,680
Hey!

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
What the hell!

161
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Stay here...

162
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
if you wanna live.

163
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
He won't stop coming here.

164
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
This is a new headache.

165
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,760
What if Nayak finds out?

166
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,160
We should move you.

167
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,640
The handsome motherfucker
will keep an eye on us.

168
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,560
Hey!

169
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
Don't say that.

170
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,320
What do you want me to do?

171
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,880
Just keep me alive.

172
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,800
I didn't cry when they killed Shetty.

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm collecting my tears.

174
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll only cry after that
asshole Nayak is dead.

175
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
Look after me, all right?

176
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,400
Look after me.

177
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,160
My uniform's gonna change tomorrow.

178
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,120
This is my final show.

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,240
What's gonna happen?

180
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Listen...

181
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
will I be caught?

182
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,360
<i>It's like a video game.</i>

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,480
<i>But it's a dangerous one.</i>

184
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
I can't stop playing.

185
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
I'll have to keep running...

186
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,760
<i>all my life.</i>

187
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
And this pounding inside my chest...

188
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,440
<i>this won't stop.</i>

189
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
I wanna get used to it.

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>I wanna enjoy it.</i>

191
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,640
It is what it is.

192
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,040
They've deployed more
security at the airport today.

193
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
I think it's a special checking.

194
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,440
WE KNOW. LET IT BE.

195
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,240
Sir, it's heroin.

196
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,720
Heroin.

197
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,080
Sir, I've been following
them for three weeks,

198
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,720
some staff from Rwanda Airlines.

199
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Total eight mules, sir.

200
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,640
Eight mules.

201
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,960
<i>Meaning, ten crores worth of heroin.</i>

202
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,160
<i>But, sir...</i>

203
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,840
<i>we believe this is just
the tip of the iceberg, sir.</i>

204
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,360
What will we gain by arresting this crew?

205
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,560
Just some heroin?

206
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,200
But we were thinking,
what if we let them go?

207
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,360
And then track them.

208
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,440
According to Intelligence,
there is a chance that

209
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
this exact crew that
is carrying the heroin,

210
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
will return with cocaine.

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,760
He's right, sir.

212
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,320
In narcotics, they use the
mules on both sides.

213
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,720
And we're tracking them anyway.

214
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,120
We can hopefully get a lot of
information on Nayak's operation.

215
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,160
I think we should let them go, sir.
I will take responsibility for it.

216
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Don't get cocky, Fernandez.
This is my responsibility.

217
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Okay.

218
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,240
Let them go.

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Officer, my bag?

220
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,400
Here you go.
We thought it was a lighter.

221
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,040
We've marked eight people, sir.

222
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
They're scheduled to come
back to Mumbai after five days.

223
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,440
Okay, copy. Yeah.

224
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,400
Sir!

225
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,000
Five days.

226
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,520
-Sir, it's a stupid question...
-Of course.

227
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,880
Go on.

228
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,280
We can track Bhumi and
arrest Nayak next time, right?

229
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,600
We haven't found a match for the
fingerprints recovered from Bhumi's phone.

230
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,960
But we can confirm it
by arresting him, right?

231
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
What if fingerprints don't match?

232
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,800
And even if they do,
what evidence do we have against him?

233
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,360
He doesn't carry any proof.

234
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,320
Then why can't we just finish him?

235
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,320
Unofficially.

236
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,600
Firstly, it could
compromise Bhumi's safety.

237
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,360
Secondly, we won't be
able to seize his operation.

238
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,200
We need to catch him red-handed
and also seize his operation.

239
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,200
Is that clear?

240
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,800
Yes, sir.

241
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,720
Right, sir.

242
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,520
Show me.

243
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,120
What happened?

244
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't wanna live with you anymore!

245
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Hemant?

246
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,200
Did he hit you?

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Why don't you tell her
what you did with him?!

248
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,760
What did you do with my boyfriend?

249
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,040
Hemant!

250
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,520
Call him!

251
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,520
-Look, it was mistak...
-You hit her?

252
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,240
We had a fight.
And it was a mistake...

253
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
Rupa, hit him.

254
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
What?

255
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,240
Hit him like he hit you!

256
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,760
Hit him!

257
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,880
I said hit him like he hit you!

258
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,240
-Bhumi, let it be...
-Look...

259
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,960
I'll show you.

260
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
Bhumi!

261
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,720
-You bastard!
-Bhumi, what are you doing?

262
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,640
These bloody assholes!

263
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,040
-What are you doing?!
-Assholes!

264
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,440
Assholes like him shouldn't dare...

265
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,880
They shouldn't dare touch us!

266
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,040
-They shouldn't dare!
-Bhumi! Bhumi, stop!

267
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,720
-Let him go! What are you doing?
-Fucking asshole!

268
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,760
<i>Hey, Rupa!</i>

269
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,360
-Don't touch me!
-Rupa...

270
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,000
This is what we must do
to survive in this damn world!

271
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,520
They won't let us live peacefully.

272
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
Who's "they"?

273
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,760
And who are you?
What have you become?

274
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,800
Listen...

275
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
I just can't live with you anymore.

276
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,520
<i>You leave the house or I will!</i>

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,000
All right.

278
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
I won't come back home.

279
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,480
I'LL BE WORKING TONIGHT

280
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,640
-Now, I'm gonna find...
-Guys!

281
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,960
Nayak has picked Bhumi up.

282
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,040
How come you're here?

283
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,680
How are you feeling?

284
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm changing.

285
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,720
Look.

286
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,120
How do you feel...

287
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,480
when you see all of this?

288
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,760
Relieved.

289
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,160
Your Fernandez was lucky...

290
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,040
to catch them.

291
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,280
Two of my informers reported that
the police have beefed up security.

292
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,560
One at the airport, and the other at...

293
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,440
By the time I got the information,
it was too late.

294
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
The carriers were inside the airport.

295
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,280
But now that the mess
has been cleaned up...

296
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,720
I feel relieved.

297
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
Watching it really stresses me out.

298
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,280
My body heats up.

299
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,400
I feel like my blood's boiling.

300
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,400
I feel my stomach churning.

301
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,200
I think you need a check-up.

302
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,840
Take your clothes off.

303
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,200
I'll have a look.

304
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,960
Here?

305
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,720
Yes.

306
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,760
And?

307
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,040
Why don't you check?

308
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,440
These symptoms...

309
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
I used to have these as well.

310
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,240
I miss these.

311
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,000
You'll miss them as well.

312
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,040
I'm setting up the pipeline for
the whole operation right now.

313
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
Will you help me?

314
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,400
Yeah.

315
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,200
I need to distract the police.

316
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,320
Will you help me?

317
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,320
Yeah.

318
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,960
Because if...

319
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,680
THE FLYING BIRDS WON'T RETURN

320
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Sir, Inspector Karmarkar from the airport.

321
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,720
Yeah, Karmarkar?

322
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,720
Sir, I have some news from Rwanda.

323
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,640
The airlines' staff we've
been tracking are missing.

324
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,160
They're missing?

325
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,160
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

326
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,360
Shit...

327
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,640
How can eight staff
members just disappear?

328
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
You must have some records.

329
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
Please check!

330
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,320
The bastards killed them.

331
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,280
We have to kill the bastard!

332
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,240
{\an8}TODAY'S A BIG DAY

333
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
{\an8}Something's gonna happen today.

334
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
Come on, get ready.

335
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,600
-Here. Take this.
-Yeah.

336
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Come on. Settle in. Quickly.

337
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,120
Where's my feed, Leena?

338
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,800
Sir?

339
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,440
What's the status, Fernandez?

340
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,240
<i>More information coming from Bhumi, sir.</i>

341
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,920
I've sent it to the Intelligence Unit.

342
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,160
But we'll need more
forces on the ground, sir.

343
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
Guys, come on.
It's the same pattern.

344
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,600
Location coordinates, truck numbers,
highway numbers, sub-routes.

345
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,280
As soon as you find it and confirm it,
I want it on the screen.

346
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,200
Pin it!

347
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,800
Guarding the airport is pointless.

348
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
He already knows.

349
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,800
Leave the airport.

350
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,080
<i>And report to the assigned
locations with your teams.</i>

351
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
-New forces assigned to the locations?
-Yes, sir.

352
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,000
<i>Follow the marked vehicle, sir.</i>

353
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,520
Copy, sir! Come on!

354
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,160
Guys, I'm sending 12 back-ups
at number six.

355
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,640
We must strike all the routes
and locations at the same time.

356
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
If Nayak gets a whiff,
all our leads will be compromised.

357
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,120
Sir, but we have the same problem, sir.

358
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
Bhumi is still with Nayak.

359
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,680
And he'll easily find out, sir.

360
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,440
We have to strike this time, Fernandez.

361
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Ask Bhumi to get out of there immediately.

362
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,680
Right?

363
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,480
MOM:
COME HOME. IT'S GETTING LATE.

364
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,160
Yes, the arrangements are in place.

365
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,040
Supervise the people who need to go.

366
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,400
If anything goes wrong,

367
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,400
you'll completely cut all the contact.

368
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,000
Our last phase...

369
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,680
begins now.

370
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,520
{\an8}BHUMI: I'M BUSY.
I DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO LEAVE.

371
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,280
Command to strike, ACP.

372
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,840
Just a few more minutes, sir.

373
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,520
MOM: THE STREETS ARE DANGEROUS AT NIGHT.

374
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,000
Come on, it's time!
We can't wait any longer, Fernandez.

375
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,360
{\an8}BHUMI: I KNOW IT'S DANGEROUS. BUT I
NEED TO FINISH THE JOB. IT'S TOO LATE.

376
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,720
All units in position?

377
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,120
Yes, sir.

378
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

379
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,800
Get ready to engage.

380
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,680
<i>On my command...</i>

381
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
Now!

382
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
Go! Go!

383
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,400
Call Bhumi.

384
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,160
Nayakudu wants to see you.

385
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,640
We'll meet again.

386
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,520
It's time for my flight now.

387
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,240
How are you gonna get a flight right now?

388
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,120
Private flight.

389
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,520
Go.

390
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,080
Brother, can I make a phone call?
My phone's dead.

391
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,360
It'll just be a minute. Thank you.

392
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,920
Yeah, so put them...

393
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Hello?

394
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Bhumi?

395
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
<i>-Are you all right?</i>
-I'm not sure, sir.

396
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,920
-Has the operation started?
<i>-Yes.</i>

397
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,440
And you were right, Bhumi.
Something big's going down today.

398
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,840
Listen to me, sir.

399
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,480
Nayak's planning to escape on a plane
from the private airport.

400
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,480
Please kill him, sir.
He won't spare me, sir.

401
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,120
Are you sure he's leaving?

402
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,560
<i>Yes, he said so himself, sir.</i>

403
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,560
He's worried. He wants to get out.

404
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,400
Please get him, sir.

405
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,160
Excuse me.
Sir, I need to speak to you for a minute.

406
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,080
It's urgent.

407
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,000
We've found Nayak, sir.
He's escaping on a plane.

408
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,560
The devil himself?

409
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,840
Go for it, Fernandez.

410
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,400
I'll get that bastard, sir.

411
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,480
Alive, Fernandez.

412
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,600
I know, sir. I won't kill him.

413
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000
Even though I want to.

414
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,840
<i>Target is on the way.</i>

415
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Copy that.

416
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,400
We have to arrest the target.

417
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,560
Wait for my command.

418
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Open fire! Open fire!

419
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,240
Go! Go! Go! Go!

420
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,200
Everyone, push up!

421
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,040
They're going towards Zone B.

422
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,160
Officer hit!

423
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,440
They're going to Zone C.

424
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,720
Sniper, take position.

425
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,680
He's dead.

426
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,080
Check the fingerprint sample
against the body's fingerprints.

427
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,680
Hello?

428
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,800
It's for you.

429
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,120
-Hello?
-Bhumi!

430
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Fernandez sir wants you to
come to the private airport

431
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,720
<i>and identify Nayak's body.</i>

432
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,400
Okay.

433
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,240
Guys, give us a minute.

434
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,720
<i>Yes, Fernandez?</i>

435
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,520
She's here, sir.

436
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,160
Yes, sir.

437
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
That's Nayak.

438
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,160
Are you sure, Bhumi?

439
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,360
We got him, sir.

440
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,880
<i>We got Nayak!</i>

441
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,840
But he's been killed, sir.

442
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,080
<i>Accidentally.</i>

443
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,840
It was an accident?

444
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,480
<i>I'm not too sure.</i>

445
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,960
Well, I'm willing to
face another inquiry, sir.

446
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,800
Yes, sir, one second.

447
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Good job, Bhumi!

448
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,880
Well done.

449
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,880
I'll be your Sasya!

450
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,960
That's what he looks like.

451
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,480
Sir, this is the first time we have
some visual representation of Nayak.

452
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,400
Tell the cops that Nayak
has hacked into your phone.

453
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
He has bugged my phone, sir.

454
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,560
Tell them the truth.

455
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,280
They were burying loads
of dead bodies there.

456
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,560
Add a pinch of lie.

457
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,640
I saw Sasya's dead body.

458
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,840
You must gain their trust.

459
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,880
And then we'll use that trust...

460
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>to give them false information.</i>

461
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,120
BHUMI: HOW ARE YOU, MOM?

462
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,880
Did you text your <i>"Mom"?</i>

463
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,480
Nambiar, sir.

464
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,920
Same types of routes.

465
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,560
Nayak's fingerprints.

466
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,840
Sir!

467
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,200
The body's fingerprints
match those on Bhumi's phone.

468
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,840
We need to distract the police.
Will you help me?

469
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

470
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,880
The locations are correct.
They will seize my stuff.

471
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,920
The cops will be busy.

472
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,880
<i>And I'll be busy setting up the
pipeline for my operation.</i>

473
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,520
I'll cover everything.

474
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,280
I'll weed all the weaknesses out.

475
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,720
<i>The large animal devours the smaller one.</i>

476
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,120
Which are you?

477
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Guarding the airport is pointless.

478
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,520
The police will think they've
ended Nayak's entire operation.

479
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,720
And they'll close their investigation.

480
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,840
That is when phase three will begin.

481
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,000
<i>How are they gonna look for a dead man?</i>

482
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
...no clue we'd be able to do this, sir.
