1
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:06,035
- Previously on Gotham...
- I hope you know, Oswald,

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,093
you can always count on me.

3
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:13,565
Thank you.

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:15,634
Miss Kringle.

5
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,203
Dinner. Chez Moi.

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,639
Okay.

7
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,453
That's for Kristen.

8
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,389
Whatever happened with Tetch?

9
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:28,724
Broke his sister out of GCPD.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,725
I'll never go with you!

11
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,726
- I love you.
- You're insane!

12
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:32,561
No, no!

13
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:35,498
No!

14
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:36,732
You killed her!

15
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,034
She died, he escaped.

16
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:39,201
'Cause I heard a rumor there's

17
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:41,358
something strange about her blood.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,113
I'll tell you what you want to know.

19
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:54,650
You are gonna have to
buy me dinner, though.

20
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:55,951
He killed you.

21
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,057
Those who hurt you

22
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:03,959
will feel my pain.

23
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,337
I love you, Daddy.

24
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:15,705
I love you, too, baby.

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,907
I'm so proud of you.

26
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:22,460
Bye.

27
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:36,080
Well, the good part is about to happen.

28
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:37,348
I hope so.

29
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,783
Look at that.

30
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:41,152
There's no greater symbol of love

31
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:44,455
than two people who've made the choice

32
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:46,113
to spend the rest of
their lives together.

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,893
Hey, pal, we have a reception to get to.

34
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,629
- So, what you say we get a move on?
- Oh, yes,

35
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,810
about that... I'm afraid
you won't be able to attend.

36
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,468
This some kind of a joke?

37
00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,886
No.

38
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:02,974
It's quite serious, in fact.

39
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,843
You're needed elsewhere.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,809
Let's get out of here.

41
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,382
- Hey, open the damn door.
- Sorry,

42
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:12,850
we mustn't be late.

43
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:14,552
Please just... don't hurt us.

44
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:17,188
That's not my decision to make.

45
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,624
Your fate depends entirely

46
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,659
on James Gordon.

47
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:22,660
Hey. Hey!

48
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,662
Don't forget to buckle up.

49
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:34,324

50
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:38,109
What a beautiful morning.

51
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,346
Sun is shining, birds are singing.

52
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:46,484
They say that fortune favors the brave.

53
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,388
They have that saying
in your country, Olga?

54
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:52,090
Ya ne ponimayu.

55
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,359
I don't know what you're saying.

56
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,160
Vash zavtrak gotov.

57
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,996
It's not important.

58
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,031
What is important

59
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,066
is that I have found someone.

60
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,229
What good is love if it's one-sided?

61
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:09,540
I have no choice

62
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,643
but to confess my feelings to Ed.

63
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:12,678
Da.

64
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,546
Now that, I understand.

65
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:17,248
It means yes.

66
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:18,383
My mother taught me that.

67
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:20,251
She used to tell me,

68
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:23,855
"Life only gives you
one true love, Oswald.

69
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,458
When you find it, run to it."

70
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,562
So that is what I'm going to do.

71
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,133
I'm also going to enroll
you in an ESL program.

72
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:36,401
You really should learn the language

73
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,468
if you're gonna work here.

74
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:45,843
So, I hear that Lee
Thompkins is running point

75
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,946
on Alice Tetch's blood at the GCPD.

76
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,948
That would make sense.

77
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:52,750
Can you get me a sit-down with her?

78
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,954
Oh, I see. You're willing to help me,

79
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,289
just not when it comes to your ex.

80
00:03:58,324 --> 00:03:59,657
It's complicated.

81
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,559
Actually, it's really simple.

82
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,027
You just pick up the
phone, you dial her number

83
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:04,595
and you let her know that
Valerie Vale would like

84
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,398
a sit-down to discuss
Alice Tetch's blood.

85
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,567
See? It's pretty simple.

86
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:13,438
She won't give you anything.

87
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,672
You leave that part to me.

88
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,125
You know, I can get used to this...

89
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,178
You helping me with my stories.

90
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,879
We make a pretty good team.

91
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:24,082
Hmm. Does that mean you'll
share your breakfast?

92
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,873
Absolutely not.

93
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:28,086
But really, when are you
gonna give up this P.I. act?

94
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,189
So far you've had two
cases... One girl died,

95
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,791
and the other one, well,
you never found her.

96
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:35,426
In baseball we call that an O-fer.

97
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,313
- I'm happy.
- Of course you are.

98
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,698
You get to drink scotch all
day and have sex with me.

99
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,166
Uh...

100
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,011
I got to go to work.

101
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:46,704
You know what?

102
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,539
This is nice.

103
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,076
Let me know when you
hear from Thompkins.

104
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,781
Uh-huh.

105
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,657
Can I help you?

106
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:07,925
James Gordon,

107
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,961
Jervis Tetch has a message for you.

108
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,931
Follow my friend where to go,

109
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,534
to learn the truth you've hidden below.

110
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:18,636
Should you choose not to play,

111
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:20,800
precious people will die today.

112
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:48,166
- This is Gordon.
- Hello, James.

113
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:49,934
Jervis.

114
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:51,973
Never should have left that
hole you were hiding in.

115
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,505
Oh, I wasn't just hiding.

116
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,574
I put the time to good use.

117
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,059
Made a thorough study of you.

118
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:02,513
Quite the fascinating
history, yet so tragic.

119
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,348
A father lost,

120
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:06,150
career gone by the wayside,

121
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:07,819
failed relationships.

122
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:09,992
And here I didn't think about your once.

123
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,418
Oh, James.

124
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,092
I've been inside that
head of yours, James.

125
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:16,828
I've seen

126
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:19,597
the web of lies you tell yourself.

127
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:22,166
Strung together to keep that

128
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:24,077
fragile psyche of yours intact.

129
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,837
Well, it's been nice
catching up with you.

130
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:29,373
I'm going to force you to
confront who you really are.

131
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,843
And I'm going to drive you mad

132
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:33,978
doing it. Now, please,

133
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,639
direct your eyes to the overpass.

134
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:38,716
Meet Dave and Amy Walters.

135
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,752
Married just this morning.

136
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,120
Lovely ceremony.

137
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,456
In 30 seconds they're going
to jump to their deaths.

138
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:48,292
Take the stairs and you
can save them. However,

139
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:49,861
down the street there's a little boy.

140
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:52,230
His name is Shane, and he's going to be

141
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:56,095
hit by a truck, driven by my
highly esteemed associate.

142
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,189
Choice is yours James.

143
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,578
You can't save both.

144
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:11,725
So, who's it going to be?

145
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,077
You can't save both.

146
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:51,079
You can't save both.

147
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,058
You son of a bitch.

148
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:05,090
Good, now I have your attention.

149
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,195
They were innocent, Jervis.
You didn't have to kill them.

150
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:08,830
It was your choice, James.

151
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,833
You practically pushed
them off the ledge.

152
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:15,237
- Stay with me, James. James?
- What?

153
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:18,540
87 Fulton Street,
apartment 4C. Five minutes.

154
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:21,543
No police or more people die.

155
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:32,020
Oh, boy, now it's official.

156
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,421
Why, you looking to back out?

157
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:35,373
You'd have to put a bullet in me.

158
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:36,791
Good thing I don't carry a gun.

159
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,030
My father called.

160
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,765
He wants to throw us
an engagement party.

161
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,934
- Told him we're not interested.
- Okay.

162
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:48,136
I know you had reservations
about moving back here.

163
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,038
And you know my dad... Half
measures aren't his thing.

164
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:51,339
If we say yes,

165
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,408
he's gonna put us on
display for the whole city.

166
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:54,678
I understand.

167
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,812
But we chose to build a life here.

168
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,434
And I'm glad.

169
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,534
An engagement party sounds wonderful.

170
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,957
These go directly to
the city clerk's office.

171
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:13,828
And this...

172
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:17,799
Leave this outside

173
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,935
Nicky the Nail's place. Knock twice.

174
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,803
Light it and then run.

175
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:23,838
Okay.

176
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,110
Good morning, Mayor Cobblepot.

177
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:31,379
Good morning to you, my chief of staff.

178
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:33,181
Here are your schedules for the
day. This covers your duties

179
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:35,884
as mayor, and this as
kingpin of the underworld.

180
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,550
You really are settling into
your role here, aren't you, Ed?

181
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,123
And yet I still have so
much to learn from you.

182
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,359
Oh...

183
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,198
I came up empty tracking down Butch.

184
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,133
Somehow

185
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,202
that one-handed ape
managed to disappear.

186
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:56,777
I suspect he's hiding with his old crew.

187
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,458
I'm sorry for letting you down.

188
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,945
You have done nothing of the sort.

189
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:07,184
I would be lost without you.

190
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:10,819
In fact, um...

191
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,421
there is something that
I need to tell you.

192
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,024
Something very important.

193
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,267
What is it, Oswald?

194
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,407
You know what? I forget.

195
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:35,210
In and out of my head, just like that.

196
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,778
Don't you hate that when that happens?

197
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:37,879
That never happens to me.

198
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,848
You know what? I believe that.

199
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:42,221
So, uh, where are we off to first?

200
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,086
PS 134. You're touring a school.

201
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,052
Press will be there, so
we better get a move on.

202
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,293
Great. I love children.

203
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:56,931
Okay, thank you very much. Okay?

204
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,238
Hey, Cap, I just spoke
to that kid over there.

205
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:04,773
You're not gonna believe this.

206
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:06,608
He said Jim Gordon saved his life.

207
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,777
Pulled him out of the way of a truck.

208
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,211
Get him on the phone now.

209
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,080
I already tried him. No answer.

210
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:17,786
What happened, you forget your cane?

211
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,988
I don't need it anymore.

212
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:22,090
Put an all-points out on Gordon.

213
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,712
I want him found.

214
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,595
Hey, does that guy look strange to you?

215
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:30,031
I mean, more so than
the usual whack job?

216
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,200
Hey, pal!

217
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,135
You see what happened here?

218
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,546
I have a message for you.

219
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:38,073
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

220
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,376
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

221
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:43,111
- He's hypnotized.
- James Gordon,

222
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:46,114
- I have a message for you.
- Tetch.

223
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,834
Jervis?

224
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,736
Cutting it close, James.

225
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,471
Like what you've done with the place.

226
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,152
Everyone needs a hobby.

227
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,809
Take a peek through the lens.

228
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,844
Let's chat face-to-face.

229
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:57,085
I wonder, what is it that you
have against married couples?

230
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,487
Bad memories, perhaps.

231
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,723
Understandable, given the last time

232
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,825
you saw a woman in a wedding dress,

233
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,232
she had a shotgun pointed at you.

234
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,974
- Hey, Jervis.
- Yes, James?

235
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,974
- Hello?
- Don't you ever do that again!

236
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,676
Okay.

237
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,147
This is about your sister, isn't it?

238
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,817
In your addled brain, you blame
me for what happened to her.

239
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:30,218
Don't you talk about her!

240
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,620
I got to know her, Jervis.
She was a good person.

241
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,255
That's why she hated you.

242
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,791
Why she died trying
to get away from you.

243
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,560
You want revenge, kill yourself.

244
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:42,220
Dismissive, rude. I
don't like your attitude.

245
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,326
Well, tell you what.

246
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,700
I'll come down, and we can
talk about it in person.

247
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,462
Hang up again, she dies.

248
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:52,240
- What are you talking about? Who?
- Surprising, really,

249
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,642
given that every
relationship you've been in

250
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,811
ended in such misery.

251
00:13:56,847 --> 00:14:00,582
And yet, you made the
choice to date again.

252
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:02,550
Poor girl. She had

253
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:05,687
no idea who she was
getting into bed with.

254
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,422
She will soon.

255
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:08,687
See for yourself.

256
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,141
Great thing about reporters.

257
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,564
Tell them you have a story,

258
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,533
and they'll meet you anywhere.

259
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,947
Got him in a safe house uptown.

260
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,550
You would not believe the
amount of steak that man eats.

261
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,868
Poor, Butchie. Nothing but
Tabitha and red meat all day.

262
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:45,447
You know, sooner or later,

263
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,583
Penguin is gonna figure
out who sprung him.

264
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,873
You need a plan, sweetie.

265
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,148
- I'm working on it.
- And in the meantime,

266
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:53,244
has the flame rekindled between you two,

267
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,812
or are you still holding out?

268
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,280
We'll see.

269
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,048
Oh, speaking of old flames.

270
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,617
Oh.

271
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,619
Well, you just can't seem to stay away.

272
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,754
- Tetch... where is he?
- How should I know?

273
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,024
And if you don't mind, Tabitha
and I are just in the mid...

274
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,393
Unnecessary.

275
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:10,961
Jervis Tetch kidnapped
Valerie Vale this morning.

276
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:12,563
He knew things that only
you could have told him.

277
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,565
I want to know where he is.

278
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,833
Oh. See that fire?

279
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,902
I mean, where was that
when we were together?

280
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:20,004
All I got was Captain Vanilla.

281
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,843
Seriously, we have to
open in a few hours.

282
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:28,045
- Then talk.
- Firstly,

283
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,613
I don't know where Tetch is.

284
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,248
Secondly, he may have come in here

285
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,883
a few days ago asking about you.

286
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,186
- Asking what?
- Oh, you know,

287
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,653
everything.

288
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,090
Family stuff, GCPD,
the women in your life.

289
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:42,038
He seemed especially interested in that.

290
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:44,195
He knew all about Vale
already, but I told him

291
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,829
about us.

292
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:47,798
About how you're still in love with me,

293
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,033
cry yourself to sleep at night.

294
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,068
And Lee?

295
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,536
Did you tell him about her?

296
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,004
Oh, you mean

297
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,971
Miss Rebound from me? Of course.

298
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:02,246
We'll send you a bill for the damage.

299
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:03,581
Lee, listen to me.

300
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:04,915
I'm sorry, James.

301
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,383
Lee can't come to the phone right now.

302
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:07,751
Can I take a message?

303
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:09,153
No? Good.

304
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,404
Gotham Water and Power, ten minutes.

305
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,124
I need to know she's
okay, both Lee and Vale.

306
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,926
What you want means nothing to me!

307
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:17,962
Nine minutes.

308
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,400
James sends his regards.

309
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,569
Now, where were we?

310
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,572
Oh, yes, introductions.

311
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:31,742
Lee Thompkins, meet Valerie Vale.

312
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:35,442
You both have one very
important thing in common.

313
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:39,383
You're two halves of Jim Gordon's heart.

314
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:49,660
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

315
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,895
Where is Jervis Tetch?

316
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,297
James Gordon,

317
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:55,781
- I have a message for you.
- Yeah, I know.

318
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,084
You said that the first
hundred times I asked you.

319
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,604
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

320
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,641
Where is he?! I know you can hear me!

321
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,184
Hey, Cap, a uni just spotted Gordon

322
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,020
pulling up to Gotham Water and Power.

323
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,764
Tell him to hold his
position till we get there.

324
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:54,672
Glad you could make it, James.

325
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:58,295
Where's Lee and Vale?

326
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:00,831
Oh, you clearly have no
sense for stagecraft.

327
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:03,233
We must build to the climax.

328
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:05,903
This is merely the second act,

329
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:07,705
where we stoke the tension.

330
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,844
On the right is one of
Gotham's finest pediatricians.

331
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:17,314
On the left, Channel
Five's favorite anchor.

332
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,151
A doctor and a journalist.

333
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:23,253
- You get it?
- Yeah, I get it.

334
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,922
The choice is simple, you see. It's kill

335
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:26,919
one, and the other will go free.

336
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:29,259
But if your answer to me is "no,"

337
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:32,029
a thousand watts into them will go.

338
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:50,514
Sorry, Jervis. I'm not killing anyone.

339
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:51,849
Yes, you will!

340
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:54,091
Now pick up the pistol and fire!

341
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:57,087
You want to show me who I
really am, then show me.

342
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:58,589
Oh, I will.

343
00:18:58,624 --> 00:18:59,957
I'm done playing your game.

344
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,024
Jim!

345
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:05,963
Hold.

346
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,364
What the hell's going on here?

347
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,632
Captain Barnes, you're just

348
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:12,703
in time to see James kill
these two innocent men.

349
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:14,271
You need to find the
main power shutoff now.

350
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,407
- Go.
- Even when

351
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:19,309
you don't choose, James,
there are consequences.

352
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,617
No!

353
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,758
No. No!

354
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:39,296
- I'm gonna find you.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.

355
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,302
Just ask an old friend
how to get to the end.

356
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,633
This is our third grade class.

357
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,559
How many more grades
do we have to visit?

358
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,461
This is a K through 12 building.

359
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,330
- Twelve?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,432
We don't have to see
every single class, do we?

361
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,313
Mayor James used to
read to the children.

362
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,113
Aubrey James is illiterate, ma'am.

363
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,462
- It's well documented.
- Perhaps we should move on.

364
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:11,788
What's wrong with that boy there?

365
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:15,659
That's Luke.

366
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,210
He's new here.

367
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,040
Hello, Luke.

368
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,108
I am Mayor Cobblepot.

369
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,210
Why aren't you playing
with the other children?

370
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,047
What if they don't like me?

371
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:40,350
Well, how would you ever know
if you don't give it a try?

372
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:44,888
And if they don't like you,

373
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,723
wait for them to turn their backs

374
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:48,358
and push them down the stairs.

375
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,802
Little guy needed a push. That's all.

376
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,238
I continue to be in awe of you, Oswald.

377
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,378
Ed.

378
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,816
There is something I
would like to discuss

379
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,898
in a more private setting.

380
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:18,321
Shall we say dinner
at the mansion, 8:00?

381
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,423
I'll pick us up a nice bottle of wine.

382
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,894
Tetch has

383
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,329
Lee Thompkins and Valerie Vale.

384
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,264
- You're sure?
- Saw him take Vale.

385
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,101
And I called Lee's cell
and he answered. So, yeah,

386
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,635
pretty sure. Call the M.E.'s office,

387
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,307
call her fiancé... Find her.

388
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,944
What the hell is going on here?

389
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,146
Tetch blames me for what
happened to his sister.

390
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,281
- He wants revenge.
- So, what,

391
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,583
he kills two innocent civilians.

392
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,084
- How does that track?
- He's obsessed

393
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,086
with showing me who I really am,

394
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,088
driving me insane.

395
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:55,525
He killed them, and I just stood there.

396
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,193
What were you supposed to do,

397
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,262
shoot one of 'em? You
did what you could.

398
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,263
That's on him.

399
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,121
This is just to prepare me.

400
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:08,405
He's gonna make me choose.

401
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,741
He's gonna put me in
front of Lee and Vale,

402
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,576
and he's gonna make me choose.

403
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:16,479
- And if I don't...
- He'll kill both of them.

404
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:21,584
We're gonna find her.

405
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,506
I promise you that.

406
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,957
Listen to me, Tetch is a lunatic.

407
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,626
He's gonna get caught.

408
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:31,461
The most you can hope for
is a lifetime in prison.

409
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,329
- Don't do this.
- Dumfree,

410
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:36,299
let's see what's in the kitchen.

411
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:38,334
Mm-hmm.

412
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:44,741
Nice try.

413
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:46,562
So why'd they bring
us back to your place?

414
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:47,610
Like I know.

415
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,279
Well, any chance your
boyfriend might come home?

416
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:50,580
Not likely.

417
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,967
You do know what this
is about, don't you?

418
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:58,822
Yes. Tetch blames Jim for his sister,
and we're his means for revenge.

419
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:00,690
- I've been here before.
- That's too big.

420
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:02,420
It's never gonna spring the mechanism.

421
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,496
You know, it is kind of ironic though.

422
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:09,599
I was just asking Jim to get
me a sit-down with you, and...

423
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:11,501
- here we are.
- Uh-huh.

424
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:15,300
See, I'm running a story
on Alice Tetch's blood.

425
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:17,627
I know you're running
point for the GCPD.

426
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,811
You're not seriously trying to
interview me right now, are you?

427
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,413
Jim said you wouldn't talk to me.

428
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:24,615
And he was right.

429
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,810
I think he was just
being protective of you.

430
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,621
Anyway, about Alice Tetch,

431
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:33,356
I hear they're running
experiments on her blood

432
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:34,891
at the GCPD bio facility.

433
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:37,460
- Care to comment?
- Maybe you're just really sacred

434
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:38,862
and this is your way of coping,

435
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:41,064
or maybe you're just insanely
committed to your job.

436
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,967
Either way, all I'm interested
in is getting out of here.

437
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:46,440
Try a cuticle pusher.

438
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:49,239
My dad was a cop... Taught
me how to pick locks.

439
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:50,807
I can walk you through it.

440
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:52,542
Thank you.

441
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,044
And in exchange, you can
talk to me about Alice Tetch.

442
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,514
You and Jim are made for each other.

443
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,115
Thanks.

444
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,760
It's not a compliment.

445
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,554
Thank you, Dr. Calvi. I'll call
you as soon as we hear anything.

446
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:07,157
Mario's been in surgery all morning.

447
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:10,627
Says that he and Lee left the
house together this morning.

448
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,763
She was headed to the station.
He hasn't heard from her since.

449
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:15,598
Jervis must have grabbed
her before she got here.

450
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,400
What's his next move?

451
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:18,902
Tetch wants me to find him.

452
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,637
Well, if that's the case, then
why didn't he just tell you

453
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,105
- where he is?
- I don't know.

454
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,374
But the last thing he said was
something about an old friend

455
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:25,708
leading me to him.

456
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,911
Well, I'm not just
gonna sit here and wait

457
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:30,680
for Tetch to send you an invitation.

458
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,583
Listen up!

459
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:38,254
Jervis Tetch thinks that Gotham
is his personal playground.

460
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,456
He's taken innocent lives.

461
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:43,411
And now he has Lee
Thompkins and Valerie Vale.

462
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,898
And to whoever puts the collar on Tetch,

463
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:50,233
my personal gratitude
and best bottle of brown.

464
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:51,568
Now go to work.

465
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,899
Follow my friend where to go.

466
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:58,374
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

467
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,709
James Gordon,

468
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:02,579
- I have a message for you.
- Hey.

469
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,144
James Gordon.

470
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:11,106
- I have a message for you.
- How do I get to the end?

471
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,979
"The true test will be revealed.

472
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:38,089
"A final decision you must yield.

473
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,185
"Our tea party begins once more...

474
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:46,787
when you walk through
Lee Thompkins' door."

475
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,034
- Jim.
- Not now.

476
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:00,837
What the hell is going on? Where's Lee?

477
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,572
Look, you're just
gonna have to trust me.

478
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,579
Trust you? According to Captain Barnes,

479
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:11,381
you're the reason she's
in trouble to begin with.

480
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,615
You know something.

481
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,317
You know where she is, don't you?

482
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:16,319
Keep your voice down.

483
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:17,453
Does Barnes know?

484
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,555
- Where is he?
- No, he does not know.

485
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:22,892
Because if he showed up with 20 cops,
both Lee and Vale would be dead.

486
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:25,828
I see. So you're gonna go
in all alone and save 'em?

487
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,330
Is that it?

488
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:30,199
Actually, you might be the
only person who could help me.

489
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:32,235
Come on.

490
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:36,139
- Remember, you have to feel...
- I got it.

491
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,076
Can I ask you something?

492
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:42,645
As long as it's not about
Alice Tetch's blood.

493
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:46,908
Why'd you move back to Gotham?

494
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:48,184
The way I hear it,

495
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:50,520
you made a pretty nice life
for yourself down south.

496
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:52,221
It's really none of your business.

497
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:53,890
Maybe not.

498
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:56,426
But you could have moved to
any city, gotten any job,

499
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:57,927
yet you chose Gotham

500
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,951
and the GCPD.

501
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,932
You realize that we both
might die today, right?

502
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,165
Mm-hmm.

503
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,861
Well?

504
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:08,438
I didn't come here for James Gordon,

505
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:11,240
if that's what you're worried about.

506
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,042
Not bad.

507
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:16,045
- My turn.
- Okay.

508
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:18,147
- Okay, so what's our plan?
- You're gonna break free,

509
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,382
we're gonna lure in one of these goons,

510
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:20,950
hit him over the head with something.

511
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:22,885
Not good.

512
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,887
Um, you can still get out of here.

513
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,056
I'm not leaving you here.
There's got to be something else

514
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:28,524
- we can use.
- My, my.

515
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:31,928
You two have been busy.

516
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:35,298
Now, if you'd kindly join
me in the dining room,

517
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,601
the guest of honor will be here shortly.

518
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,255
Welcome to our tea party, James.

519
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,666
We've been expecting you.

520
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:21,332
Please.

521
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:26,771
Have a seat.

522
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:33,278
- I think I'll stand.
- You'll do what I say

523
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,779
or things will get messy.

524
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:36,481
And by messy I mean

525
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:38,283
my two friends will pull their triggers,

526
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,485
and then we'll have blood and brains

527
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,979
all over this beautiful table.

528
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,257
So...

529
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:49,441
place your gun on the
platter and have a seat.

530
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,464
Really?

531
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,865
After all we've been through today,

532
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,867
you have to think about it?

533
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,503
Not everyone here has to die.

534
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,389
It's gonna be okay.

535
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,493
Don't lie to them, James.

536
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:23,661
Lee,

537
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,865
would you mind passing
that down to James?

538
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,033
I must apologize

539
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,035
for the hideous china.

540
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:34,649
Frankly, I expected more
from Don Falcone's son.

541
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,874
I guess I know what I'm
getting you for your wedding.

542
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:43,715
To good health.

543
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,083
I think I'll pass.

544
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,150
Me, too.

545
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,521
You know what,

546
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:51,923
I'll have some.

547
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,827
Bravo, James.

548
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,365
Now,

549
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,767
I'd like to begin by telling the story

550
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,103
of a brother and a sister,

551
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,873
separated for years but
whose love never waned.

552
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,409
Fair warning though,

553
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:14,178
it has a sad ending.

554
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,534
But I couldn't find my sister alone,

555
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,737
so I turned to this man, James Gordon,

556
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:41,606
whom everyone said was a good man,

557
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:43,340
an honorable man.

558
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,791
And what did this good man do?

559
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,910
Why,

560
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,580
he found my sister and
he turned her against me,

561
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:52,116
poisoning her mind.
And then he killed her!

562
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,055
Does that sound about right, James?

563
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,357
- Sure, why not?
- Now, James,

564
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:01,992
I get the sense you're not being honest.

565
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:04,462
Though that's not
surprising, considering

566
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:08,199
you've run from your true
self every day of your life.

567
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,702
But you can't run from this choice.

568
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:15,890
The woman you love is going to die.

569
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,563
I just need to figure
out which one it is.

570
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,249
So let's review our options, shall we?

571
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:40,965
On the one hand, we have Lee Thompkins.

572
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,534
Intelligent, kind.

573
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,269
She thought she could save you

574
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,088
from your darkness,
drag you into the light.

575
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:50,141
And what did she get for her efforts?

576
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,809
Hmm?

577
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:54,278
Pain and sadness.

578
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,819
Don't listen to him, Lee.

579
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,916
Look in her eyes.

580
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,347
She still has love for you, James.

581
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,295
And then,

582
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,731
there's Valerie Vale.

583
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,867
The intrepid reporter

584
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:17,535
from a blue-collar family.

585
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,032
She still has hope for you.

586
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:25,211
What will happen when she
learns who you really are?

587
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,645
So...

588
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:31,379
those are the choices.

589
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,420
Now it's up to you.

590
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,656
Which lady...

591
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:40,591
has your heart?

592
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,427
Who do you love?

593
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,463
You want me to choose?

594
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,398
Tell these idiots to lower their guns.

595
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,400
I don't trust them not
to shoot me by accident.

596
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:52,236
You're right. They are stupid.

597
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,505
Down, boys.

598
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:56,107
Now you drop your gun.

599
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:59,677
- And why would I do that?
- Because I'll shoot you.

600
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,116
Well, well.

601
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,151
You okay?

602
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,563
This was your grand plan, James?

603
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:11,923
Play along until Dr.
Calvi could sneak in

604
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,192
and shoot me dead?

605
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:16,094
Well, there's only one small problem.

606
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,596
Before you arrived, I
went down to the basement,

607
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:20,031
and switched the magazine

608
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,432
in that gun with an empty one.

609
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:25,303
My apologies, Dr. Calvi.

610
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,338
I only set the table for four.

611
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,808
Dumfree, will you please escort
the doctor to the bathroom?

612
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:34,545
I believe there's still
one chain in working order.

613
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,615
Now...

614
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,297
I'm out of patience.

615
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,622
Who do you love?

616
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:46,491
You want to talk about love, fine.

617
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,793
Let's talk about who you love,

618
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,027
- or loved.
- Don't.

619
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,562
Your sister knew you were crazy, Jervis.

620
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:52,713
Stop it.

621
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,500
She was terrified of you. She hated you.

622
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,301
- Enough.
- She told me...

623
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,247
what you did to her when you were kids.

624
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:03,674
The thought of you disgusted her.

625
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,809
Lies! Deceit!

626
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,677
The story you tell is incomplete.

627
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,846
She loved me. She loved you?

628
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,481
She killed herself
rather than be with you.

629
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:12,283
She didn't... no.

630
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:15,820
She impaled herself on a
spike and died in agony

631
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:18,656
because even that was better
than having you touch her.

632
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:20,458
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

633
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,660
I saw her when she was dying.

634
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:24,162
Her face...

635
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:26,841
when she knew she was
finally safe from you,

636
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:29,033
she was smiling.

637
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,336
Because despite the pain, she was happy.

638
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,005
Liar!

639
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,975
She was the only thing I ever loved,

640
00:34:38,011 --> 00:34:39,811
and you, you...

641
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:42,013
sent her soul to heaven above.

642
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,481
Yes.

643
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,983
That's right... me.

644
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,885
I'm the one you want.

645
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,521
So let Lee and Vale go.

646
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:54,992
Keep me but let them go.

647
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:02,033
Oh, James.

648
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,174
You're trying to confuse me.

649
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,508
But I won't let you.

650
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:13,244
No. I'm determined

651
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,414
that you'll live on and suffer

652
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,705
without your love as I have.

653
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:21,285
Choose.

654
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:26,424
No. I won't choose.

655
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,725
You will.

656
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,260
You will.

657
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,095
You'll certainly spill.

658
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,671
I'll make it easy for you.

659
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:42,173
On the count of three,

660
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,476
instead of telling me who you love,

661
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,244
tell me who to kill.

662
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,582
Or I shoot them both of them,

663
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:54,662
which would be such a thrill.

664
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:58,943
One.

665
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:06,297
Two.

666
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,638
Three.

667
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:14,939
Kill Lee.

668
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,376
Oh, finally.

669
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:20,711
The truth is revealed.

670
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:23,381
You chose Lee because you love Vale.

671
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,451
Very well.

672
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,553
I knew you had it in you, James.

673
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:32,957
All this time, you made everyone believe

674
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:34,859
you were the hero,

675
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:37,328
but deep down you always knew the truth.

676
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,371
You're a villain.

677
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:44,540
Vale.

678
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:48,803
This is Dr. Leslie Thompkins.

679
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:51,242
Please send an ambulance
to 25 Blackstone Drive.

680
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:52,710
Hurry!

681
00:36:52,745 --> 00:36:53,945
Move.

682
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,181
You're gonna be okay, Vale. You hear me?

683
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,320
You're gonna be okay. Hold on.

684
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:07,411
Victim's name is Valerie Vale.

685
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:09,012
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

686
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:11,715
BP's 100/60.

687
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,050
Tachy's at 160.

688
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:15,052
O.R. One's prepped and ready to go.

689
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,420
Clear the way.

690
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:17,888
Clear the way, please.

691
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:19,623
I've got her from here.

692
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:42,279
Ed.

693
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:45,249
A man comes to a crossroads in his life,

694
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:47,618
and he has to make a choice.

695
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:50,921
Does he choose safety and cowardice

696
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:54,564
or does he opt for courage
and risk everything?

697
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:57,541
I choose courage.

698
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,452
What I'm trying to say is...

699
00:38:04,403 --> 00:38:08,505
The thing I've been wanting
to tell you all day long is...

700
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:12,704
I love you.

701
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:40,204
Impossible to pick the
perfect bottle, isn't it?

702
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,407
Well, it all depends
on region and vintage.

703
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:46,143
Of course, you have to
consider the wine pairing.

704
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:54,411
Miss Kringle?

705
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:57,454
No. Oh, no. My name's Isabella.

706
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,267
Um, I'm sorry to bother you; I
don't usually talk to people.

707
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:03,467
There's just, um, something about you.

708
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:04,987
No, no, please. There's...

709
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,866
There's no need to apologize.

710
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:10,701
You ju...

711
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:13,964
You remind me of someone
that I used to know.

712
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:16,486
A long time ago.

713
00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:24,581
You struggle to regain me.

714
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:26,427
When I'm lost...

715
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:28,719
you struggle to obtain me.

716
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:30,784
What am I?

717
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:34,291
Time.

718
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,595
I'm Edward.

719
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:41,180
Edward Nygma.

720
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:51,074
Jim.

721
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,141
- How is she?
- Still in surgery.

722
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:56,346
She seems like a tough
cookie; she'll be all right.

723
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:58,382
What about Tetch?

724
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,417
We got the whole department
canvassing the city.

725
00:40:00,452 --> 00:40:01,767
We'll find him.

726
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,422
Why didn't you come to me?

727
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:08,217
I couldn't.

728
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:12,262
And I thought I could save them both.

729
00:40:12,298 --> 00:40:15,165
You did what you thought was right.

730
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,367
Maybe.

731
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:22,434
In the end, I did
exactly what he wanted.

732
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:26,507
He won.

733
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:32,649
We'll see.

734
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:50,133
Mario's a great doctor.

735
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:51,507
She'll pull through.

736
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:59,348
- Lee, about what I said...
- Jim.

737
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,833
Not now.
