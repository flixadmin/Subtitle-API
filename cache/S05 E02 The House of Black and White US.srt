1
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,711
In the old times, whenever Braavos
stood in danger,

2
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,299
the Titan would step
with fire in his eyes.

3
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,511
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

4
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,514
He's just a statue.

5
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,397
Don't be afraid.
He's announcing our arrival.

6
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:30,984
I'm not afraid.

7
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,597
The House of Black and White.

8
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,933
This is where you'll find
the man you seek.

9
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,399
Here I leave you.

10
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:01,825
Thank you for bringing me.

11
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,244
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

12
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,541
-Valar morghulis.
-Valar dohaeris.

13
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,828
Hello.

14
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,875
Valar morghulis.

15
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,513
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

16
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,644
No one here by that name.

17
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,729
Please.

18
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,483
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

19
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,568
You have everywhere else to go.

20
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,237
But wait--

21
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,883
Cersei.

22
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,177
Walder Frey.

23
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,888
The Mountain.

24
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,725
Meryn Trant.

25
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,602
Cersei.

26
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,814
Walder Frey.

27
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,692
The Mountain.

28
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,112
Meryn Trant.

29
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,781
Cersei. Walder Frey.

30
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,450
The Mountain.

31
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:08,952
Meryn Trant.

32
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,164
Cersei.

33
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,749
Walder Frey.

34
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,417
The Mountain.

35
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,294
Meryn Trant.

36
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,337
Cersei.

37
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,299
Walder Frey.

38
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,260
The Mountain.

39
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,305
Meryn Trant.

40
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,588
Must be good food if it's crowded.

41
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,053
Ale?

42
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,728
Ale?

43
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,781
Before we left,
a maester gave you a raven scroll.

44
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,994
You are becoming an observant young lady.

45
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,831
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

46
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,292
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

47
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:41,837
Excuse me.

48
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,880
So it was good news?

49
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,466
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

50
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,386
I thought you still mourned
the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

51
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,679
Ale?

52
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,472
I'll have some.

53
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,896
-My lady.
-What is it?

54
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,731
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

55
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,194
-You sure?
-She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

56
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,613
-She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.
-Littlefinger?

57
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,240
A bunch of knights with him.

58
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,742
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick?
Six? Twenty?

59
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,161
Ten, I think. Too many.

60
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,454
My lady, I don't think this is the right--

61
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,291
-Ready the horses.
-We only have one horse.

62
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,375
Find more.

63
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,258
Do you like the taste?

64
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,594
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

65
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,638
Why do men love it so much?

66
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,807
It gives some men courage.

67
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,601
Does it give you courage?

68
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
That's far enough.

69
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,776
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

70
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,489
-My name is Brienne of Tarth.
-We've met with Renly Baratheon.

71
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,075
What did he say about you?

72
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,497
He said,
"Your loyalty came free of charge."

73
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,585
Someone appears to have paid quite a bit
for it since then.

74
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,516
Lady Sansa…

75
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,605
before your mother's death,
I was her sworn sword.

76
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,442
I gave my word
I would find you and protect you.

77
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,445
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

78
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,948
and give my life for yours if need be.

79
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,534
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

80
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,456
Please, Lady Brienne,
no need for such formality.

81
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,584
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

82
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,294
-I was.
-Strange.

83
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,214
I knew Cat from the time we were children.
She never mentioned you.

84
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,967
It was after Renly's murder.

85
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,178
-Ah, yes.
-You were accused of killing him.

86
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,847
-I tried to save him.
-But you were accused.

87
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,017
-By men who didn't see what happened.
-And what did happen?

88
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,691
He was murdered by a shadow.

89
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,902
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

90
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,654
A shadow?

91
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,157
With the face--

92
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,870
This woman swore to protect Renly.

93
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,792
She failed. She swore to protect
your mother, she failed.

94
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,669
Why would I want somebody

95
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,130
with your history of failure
guarding Lady Sansa?

96
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,340
Why should you have any say
in her affairs?

97
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,425
Because I am her uncle.

98
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,928
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

99
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,098
We're family now and you are an outsider.

100
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,019
Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experience
has made me wary of outsiders.

101
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,939
-Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--
-No.

102
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,191
Please, my lady. If I could explain--

103
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,153
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding
bowing to the King.

104
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,988
Neither of us wanted to be there.

105
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,701
-Sometimes we don't have a choice.
-And sometimes we do.

106
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,954
You should leave.

107
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,542
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

108
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,712
The roads in these parts aren't safe.
Why don't you stay?

109
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,973
The man asked you to stay,
so why don't you--

110
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,437
Hyah! Hyah!

111
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,279
Hyah! Hyah!

112
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,489
After her!

113
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,815
-Stop! Stop!
-I'll take him!

114
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,442
Podrick!

115
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:16,986
Hold on to her!

116
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,950
Take her!

117
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,134
Keep moving!

118
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,718
Go on!

119
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,858
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

120
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,197
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

121
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,201
No, no, no, stop!

122
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,223
I guess that means you're unarmed.

123
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,893
Down, Podrick! Down!

124
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,499
-Podrick.
-Yes, my lady?

125
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,501
You can stand now.

126
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,377
Yes, my lady.

127
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:01,799
Sansa Stark?

128
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,844
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

129
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,764
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

130
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,349
We'll follow them.

131
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,727
My lady, if both Stark girls
refused your service,

132
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,480
maybe you're released from your vow.

133
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,440
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

134
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,692
-But if they don't want your protection?
-Do you think she's safe

135
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,818
with Littlefinger?

136
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,115
-No, my lady.
-Get your horse.

137
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,544
A summons from the queen.

138
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,314
There are only two like it in the world.

139
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,651
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

140
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,904
-It's a threat.
-Of course it's a threat.

141
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,118
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

142
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,370
"It's a threat."

143
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,957
No note?

144
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,751
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

145
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,547
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

146
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,091
I will burn their cities
to the ground if they touch her.

147
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,301
-Softer.
-What?

148
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,053
-Not so loud.
-Our daughter's in danger

149
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,055
and you're worried
I'm speaking too loudly?

150
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,890
The world can't know she's our daughter.

151
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,436
Then don't call her your daughter.

152
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,439
-You've never been a father to her.
-If I was a father to any

153
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,107
of my children,
they'd de stoned in the streets.

154
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,692
And what has your caution brought?

155
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,988
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

156
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,866
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

157
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,330
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

158
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,508
-I'm going to make things better.
-You've never made anything better.

159
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,428
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

160
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,224
You can't just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

161
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,479
-She's promised to his son.
-I'm not going to ask him anything.

162
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

163
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,483
No army.

164
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,902
Do you know where they're keeping her?

165
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,199
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

166
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,742
I'll find her.

167
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,413
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

168
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,251
You're going to Dorne?

169
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,215
A one-handed man alone?

170
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,967
I never said I was going alone.

171
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,895
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

172
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,606
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

173
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,402
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

174
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,487
We can have a harp if you like,
but no flutes.

175
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,989
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

176
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,283
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

177
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,536
That's what they eat
in the capital, don't they?

178
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,288
Don't they?

179
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,961
-Don't who?
-People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

180
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,132
They certainly do, my dear.
They certainly do.

181
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,218
It's a fine place, isn't it?

182
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,470
A fine place.

183
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,641
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

184
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,643
You won't.

185
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,064
-Pardon?
-We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

186
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,859
When mother dies, my sister gets
the castle because she's older.

187
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,444
She hates me.

188
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,405
She calls me mean names
and sometimes even still

189
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,407
she pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.

190
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,910
You know what I think?

191
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,329
I think you're a good person.

192
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,041
-And your sister is a mean person.
-She is.

193
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,173
I've been all over the world,
and if there's one thing I've learned,

194
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,550
it's that meanness comes around.

195
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,011
People like your sister,

196
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,097
they always get what's coming to them
eventually.

197
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,683
One way or another.

198
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,605
Who's that?

199
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,359
Jaime fucking Lannister.

200
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,114
-Ser Jaime.
-Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

201
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,993
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

202
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,453
Thank you.

203
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,456
This is my betrothed Lollys.

204
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,709
A pleasure.

205
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,755
Run along, love.

206
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,305
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

207
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,016
When were you planning on getting married?

208
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,060
-Just get on with it.
-On with what?

209
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,230
What you're here for.
There's no way this little visit

210
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,815
could possibly mean anything good for me.

211
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,233
It's very good for you.

212
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,540
Lollys will be marrying
Ser Willis Bracken.

213
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,918
We made a deal, your sister and I.

214
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,755
-I would have advised against that.
-How is this good for me?

215
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,550
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

216
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,303
And when we return, I'm going to give you
a much better girl

217
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,930
and a much better castle.

218
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,268
Return from where?

219
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,271
As far south as south goes.

220
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,494
My future queen.

221
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,547
You are my queen.

222
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,385
Queen of Dorne.

223
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,641
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

224
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,645
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long axe and I'll shove it--

225
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,730
Captain.

226
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,816
Let her pass.

227
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,906
Your brother was murdered

228
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,785
and you sit here in the Water Gardens
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

229
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:49,540
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

230
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,126
-Your brother.
-You don't have to remind me.

231
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,837
He was my brother long before
he was anything to you.

232
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,508
-What will you do about his death?
-I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

233
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,261
-And then?
-You would have me go to war?

234
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,846
The whole country
would have you go to war.

235
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,515
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

236
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,230
The Sand Snakes are with me.
They have the love of their people.

237
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,191
They will avenge their father
while you sit here

238
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,693
in your chair doing nothing.

239
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,491
Oberyn is dead

240
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,453
and this Lannister girl skips
about the Water Gardens

241
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,623
eating our food, breathing our air.

242
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,502
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

243
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,338
Let me have her.

244
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,177
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

245
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,180
I loved my brother.

246
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,141
And you made him very happy.

247
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,061
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

248
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,941
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

249
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,943
Not here.

250
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,028
Not while I rule.

251
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,115
And how long will that be?

252
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,717
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

253
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,428
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

254
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,139
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

255
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,141
You haven't, have you?

256
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,562
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

257
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,358
they drink, they whore,
fight in the streets,

258
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,446
they blend in.
They overhear things in taverns,

259
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,199
follow people from the taverns
to nice, quiet alleys,

260
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,201
break a few fingers,

261
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,746
overhear a few more things.

262
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,457
Before you know it…

263
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,561
No one here.

264
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:17,688
We go.

265
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,524
In a hurry? You're afraid?

266
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,526
Unsullied fear nothing.

267
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:24,945
Right.

268
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,697
That's your problem.

269
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,910
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

270
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:36,290
Someone who's forgotten fear
has forgotten how to hide.

271
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,009
Fear is useful that way.

272
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,329
Sons of the Harpy, they want
to put a collar back on my neck.

273
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,083
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

274
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,209
It would send a message.

275
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,087
I think you should
exercise restraint, Your Grace.

276
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,213
Why?

277
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,090
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

278
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,843
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

279
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,637
-How do you know that?
-Because I questioned him.

280
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,015
And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

281
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,142
He is born free.

282
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,435
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

283
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,062
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

284
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,897
was knowing that there was someone
lower than he was.

285
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,359
They pay him.
Great families afraid to do a thing.

286
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,819
They pay poor man to do it for them.

287
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,821
-And how do you know this?
-Everyone know this.

288
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,198
I don't know it and I'm the head
of a great family.

289
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,367
We do not know what this man did
or didn't do.

290
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,453
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

291
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,331
Show all the citizens of Meereen

292
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,292
that you're better
than those who would depose you.

293
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,127
Teach them a better way.

294
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,421
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

295
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,923
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

296
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,220
But here in Meereen,
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

297
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,641
So we learn much about them
or we do not live long.

298
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,186
They teach me what they are.

299
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,773
Mercy, fair trial,
these mean nothing to them.

300
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,775
All they understand is blood.

301
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,824
Thank you all for your counsel.

302
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,878
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

303
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,796
-About what?
-About your father.

304
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,466
-About the Mad King.
-The Mad King?

305
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,967
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

306
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,011
-Consider me reminded.
-Your Grace…

307
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,889
I served in his Kingsguard.

308
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,268
I was at his side from the first.
Your enemies did not lie.

309
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,772
Go on.

310
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,151
When the people rose
in revolt against him,

311
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,112
your father set their towns
and castles aflame.

312
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,574
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

313
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,704
He burned men alive with wildfire
and laughed as they screamed.

314
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,291
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

315
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,546
led to rebellion that killed
every Targaryen except two.

316
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,341
I'm not my father.

317
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,927
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

318
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,807
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

319
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,936
And each time, it made him feel powerful
and right.

320
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,689
Until the very end.

321
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,197
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

322
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,577
Your Grace.

323
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,590
-There's a bug.
-Yes, best be careful.

324
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,051
You might accidently
consume some solid food.

325
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,681
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

326
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:30,274
Besides, what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

327
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,735
-You don't like it?
-I want to take a walk.

328
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:37,156
You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

329
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,782
She ought to offer her cunt.

330
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,535
Best part of her for the best part of me.

331
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,581
Well, I suppose a box is as good a place
for me as anywhere.

332
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,251
Are we really going
to spend the entire road to Volantis

333
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,295
talking about the futility of everything?

334
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,838
You're right. No point.

335
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,132
The road to Volantis?

336
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,469
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

337
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,054
The road to Meereen.

338
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,474
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

339
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,311
-I told you. A ruler.
-We've already got a ruler.

340
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,064
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

341
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,442
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

342
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,486
has someone's banner hanging from it.

343
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,572
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

344
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,950
During your brief tenure as Hand.

345
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,497
-I didn't rule. I was a servant.
-Still, a man of talent.

346
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,082
Managed to kill a lot of people.

347
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,002
Yes, but you showed
great promise in other areas as well.

348
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,341
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

349
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,718
She begged me.

350
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,679
-I wouldn't go.
-Why?

351
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,139
'Cause I liked it.

352
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,811
Power. Even as a servant.

353
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,271
People follow leaders.

354
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,235
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

355
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,988
-I find us repulsive.
-And we find them repulsive,

356
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,409
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

357
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,410
to keep them away.

358
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,412
And yet,

359
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,914
no matter what we do,

360
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,752
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

361
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,212
Not for long.

362
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:17,923
You're right.

363
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,926
-Let's go for a walk.
-No.

364
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,429
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

365
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,306
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

366
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,229
Not him.

367
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,690
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

368
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,942
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

369
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,944
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

370
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,155
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

371
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,532
Mistakes will be made.

372
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,534
-Thank you, Your Grace, thank you.
-Your Grace, thank you.

373
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,327
-Take the head.
-Pardon me, Your Grace.

374
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:51,081
I would take it if you don't mind.
It could prove useful for my work.

375
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,584
Very good.

376
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,255
Over there? Will be fine.

377
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,842
You heard the man. Over there.

378
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,789
-You're the Hand of the King?
-No, Uncle.

379
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,460
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

380
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,171
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

381
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,839
and chooses a Hand for himself.

382
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,343
Your Grace, I would
be willing to serve provisionally

383
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,470
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough--

384
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,681
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

385
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,728
In addition to being Master of Ships,
the King has appointed you Master of Coin.

386
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,981
Oh, Your Grace.

387
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,527
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

388
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,363
He said he would be honored to have you

389
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,281
represent the crown's interests
in the same.

390
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,908
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

391
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,370
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

392
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,289
a Grand Maester has served
as the King's Hand.

393
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,502
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

394
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:26,301
Your Grace, him? This… this man?
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

395
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:32,057
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

396
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,810
The qualification of loyalty,
Grand Maester.

397
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,687
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

398
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,273
Far more than many ever have.

399
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,109
I must say, I cannot see--

400
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,655
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

401
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,575
it would please the King if you would
serve as his Master of War.

402
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,619
No man living better deserves the title.

403
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,913
That is kind of you to say.

404
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,624
I would like to hear it
from the King himself.

405
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,668
The King is very busy at this moment.

406
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,254
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

407
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,966
He is learning. On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

408
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,551
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

409
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,388
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

410
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,433
And to you. And to serve the King.

411
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,437
I did not return to the capital
to serve as your puppet.

412
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,982
To watch you stack
the small council with sycophants.

413
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,985
Sending your own brother
away so he wouldn't be--

414
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,864
My brother has left the capital to lead
a sensitive diplomatic mission.

415
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,990
What mission?

416
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,950
That is not your concern as Master of War.

417
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:39,082
I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

418
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,961
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

419
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,259
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

420
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,179
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

421
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,306
At Casterly Rock.

422
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,274
Come on, you know this one.

423
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,736
It looks like an animal.

424
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:11,948
Snake.

425
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,826
S… snake. S.

426
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,454
-It's an S.
-Right, very good.

427
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,292
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history

428
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,503
Osric Stark was elected at the age of ten?

429
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,798
I know S.

430
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:29,716
You'll learn, I promise.

431
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,387
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

432
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,222
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

433
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,308
Very patient.

434
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:41,228
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

435
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,271
-the faster you'll be able to read.
-That's all right.

436
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,190
We're doing just fine.

437
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,486
I'm sure you and "Ostrich" Stark
have a lot to talk about.

438
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,783
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

439
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,576
-Three.
-Three?

440
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,248
-Who taught you, your mother?
-No, old Maester Cressen did.

441
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,085
I had a lot of time to practice.
My mother kept me inside because…

442
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,800
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

443
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,427
Greyscale.

444
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,179
What do you call it north of the Wall?

445
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:17,931
I don't know.

446
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,852
But two of my sisters had it.
They both died.

447
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,440
-How did they cure you?
-I don't remember. I was a baby.

448
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,859
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

449
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,944
Whatever they did, it went away.

450
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,740
What happened to your sisters?

451
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,954
My father made them move out
of the keep into the hut outside.

452
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,874
None of us were allowed to go near them.

453
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,586
But we heard them, especially at night.

454
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,591
They started to sound not like themselves.

455
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,051
Did you ever see them?

456
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,804
Only once at the end.

457
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,099
They were covered with it.

458
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,103
Their faces, their arms.

459
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,647
They acted like animals.

460
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,693
My father had to drag them out
to the woods on a rope.

461
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,738
What did he do with them in the woods?

462
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,536
Mother.

463
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:23,121
Leave us.

464
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,709
Your Grace.

465
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,171
You need to stay away from that girl.

466
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,714
-Why?
-She's a wildling.

467
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,758
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.

468
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,843
-I'm teaching her to read.
-She's a wildling.

469
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,598
Your father defeated her people.
He executed their king for treason.

470
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,726
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

471
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,478
Gilly wouldn't do that.

472
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,273
You have no idea what people will do.

473
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,360
All your books and you still don't know.

474
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,993
I ordered Mance Rayder
burnt at the stake.

475
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,621
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

476
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,915
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

477
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,917
A king's word is law.

478
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,672
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

479
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,845
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

480
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,763
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

481
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,849
With respect, Your Grace,

482
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,059
the free folk will never follow you
no matter what you do.

483
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,604
You're the man who burned
their king alive.

484
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,189
Who, then?

485
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,443
-You?
-No.

486
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,779
Only one of their own.

487
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,575
Do you know this wretched girl…

488
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,620
-Lyanna Mormont?
-The Lord Commander's niece.

489
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,332
Lady of Bear Island and a child of ten.

490
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,795
I asked her to commit her house
to my cause. That's her response.

491
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,090
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

492
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,092
whose name is Stark."

493
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,011
That amuses you?

494
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,890
I apologize, Your Grace.

495
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,519
Northerners can be a bit
like the free folk.

496
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,356
-Loyal to their own.
-I know.

497
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,942
My brother Robert went on often and loudly

498
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,944
about how difficult
it was to control them.

499
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,990
Even with your father's help.

500
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,371
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elects a new Lord Commander.

501
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,166
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

502
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,876
-Most likely.
-Unpleasant man.

503
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,878
He thinks you're a traitor.

504
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,215
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

505
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,302
-Unpleasant, I expect.
-Your bravery made him look weak.

506
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,305
He'll punish you for it.

507
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,683
I don't punish men for bravery.
I reward them.

508
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,977
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

509
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,189
But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

510
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,942
I pledged them my life,
my honor, my sword.

511
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,527
I don't know what I have left to give you.

512
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,862
You can give me the North.

513
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,698
I can't.

514
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,703
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard, a Snow.

515
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,040
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword at my feet.

516
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,335
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

517
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,336
Lord of Winterfell.

518
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,719
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

519
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,263
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

520
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,309
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the King,

521
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,604
and just like that, I would never be
the bastard of Winterfell again.

522
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:39,025
You deserve this. You do.
I couldn't be happier for you.

523
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,611
I'm going to refuse him.

524
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,950
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

525
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,786
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

526
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,955
If I don't take my own word seriously,

527
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,790
what sort of Lord of Winterfell
would I be?

528
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,465
Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

529
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,309
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

530
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,187
before we cast our tokens

531
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,777
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

532
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,825
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,
he's a man of true nobility.

533
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,703
He was acting commander
when the Wall came under attack

534
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,289
and led us to victory
against the wildlings.

535
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,583
-Hear, hear.
-He's a veteran of 100 battles

536
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,794
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

537
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,046
Aye.

538
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,964
He's the only true choice.

539
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,215
Yes!

540
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,346
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

541
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,641
and has served loyally
longer than any other ranger.

542
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,144
Through ten winters he served.

543
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,981
As commander of the Shadow Tower,
he kept the wildlings away.

544
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,733
We could do no better.

545
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,699
If there is no one else,
we will begin the voting.

546
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,662
The triangular tokens count
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

547
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,958
The square tokens
for Ser Denys Mallister.

548
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,044
-Each brother will--
-Maester Aemon.

549
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,049
Samwell Tarly. Go on.

550
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,885
Sam, The Slayer.

551
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,264
Another wildling lover
just like his friend Jon Snow.

552
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,183
How's your lady love, Slayer?

553
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,602
Her name is Gilly.

554
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,938
Brother Slynt knows her quite well.

555
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,149
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

556
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,151
Lies!

557
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,612
A wildling girl, a baby,

558
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:49,823
and Lord Janos.

559
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,035
I found him there after the battle
was over in a puddle of his own making.

560
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,710
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children,

561
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,796
Jon Snow was leading.

562
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,133
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true.

563
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,426
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

564
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,887
He took charge of the Wall's defense.

565
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,056
He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.

566
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,892
He went north to deal with Mance Rayder

567
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,395
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

568
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,733
Before that…

569
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,821
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

570
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,534
Mormont himself chose Jon
to be his steward.

571
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,204
He saw something in Jon
and now we've all seen it too.

572
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,248
He may be young…

573
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,461
but he's the commander we turned to
when the night was darkest.

574
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,472
I can't argue with any of that.

575
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,851
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

576
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,853
Night's Watch…

577
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,939
or the wildlings?

578
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:11,237
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl
and spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

579
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,407
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

580
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,868
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

581
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,706
We all saw him put the King
beyond the Wall out of his misery.

582
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,460
Do you want to choose a man
who has fought the wildlings all his life

583
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,837
or a man who makes love to them?

584
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,513
It is time.

585
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,187
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

586
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:53,256
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

587
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,786
You. You.

588
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,250
What have you got there?

589
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,547
-I said--
-Turn around and go.

590
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,927
Turn around and go.

591
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,639
That's a nice little sword.
Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that.

592
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,227
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

593
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,482
Come on.

594
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,858
Quickly, go! Go!

595
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,831
Who are you?

596
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,710
-Why were they scared of you?
-You lost this.

597
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,432
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

598
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,353
There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

599
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,273
Well, who are you, then?

600
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,026
No one.

601
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,320
And that is who a girl must become.

602
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:52,768
Why?

603
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:37,582
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
-Mhysa! Mhysa!

604
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,104
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
-Mhysa! Mhysa!

605
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,982
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
-Mhysa! Mhysa!

606
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,525
She should have cut off the traitor's head

607
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,319
in the Great Pyramid
and been done with it.

608
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,571
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

609
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,993
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
-Mhysa! Mhysa!

610
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,699
Mhysa.

611
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,861
Mhysa!

612
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,885
I'll stand guard outside your door
tonight, Your Grace.

613
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:19,678
We all guard tonight.

614
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:22,515
Leave me.

615
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,777
Drogon.
