00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,637
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,079
<i>( bird screeches )</i>

3
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,505
Your Grace,
I want to say--

4
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,465
You will not speak.

5
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,511
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

6
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,930
If only I were otherwise.

7
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,724
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

8
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,101
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

9
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,979
You want revenge
against the Lannisters?

10
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,565
I killed my mother
Joanna Lannister

11
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,400
on the day I was born.

12
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,904
I killed my father
Tywin Lannister with
a bolt to the heart.

13
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,406
I am the greatest
Lannister killer
of our time.

14
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,408
So I should welcome you
into my service

15
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,078
because you murdered members
of your own family?

16
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,665
Into your service?

17
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,543
Your Grace, we have
only just met.

18
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,087
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

19
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,048
If you'd rather return
to the fighting pits,

20
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,342
just say the word.

21
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,638
When I was a young man,
I heard a story

22
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,433
about a baby born
during the worst storm
in living memory.

23
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,519
She had no wealth,
no lands, no army,

24
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,438
<i>only a name</i>
<i>and a handful</i>
<i>of supporters,</i>

25
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,442
most of whom probably
thought they could use that
name to benefit themselves.

26
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,195
They kept her alive,
moving her from place
to place,

27
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,990
<i>often hours ahead of the men</i>
<i>who'd been sent to kill her.</i>

28
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,618
<i>She was eventually</i>
<i>sold off to some warlord</i>
<i>on the edge of the world</i>

29
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,954
<i>and that appeared</i>
<i>to be that.</i>

30
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,873
<i>And then</i>
<i>a few years later,</i>

31
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,000
the most well-informed
person I knew

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,919
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands,
or armies

33
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,506
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

34
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,466
along with three dragons.

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,594
<i>He thought</i>
<i>she was our best,</i>

36
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,471
<i>last chance to build</i>
<i>a better world.</i>

37
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,601
I thought you were worth
meeting at the very least.

38
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,144
And why are you
worth meeting?

39
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,812
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

40
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,607
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

41
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,485
You have no one
at your side who understands
the land you want to rule.

42
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,529
The strengths
and weaknesses
of the houses

43
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,864
<i>that will either</i>
<i>join or oppose you.</i>

44
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,742
I will have
a very large army

45
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,327
and very large dragons.

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,164
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

47
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,999
When I served
as Hand of the King,

48
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,543
I did quite well
with the latter considering
the king in question

49
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,172
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

50
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,174
I could do
an even better job

51
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,635
advising a ruler
worth the name.

52
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>If that is indeed</i>
<i>what you are.</i>

53
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,264
So you want
to advise me?

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,518
Very well.

55
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,396
What would you
have me do with him?

56
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,902
<i>I swore I would kill him</i>
<i>if he ever returned.</i>

57
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,779
I know.

58
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:46,119
Why should the people
trust a queen who can't
keep her promises?

59
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,000
Whomever Ser Jorah
was when he started
informing on you,

60
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,878
he is no longer that man.

61
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,838
I can't remember
ever seeing a sane man

62
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,633
as devoted to anything
as he is to serving you.

63
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,427
<i>He claims he would kill</i>
<i>for you and die for you</i>

64
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,806
<i>and nothing I ever witnessed</i>
<i>gives me reason to doubt him.</i>

65
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,478
And yet he did
betray you.

66
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,743
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

67
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,745
Yes.

68
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,956
Many opportunities.

69
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,458
Tyrion:
<i>And did he?</i>

70
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,963
No, not until
forced to do so.

71
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,678
He worships you.

72
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,597
He is in love
with you, I think.

73
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,683
<i>But he did not trust you</i>
<i>with the truth.</i>

74
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,351
<i>An unpleasant truth</i>
<i>to be sure,</i>

75
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,895
<i>but one of great</i>
<i>significance to you.</i>

76
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,066
<i>He did not trust</i>
<i>that you would be wise</i>
<i>enough to forgive him.</i>

77
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,402
So I should kill him?

78
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,363
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

79
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,241
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

80
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,326
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion,

81
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,623
a lot of it,
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

82
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,461
But you cannot have him
by your side when you do.

83
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,843
Remove Ser Jorah
from the city.

84
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,861
<i>( door slams )</i>

85

Confess.

86

My son.

87
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,047
Let me speak to--

88
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,465
Confess.

89
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,509
I meant it.

90
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,096
My face will be
the last thing
you see--

My name is Lanna.
I'm an orphan.

95
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,369
<i>When I was eight,</i>
<i>I begged enough money</i>

96
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,454
<i>to buy my first</i>
<i>bucket of oysters.</i>

97
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:21,001
I sold that bucket
and made enough money
to buy two more.

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,919
<i>( people chattering )</i>

<i>an oyster cart.</i>

101

<i>Now every morning,</i>

102
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>I make my way</i>
<i>down to the canals.</i>

103
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,767
<i>I pass the fish mongers</i>
<i>and the bakers.</i>

104
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,274
<i>I usually see Lhara,</i>

105

<i>my first customer of the day</i>
<i>on her way home.</i>

106
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,490
<i>Then I turn left</i>
<i>onto Moonsinger Lane--</i>

107

( cracks )

108
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,913
Turn left

where I do
most of my trade.

110
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,917
Lanna is very impressive.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,169
Very industrious.

112
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,214
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

113
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,174
How will she serve him?

114
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,510
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

115
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,347
She will turn right
and go to Ragman Harbor.

116
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,890
What will she do there?

117
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,767
She will see.

Best in the city.

Mm.

130

Very nice.

Returned from all of them

<i>Please!</i>

143
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,753
Jaqen:
<i>The man is a gambler.</i>

144
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,255
He wages that
a sailor's ship

145
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,425
will make it
to its destination.

146
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,053
It is a strange wager
for the captain.

147
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,847
He only wins
if he loses his life.

148
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,727
So why would
a captain make the wager
in the first place?

149
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,523
A girl tells a man
that she has seen.

150
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,819
If the captain dies,

151
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,238
the thin man pays
his family a lot of money.

152
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,577
But perhaps the gambler
loses his bet

153
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,871
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

154
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,332
A destitute woman
and her small child,

155
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,711
what can they do
to such a man if he keeps
their money for himself?

156
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,799
To whom can they turn
for recourse?

157
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,134
( whispering prayer )

158
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,390
The Many-Faced God.

159
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,477
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

160
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,980
A man had no idea
what a girl would see
and what she would not.

161
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,652
A girl named Lanna
will return to the docks.

162
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,821
She will watch
the gambler.

163
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>She will come to know</i>
<i>as much about him as she</i>
<i>knows about herself.</i>

164
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,201
And then what?

165
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:27,914
A gift for the thin man.

166
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,227
She's not ready.

167
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,188
Perhaps she is,
perhaps she's not.

168
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,399
And if she's not?

169
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,735
It is all the same
to the Many-Faced God.

170
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,496
<i>( door unlocks, opens )</i>

171
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,173
<i>( door locks )</i>

172
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,302
The trial
will take place soon.

173
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,721
<i>The High Sparrow</i>
<i>will be presenting</i>

174
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,681
<i>a substantial case</i>
<i>against you.</i>

175
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,849
The charges?

176
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,310
<i>Fornication,</i>
<i>treason, incest,</i>

177
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,895
the murder
of King Robert.

178
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,104
All lies.

179
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,856
Of course,
Your Grace.

180
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:43,072
My concern is that
the Faith does not adhere

181
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,659
to the same standards
of proof as the crown.

182
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,578
<i>I hope you'll excuse me</i>
<i>for saying it,</i>

183
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,456
<i>but belief is so often</i>
<i>the death of reason.</i>

184
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,583
I wish you had
said it sooner.

185
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,587
Is there any word
from Jaime?

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,964
No, I'm afraid not.

187
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:10,767
Your Grace,
Grand Maester Pycelle

188
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,602
has summoned
your Uncle Kevan

189
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,187
back from Casterly Rock

190
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,772
to serve
as Hand of the King.

191
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,609
He now presides
over the small council.

192
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,986
Tell him I need
to speak to him.

193
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,948
I implored him
to visit you,
but he would not.

194
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,913
What about my son,
the king?

195
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,957
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

196
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,459
Your arrest
and Queen Margaery's
arrest,

197
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,002
the king has not
taken them well.

198
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,754
<i>He remains</i>
<i>in his chambers.</i>

199
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,841
His servants often find
his food in the hall
left untouched.

200
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,468
You need to talk to him.

201
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,637
You need to talk
to my son and tell him
to come and see me,

202
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,138
come and see his mother.

203
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,724
He-- I tried,
Your Grace.

204
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,519
He wouldn't see me.
He won't see anyone.

205
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,188
I can't stay here.

206
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,568
There is a way,
Your Grace.

207
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,906
A way out.

208
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,078
Confess?

209
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,830
To the High Sparrow?

210
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,165
I won't.

211
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,085
I made him.

212
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,962
I rose him up
from nothing.

213
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,840
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

214
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,342
and beg his forgiveness.

215
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,768
Good-bye, my queen.

216
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,355
The work continues.

217
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,726
Why?

218
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,896
Why, Theon?

219
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,857
I'm not Theon.
There is no Theon.

220
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,484
- Reek.
- Reek.

221
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,904
Why did you
tell him, Reek?

222
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,365
I was helping you.

223
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,741
You wanted to escape.

224
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,911
There is no escape.

225
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,205
Not ever.

226
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,708
Theon Greyjoy
tried to escape.

227
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,544
The master knew.

228
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,297
He knows everything.

229
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,633
He hunted him
and caught him

230
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,927
and strapped him
to a cross

231
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,304
and cut away
piece after piece

232
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,765
until there
was no Theon left.

233
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,479
Good.

234
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,611
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

235
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,155
If I could do
what Ramsay did to you

236
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,991
right here,
right now, I would.

237
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,289
I deserved everything.

238
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,419
I deserve to be Reek.

239
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,381
<i>I did terrible things.</i>

240
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,510
Turned on Robb.

241
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,054
Captured Winterfell.

242
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,473
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

243
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,976
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

244
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,644
You've known them
since they were born.

245
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,187
They weren't.
They were only--

246
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,939
Only what?

247
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,441
- I can't.
- Tell me.

248
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,317
I can't, not unless
the master says.

249
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,777
- Tell me.
They weren't what?
- They weren't--

250
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,447
Tell me why Bran
and Rickon should be gone

251
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,198
while you still
breathe the air.

252
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,658
Tell me
to my face, Theon.

253
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,326
Tell me that they
weren't your brothers!

254
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,870
They weren't
Bran and Rickon!

255
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,458
I couldn't find them.

256
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,216
It was two farm boys.

257
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,973
I killed them
and burned them
so no one would know.

258
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,145
You didn't?

259
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,357
Do you know
where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

260
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,026
I can't talk
to you anymore.

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,861
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where--

262
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,530
Not Theon! Reek!

263
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,368
<i>( door closes )</i>

264
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,747
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more
than 6,000 men.

265
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,041
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

266
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,086
And how high do
Stannis's horses jump?

267
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,546
Our walls have been
fully repaired.

268
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,632
The gates have been
reinforced.

269
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,468
We have enough food
for six months.

270
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,555
We are more prepared
for a siege than they
could ever be.

271
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,308
All we have to do
is wait for them
to freeze,

272
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,102
starve, and mutiny.

273
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,398
You disagree?

274
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,692
Stannis isn't
from the North.

275
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,569
You are, Father.

276
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,864
I think you're missing
an opportunity to show
the people of the North

277
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,283
<i>how House Bolton</i>
<i>treats southern invaders.</i>

278
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,785
And what
do you recommend?

279
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,745
<i>That we not sit</i>
<i>and wait for Stannis</i>

280
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,956
<i>to decide</i>
<i>what sort of fight</i>
<i>this is going to be.</i>

281
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,124
That we hit first
and hit hard

282
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,085
and leave a feast
for the crows.

283
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,296
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

284
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,757
<i>As long as we stay</i>
<i>behind these walls,</i>

285
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,384
<i>they can't touch us.</i>

286
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,927
Not to mention
that the snow is so deep,

287
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,846
we couldn't get
an army through
to engage them

288
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,639
even if we wanted to.

289
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,683
I don't need an army.

290
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,060
I need 20 good men.

291
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,653
So, have you
decided yet?

292
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,364
Whether I'm worthy
of your service?

293
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,578
Have you decided yet
whether you're going
to have me killed?

294
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,913
It's probably
my safest option.

295
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,043
I can see why
you would think so.

296
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,088
It's what your father
would have done.

297
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,798
And what would
your father have done?

298
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,635
My father,

299
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,179
who publically
sentenced me to death?

300
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,266
I'd say his thoughts
on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

301
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,726
Is that why
you killed him?

302
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,316
Someday, if you decide
not to execute me,

303
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,693
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

304
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,030
And on that day,
should it ever come,

305
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,033
we'll need
more wine than this.

306
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,078
I know
what my father was.

307
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,456
<i>What he did.</i>

308
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,000
I know the Mad King
earned his name.

309
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,631
So, here we sit.

310
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,842
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

311
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,510
I'm terrible?

312
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,554
I've heard stories.

313
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,682
Why did you travel
to the far side of the world
to meet someone terrible?

314
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,685
- To see if you were
the right kind of terrible.
- Which kind is that?

315
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,147
The kind that prevents
your people from being
even more so.

316
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,734
Well, I did reopen
the fighting pits.

317
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,695
Under my rule,
murder will once again
become entertainment.

318
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,530
Yes, that was wise.

319
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,992
And you agreed to
marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

320
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,662
Very impressive.

321
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,539
<i>My own sister</i>
<i>married someone</i>
<i>she loathed as well,</i>

322
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,792
though not by choice
and certainly not

323
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,044
for the greater good,
gods forbid.

324
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,712
She ended up
having him killed.

325
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,967
Perhaps it won't
come to that.

326
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,477
It's not impossible
that Varys was right
about you after all.

327
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,563
Varys?
King Robert's spymaster?

328
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,401
Yes, he's the one
who convinced me
to come find you.

329
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,944
He was my travelling
companion

330
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,321
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

331
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,949
Jorah sent my secrets
to Varys.

332
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,911
For 20 years the Spider
oversaw the campaign
to find and kill me.

333
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,455
He did what he had
to do to survive.

334
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,667
He did a lot
of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

335
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,921
<i>I suspect he's</i>
<i>the main reason you weren't</i>
<i>slaughtered in your crib.</i>

336
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,673
But you trust him?

337
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,174
<i>Yes, oddly.</i>

338
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,636
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

339
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,263
Except my brother.

340
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,391
The brother
who killed my father?

341
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,767
That's the one.

342
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,436
Perhaps I will have you
killed after all.

343
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,771
Your queenly prerogative.

344
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,067
I had given up on life

345
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,612
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

346
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,282
If you chop off
my head, well,

347
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,409
my final days
were interesting.

348
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,333
I'm not
going to kill you.

349
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,297
No? Banish me?

350
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,798
No.

351
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,633
So if I'm not going
to be murdered

352
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,135
and I'm not going
to be banished--

353
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,511
You're going
to advise me.

354
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,640
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

355
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,562
Advise you on what?

356
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,564
How to get
what I want.

357
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,150
The Iron Throne.

358
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,861
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

359
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,739
If I want jokes,
I'll get myself
a proper fool.

360
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,824
<i>I'm not entirely joking.</i>

361
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,327
<i>There's more to the world</i>
<i>than Westeros after all.</i>

362
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,748
How many hundreds of thousands
of lives have you changed
for the better here?

363
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,666
Perhaps this
is where you belong,

364
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,294
where you can do
the most good.

365
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,673
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

366
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,593
would ever know
what it meant to be
bought or sold.

367
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,430
<i>I will continue</i>
<i>that fight here and beyond.</i>

368
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,099
But this is not my home.

369
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,684
When you get
back to your home,
who supports you?

370
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,520
The common people.

371
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,814
Let's be generous
and assume that's
going to happen.

372
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,608
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of
the common people

373
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,027
and only
the common people.

374
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:09,031
What was that like?
Ruling without the rich?

375
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,033
House Targaryen is gone.

376
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,328
Not a single person
who shares your blood
is alive to support you.

377
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,247
<i>The Starks</i>
<i>are gone as well.</i>

378
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,082
<i>Our two terrible fathers</i>
<i>saw to that.</i>

379
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,959
<i>The remaining members</i>
<i>of House Lannister</i>

380
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,877
<i>will never back you,</i>
<i>not ever.</i>

381
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,338
Stannis Baratheon
won't back you, either.

382
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,883
His entire claim
to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

383
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,885
<i>That leaves the Tyrells.</i>

384
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,388
Not impossible,
not enough.

385
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,684
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

386
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,811
They're all just spokes
on a wheel.

387
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,105
This one's on top,
then that one's on top.

388
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,359
And on and on
it spins, crushing
those on the ground.

389
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,363
It's a beautiful dream,
stopping the wheel.

390
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,074
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

391
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:56,370
I'm not going
to stop the wheel.

392
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,998
I'm going to break
the wheel.

393
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,086
( grunting )

394
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,930
( whistles )

395
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:25,691
You said whoever wins
will fight at the Great Pit
in front of the queen.

396
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,401
I won.

397
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,821
- You struck me.
- Have me flogged
if it makes you happy.

398
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:34,200
But I'm the best
you've got.

399
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,702
If I win
at the Great Pit,

400
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,662
how much can you
sell me for?

401
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,125
You're a free man.

402
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,461
You could have
gone anywhere.

403
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,046
Why did you come back?

404
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,802
Let me fight for her

405
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,930
and I belong to you.

406
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,188
Woman:
<i>Thirsty?</i>

407
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,981
Confess.

408
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,863
I'll get out of here,
you realize, before long.

409
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,031
Confess.

410
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,493
I can make you
a wealthy woman.

411
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,161
A lady of the court.

412
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,746
Confess.

413
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,921
Or I can make sure
you die in the most
hideous way imaginable.

414
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,006
And all I do is sit here

415
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,260
imagining hideous ways
for you to die.

416
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,689
<i>( door opens )</i>

417
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,817
<i>( door closes, locks )</i>

418
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,745

419
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,132
<i>( wind howling )</i>

420
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,515
Does it hurt?

421
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,060
No.

422
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,271
Good.

423
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,484
How are you?

424
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:36,322
I'm not the one
who got punched
and kicked in the face.

425
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,200
You know what I mean.

426
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,746
I'm good.

427
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,874
- Are you scared?
- A little.

428
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,876
Me, too.

429
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,463
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

430
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,340
- Who's there?
-<i> Olly.</i>

431
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,300
Oh.

432
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,052
Come in.

433
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,639
I heard what happened.

434
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,225
Oh, not to worry.

435
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,771
Men brawl
from time to time.
It's only natural.

436
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,775
Figured you were hungry.

437
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,320
Oh, you're a good lad.

438
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,657
Wanted to ask you
something

439
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,368
if you've got the time.

440
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,661
I need to check
on baby Sam.

441
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,668
<i>( door closes )</i>

442
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:36,006
Sam:
<i>Now then,</i>
<i>how can I help?</i>

443
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,425
- It's about
the Lord Commander.
- Yes?

444
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,054
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

445
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,767
Wildlings killed
my mom and dad.

446
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,685
They killed everyone
in my village.

447
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,396
We've been
fighting them for years.

448
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,980
<i>This wasn't a fight.</i>

449
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,652
We were farmers
and they slaughtered us.

450
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,821
So why is he saving them?

451
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,156
Wildlings are people.

452
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,201
Just like us,
there are good ones
and bad ones.

453
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,871
The one he's travelling with,
the one with the red beard,

454
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,832
he led the raid
on my village.

455
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,209
-<i> Oh, Olly.</i>
- How can he trust him?

456
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,380
I've seen the army
of the dead.

457
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,425
<i>I've seen</i>
<i>the white walkers.</i>

458
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,594
And they're
coming for us,
for all the living.

459
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,599
And when it's time,

460
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,644
we'll need every
last man we can find.

461
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,564
But what if we let
the wildlings through
the gates

462
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,357
and they cut our throats
while we sleep?

463
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,818
Jon's taking a risk,
but he has to.

464
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,612
We don't stand
a chance otherwise.

465
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:44,533
<i>Sometimes a man</i>
<i>has to make hard choices,</i>

466
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,493
<i>choices that might look</i>
<i>wrong to others,</i>

467
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,538
<i>but you know are right</i>
<i>in the long run.</i>

468
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,123
You believe that?

469
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,333
With all my heart.

470
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,092
<i>Try not to worry, Olly.</i>

471
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,262
I've been worrying
about Jon for years.

472
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,139
He always comes back.

473
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,146
( wind howling )

474
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,791
( men grunting )

475
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,391
Ranger:
<i>Turn us about!</i>

476
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,635
You trust me,
Jon Snow?

477
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,804
Does that
make me a fool?

478
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,181
We're fools
together now.

479
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,315
<i>( man whistles )</i>

480
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,742
Lord of Bones.

481
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,869
Been a long time.

482
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,998
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was
your prisoner.

483
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,417
The other way around now.
What happened?

484
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,002
War.

485
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,713
War?
You call that a war?

486
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,090
The greatest army
the North has ever seen

487
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,093
cut to pieces
by some southern king.

488
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,345
We should gather
the elders,

489
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,306
find somewhere
quiet to talk.

490
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,224
You don't give
the orders here.

491
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,436
I'm not giving an order.

492
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,730
Why aren't you
in chains?

493
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,066
He's not my prisoner.

494
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,735
No?

495
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,486
What is he?

496
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,155
We're allies.

497
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,492
You fucking traitor.

498
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,539
You fight
for the crows now?

499
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,711
I don't fight
for the crows.

500
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,506
We're not here to fight.
We're here to talk.

501
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,051
Is that right?

502
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,638
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

503
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,556
And when
you're done talking,

504
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,559
do you get
down on your knees
and suck his cock?

505
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,436
( grunts )

506
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,119
Gather the elders
and let's talk.

507
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,062
<i>( man coughs )</i>

508
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,398
My name's Jon Snow.

509
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,235
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

510
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,448
We're not friends.

511
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,660
<i>We've never been friends.</i>

512
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,371
<i>We won't become</i>
<i>friends today.</i>

513
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,916
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about friendship.</i>

514
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,753
This is about
survival.

515
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,839
This is about putting
a 700-foot wall

516
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,425
between you
and what's out there.

517
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,093
You built that wall
to keep us out.

518
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,929
Since when do the crows
give two shits if we live?

519
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,182
Jon:
<i>In normal times we wouldn't.</i>
<i>But these aren't normal times.</i>

520
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,561
The white walkers
don't care if a man's
free folk or crow.

521
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,647
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

522
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,108
But together
we can beat them.

523
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,651
Beat the white walkers?

524
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,029
Good luck with that.
Run from them, maybe.

525
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,833
It's not a trick.

526
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,797
It's a gift
for those who join us.

527
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,513
Dragonglass.

528
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,725
A man of the Night's Watch
used one of these daggers

529
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,852
<i>to kill a walker.</i>

530
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,354
- You saw this?
- No.

531
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,689
But I trust the man.

532
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,192
There are old stories
about dragonglass.

533
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,904
There are old stories
about ice spiders
as big as hounds.

534
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,114
And with the things
we've seen, you don't
believe them?

535
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,034
Jon:
<i>Come with me and I'll share</i>
<i>these weapons.</i>

536
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,702
Come with you where?

537
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,454
Jon:
<i>There are good lands</i>
<i>south of the Wall.</i>

538
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,206
<i>The Night's Watch will let you</i>
<i>through the tunnel</i>

539
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,750
and allow your people
to farm those lands.

540
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,586
( murmuring )

541
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,797
I knew Mance Rayder.

542
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,757
<i>He never wanted a war</i>
<i>with the Night's Watch.</i>

543
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,384
<i>He wanted a new life</i>
<i>for his people, for you.</i>

544
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,262
We're prepared
to give you that new life.

545
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,806
If?

546
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,476
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

547
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,104
Where is Mance?

548
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,236
- He died.
- How?

549
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,284
I put an arrow
through his heart.

550
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,787
- ( wildlings shouting )
- Tormund: Hey, hey.

551
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,831
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

552
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,584
Hey, hey, hey.

553
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,127
Loboda:
<i>I say we send</i>
<i>the Lord Commander</i>

554
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:15,173
back to Castle Black
with no eyes.

555
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,052
Hey, none of you
saw Mance die.

556
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,096
I did.

557
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,849
The southern king
who broke our army,
Stannis,

558
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,685
wanted to burn him alive
to send us a message.

559
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:30,856
Jon Snow defied
that cunt's orders.

560
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,859
His arrow was mercy.

561
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,485
What he did
took courage.

562
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,153
And that's
what we need today,

563
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,114
the courage
to make peace

564
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,200
with men
we've been killing
for generations.

565
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,494
I lost my father,
my uncle,

566
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,705
and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

567
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm not asking you
to forget your dead.

568
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,545
I'll never
forget mine.

569
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:58,133
I lost 50 brothers
the night that Mance
attacked the Wall.

570
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,386
But I'm asking you

571
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,555
to think about
your children now.

572
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,017
<i>They'll never have</i>
<i>children of their own</i>

573
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,603
<i>if we don't band together.</i>

574
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,522
The Long Night
is coming

575
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,524
and the dead
come with it.

576
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,027
No clan can stop them.

577
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,737
The free folk
can't stop them.

578
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,363
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

579
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,825
And all
the southern kings
can't stop them.

580
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,454
<i>Only together,</i>
<i>all of us.</i>

581
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,122
And even then
it may not be enough,

582
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,875
but at least we'll give
the fuckers a fight.

583
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,101
You vouch
for this man, Tormund?

584
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,523
He's prettier
than both my daughters,

585
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,400
<i>but he knows</i>
<i>how to fight.</i>

586
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:01,446
He's young,
but he knows
how to lead.

587
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,531
He didn't have
to come to Hardhome.

588
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,494
He came because
he needs us

589
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,163
and we need him.

590
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,418
My ancestors
would spit on me

591
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,420
if I broke bread
with a crow.

592
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,632
So would mine,
but fuck 'em,
they're dead.

593
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,766
( sighs )

594
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,978
I'll never trust
a man in black.

595
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,692
But I trust you,
Tormund.

596
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,278
If you say
this is the way,

597
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,364
we're with you.

598
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,829
- This is the way.
- ( murmuring )

599
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,206
Elder:
<i>I'm with Tormund.</i>

600
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,835
We stay here,
we're dead men.

601
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,213
At least with King Crow,
there's a chance.

602
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,966
<i>( giant growls )</i>

603
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,969
Tormund.

604
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,808
Keep that new life
you want to give us.

605
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,147
And keep your glass,
King Crow.

606
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,652
As soon as you get on
his ships, they're gonna
slit your throats

607
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,322
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of
the Shivering Sea.

608
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,035
That's our enemy.

609
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,997
That has always
been our enemy.

610
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,473
I fucking hate Thenns.

611
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,150
( chatter )

612
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,745
- Man: Move it.
- Woman: Be careful.

613
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,789
- Man #2:
<i>Move 'em along, now.</i>
- Man #3:<i> Cast-off time.</i>

614
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,624
<i>That's it, come on.</i>

615
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,962
How many are with us?
5,000?

616
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,132
I'm not good
at counting.

617
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,842
We're leaving
too many behind.

618
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,677
The free folk
are stubborn.

619
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,305
You know how long
it took Mance to band
them together?

620
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,516
20 fucking years.

621
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,852
And he knew them better
than I ever will.

622
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:42,023
They're running out of food
and there's nothing to hunt.

623
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,733
