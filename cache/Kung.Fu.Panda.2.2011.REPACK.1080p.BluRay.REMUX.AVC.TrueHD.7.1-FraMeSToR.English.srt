1
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,358
<i>Long ago, in ancient China,</i>

2
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,736
<i>the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.</i>

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,366
<i>They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city</i>

4
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,869
<i>for they had invented fireworks.</i>

5
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>But their son, Lord Shen,</i>

6
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,587
<i>saw darker power in the fireworks.</i>

7
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,299
<i>What had brought colour and joy</i>

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>could also bring darkness
and destruction.</i>

9
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,808
<i>Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.</i>

10
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,</i>

11
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.</i>

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>The young lord
set out to change his fate.</i>

13
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:18,203
<i>But what he did next only sealed it.</i>

14
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,087
<i>Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.</i>

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,383
<i>But in their faces, he saw only horror.</i>

16
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,971
<i>He was banished from the city forever.</i>

17
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,349
<i>But Shen swore revenge.</i>

18
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>Someday he would return</i>

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,398
<i>and all of China would bow at his feet.</i>

20
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,766
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,855
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,899
China will be mine.

23
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,245
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

24
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,290
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

25
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,292
Enough talk. Let's fight!

26
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,628
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

27
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,130
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

28
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,715
Thirty-three. Stop him!

29
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,133
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,636
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

31
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,471
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

32
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,099
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,438
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,149
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,610
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,987
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

37
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,280
Do it.

38
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,865
No problem!

39
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,620
Yeah!

40
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,164
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,834
Yeah!

42
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,045
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,048
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,427
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

45
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,513
You'll save those for me, right?

46
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,356
Flippety-do.

47
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,577
Inner peace.

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,082
Inner peace.

49
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,171
Inner peace.

50
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,756
Master Shifu.

51
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,633
Master Shifu, what do we got?

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,932
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

54
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,518
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

55
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,688
What are you doing?

56
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,275
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

57
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,557
Awesome!

58
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,644
How did you do that?

59
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,815
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

60
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,694
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

61
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:25,325
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

62
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,663
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

63
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,835
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

64
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,671
Or?

65
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,299
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

66
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,845
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

67
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,847
was the worst day of my life.

68
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,267
By far.
Nothing else came close.

69
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,813
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

70
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,440
- OK.
- ...I have ever experienced.

71
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,532
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

72
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,288
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

73
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,999
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

74
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,293
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

75
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,880
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

76
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,007
Inner peace, you're going down.

77
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,967
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

78
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,218
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

79
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,388
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

80
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,639
Danger.

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,727
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

82
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,271
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

83
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,064
No snack stops this time.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,942
Snack stops.

85
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,819
Wait, are you serious?

86
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,459
Get all the metal you can find!

87
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,797
Grab the metal!

88
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,639
Help, help, help, help. Help!

89
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,102
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

90
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,396
Oh, no.

91
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,737
Wings of Justice!

92
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,924
The Dragon Warrior!

93
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,385
A panda? That's impossible.

94
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,470
My fist hungers for justice.

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,348
That was my... fist.

96
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,850
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

97
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,417
Take that!

98
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,429
Po! Incoming!

99
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,431
Thanks, Mantis!

100
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,701
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

101
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,544
Feet of Fury!

102
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,384
Tigress! Monkey!

103
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,511
Viper! Mantis!

104
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,513
Bunny! What?

105
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,515
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,606
Help!

107
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,692
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

108
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,421
Is everyone OK?

109
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,007
That was awesome!

110
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,803
I got this.

111
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,398
Po!

112
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,198
Chew on that, tubby!

113
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,705
Help.

114
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,127
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

115
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,463
I think I saw...

116
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,966
I think...

117
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,551
I gotta go.

118
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:42,142
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

119
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,060
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

120
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,980
If you need anything, just ask.

121
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,859
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

122
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:55,488
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

123
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,992
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

124
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,494
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

125
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,582
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

126
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,084
He doesn't work here any more.

127
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,754
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

128
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,423
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

129
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,632
Po!

130
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,262
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

131
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,681
- You should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

132
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,100
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.

133
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,771
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

134
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:35,111
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

135
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,155
With purchases.

136
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,950
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

137
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,746
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

138
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,581
Ah, well, maybe a little.

139
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,585
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

140
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,337
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

141
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,173
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

142
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,300
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

143
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,802
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

144
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,223
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

145
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,351
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

146
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,228
I had this crazy vision.

147
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,190
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

148
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,984
Mom? A baby?

149
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,489
- Dad?
- What...?

150
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,699
How do I say this?

151
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,203
Where did I come from?

152
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,879
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,717
- Don't ask me where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

154
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,096
I know it's not.

155
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:48,559
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,520
OK.

157
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,524
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,696
...adopted.

159
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,698
- I knew it.
- You knew?

160
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,826
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,829
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,872
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,877
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

164
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,049
Actually... you came from this.

165
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,806
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

166
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,599
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,896
<i>I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.</i>

168
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,774
<i>There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.</i>

169
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,570
<i>Only there were no radishes.</i>

170
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,157
<i>Just a very hungry baby panda.</i>

171
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,745
<i>There was no note.</i>

172
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>Of course, you could have eaten it.</i>

173
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:56,127
<i>I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.</i>

174
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,111
<i>I brought you inside.</i>

175
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,990
<i>Fed you.</i>

176
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,160
<i>Gave you a bath.</i>

177
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,165
<i>And fed you again.</i>

178
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,252
<i>And again.</i>

179
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,132
<i>And tried to put some pants on you.</i>

180
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,686
<i>And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.</i>

181
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>To make my soup without radishes.</i>

182
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,405
<i>And to raise you as my own son.</i>

183
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,784
<i>Xiao Po, my little panda.</i>

184
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:15,331
<i>And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life</i>

185
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,667
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,838
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

187
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,175
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,847
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

189
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:35,226
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,395
It was imported, too.

191
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,731
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,949
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,617
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,538
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

195
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,374
I know. I just have so many questions.

196
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,960
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

197
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,795
Why didn't I like pants?

198
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,133
And who am I?

199
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,225
Good. Watch your form.

200
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,396
Good.

201
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,775
Better. Elbow.

202
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,944
Straighten it out!

203
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,931
Shen?

204
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,059
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:02,980
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,274
- Your house?
- Yes.

207
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,944
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

208
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,073
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:17,411
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

210
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,582
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,293
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

212
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,965
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

213
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,801
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

214
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,805
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,226
I'm so glad you feel that way.

216
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,229
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

217
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,439
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,151
You want to see? It's a gift.

219
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,114
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

220
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,824
Part of you here, part of you there

221
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,953
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

222
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,122
You insolent fool!

223
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,642
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

224
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,645
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,772
I agree.

226
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
But this is.

227
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,374
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,876
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

229
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,629
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,757
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,967
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

232
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,344
That's impossible.

233
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,971
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,642
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,227
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:10,733
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,279
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

238
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,367
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

239
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,369
OK, here we go! Here we go!

240
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,247
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

241
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,042
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

242
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,127
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,673
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

244
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,098
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

245
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,016
Peace on.

246
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,227
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

247
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,521
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

248
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,774
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,194
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,575
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,619
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,664
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

253
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,375
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,379
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,965
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

256
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,386
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,432
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

258
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,768
You have a job to do... far from home,

259
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,647
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,568
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

261
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,320
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

262
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,782
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,910
And if I don't... what am I?

264
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,538
You're my son.

265
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,333
Right?

266
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,755
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,258
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,802
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

269
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,518
Noodles.

270
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,777
Come on, guys, let's go!

271
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,153
Yeah!

272
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,532
Yeah...

273
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,452
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

274
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,533
Mama?

275
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,583
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

276
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,085
Mom! Dad!

277
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,423
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,801
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,969
But I thought...

280
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,097
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

281
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,310
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,854
does better kung fu.

283
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,731
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,819
Wait!

285
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,076
No.

286
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,296
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,681
Inner pea...

288
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,560
Pea...

289
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,606
Inner peace.

290
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:21,794
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

291
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,718
I'm... training.

292
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,179
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,227
- I am ready.
- OK.

294
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,396
So serious.

295
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,197
I think I prefer the mast.

296
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:55,077
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,578
Now I feel nothing.

298
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,623
That's severely cool.

299
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,585
Again!

300
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:10,509
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

301
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,429
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,598
Is there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,476
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

304
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,603
No. Besides...

305
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,610
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

306
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,743
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,456
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

308
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,334
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,214
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,300
Yeah.

311
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,303
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

312
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,473
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

313
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,600
Souls of platinum.

314
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,976
Like you.

315
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,103
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,651
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

317
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,321
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,656
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,910
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,454
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

321
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,457
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,667
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,003
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

324
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,380
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

325
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,217
- What?
- We're here.

326
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,344
Gongmen City.

327
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,238
My father's throne.

328
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,449
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,121
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

330
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,252
A little to the left.

331
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,546
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

332
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,007
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

333
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,678
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

334
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,557
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

335
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,767
Perfect!

336
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,146
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

337
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:35,070
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

338
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,905
We move out in three days,

339
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,909
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

340
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,706
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

341
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,915
Fortune?

342
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,794
Future. I was going to say future.

343
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,340
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,596
If you continue on your current path...

345
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,935
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,440
I see...

347
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,234
I see...

348
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,447
I see pain... and anger.

349
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,617
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

350
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,910
Followed by denial.

351
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,621
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

352
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,789
- what's happening right...
- Now?

353
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,127
The most important time is now.

354
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,797
But if you really want
to see the future...

355
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,344
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,101
A peacock...

357
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,482
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

358
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,693
Nothing has changed.

359
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,786
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:09,164
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,624
Who?

362
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,794
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

363
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,340
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

364
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,133
Big and furry.

365
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,470
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,266
There are no more pandas.

367
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,769
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

368
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,814
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,859
Find this panda and bring him to me!

370
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,778
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,782
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

372
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,786
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

373
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,332
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,461
Will you stop that!

375
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,601
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

376
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,313
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

377
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,523
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

378
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,692
and we are here
to bring you to justice!"

379
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,781
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,873
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

381
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,919
I do not like that guy.

382
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,715
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,384
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,035
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

385
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,872
Now, where'd those noodles go?

386
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,214
Hello. I couldn't help but...

387
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,300
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

388
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,470
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

389
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,392
OK.

390
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,900
Guys! Guys?

391
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,777
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

392
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,445
So that was stealth mode, huh?

393
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,073
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

394
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,659
...gold in there, come on!

395
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,286
This rice is raw!

396
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,997
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

397
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,334
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

398
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,254
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

399
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,923
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

400
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,134
- Wait, I have a better idea.
- ...two...

401
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,510
...one.

402
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,303
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,025
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

404
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,902
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

405
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,529
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

406
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,866
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

407
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,492
Right.

408
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,372
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

409
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,917
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

410
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,711
What? They're still alive?

411
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,880
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

412
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,757
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

413
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,593
OK, let's go!

414
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,846
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

415
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,306
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

416
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,725
- Get them!
- Sorry!

417
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,060
Take that!

418
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,812
- Keep going!
- Faster!

419
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:02,898
Hey, stop!

420
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,086
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

421
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,338
Surround him.

422
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,258
Now!

423
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,177
Gotcha!

424
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,471
What? Where'd he go?

425
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,432
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

426
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,561
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

427
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,188
Then search there!

428
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,613
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

429
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,782
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

430
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,952
Look. Gongmen Jail.

431
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,374
Aw, it's cute.

432
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,834
Cute, huh?

433
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,679
Nice work, Po.

434
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,766
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

435
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,103
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

436
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,647
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

437
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,775
Master Ox! Master!

438
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,487
The ferocious Master Croc!

439
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,825
And Master Storming Ox.

440
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,662
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

441
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,831
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

442
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,625
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

443
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,879
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

444
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,048
We're coming for you, Shen!

445
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,765
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

446
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,684
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

447
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,561
Of course we do.

448
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:08,565
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

449
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,525
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

450
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,485
by not protecting Gongmen City?

451
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:17,282
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

452
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:21,202
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

453
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,955
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

454
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,710
...by the unstoppable weapon.

455
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,212
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

456
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,882
from telling me something's unstoppable!

457
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,437
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

458
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,147
I'd like to see you get me out!

459
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,113
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

460
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,157
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

461
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,077
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

462
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,377
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

463
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,964
Yes!

464
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,008
All right, let's go!

465
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,094
I get the top bunk.

466
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:25,433
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

467
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,102
I...

468
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,314
You...

469
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,651
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

470
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,279
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

471
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,658
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

472
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,451
With despair for dessert.

473
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,788
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

474
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:50,875
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

475
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,419
Yeah!

476
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,673
Monkey?!

477
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,551
You! You're mine!

478
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,678
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

479
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,764
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

480
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,810
Get him!

481
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,062
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

482
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,273
Stop him!

483
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,569
Faster!

484
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,158
Yeah! Go, go!

485
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,827
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

486
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,831
- Viper!
- Hang on!

487
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,010
- What?
- Watch out!

488
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,681
Uncool! Very uncool!

489
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,851
Try this!

490
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,186
Guys, guys, guys!

491
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,026
Maybe something smaller!

492
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,695
No, no! Oh, no, no.

493
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,994
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

494
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,339
Fire!

495
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,549
We've lost them.

496
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,519
Again! Again!

497
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,896
Crane, catch!

498
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,400
Gotcha!

499
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,703
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

500
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,414
Mantis, now!

501
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,682
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

502
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,101
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

503
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,438
Your turn!

504
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,111
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

505
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,254
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

506
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,925
Yes! Taste the defeat!

507
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,468
Let me tell you something.

508
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,638
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

509
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,233
Guess nobody told you,

510
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,320
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

511
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,699
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

512
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,537
We surrender!

513
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,295
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

514
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,964
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

515
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,301
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

516
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,847
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

517
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,267
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

518
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,187
These are the best cuffs!

519
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,359
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

520
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,570
No, no, no...

521
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,869
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

522
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,538
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

523
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,794
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

524
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,713
He is coming to me in chains.

525
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,383
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

526
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,013
Don't even think about it.

527
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,988
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

528
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,490
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

529
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,742
This plan's nothing like that plan.

530
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,036
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

531
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,592
Keep moving.

532
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,851
Ah, my old enemy...

533
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,441
...stairs.

534
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,972
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

535
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,558
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

536
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,143
Someone might want to clean that up.

537
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,979
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

538
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,731
Greetings, panda.

539
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,233
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

540
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,361
Hey.

541
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,531
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

542
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,409
Hey... enough with the poking around.

543
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,329
Strong. Healthy.

544
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,165
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

545
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,793
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

546
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,670
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

547
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,924
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

548
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,759
Bring the prisoners to me.

549
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,552
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

550
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,263
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

551
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,894
Sparrow kick!

552
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,108
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

553
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,537
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

554
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,873
I do not. I know he is.

555
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,628
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

556
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,298
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

557
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,716
I did not have a lifetime.

558
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,844
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

559
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,723
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

560
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,393
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

561
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,979
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

562
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,731
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

563
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,067
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

564
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,444
Know what? What's so funny?

565
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,739
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

566
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,827
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

567
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,330
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

568
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,500
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

569
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,379
The only reason you are still alive

570
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:38,342
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

571
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,846
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

572
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,890
Who do you think you are, panda?

573
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,767
Who do you think I am, peacock?

574
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,528
Why are we laughing?

575
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,739
Take aim.

576
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,835
Fire.

577
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,717
Well, light the... thing!

578
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,469
I did!

579
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,100
Fear the bug!

580
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,611
Get the weapon!

581
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,490
Tigress!

582
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,774
You... You were there.

583
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,860
Yes. Yes, I was.

584
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,871
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

585
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,919
Fire!

586
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,716
Oh. No, he's got way more.

587
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,432
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

588
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,017
Coming!

589
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,312
- Watch out!
- Po!

590
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,484
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

591
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,194
Use the ropes.

592
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,164
Run, run, little panda!

593
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:27,511
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

594
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,305
Bring it down!

595
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,061
- We're trapped!
- This way!

596
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,941
Goodbye!

597
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,321
Fire!

598
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,199
Get back!

599
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,250
The only way out is up.

600
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,378
What?

601
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,266
Follow me! Come on!

602
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,768
Where are they going?

603
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,771
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

604
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,571
Here we go!

605
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,593
- You idiot!
- My nose!

606
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,181
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

607
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,977
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

608
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,021
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

609
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,858
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

610
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,779
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

611
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,948
Happy New Year, sir.

612
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,039
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

613
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,291
Now!

614
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,376
Now, now, now, now, now!

615
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,337
Move! Move, move, move, move!

616
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,355
This way.

617
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,570
Let's go.

618
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,245
Oh, you! What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

619
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,080
What happened to stopping Shen?

620
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,167
Yeah.

621
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,754
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

622
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,048
I meant for him to get away.

623
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,176
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

624
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:17,264
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

625
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,934
That makes no sense.

626
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,769
What do you mean? Sure it does.

627
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:25,272
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

628
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,483
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

629
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,194
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

630
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,154
The truth.

631
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,286
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

632
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,997
- Real far.
- What?

633
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,291
You're staying here.

634
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,211
Wait! I have to go ba...

635
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,426
You're staying here!

636
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,137
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

637
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,685
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

638
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,562
Guys? Don't.

639
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,813
Ready.

640
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,481
Look!

641
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,412
Stay down.

642
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,125
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

643
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,838
He was there! OK?

644
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:34,216
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

645
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:38,012
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

646
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,639
Who I am.

647
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,312
Look, I'm going.

648
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,356
I have to know.

649
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,567
The hard core can't understand.

650
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,444
Tigress, no!

651
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,617
The hard core do understand.

652
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,954
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

653
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,460
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

654
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,546
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

655
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,383
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

656
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,344
You're better off here.

657
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:32,399
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

658
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,569
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

659
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,697
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

660
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,241
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

661
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:46,747
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

662
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,375
Then will you finally be satisfied?

663
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:53,754
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

664
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,300
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

665
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,931
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

666
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,101
It is time to stop this madness.

667
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,062
Why on earth would I do that?

668
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,439
So your parents can rest in peace.

669
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,235
My parents hated me.

670
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,322
Do you understand?

671
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:25,869
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

672
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,329
They loved you.

673
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:32,251
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

674
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:40,634
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

675
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,518
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

676
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,313
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

677
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,191
Happiness must be taken.

678
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,195
And I will take mine.

679
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,845
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

680
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,099
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

681
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,562
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

682
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,358
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

683
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,027
I can't feel my face.

684
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,462
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

685
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,881
- Hey.
- Hey.

686
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,549
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

687
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,177
You! Where are you going?

688
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,724
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

689
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,950
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

690
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,254
Greetings, panda.

691
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,844
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

692
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,013
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

693
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,183
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

694
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,896
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

695
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:02,651
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

696
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,246
Here's your New Year's gift.

697
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,582
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

698
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,836
Po? What's he doing here?

699
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,005
Return it! Return it!

700
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,644
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

701
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,356
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

702
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,839
We got them. Go!

703
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,071
You looking for me?

704
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,871
I said that too soon, didn't I?

705
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,464
Po!

706
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,762
Po, get away from him.

707
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,889
I'll get up. Here we go.

708
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,353
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

709
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,522
Now... answers.

710
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,441
Oh, you want to know so badly.

711
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,278
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

712
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:14,491
Fill some crater in your soul?

713
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,827
Well, here's your answer.

714
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:20,080
Your parents didn't love you.

715
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,000
But here...

716
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,836
...let me heal you!

717
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,635
No!

718
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,712
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

719
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:59,221
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

720
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:03,350
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfill your destiny.

721
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,728
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

722
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,565
What is this place?

723
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,736
I'm surprised you remember so little.

724
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,365
But you were so little when it happened.

725
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,206
Perhaps you do remember.

726
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,375
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

727
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,627
Nightmare? Or memory?

728
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,202
This was a thriving village.

729
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,914
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

730
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,916
But he wanted more.

731
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:15,839
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

732
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:19,968
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

733
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,566
Get them all!

734
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:44,618
Take our son and run away! Go!

735
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,801
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

736
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:09,804
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

737
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,099
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

738
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,810
It is the rest of your story.

739
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,813
Who you choose to be.

740
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,349
So, who are you, panda?

741
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,025
I am Po.

742
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,779
And I'm gonna need a hat.

743
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:20,166
Such sad, sad faces.

744
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,044
But now is a time only for joy.

745
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,257
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

746
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:33,513
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

747
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,851
you and your precious kung fu will die.

748
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:44,941
Then China will know to bow before me.

749
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:46,776
Set sail!

750
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,456
What is that?

751
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,104
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

752
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:26,274
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

753
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,193
...then she'd eat my head.

754
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,778
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

755
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:35,492
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

756
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:47,420
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

757
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,380
Fire!

758
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,433
You coward!

759
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,444
Po?

760
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,864
Po?

761
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:22,121
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

762
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,132
Shen!

763
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,345
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

764
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,097
What?

765
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:43,309
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

766
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,103
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

767
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,523
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

768
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,775
Disc of Destruction!

769
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,789
OK. Take aim!

770
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,719
Ready?

771
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,617
You can't follow me.

772
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:41,868
Just get him!

773
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,916
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

774
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,550
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

775
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:58,760
No, don't shoot!

776
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,346
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

777
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,931
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

778
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,352
Yeah!

779
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:10,396
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

780
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,030
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

781
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,579
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

782
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,290
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

783
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,875
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

784
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,043
Po!

785
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,379
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

786
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:40,927
Nice!

787
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,847
Viper, Puppet of Death!

788
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,599
Tigress!

789
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,276
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

790
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,946
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

791
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,949
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

792
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,791
Master Shifu!

793
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,462
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

794
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,307
Crane!

795
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,185
Wings of Justice!

796
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,480
Yeah!

797
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,654
What?

798
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:55,752
I love you guys.

799
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,345
Why aren't we firing?

800
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,932
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

801
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:14,687
Fire! Fire at them!

802
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,941
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

803
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,151
Fire!

804
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,821
No.

805
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,747
Po!

806
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,450
Tigress?

807
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,002
As you wish.

808
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,795
Let's finish this.

809
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,695
Fire!

810
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,577
<i>Inner peace.</i>

811
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,064
Again!

812
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,405
Yeah!

813
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,660
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

814
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,267
What? No. No!

815
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,902
Keep firing! Keep firing!

816
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,049
Skadoosh.

817
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,622
How did you...?

818
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,667
How did you do it?

819
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,132
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

820
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,469
Not that. How did you find peace?

821
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,306
I took away your parents. Everything.

822
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,850
I scarred you for life.

823
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,979
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

824
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:11,150
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

825
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,736
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

826
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:18,324
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

827
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:22,411
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

828
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:27,083
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

829
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,667
You're right.

830
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,212
Then I choose... this!

831
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,225
That was pretty hard-core.

832
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:36,652
- Po!
- You did it!

833
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,905
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

834
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:43,742
It seems you have found inner peace.

835
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,245
And at such a young age.

836
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,289
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

837
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,938
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

838
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,482
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

839
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,402
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

840
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,405
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

841
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:22,948
When do you think he'll be back?

842
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,914
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

843
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,417
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

844
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,794
At least, I was his dad.

845
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,632
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

846
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:43,469
But why? He's just one little panda.

847
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,780
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

848
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,157
Yep.

849
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,618
Well, I knew you would.

850
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,536
That's why I had new signs made.

851
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,956
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

852
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,667
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

853
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,168
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

854
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,004
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

855
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,884
There's something I should tell you.

856
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:31,100
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

857
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,188
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

858
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:37,982
You did?

859
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,736
- I know who I am.
- You do?

860
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,365
I'm your son.

861
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,123
I love you, Dad.

862
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,042
I love you, too, son.

863
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,132
Delicious, fat radishes!

864
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,426
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

865
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,344
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

866
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:08,929
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

867
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,223
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

868
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,726
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

869
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:14,893
- Po.
- Dad.

870
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,520
- Po!
- OK.

871
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,315
Let's both cook. Together.

872
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,774
Together.

873
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,526
No, I'll cook.

874
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,855
My son is alive.

875
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:23,835
