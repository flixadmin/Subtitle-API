1
00:00:01,026 --> 00:00:03,727
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:06,895
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:09,447
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,983
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:16,705
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:21,126
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:26,614
I must be
something else.

8
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,717
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,836
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

10
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:34,288
You got what you came for!
Time's up.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,974
No!
I guess you made your choice.

12
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:38,176
No!

13
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,678
Ivo killed Shado
because of me.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,847
Nothing good comes from telling
Slade that you think you're responsible

15
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,316
for the death
of the woman he loved.

16
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:49,320
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

17
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:50,565
Not for long.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,514
Because we're going
to take the freighter.

19
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,693
We're all going
to die here, just like him.

20
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:59,313
No, we're not. I think I found our way
on to the freighter.

21
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,034
A parachute.

22
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:06,037
I'd like you to meet
Slade Wilson.

23
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,206
It's a pleasure to meet you...

24
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,341
Mr. Queen.

25
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:17,331
What are you
doing here?

26
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,052
Mr. Wilson just made
a sizeable contribution

27
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,054
to my campaign.

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,391
How generous of him.

29
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:27,859
Well, I felt compelled.

30
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,061
It was the least
that I could do for your mother.

31
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:33,014
And what this city needs
is a pro-business mayor

32
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:36,701
like Moira to spread growth
through urban investment.

33
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:41,072
And we were just discussing how
to combat the rising wage gap.

34
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:44,692
And the answer lies
in your budget proposal.

35
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:46,878
You know, when I look
at your mother,

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,464
I think about everything that you
went through after the quake.

37
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,834
All I can say is, you and
I have something in common.

38
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,702
What's that?

39
00:01:54,704 --> 00:01:57,172
I know how difficult
it is to pick yourself back up

40
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,707
when other people
have written you off.

41
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:03,528
Indeed.

42
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:09,434
What's wrong, Mr. Queen?
You look a little piqued.

43
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:13,071
I'm fine,
thank you.

44
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:18,443
Ah, thank you, dear.

45
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:21,779
Oliver, Mr. Wilson
was kind enough to bring

46
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,782
a bottle of authentic
Australian rum.

47
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:30,238
Will you join us
in a drink?

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,407
Yes, of course.

49
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,426
Wonderful.

50
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:37,846
What shall
we drink to?

51
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,268
To friendship.

52
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:53,478
Oh, delicious.

53
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:58,283
This here
is a beautiful piece.

54
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:02,287
Tell me, does your family spend
much time on the water?

55
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,489
Uh, no.

56
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:08,459
Not since my late husband.

57
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:10,628
I'm sorry, Moira,
forgive me.

58
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,632
I do remember reading about that
accident in the paper.

59
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,467
You were a brave soul.

60
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,287
I don't like
to talk about it.

61
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:21,289
I can understand.

62
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,091
All that time on that island...

63
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,643
It must have been
hell for you.

64
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,619
Shado
would be proud.

65
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:27,188
Thank you.
But those trees don't move,

66
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,375
or shoot back. Ivo's men
on the freighter will.

67
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,250
Then shoot first.

68
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:36,251

70
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,055
Ivo's freighter
is located here.

71
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,340
He keeps eight men
on deck. Three on the starboard,

72
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:48,209
three on the port
and two up in the bridge.

73
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:51,712
But our bigger concern
are these GP 25 grenade launchers

74
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:53,598
that they're walking
around with at all times.

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,316
Do they have
night vision?

76
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:57,735
Not according to blondie.

77
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:02,223
That smells awful.

78
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,941
It'll taste
even worse.

79
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:05,443
But it'll work?

80
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:07,779
I spent a year
with Anthony Ivo.

81
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,864
I know how he thinks.

82
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,499
It'll work.

83
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:19,257
Hey, what about
the Mirakuru?

84
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,925
Well, what about it?

85
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,960
Well, look,
I mean, it can cure,

86
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:25,596
I don't know,
maybe anything.

87
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:29,801
Maybe...Maybe
it's a miracle drug.

88
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:34,105
But it's also something else.

89
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:36,424
Something that people like Ivo

90
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:39,110
should never be allowed
to control.

91
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:42,430
What about Slade?
He might not let us.

92
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:46,150
Might not
let you do what?

93
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,986
You think we should
destroy the Mirakuru?

94
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:51,789
This thing doesn't
go our way...

95
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,659
We can't let
Ivo have it.

96
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,945
You're right.

97
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:01,049
We should burn it.

98
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:05,503
Anthony devoted his
entire life to finding this.

99
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:09,557
Nobody even thought
it was real.

100
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,809
It was his dream.

101
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,828
Did he ever say why?

102
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,297
He wanted
to save the world.

103
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,303
We need
to talk about tomorrow.

104
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:26,074
About what to do with Anthony
once we take the freighter.

105
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:27,608
What do you mean?

106
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,328
Because Slade
wants to kill him.

107
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,979
I'm not going
to let that happen.

108
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,665
No, Slade wants to
kill him for Shado.

109
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:39,203
Oliver, you don't
know him like do.

110
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,155
Look, if he's
given the chance,

111
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,007
then he's going
to turn this around.

112
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,459
He's going to make
Slade think

113
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,826
that it's your fault
that she's dead.

114
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:48,346
That you chose
to save me instead of her.

115
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,567
You can't give him
that chance.

116
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,905
Sara...

117
00:06:57,907 --> 00:07:00,174
I can't.
You've killed before.

118
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,976
That's not what
you are talking about.

119
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,196
You are talking about
executing somebody in cold blood.

120
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,848
Look, Slade has the Mirakuru in him.
He's unstable.

121
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,885
If he loses control;
If he snaps again,

122
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,620
then we're both dead.

123
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,792
You have to kill Ivo.

124
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:31,222
Who's thirsty?

125
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,373
Where'd
you get that?

126
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,874
Who cares?
Let's drink it.

127
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:36,394
Ahh, this is one of the few
precious pieces of cargo

128
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:38,813
to survive the crash.

129
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:42,266
Billy Wintergreen and I were
planning on saving it for a rainy day

130
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:45,269
but considering,
God willing,

131
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:48,189
this is our last night
on the island...

132
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:51,242
To taking
the freighter.

133
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:54,562
To getting off
this island forever.

134
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:57,582
To Shado.

135
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,787
Mmm.

136
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,341
You know, if something
happens to me tomorrow...

137
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:10,161
You can't
think like that.

138
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:15,600
If I don't make it...

139
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:18,686
I need you to...

140
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:21,889
To tell my mom and my sister

141
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:25,593
that I wasn't that same,

142
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:29,280
stupid kid that got
on that boat.

143
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:36,320
Tell them I was different.

144
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:38,573
Ok.

145
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:41,409
And if I don't
make it...

146
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:45,329
Tell my family that I died
on "The Gambit."

147
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,947
Why?

148
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,834
Let them remember me
the way that I was.

149
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,793
We should all
get some sleep.

150
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,522
I've missed you.

151
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:17,144
Shado?

152
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:22,733
How are you
still alive?

153
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:24,552
I'm not alive.

154
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,204
Remember?

155
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,974
I'm dead.

156
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:33,811
Because you chose Sara over me.

157
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:40,635
Why didn't you choose me?

158
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:42,803
Why didn't you choose me?

159
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:47,007
Why didn't you choose me?!

160
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:52,280
Rise and shine,
kid. It's time.

161
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,279
Glaza zmei!

162
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:57,817
Better luck next
time, Hendrik.

163
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:01,036
You cheat!

164
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:02,822
He cheats!

165
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:05,641
So do you.

166
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:07,610
He just cheats better.

167
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:10,513
Get up,
preacher boy.

168
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,716
I said get up,
coward!

169
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:44,864
Ivo wants
to see you.

170
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,816
Have faith, my friend.

171
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,818
God will protect you.

172
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,587
There is no God.

173
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,623
If there was...

174
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,158
He's not on this ship.

175
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,659
How is she?

176
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:59,345
I'm sorry, Anthony.

177
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:01,513
I wish I had better
news to give you,

178
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:05,517
but her condition is progressing
quicker than we anticipated.

179
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,687
Have you tried
upping her dosage?

180
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:11,190
Twice already,
but we both know

181
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,859
modern medicine
has its limitations.

182
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,946
Oh, yes, I know quite well.

183
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:19,565
Thank you, Doctor.

184
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,826
No. No, wait.
Wait, Mr. Ivo.

185
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,963
My family is Bratva.
Russian mafia.

186
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,882
They pay millions for me.

187
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,585
I'm sorry, I have very
little use for money.

188
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:43,923
I do, however,
require an eye

189
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:46,225
for my research.

190
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:23,095
Well, we don't have all day.

191
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:26,332
There's a breeze.

192
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,693
They're
on the beach.

193
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,495
Take them.

194
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:58,280
Alive.

195
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:59,798
What about him?

196
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:06,171
They're coming.

197
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:08,457
Two men, armed.

198
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,294
You know, when
we first tried

199
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,263
to get off
this island,

200
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:17,099
it was as strangers.

201
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:20,635
But now it's
as brothers.

202
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,974
See you on the freighter.

203
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,706
Right over there.

204
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,603
Ohh!

205
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,510
You're lucky
Ivo wants you alive.

206
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:08,167
I told you
I'd come back.

207
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:09,735
Fantastic.

208
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,787
We're saved.

209
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,387
He likes you.

210
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,707
Don't worry,
he won't bite.

211
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,544
Reverend Thomas Flynn.

212
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:38,230
Oliver Queen.

213
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:42,618
This is Abraham.

214
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,320
I remember you from
before. You escaped.

215
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:47,823
With that blonde whore.

216
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,275
That's Hendrik.
He's a charmer.

217
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,494
Yeah, I hope
she rots in hell.

218
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:55,998
Hey, Sara was a prisoner,
just like all of us.

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,400
Right.

220
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:01,753
Funny, I never
heard her scream.

221
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:05,240
How long have you
been here, Thomas?

222
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:07,292
A little
over a year.

223
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:08,710
I was working
as a missionary

224
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:11,313
in Maliku, just off
the coast of India.

225
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:13,415
This ship docked
there for supplies,

226
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,917
Dr. Ivo asked me
to come aboard

227
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,421
to administer last rites
for a dying man.

228
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:22,307
My mistake.

229
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,442
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,444
Don't be.

231
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:28,647
Can you imagine a better place
for a man in my line of work?

232
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:39,274
Prochnost.

233
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,466
Mr. Queen.

234
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,301
Welcome back.

235
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,620
My men are still
searching the beach

236
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:53,255
for your friend
and Sara.

237
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,641
They have
the Mirakuru.

238
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,809
So...

239
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,395
Where are they?

240
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,481
Go to hell.

241
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:05,734
Maybe you'd like
to rethink that.

242
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:15,810
Ivo...You torture me
all you want to.

243
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:18,497
I am never going
to tell you where they are.

244
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:21,149
No. Not willingly.

245
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,505
What is that?

246
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:28,173
Oh, this?

247
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:30,042
See, this is
sodium pentothal.

248
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:33,011
Its more colloquial,
yet very descriptive name,

249
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:34,496
is truth serum.

250
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,881
No, wait, wait!

251
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:38,917
No, no,
I'll tell you everything!

252
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,337
Let's begin.

253
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,059
Are you married,
Mr. Wilson?

254
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,161
Do you have
any children?

255
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:51,346
Sadly neither.

256
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:56,285
Well, there must be
someone special in your life.

257
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:59,071
There was.

258
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:01,907
But she passed away
a few years ago.

259
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,408
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,061
My mother and I have had
to deal with a lot of loss,

261
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,080
unfortunately.

262
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:11,366
And eventually we learned...

263
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:14,469
That you just have to move on.

264
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,560
I don't believe that.

265
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,845
You know, I heard
that your family

266
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,398
has an affinity
with the fine arts.

267
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,684
Yes, my husband
amassed quite the collection

268
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:31,019
of 19th century
American landscapes.

269
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,722
Hmm. I'd love to see them.

270
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,525
Maybe another day.

271
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:40,245
We have some family business
that we need to discuss right now.

272
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,948
I'm sorry. My son
seems to have forgotten

273
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,750
all his manners.

274
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:48,036
Let me just get my staff to open up
the rest of the house.

275
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:49,755
Thank you.

276
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,846
Mom?

277
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,264
Ollie?

278
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:00,849
Not yet, kid.

279
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:03,585
I'm still going to meet
the rest of your family.

280
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,130
Hello?

281
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,669
Hey, Ollie, have
you and mom talked,

282
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:21,287
'cause this whole
not speaking thing...

283
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,471
Thea, now is not
a good time.

284
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,890
Who's your friend?

285
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:26,309
Slade Wilson.

286
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,010
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

287
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,129
I've heard such wonderful
things from your mother.

288
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:31,931
About me.

289
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,850
Thea, what perfect timing.
This is  Slade Wilson, and I--

290
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,886
They've met.

291
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:39,288
...was just about
to show him our collection.

292
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,073
But you're far
better suited. Come.

293
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,475
Oh.

294
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:47,496
Senior year, I was
obsessed with art.

295
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,816
My teacher made me
bring my entire art history class

296
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,285
over here
to show our pieces.

297
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:54,754
It was exactly
as mortifying as it sounds.

298
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,488
Oh, I'm sure
it wasn't.

299
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,324
But you're a very lucky girl to have
known such privilege.

300
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,761
And I am fortunate
to have your entire family here.

301
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:10,436
Oliver.

302
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:15,775
Oliver, what's
your name?

303
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:19,678
Oliver Jonas Queen.

304
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:25,451
Oliver, where
were you born?

305
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,704
Starling City.

306
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:32,658
Why did you build
a bonfire on the beach?

307
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,212
So you'd see it.

308
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:39,165
I told you.

309
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:42,251
Was the bonfire
a trap?

310
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:46,055
Not a trap.
It was a...

311
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:49,475
a distraction.

312
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:54,730
How was the bonfire
a distraction?

313
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:59,385
Where are Sara
and Slade right now?

314
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:01,604
Where are they?!

315
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:06,025
They're on the freighter.

316
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:09,912
Where on
the freighter?

317
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:13,416
They're in the engine room

318
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:15,918
because we have a raft.

319
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,004
Sound the alarm.
I want every man

320
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:19,455
on this freighter
down in that engine room.

321
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:22,741
Search the entire
floor. Go!

322
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:25,795
Oliver Jonas Queen.

323
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:34,937
It'll taste even worse.

324
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,755
But it'll work?

325
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:39,442
I spent a year with Anthony Ivo.
I know how he thinks.

326
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:40,609
It'll work.

327
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:42,428
What is it,
exactly?

328
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,564
Cocculus indicus.
It's a natural source of picrotoxin,

329
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,616
which will counteract
effects of barbiturates--

330
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:49,652
like sodium pentothal.

331
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:52,271
Ivo's favorite. But you still got to
act stoned to sell it.

332
00:21:52,273 --> 00:21:55,941
Lucky for me. Before all this,
I had a lot of practice.

333
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,135
They're
clearing the decks.

334
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,638
The top of the ship's
emptying.

335
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,974
Are you ready?

336
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:14,343
You really don't want
an honest answer to that.

337
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,312
But you've done
this before, right?

338
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:20,232
Nobody's
done this before!

339
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,115
Here, I think
these belong to you.

340
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:37,833
We're on a clock,

341
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,818
and she needs to
free the prisoners.

342
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,671
Ivo sent his men to the engine room
just like we planned.

343
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:45,541
More convenient for me
to take them out.

344
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:48,043
Go find Ivo.

345
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:52,047
He can't get off this ship.
But don't kill him.

346
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:55,518
Son of a bitch is mine.

347
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:02,975
And here we have
a Curtis Swan from 1882.

348
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:06,011
Fun fact about this one-
he actually painted it with his left hand

349
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:09,348
due to severe arthritis.

350
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,984
It's absolutely
exquisite.

351
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:15,354
I know. I can't tell you
how many offers we've had

352
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:17,373
from private collectors for it.

353
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,376
But it was
one of dad's favorites.

354
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:22,361
Wasn't it, Ollie?

355
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:25,214
Yes, it was.

356
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:28,000
He loved that one.

357
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,052
Then you must
never sell it.

358
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:34,056
I believe that when
we lose someone we love,

359
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,543
we have the obligation
to honor their memory.

360
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,768
Oof.

361
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,187
I think eventually
I'd hit something.

362
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:50,239
Be patient.
Ollie makes it look easy.

363
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,575
Is anyone going
to get that?

364
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:54,743
I'll take that
as no. No worries.

365
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:57,496
No matter where I go,
I'm just answering phones.

366
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,565
Hello?

367
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,234
Oliver?

368
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:05,504
Well, I do think
we have been butt dialed.

369
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:08,123
And here
is a Joseph Cooper from 1890.

370
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,960
Hey, that's Thea.

371
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,429
That's gorgeous.

372
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,080
Wait, hold on.

373
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:16,932
I know that voice.

374
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:21,687
I actually have a painting from his
first solo exhibition in Boston.

375
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:24,006
Oh, God, no.

376
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,357
Who is that?

377
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,443
His name is Slade Wilson.

378
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,605
And unless we stop him,

379
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,300
he's going to kill Oliver
and his entire family.

380
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,841
We have to move. Now.

381
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,659
Are you sure it was
Slade Wilson?

382
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,794
I thought he was dead.
I'm sure.

383
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:47,163
That's not a voice
I'd ever forget.

384
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:49,583
What's the biggest gun
you got down here?

385
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:53,202
That might work.

386
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:54,921
Might?

387
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:57,540
He has
the Mirakuru in him.

388
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,593
So do I.

389
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:02,646
Can I trust you?

390
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:06,733
I'll be fine.

391
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:08,985
Slade was a trained killer
even before he was injected.

392
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,821
You get the chance,
you get a shot, you put him down.

393
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:14,324
Please save Oliver.

394
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:29,089
Why are you doing this?

395
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:30,907
I'm with Oliver now.

396
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,092
Why should I believe you?

397
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:34,844
Because you don't
want to die! Go!

398
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:48,091
You helped that maniac
torture us.

399
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:12,999
No!

400
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,178
Follow me.

401
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:29,465
Where's Ivo?!

402
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,467
He's heading to the bridge!

403
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,835
Answer the phone.

404
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:08,304
Hello?

405
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:10,774
Jessica,
it's me.

406
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,525
Who?

407
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,611
It's Anthony.

408
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:16,913
Anthony.

409
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:19,382
I was married
to a boy named Anthony.

410
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:20,867
I know,
sweetheart.

411
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:22,285
But he went away.

412
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,571
I went to find a cure.

413
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,873
And I found one,
sweetheart.

414
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,192
I found it, and soon,
we're going to be--

415
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:34,297
He was a doctor,
but he went away.

416
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:51,380
It's harder than
it looks, isn't it?

417
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:54,400
Killing an unarmed man.

418
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:57,787
It seemed pretty easy when
you murdered Shado.

419
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,405
I didn't murder her, Oliver.

420
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:00,940
Ivo, you shot
her in the head!

421
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:02,942
I gave you a choice!

422
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,112
You chose Sara.

423
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:07,947
You blame me,

424
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:10,617
but that's because
you can't face your own guilt

425
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,420
I loaded the bullets, yes,
I pulled the trigger.

426
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,941
But you...

427
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:20,126
you aimed the gun.

428
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:24,714
And you hold yourself
responsible.

429
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,415
Don't you?

430
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:30,303
Yes.

431
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:34,924
But that doesn't mean
I won't kill you.

432
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:38,111
The question is...

433
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:41,314
What will he do?

434
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,877
Is it true?

435
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:09,516
Tell me.

436
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:10,551
Slade, I tried
to tell you...

437
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:12,720
Tell him, Oliver.

438
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:16,140
I was angry,
like you are right now.

439
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,592
And I wasn't thinking clearly.

440
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,778
Shut up!

441
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,479
I acted rashly;
I told him to choose

442
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:25,165
between Shado and Sara.

443
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,100
Don't listen to him.

444
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:28,986
He's a monster,
he will say anything.

445
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:30,604
You know that he will!

446
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:32,489
Tell him I'm lying, Oliver.

447
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,326
Say it.

448
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:38,162
I can explain...

449
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:41,165
You've known...

450
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:02,019
Slade...

451
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:05,356
Please...Ivo.

452
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:07,107
He's dead.

453
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,110
As dead as you are.

454
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:44,561
Aah!

455
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,191
How many?

456
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:05,198
This one time,
you can pray for me.

457
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,600
Behind you!

458
00:31:30,275 --> 00:31:33,610
Ollie! Are you ok?
Where's Slade?

459
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,946
He knows!

460
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:45,005
We've got to get off this ship!
No!

461
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,875
Ollie, it's over!
It's over!

462
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:50,627
We've got to go! We can still swim
back to the island.

463
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:53,797
She's right!
We must hurry!

464
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:17,154
Slade, wait...

465
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:27,247
Stop. Don't move.

466
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,584
Get in the cell.

467
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:35,606
I do not take orders
from you.

468
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:38,425
I am this ship's Captain.

469
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:44,848
Not anymore.

470
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:53,357
This is my ship now.

471
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,860
Any objections?

472
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:09,172
Slade Wilson
is dangerous.

473
00:33:09,174 --> 00:33:11,792
No chances, no mistakes.

474
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,295
I'm in position.

475
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,330
When Slade comes out,
I'll have the shot.

476
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:19,499
Felicity?

477
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,836
Thermal imaging's
coming up now.

478
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,139
They're in
the northwest hall.

479
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:32,613
Roy, remember, just get
Thea and Moira away from Slade.

480
00:33:32,615 --> 00:33:35,198
Don't start a fight,
you'll lose. Ok?

481
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,517
Ok.

482
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,486
Let's go.

483
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:05,054
Thank you again

484
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:08,407
for such a wonderful
and insightful tour.

485
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:11,077
You were a remarkable guide.

486
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,762
Did you have
a favorite?

487
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,897
I found "The Promise"

488
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,566
to be particularly
compelling.

489
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:19,251
Thea, you home?

490
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:22,705
Roy! I thought I was
meeting you at Verdant.

491
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,240
Oh, yeah.

492
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:28,094
Uh, this is, uh--

493
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:29,095
I'm Roy Harper.

494
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:32,748
Slade Wilson.

495
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,601
That's a particularly firm
handshake you have there, son.

496
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:37,553
Yeah, you, too.

497
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:46,312
Ollie.

498
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:49,264
There you are.

499
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,817
Sara, we didn't
hear you come in.

500
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:55,121
I didn't want
to interrupt the tour.

501
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:59,575
Mr. Wilson, this is my son's
friend Sara Lance.

502
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,460
Of course.

503
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:05,131
You're the girl who came back
from the dead.

504
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:08,084
Ah, we're just glad
to have her home.

505
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:10,336
Well, I can see.

506
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:12,139
I mean, it's hard
to find that special someone

507
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,957
who means
everything to you.

508
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,626
You were very lucky.

509
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:25,151
So...

510
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:29,605
What would you like to do now?

511
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:32,491
Mr. Wilson.

512
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:47,156
Well, I'd hate
to break up the party...

513
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,675
But I think
I should be going.

514
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:55,998
I look forward to seeing more
of you, Moira.

515
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,833
Oh.

516
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:02,521
And your
lovely family.

517
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:07,342
Dig's got a shot
lined up outside.

518
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:10,062
Mr. Wilson.

519
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:13,466
May I walk you to your car?

520
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,917
Cyrus gold,

521
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:35,704
the men in the skull mask,
all this was you.

522
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:38,507
They worked for you.

523
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:41,260
Well, I have my allies,

524
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:44,063
just as you have yours.

525
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:46,432
John Diggle, for example.

526
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:50,903
I suppose you're wondering
why he hasn't taken his head shot.

527
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:54,907
Don't worry.

528
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:58,944
He's still alive--for now.

529
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:02,915
Slade.

530
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:09,538
What
do you want?

531
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:21,967
Five years ago,
I made you a promise.

532
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:24,086
Do you remember?

533
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:29,258
Well, I'm here
to fulfill it.

534
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,478
I'll see you
around, kid.

535
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,575
We made it!

536
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:49,829
Where's Oliver?

537
00:38:02,392 --> 00:38:05,761
I need you
to see something.

538
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:19,191
Ok. Wait.

539
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:22,161
You need me.

540
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:24,163
Ok, you have
the Mirakuru in you.

541
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:26,866
Not just in me.

542
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:36,258
You burned a box
full of dirt.

543
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,628
I can help
you understand how it works.

544
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,163
I've spent my entire
life studying it, all right?

545
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:43,933
It was you.

546
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:45,801
You were the one
who killed Shado.

547
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,470
No. No, he chose.

548
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:50,839
It was him.

549
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:58,814
Give him your gun.

550
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:03,518
Take it.

551
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,871
And show me...

552
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:07,856
How you killed Shado.

553
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:10,576
Show me!

554
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:19,501
Slade...

555
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:24,723
This isn't you.

556
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,926
It's the Mirakuru.

557
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:28,710
And you're sick!

558
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:30,879
I don't care.

559
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:34,233
I was trying to protect Sara.

560
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:36,735
But I didn't want Shado to die.

561
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:40,105
I cared for her, too.
You know that I did!

562
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:42,858
I don't care.

563
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:48,197
You said we were brothers.

564
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,900
You said that.

565
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:54,036
Is that how
you did it?

566
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:56,922
Is that how you pointed
the gun at her?

567
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:58,540
Yes.

568
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:11,136
Get him out of here.

569
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:18,060
Why don't you just kill me?

570
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:20,279
To kill you now...

571
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:23,098
would be a mercy.

572
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:28,237
You cannot die

573
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,772
until you have
suffered...

574
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:34,943
the same way that
I have suffered.

575
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:38,464
Till you have known

576
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,582
complete despair.

577
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:44,119
And you will.

578
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:47,589
I promise.

579
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:57,933
Mr. Wilson leave?

580
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:00,569
Yeah.

581
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:03,939
It's getting pretty late,
I'm going to go, too.

582
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,608
Hmm. Oliver.

583
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,911
I know you and I have
our differences,

584
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:11,864
but they hardly excuse
your behavior tonight.

585
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:18,520
If this is the way you're going to act
around me from now on,

586
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,655
then don't come by
the house anymore.
