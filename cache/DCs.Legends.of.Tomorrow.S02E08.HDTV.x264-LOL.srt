1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:02,740
Time travel is real,

2
00:00:02,765 --> 00:00:05,124
and all of history is
vulnerable to attack,

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:07,049
which is why we must
travel through time

4
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,852
to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations,

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:12,321
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:14,891
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,826
so please don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:19,662
We're something else. We're legends.

9
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,331
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

10
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,834
You're back! I love you, Dad.

11
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:27,003
When I last left 2016,

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,771
that young woman did not exist.

13
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:31,207
I do not want to lose my daughter.

14
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:33,160
This amulet looks a lot like the one

15
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:34,610
we recovered off the Nazis.

16
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,879
- There's gotta be a connection.
- And we know that Damien Darhk

17
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,948
and the speedster are
willing to kill for it.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,404
Mr. Capone...

19
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,973
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

20
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,908
I cancelled tickets to the opera,

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,811
'cause I heard there
was new players in town.

22
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:11,781
No one told me it was Halloween.

23
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:14,150
Well, it's more like Christmas.

24
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:16,052
That's... I like that, it's very good.

25
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,055
See, my associate and I have
come with a proposition.

26
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:20,656
We've seen how you run your empire,

27
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:21,958
and we're impressed,

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,392
but there's room for improvement.

29
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:25,361
We'd like to offer our services.

30
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,096
I got a better idea.

31
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:32,535
How 'bout I show you how
business is done in my town?

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,438
You or me?

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,075
Oh, I've got...

34
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,077
this.

35
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,645
By now you've probably surmised

36
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,947
that my friend and I
aren't from around here.

37
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,116
- What do you freaks want?
- To help.

38
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,385
I thought I made...
did I not make that perfectly clear?

39
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,120
New enemies are coming to Chicago,

40
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:53,255
and they will endanger your enterprises.

41
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,825
And you're saying you
two can help me out?

42
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,395
Actually, there's three of us.

43
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,964
Pleasure to meet you.

44
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,667
My name is Malcolm Merlyn.

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,897
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

46
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,553
Okay.

47
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:26,055
New suit's good, but I think it needs

48
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:27,790
those modifications Cisco mentioned.

49
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,825
It's a poor hero to blame a super suit.

50
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:32,061
Eh, exoskeleton. Come on, let's do this.

51
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,330
I wanna get the kinks worked
out before our next mission.

52
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:35,865
What's the rush? I think I'm doing

53
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,933
a pretty good job picking up your slack.

54
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,169
We scientists have a
name for that phenomenon.

55
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,771
- It's called beginner's luck.
- Ooh.

56
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:43,839
Hey!

57
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:47,376
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh, s... sparring.

58
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,164
Yeah, he's helping me
calibrate the new suit.

59
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:50,579
Last time y'all decided to spar,

60
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,648
- you wrecked my cargo bay.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,784
Hey!

62
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,952
Don't make me come down here again.

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,327
Don't you make me
come down here again.

64
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,762
I'm gonna come down here again,
I'm watching you.

65
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:10,266
Hey!

66
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:12,234
- What is going on with them?
- You don't have any brothers

67
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,603
- or sisters, do you?
- Nope.

68
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:17,506
Sibling rivalry. Nothing to
be too worried about.

69
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,844
This is why I'm glad

70
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:23,546
I'm an only child.

71
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:35,357
Oh, Jefferson, I was just, uh,
catching up on some reading.

72
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:40,062
"The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Repair"?

73
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:43,332
It's a fascinating subject.
Of course, I'm also researching

74
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,836
the amulet Ms. Lance last
stole from Damien Darhk.

75
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,437
You know, you might be
a genius when it comes

76
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,573
to nuclear physics,
but when it comes to lying,

77
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,508
you kinda suck at it, bro.

78
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:56,450
You were thinking about
her again, weren't you?

79
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:59,749
I can't help it.

80
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:02,918
Every day, I recover new memories of her,

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,421
each one a gift.

82
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,824
Then I find myself worrying,
"What if there's a car accident,

83
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,527
or... or a fire? Or she could
be struck by lightning."

84
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:13,325
Yeah, I'd be more worried
about what happens

85
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,997
when Sara finds out you have a daughter

86
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,600
- that's a time aberration.
- She's not an aberration.

87
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:20,536
The only reason Lily exists

88
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,171
is because you convinced
your younger self

89
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,839
to pay more attention to your wife,

90
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,408
and less attention to
putting on a condom.

91
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,444
You changed history,

92
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,780
and one of these days,
either Nate or Gideon

93
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,848
or anybody revealing the
historical timeline's

94
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,117
- gonna figure that out.
- Not necessarily.

95
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:37,253
According to my calculations,

96
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,756
if Lily's impact on history
remains small enough,

97
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:43,459
she may be able to go undetected.

98
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,596
Excuse me, but
Dr. Haywood's seismograph

99
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,599
- has detected an aberration.
- You were saying?

100
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,135
- Who installed the alarms?
- That'd be me.

101
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,237
- We should kill him.
- We got another one?

102
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,306
Yeah, and judging by these
readings, it's a major one.

103
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:59,508
Is there really cause for all this alarm?

104
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,977
Perhaps the aberration
isn't as large as we think.

105
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,547
The temporal tremors
originate from Union Station

106
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:08,617
in Chicago, Illinois,
October 17th in the year 1927.

107
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,320
That's fantastic.

108
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,689
I-I mean, I've always
wanted to visit the roaring '20s

109
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,257
right in the middle of Prohibition.

110
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,726
That means no drinking. That's not good.

111
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,563
Well, actually under Capone,
Chicago was a hot bed of vice.

112
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:23,032
There was illegal drinking,
gambling, prostitution.

113
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:25,434
Well, then, let's fire up
a tub and get there.

114
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:28,671
Grab your fedoras,
we're going to the 1920s.

115
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:41,116
I can't believe we're here.

116
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:44,153
What are you so happy about?

117
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,522
When I was younger,
I'd read my mother's magazines,

118
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,824
and I'd see photos of Chicago.

119
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,193
I'd never thought I'd
see it with my own eyes.

120
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,462
Well, keep those eyes focused
on whatever's causing

121
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,764
those temporal tremors.

122
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,066
Copy that.

123
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,774
That's Eliot Ness.

124
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:09,511
He doesn't
look like Kevin Costner.

125
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,046
What if somebody tipped off Capone

126
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,249
that Ness is a future threat?

127
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,117
Then his life's in danger.

128
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,820
Don't worry, I'm on it.

129
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:18,854
You go.

130
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,157
Oh!

131
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,094
Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness, hi.

132
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:27,897
Uh, you don't know me.
My name is Ray Palmer.

133
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,699
I have reason to believe that
your life may be in danger.

134
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,167
It'd be best if you came with me.

135
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,070
Mr. Ness, I'm Sergeant
Jones with Chicago PD.

136
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,973
We're your security detail
on the way to the bureau.

137
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,775
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Palmer,

138
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,610
but it looks like I'm in good hands.

139
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,649
Okay.

140
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:47,917
What just happened?

141
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,919
Well, it's the strangest thing.

142
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:55,124
Uh, two cops just escorted
Eliot Ness to the bureau.

143
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,092
They're not escorting him to the bureau.

144
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,161
They're gonna throw him in the river.

145
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:02,698
- What?
- Ray, 1920s Chicago PD

146
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,134
was the most corrupt
police force in history.

147
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,569
Almost all of them are
on Capone's payroll.

148
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:09,438
Did you or did you not

149
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,673
see "The Untouchables"?

150
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,241
Jax, Stein,

151
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,310
I need you to intercept Eliot Ness.

152
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,379
He's being escorted by
two police officers.

153
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,459
Grey! Didn't you hear Sara?

154
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,027
- No.
- Oh.

155
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,765
Oh, wait, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

156
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,903
What the hell happened back there?

157
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:44,206
- How come you didn't stop him?
- I'm sorry, I got distracted.

158
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,408
- By what?
- Tell her, Grey.

159
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,010
It's not the professor's fault.

160
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,145
Ray let Ness walk right
into Capone's hands.

161
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,981
They were police officers,
and who's to say

162
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,316
they didn't take him to the
FBI like they said they would?

163
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,784
Gideon, pull up the Chicago Chronicle,

164
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,821
- October 24th, 1931.
- Ah, yes,

165
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,323
the day Al Capone originally
went down for tax evasion,

166
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:03,025
only in this version of history,

167
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:05,260
he becomes something far
worse than a criminal,

168
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,829
he becomes a politician.

169
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,331
Al Capone becomes mayor?

170
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,934
Okay, I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.

171
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:13,335
Well, let's find out where they took him,

172
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:17,339
so we can unscrew
him before this happens.

173
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:24,847
Special agent Ness,

174
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,582
you're having a hell of a first day.

175
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:30,519
How do you know who I am?
And when I was coming to town?

176
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:33,589
Some new friends of mine,
they whispered in my ear,

177
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:35,290
so me and the boys decided
we would get you

178
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,394
a nice welcome present. Cement galoshes.

179
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,962
Very popular in Chicago these days,

180
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,931
and I have a feeling these
will be just your size.

181
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,501
Now, come on, try 'em on.

182
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:49,838
- Any luck finding Ness?
- By the time you find Ness,

183
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,308
he'll be swimming with the fishes.

184
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,144
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.

185
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:57,012
About time someone noticed.

186
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,716
Gideon, set the course to
shipping harbor dock 39.

187
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:02,384
What makes you so sure he'll be there?

188
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,553
In the '20s, dock 39 was where Capone

189
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,555
brought all of his enemies
and tied cinderblocks

190
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:08,223
to their feet and tossed
them in the harbor.

191
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,926
It became known as Cadaver's Cove.

192
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,535
This isn't personal. I'm a businessman,

193
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:22,304
and the Feds, well,
they're bad for business.

194
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:25,707
The Bureau of Investigation
will never stop fighting,

195
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,409
not until the fight is done.

196
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:29,978
Poetic.

197
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,880
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.

198
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:34,183
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.

199
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,422
All this for some booze?

200
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:43,759
I like it. Nice getups.

201
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,995
Seems our new friends have
got some friends of their own.

202
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:48,097
Get 'em, boys.

203
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,583
I'm going after Capone.

204
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:13,489
Let 'em go, we got Ness.

205
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,357
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious.

206
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,793
He took on a lot of water.

207
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,597
Merlyn was right.

208
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,599
They took the bait.

209
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,533
Special agent Ness has
suffered severe hypoxia.

210
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:37,669
It will take some time to
reverse his brain damage.

211
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,171
You can undo brain damage?

212
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,206
Why haven't you helped Rory out?

213
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,474
Who says I haven't?

214
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,143
All right, let's get serious.

215
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,480
Obviously, Capone somehow knew
that Ness would be the one

216
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,415
- to take him down.
- When we were at the docks,

217
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,584
Capone said something
about having new friends.

218
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,821
But we have a bigger problem.
I mean, another problem.

219
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,123
This week, Ness and his team
are supposed to obtain

220
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,825
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.

221
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,928
Now the IRS's case against
Capone for tax evasion

222
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,197
is completely dependent on that ledger.

223
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,332
Which Ness can't grab
while he's lying here

224
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,467
with brain damage.

225
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,435
Exactly, which means

226
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,738
one of us has to take his place.

227
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,874
- That's a stupid idea.
- It's pre-Internet.

228
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,509
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.

229
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,277
Nate's right, I got this.

230
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,012
Actually, I was thinking I got this.

231
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,647
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission

232
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,449
was impersonating Brad Pitt,
you'd be the man,

233
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,084
but I think we can all
agree if anyone here

234
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,953
looks like a G-man here, it's me.

235
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,589
Well, we're in this situation,
because you learned history

236
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,258
- from a movie.
- All right, enough.

237
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,294
Ray, I'm sorry, but Nate
knows more about this area

238
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,729
than any of us.

239
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,331
- What's the plan?
- Okay.

240
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,266
So if Capone's ledger is anywhere,

241
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,436
it's probably at his primary
speakeasy, the Chelsea Club,

242
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,238
so Ray and I will go to the Bureau,

243
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,441
assemble Ness's team,
lead him to bust the place up,

244
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,743
- grab the ledger.
- Great, take Rory with you.

245
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,312
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

246
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,115
Does this face look like a cop to you?

247
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,850
If this were a JSA mission,

248
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,886
we'd probably also send
someone undercover at the club.

249
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,888
Well, I'm not doing that either.

250
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,489
I'm done playing dress-up.

251
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,790
Fine.

252
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,626
I'll go the club with Jax and Stein,

253
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,961
and you can stay here, drink your beers,

254
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,429
and watch over Ness.

255
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,597
What about me?

256
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:16,234
- You can watch over him.
- What?

257
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,336
Sorry.

258
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,774
Beer.

259
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,813
- There he is.
- Ah.

260
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,850
- Special agent Cole Bennett.
- Yes, and you are?

261
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,252
Special agent Eliot Ness.
This is my associate,

262
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,855
- Bob De Niro.
- Well, I've assembled the team

263
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,823
your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.

264
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,725
Well, hope they're ready for some action,

265
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:41,882
'cause they're gonna get it.

266
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:44,062
Tonight we're gonna take
down the Chelsea club.

267
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,298
Our files say Capone's got
nothing to do with that place.

268
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,767
Well, your files are
embarrassingly outdated.

269
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,702
We've learned Capone
has a stake in the club,

270
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,504
and furthermore, he hides
a sizeable amount

271
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,039
of Canadian whiskey in there.

272
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,807
You fellas sure do
know an impressive amount

273
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,409
about Capone's organization.

274
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,512
Well, let's just say we
have people on the inside.

275
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,353
This place is quite lively,
considering we haven't seen

276
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,789
a single bottle of alcohol.

277
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,158
Well, Nate said it was a speakeasy.

278
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,061
Yeah, that's why it's called a speakeasy.

279
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,330
You gotta know how to do
ask for the good stuff.

280
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,098
Ah.

281
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,203
Excuse me, I'd like a club soda, please.

282
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,572
One club soda coming up.

283
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,307
Here's what I wanna know.

284
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,309
Why would somebody from
the future be interested

285
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,944
in helping Al Capone?

286
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,246
Well, we're here to find out.

287
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:40,118
This is just a club soda.

288
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,627
- You feeling all right?
- Fine.

289
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,795
I guess I'm just surprised
you'd rather stay here

290
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,431
on the ship than be out there.

291
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,768
1920 Chicago seemed like your kinda town.

292
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,770
You know, when I was younger,

293
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,506
I always wanted to be a police officer.

294
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,608
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted

295
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,111
- to wear a badge.
- Cute.

296
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,147
The bad guys have all the fun, you know.

297
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,454
It doesn't look like you're
having much fun right now.

298
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:25,130
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

299
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,972
Leonard.

300
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,675
- I must be losing my mind.
- Of course you are.

301
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,243
Why else would you still be here

302
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,246
taking orders like a well-trained puppy?

303
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,214
You're not right in the head, Mick.

304
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,452
That's why I'm here, to set you straight.

305
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,163
Ray, Nate, what's your status?

306
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,633
Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.

307
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,338
What are squares like you
doing in a place like this?

308
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,741
- You.
- Jefferson.

309
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,146
What the hell?

310
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,649
Jefferson, the speedster is here, run!

311
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,723
Nobody move!

312
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,758
- Federal officers.
- You're all under arrest

313
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,359
for violations of the Volstead Act.

314
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,595
Man!

315
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,797
Hey, take it easy, that's our inside guy.

316
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,999
Considering this club's
as dry as the Sahara,

317
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,736
I'd say you need a new inside guy,
special agent Ness.

318
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:40,338
Yeah.

319
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,073
What the hell's happening in here?

320
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,242
Damien Darhk showed
up with the speedster.

321
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,277
They took Grey and Sara.

322
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,844
This whole Capone
aberration was a distraction.

323
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,821
Darhk and his speedster pal
knew it'd attract our attention.

324
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:01,623
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?

325
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,258
I mean, what could he want with them?

326
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,659
Still trying to work that one out.

327
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,061
- You all right, Jax?
- I'm pissed.

328
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,696
Let it go, kid.

329
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,098
There's nothing you can
do about the speedsters.

330
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,567
We'll see about that.

331
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:15,904
Long story short, Rip
had a secret armory.

332
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,440
Me and Grey found it alongside
future Barry's message

333
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:19,541
about the oncoming war.

334
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,875
This speedster killed Rex

335
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,610
and kidnapped our friends.

336
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,212
We need him in the brig before dawn.

337
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:27,382
Yeah, if this weapon does
what I think it does,

338
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:28,783
we'll stop him dead in his tracks.

339
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,285
Yeah, well, at's all well and good,

340
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:32,120
but we still need to get
Capone's ledger back,

341
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,822
otherwise history's screwed.

342
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,857
Since your last plan was a total bust,

343
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,359
I suggest somebody else
do the strategic thinking.

344
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,928
Let me guess, that's you?

345
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,031
All right, so let's
hear your brilliant idea.

346
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,467
Well, I don't have one, but
it's gonna be better than yours.

347
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,769
Enough.

348
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:51,539
If you wanna nail
Capone and Rex's killer,

349
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,608
you can't do it by playing a boy scout

350
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,479
or an historian or a policeman.

351
00:16:57,481 --> 00:17:00,849
We do this my way,

352
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,784
like a criminal.

353
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:14,422
Yes, the Ritz-Carleton
it is definitely not.

354
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:15,697
How did we get here?

355
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,500
It appears our speedster
friend got the better of us.

356
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:21,102
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.

357
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:24,873
Damien Darhk, a rather
predictable bedfellow

358
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,876
for Al Capone.

359
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:29,944
And don't forget about me.

360
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:32,747
It's been a long time, Sara.

361
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,350
You look good for someone
who's come back from the dead.

362
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:38,486
Why am I not surprised
that you and Damien Darhk

363
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:39,954
would find each other?

364
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:41,856
What do you want with us?

365
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:44,259
You have something we need,

366
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:47,662
and while my partners think
I'm a fool for trying,

367
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:49,597
I would like to broker a deal with you.

368
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,501
You have in your possession an amulet.

369
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,770
Give it to me,

370
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:58,239
and I will give you nine
years of your life back.

371
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,908
What are you talking about?

372
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,243
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you,

373
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,580
but I was the one who arranged
to blow up the Queen's Gambit.

374
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:11,386
That was the day everything
changed for you, Sara,

375
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,555
hundreds of dominos toppling.

376
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:19,093
Dr. Ivo, Slade Wilson,
the League of Assassins,

377
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,762
losing your sister.

378
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,031
And you losing your son.

379
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,899
We both get clean slates.

380
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,035
Why don't you just ask
your speedster friend

381
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,469
to take you back in time?

382
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,306
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy,

383
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:34,108
sent to retrieve the amulet.

384
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,944
Why is it so important?

385
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:38,146
What does it matter?

386
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:41,249
I'm giving you and your sister
a chance to live normal lives.

387
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,818
To go back, maybe go to college,

388
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,656
meet a nice boy, or a
girl, and settle down.

389
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,158
No thank you.

390
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,927
I was never meant for those things,

391
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,063
and I know that now.

392
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,865
And besides, you can't just go back

393
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,466
and change things like that.

394
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,070
Why not?

395
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,806
Because time is sacred,

396
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,542
and it can't be changed to
suit any one person's desire

397
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:11,412
without harming the lives
of countless others.

398
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:14,582
But you wouldn't remember
any of this, would you?

399
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:18,419
You would be blissfully
unaware of time travel,

400
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:22,190
of loss, of heartbreak.

401
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,092
You'd be happy,

402
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:27,095
and isn't that what
matters most in the end?

403
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,334
Hey, Malcolm.

404
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,470
I'll take a nightmare that's real

405
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:38,239
over a dream that's a lie.

406
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:46,014
That was remarkably selfless.

407
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:48,816
Well, I had a good teacher.

408
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:51,486
Yes, Captain Hunter.

409
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:54,222
No.

410
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,357
I was talking about you.

411
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,069
What the hell?

412
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:13,007
Shoot her!

413
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,484
Come on! Get out of here!

414
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:24,752
Get out of here!

415
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,557
Hi, I'm Clyde. That's Bonnie.

416
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,126
Get out of the truck.

417
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,995
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

418
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,863
Yes, now where's the truck headed?

419
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,099
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.

420
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:40,702
Much obliged.

421
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:45,440
Hold that.

422
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,342
Aren't you forgetting something?

423
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,010
Nate and Ray?

424
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,279
Those idiots have done
nothing but get in the way.

425
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:53,614
Uh, guys, we're...
We're standing right here.

426
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:56,800
Well... get in the back.

427
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,886
I can't believe Malcolm
thought I would actually

428
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:01,689
take that deal.

429
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:04,392
You really weren't tempted?

430
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,661
Of course,

431
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:09,998
but we can't let a man
like that change history.

432
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,500
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.

433
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,836
Oh, yes, when it comes to time travel,

434
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,839
even the best of us can wreak havoc.

435
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:20,541
What do you mean?

436
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:23,044
Martin?

437
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:24,312
You have been acting weird

438
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,714
ever since we fought the Dominators.

439
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:30,084
What's going on?

440
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:32,520
It was an innocent mistake...

441
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:35,723
I was just trying to give
myself a bit of marital advice.

442
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:38,426
Never did I imagine it
would ever have an effect.

443
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:41,362
You caused an aberration?

444
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:45,099
I have a daughter.

445
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,934
A what?

446
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:52,140
A full-grown human progeny

447
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,776
who I never even knew I had.

448
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,745
- This beautiful, brilliant...
- And not real.

449
00:21:57,747 --> 00:22:02,417
At first, no, but then I remembered.

450
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,720
I remembered the...
The countless nights I spent

451
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,355
pacing the neighborhood
with her stroller,

452
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:10,124
trying to get her to sleep. The... the...

453
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:14,762
The way my heart melted the
first time she smiled at me.

454
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:18,433
The... the distress she caused
her kindergarten teacher

455
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:21,803
when she insisted on
singing the periodic table

456
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:23,938
instead of the alphabet. I-I...

457
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,374
I remembered all of it.

458
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:28,609
But none of that happened to you.

459
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:32,380
But the memories are real.

460
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:34,882
They are a part of me now.

461
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:38,519
She is a part of me now.

462
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:43,224
And I love her.

463
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,827
Martin, you were the
one who talked me into

464
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,929
not killing Damien Darhk,

465
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,797
into not bringing my sister back,

466
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,267
because of the damage that
it would do to history.

467
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:57,572
Ugh, I'm sorry, but my ears were burning.

468
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:01,642
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice

469
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:04,011
and offer you a deal.

470
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:05,546
Since you didn't bite,
we're gonna have to be

471
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:07,982
a little rougher.

472
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,884
Do your worst.

473
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:11,919
Oh, you didn't think that I meant you?

474
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,923
Oh, I fear with your
league-training torture,

475
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:20,595
while fun, would be a waste of time.

476
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,468
Sara?

477
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,670
Whatever you do,
don't give them anything.

478
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:30,972
No!

479
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:34,108
Martin! Martin!

480
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,416
Ah!

481
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:49,223
Professor Stein, am I right?

482
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:52,193
- Do I know you?
- Let's just say...

483
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:56,597
It's complicated.

484
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,667
I'm not gonna lie to ya.
This, um, little toy

485
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:03,070
usually leaves the subject well dead,

486
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,505
but I've adjusted it

487
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:07,663
so that you should only
feel a little pain...

488
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:12,046
In theory.

489
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:29,830
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?

490
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:33,034
Vinny, he, uh, he's hanging
out with your mother.

491
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,769
- What?
- What?

492
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:39,941
- So here's the plan.
- Is for us to rescue the people

493
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:42,176
- that got caught because of you.
- She's talking about you.

494
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:43,515
Nah, I think she was talking about you.

495
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:44,612
Shut up!

496
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:46,013
You're supposed to be partners.

497
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,748
Partners have each other's backs.

498
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,517
All right, Mick's right. We can all agree

499
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,818
that we need to get Capone's ledger.

500
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,854
- Fair?
- Agreed.

501
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:05,299
Sara?

502
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:11,939
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

503
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:13,708
We need to find Stein.

504
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,116
You know, for a homicidal gangster,

505
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:23,985
Capone was very organized,

506
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,586
and had exquisite penmanship.

507
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,027
Check it out.

508
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:35,129
Is that it?

509
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:36,864
Bingo.

510
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,065
Let's go.

511
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:46,507
Watch where you point that thing.

512
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,976
- Snart.
- You shouldn't be here, Mick.

513
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:50,945
Capone's men might be from 1927,

514
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:53,881
but their bullets work just fine.

515
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,750
Do you really wanna risk your life

516
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,818
for a skirt and a geezer?

517
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,454
- Any sign of the professor?
- Not yet.

518
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:02,556
Aw, sounds like a sweet little angel

519
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:04,392
whispering in your ear.

520
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,827
Problem is, angels always
want you do the right thing,

521
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:10,031
and doing the right
thing gets you killed.

522
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:11,565
I should know.

523
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:14,869
You wanna stay alive,
best listen to the devil.

524
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:18,372
Get out now.

525
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:21,642
Too late.

526
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,010
Hey, you found them.

527
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,565
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

528
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,347
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, good, yeah.

529
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:29,684
Oh, whoa.

530
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:32,568
Oh, my God, you're Al Capone.

531
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,317
- That's Scarface.
- Yeah, I-I don't think

532
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,857
- he likes that nickname.
- No?

533
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:38,326
I don't like when people
try and steal what's mine.

534
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:39,627
How do you think it makes me feel

535
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:41,996
seeing all you thieves on my property?

536
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:44,332
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say not good.

537
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,500
See, the doctor used
to give me these pills,

538
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:48,336
said they would help calm me down.

539
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:50,338
Then one day, I realized the only thing

540
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,040
that makes me feel any better is killing.

541
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:54,408
Time for some therapy.

542
00:26:57,613 --> 00:26:59,513
Aah!

543
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,421
Whoo. Thanks, buddy.

544
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:09,790
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

545
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,092
Yeah.

546
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:30,244
How'd I do?

547
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:32,980
You totally sold it, Al.

548
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,515
Thought so.

549
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:36,083
You sure Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be mad

550
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:37,351
'cause we let 'em go?

551
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:40,321
Oh, quite the opposite.

552
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,694
Hey, Grey, Grey,
you're safe now, it's okay.

553
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,029
- Grey.
- What?

554
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:56,331
- Grey?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry,

555
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,033
I-I-I didn't hear you.
I'm... I'm... I'm little...

556
00:27:58,035 --> 00:27:59,668
A little discombobulated.

557
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,403
Whoo! Well, that was close,

558
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:03,905
but a win's a win, and we
got the team back together.

559
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:06,408
Well, technically you and Rory
got the team back together.

560
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,677
And we got the ledger. Bro hug?

561
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,178
Do it.

562
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,180
Okay, I think this is
all a little premature.

563
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,149
We still don't have
an ID on the speedster.

564
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,784
Who's now added Malcolm Merlyn

565
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:17,686
to his team of time travelling psychos.

566
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:20,922
And he wanted the amulet that
I took off of Darhk in 1987.

567
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,758
What would someone with
the speedster's power

568
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,093
- want with ancient artifacts?
- Perhaps...

569
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,796
Perhaps I should take
a look at the amulet.

570
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,832
I may be able to unlock
some of its mysteries.

571
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,367
All right.

572
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,914
Ah, so you didn't get a chance

573
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,617
to kill your boyfriend's killer, huh?

574
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:51,720
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.

575
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:53,021
It's justice.

576
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,023
Right, right.

577
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,292
Well, for what it's worth,
you looked good tonight.

578
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:59,861
Being a bad guy suits you.

579
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,166
Thank you.

580
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:11,239
Um, I'm hungry.

581
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:16,845
What's next, Mick?

582
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,514
Long walks on the beach,
just the two of you?

583
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:21,183
For a figment of my imagination,

584
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,285
you're really beginning
to be a pain in my ass.

585
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:26,121
Look, I get it, she's easy on the eyes,

586
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,155
tough in the fight.

587
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:28,390
She's just a friend,

588
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,058
the one friend I have,

589
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,594
since my last friend blew himself up.

590
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:33,695
Care for a little advice?

591
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:36,264
From a dead guy? No.

592
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:39,734
Don't let the new girl
rope you into her death wish.

593
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,771
This whole sacrificing
yourself for your friends thing

594
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:46,074
isn't as fun as it sounds.

595
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,176
Trust me.

596
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:07,496
What the hell?

597
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:10,432
Sara, stay out of the library.

598
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,608
How you feeling?

599
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,643
I'm all right.

600
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:23,211
Look, I know you've
been through a lot,

601
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,847
but we really need to
talk about the aberration

602
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,817
that you caused.

603
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,719
Perhaps some other time.

604
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,291
-What were you doing in here, anyways?

605
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,027
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
- I speak six languages, why...

606
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,729
Stein's about to kill
Sara in the library.

607
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:42,011
With the rope or the candlestick?

608
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:43,698
Guys, I'm serious.

609
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,667
Somehow, the speedster's
disguised himself as Stein,

610
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,102
and he's turning over the whole ship.

611
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,490
- I'll suit up.
- I know how to get Sara

612
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,572
away from fake Stein.
What about that speedster gun?

613
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:52,507
Yeah, I'm already on it.

614
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,509
Martin, you've been
acting pretty different

615
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,845
ever since Darhk tortured you.

616
00:30:56,847 --> 00:31:00,282
Did they offer you a
deal like they did me?

617
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:02,817
Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?

618
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,886
My daughter?

619
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:07,455
Sara, uh, Jackson and
I were just on the bridge,

620
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,057
and, um...

621
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,760
He wanted to talk to
you about ship stuff.

622
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:13,395
Ship stuff?

623
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:15,096
Yeah.

624
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:17,365
Okay.

625
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,267
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.

626
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:20,702
Jax can wait.

627
00:31:20,704 --> 00:31:22,571
Since when do you call him Jax?

628
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,072
Actually, it's, uh, it's pretty urgent.

629
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:25,774
We should go now.

630
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,108
Okay.

631
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:54,603
My speedster weapon.

632
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:56,171
Impressive.

633
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:00,575
Unfortunately for you,
the effects are only temporary.

634
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:02,477
What did you do with Stein?

635
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:05,580
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy
worrying about him right now.

636
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:08,249
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

637
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:10,218
In a rush to die, are we?

638
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,320
I wasn't talking to you.

639
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:20,662
He's headed towards the bridge, come on.

640
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:22,631
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

641
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,800
What the hell is he doing in there?

642
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,902
Cloaking shield disengaged.

643
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,903
That's not good.

644
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,172
Cargo bay door now opening.

645
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,074
That is definitely not good.

646
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,078
Tear the ship apart.

647
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,247
Kill anyone you find.

648
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,558
The speedster just locked
himself inside the bridge.

649
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
Great, so we got him trapped.

650
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:54,095
Call me an optimist.

651
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,563
And by the sound of it,
he's letting his buddies

652
00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:56,531
onto the ship.

653
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:11,613
Guys, could use a little help here.

654
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,815
Okay, Nate and I will
help Sara hold them off.

655
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,884
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?

656
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,419
Well, he's after to amulet,
so all we have to do

657
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,754
is just keep him in the bridge...

658
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,592
What are you doing?

659
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:26,628
Capone's men are taking over the ship.

660
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:32,167
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.

661
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:33,435
Rex's killer?

662
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,606
He's tossing the ship.
He's looking for the amulet.

663
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,109
It's only gonna be a matter
of time before he finds it.

664
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:43,378
Then how do we stop him?

665
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,180
What would a criminal do?

666
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:46,247
Run.

667
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,719
Steel-up.

668
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:01,329
Isn't that just like a thug?

669
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,798
Brings a Tommy gun
to an ion blaster fight?

670
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:10,772
Ah, yeah.

671
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,342
Hey, I stole that fair and square.

672
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:18,813
This belongs to me.

673
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:19,814
Surprise.

674
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:37,365
Eliot taught you well,

675
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,567
but unless you hand over the amulet,

676
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:41,803
I'm gonna have to teach
you a few new lessons.

677
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:44,672
Those who cannot do teach.

678
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,162
I remember you.

679
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:12,133
You're here because I killed
that moronic leader of the JSA.

680
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:15,637
Mr. Rex Tyler was it?

681
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,938
Aah!

682
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,656
Don't worry,

683
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:37,058
you'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.

684
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:42,197
Lucky girl.

685
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,504
I gave you an out.

686
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:53,741
Not just a chance to survive,
but to live a better life.

687
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:55,577
I already found a better life.

688
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,744
One without you in it.

689
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,556
But what about your friend, Martin Stein?

690
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,124
Where is he?

691
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,693
Aah!

692
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:14,796
My dear, that information
comes at a cost.

693
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,769
Don't look so glum, professor.

694
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,505
You'll be in good company at
the bottom of this here river.

695
00:36:28,507 --> 00:36:31,074
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops,

696
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:33,844
they've all run afoul in my organization,

697
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:35,412
but you...

698
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:37,914
I've never had to whack a professor before.

699
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,384
Guess I'm moving up in
the world, hey, boys?

700
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:54,031
The speedster, how did
you manage to defeat him?

701
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:56,533
I didn't. I made him a counter-offer.

702
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,437
I gave him the amulet.

703
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:05,142
I still don't understand.
The last thing I remember

704
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:08,045
was getting off the train.
Everything else is a blur.

705
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:09,780
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.

706
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:12,482
After our investigation,
we concluded you were kidnapped

707
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:15,519
by an imposter, some idiot

708
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:17,854
posing as you trying
to bring down Capone.

709
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,489
The gentleman who was impersonating you

710
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:21,425
was trying to do the right thing.

711
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,181
Luckily, he found some
useful information.

712
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:26,050
- What's this?
- Everything you need to know

713
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:27,818
to take down Capone.

714
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,987
If you look closely,
you'll find some discrepancies

715
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,622
in his bookkeeping.

716
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,857
You expect me to believe that Al Capone

717
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,094
is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?

718
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:38,829
Sounds screwy.

719
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:41,665
Actually, it'd make a pretty
good movie one day.

720
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:48,839
You know, if this is the week
the Feds get Capone's ledger,

721
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,141
why does it take four more
years for them to take him down?

722
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,978
Because it's the federal government.

723
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,052
Now that's the Mick Rory I remember,

724
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:04,355
always thinking with his stomach.

725
00:38:04,357 --> 00:38:06,090
Shut up.

726
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:08,092
Who are you talking to?

727
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,560
Nobody.

728
00:38:09,562 --> 00:38:12,563
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.

729
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,001
That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?

730
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,169
I got gothick head.

731
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,305
What's that?

732
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:23,974
A little present for keeping me alive,

733
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:27,945
and for helping me almost get Rex's killer.

734
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,480
Open it.

735
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:36,653
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.

736
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:39,423
You stole it.

737
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,691
You were right.

738
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,561
The bad guys really do have more fun.

739
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:47,965
Not that you're a bad guy.

740
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:51,435
I hope it was worth it.
All this for a kiss on the cheek

741
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:54,538
and a cheap bottle of booze.

742
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,808
That speedster could've killed you, Mick.

743
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,677
What then?

744
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,880
I'll be dead like you.

745
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:11,088
My evil doppelganger left quite a mess.

746
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,657
It'll take me weeks to
reorganize my notes.

747
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:15,392
Well, it's good to have you back,

748
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,295
- the real you.
- Well, thanks to your efforts.

749
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:23,867
Though, I have to say I'm a bit puzzled.

750
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:26,437
Predicting history is
our team's raison d'être,

751
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:30,040
yet you traded the amulet to our enemies,

752
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,809
a choice which will no doubt have

753
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:34,044
countless repercussions on history.

754
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:35,813
I'm starting to think that

755
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:39,149
maybe some things are more
important than history.

756
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:42,786
You know, you, me, and this team...

757
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:44,521
We're a family,

758
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:48,392
a messed up one, but still a family.

759
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:49,927
I might not be able to save Laurel,

760
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,931
but I can protect this family,

761
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,267
and that includes yours.

762
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,704
What's her name?

763
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,539
Lily.

764
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,575
Lily.

765
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,643
It's a beautiful name.

766
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,692
We should leave soon.

767
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:12,349
You're certainly in a
hurry to get out of 1927.

768
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,817
Not your concern, Malcolm,

769
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,752
particularly now that we
have what we came for.

770
00:40:15,754 --> 00:40:17,488
Well, now that we have the matching set,

771
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:19,667
do you care to tell us why we
went through so much trouble?

772
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:21,792
Well, they are not a matching set.

773
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,528
In fact, they are not a they.

774
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,829
They are an it.

775
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:27,498
It's an amulet in two pieces.

776
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,067
I knew that you were more than
just a pretty face, Malcolm.

777
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:39,209
Wow, it's a portable planetarium.

778
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:40,544
It's a compass.

779
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:42,946
Compasses generally find things.

780
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:45,549
Indeed. Have either of you gentlemen

781
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:47,584
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

782
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:49,720
Yes, it was a spear
that was reportedly used

783
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:52,723
to penetrate the sight of Christ
after he died on the cross.

784
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:57,261
And now it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

785
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:59,263
So, how do we find it?

786
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:01,732
Well, it's complicated,
but the first step

787
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:04,234
is with the person that
Mr. Darhk met briefly

788
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:07,604
in New York. You remember
Captain Rip Hunter?

789
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,381
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!

790
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,385
Cut!

791
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:30,527
Yeah, I told you idiots to
move these garbage cans.

792
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:36,066
Can we try to...
To get this right, people?

793
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:39,036
I don't wanna be here all night.

794
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:46,376
Am I talking to myself? Today!

795
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:59,010
