1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,122
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,807
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,406
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,885
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,483
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,208
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,169
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,402
It isn't a honeymoon without mai tais.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,086
- Ronnie!
- Caitlin, whatever happens...

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,287
Ronnie!

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,569
I wanted him to be my husband.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,123
I have watched you be in love with Iris since
you were old enough to know what love is.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,845
He killed my mom.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,601
Hello! Hello there.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,125
There's only two boxes left.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,802
At this rate, we'll be finished by Easter.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,290
Don't even.

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,450
Okay, the only red-suited dude
I want in this house right now...

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,602
...is Kris Kringle, you got it?

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,085
Uh, these ornaments
are not gonna hang themselves.

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,810
Grandma Esther's recipe.

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,804
- Light on the bourbon.
- Thank you.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,891
I always loved her definition of "light."

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,205
And the Christmas tradition continues.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,164
Detective West. Yeah?

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,641
All right.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,330
Sorry, kids.
DA wants to ask me some questions.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,051
Make sure there's nog left
when I get back.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,611
No promises.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,442
- What's happening?
- Heh.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,965
Come on!

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,964
Come on. We're doing this already?
Christmas isn't for a few days.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,691
- I couldn't wait any longer. Here.
- Agh. Okay.

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,241
Oh, wait! Me first. Heh.

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,766
- My mother's wedding band?
- A replica, yeah.

38
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,207
You were devastated
when you lost the real one.

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,840
- Our fifth grade field trip to the zoo.
- To the zoo.

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,326
You cried for weeks.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,171
Here.

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,321
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,290
Steel trap.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,567
I don't know what to say. Oh.

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,281
- My gift sucks in comparison, by the way.
- No.

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,401
- All right!
- Heh-heh.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,645
It's supposed to be the best on the market.
I thought you could use a new one.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,768
- It's lame, I know.
- No!

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,684
No. This is great. I love it.

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,444
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,369
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Barry.

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,127
Nice ring.

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,691
It's beautiful, isn't it?

54
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,850
It's an exact replica of my mom's.
Barry got it for me.

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,130
Very thoughtful, Bar.

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,691
- So are we tree-trimming?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,005
Come on.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,650
Merry Christmas.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,601
Just a small token of my gratitude
for everything you guys have done for me.

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,163
I think I speak on behalf of my colleagues
when I say you've been a gift for us, Barry.

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,367
What's that?

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,888
This is compliments of Iris.

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,162
Grandma Esther's famous eggnog.

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,243
That's what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,041
Ahem. Maybe later for me.
Wouldn't wanna drink and drive.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,801
- Did I say something wrong?
- No.

67
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,530
No, man. He, um...

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,601
This used to be his favorite time
of the year...

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,481
...but the accident happened before
Christmas, so it ruined the holidays.

70
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,087
I'm gonna go get him a present.
Maybe that will cheer him up.

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,447
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,968
What are you doing for Christmas, Cisco?

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,722
The fact I asked you for your shirt size
should in no way indicate...

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,168
...that I am getting you something
shirt-related for Christmas.

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,369
Barry seemed a little odd today.

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,327
I'm pretty sure he wasn't psyched
I came by.

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,448
You ever think...

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,285
...he maybe might...

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,761
...like you?
Oh. What?

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,764
- No.
- Friends don't give friends wedding bands.

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,810
He wasn't...
He wasn't proposing to me, silly.

82
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,042
He and I are just best friends.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,730
Well, then he won't be bothered by this.

84
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,607
A bit early...

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,840
...but I couldn't wait.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,760
I figured, we'd been together a year now.

87
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,971
You pretty much stay there most nights,
anyway.

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,091
I love you.

89
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,291
- That's a yes, I take it.
- Heh.

90
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,411
It was that
or Stephen Hawking's new autobiography...

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,370
...and we both know how he feels
about Hawking.

92
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,044
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye, Cisco.

93
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,363
- Merry Christmas, doc.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

94
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,091
And to you.

95
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,562
Hey, doc, I know it's a big secret,
but can you give me a hint?

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,206
What exactly are you
working on in there?

97
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,691
The future.

98
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,650
Doctor, get inside. Lock down the facility.

99
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,526
H9)'-

100
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,920
What are you thinking?

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,449
The blood-splatter patterns
and trajectory of the remains...

102
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,046
Only a high-speed collision
could have done this.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,090
But to cause this type of damage
to a human in this space?

104
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,846
Whatever hit them
would have to have been moving fast.

105
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,285
Get this.

106
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,762
The witness says all he saw was a blur.
Sound familiar?

107
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,641
You saw a blur? What was it?

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,527
Whatever it was,
it was looking for something.

109
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,125
What did it look like?

110
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,369
Agh. Like a man...

111
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,488
...in some kind of yellow suit.

112
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,407
Okay.

113
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,764
I have to check my files.

114
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,645
Joe, you heard him.
The man that killed my mom, he's back.

115
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,724
I know.
He's been in town for a few weeks now.

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,769
He paid a visit to me at the house.
He took the evidence from your mom's case.

117
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,491
- Why wouldn't you tell me this sooner?
- I couldn't.

118
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,730
- Why?
- Because he threatened to kill Iris.

119
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,602
The witness described seeing a yellow blur.
Just like the one that killed Barry's mother.

120
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,684
Then we need to get cracking
and stop this speed psycho.

121
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,207
That... I wasn't trying to give him a name.

122
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,967
The crime scene at Mercury Labs
was on a floor with highly secured vaults.

123
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,489
- Witness said he was looking for something.
- He wanted it badly enough to kill for it.

124
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,404
What do you know about Mercury Labs?

125
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,282
Mercury was one of S.T.A.R. Labs' major
competitors until our little setback...

126
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,444
...and then it catapulted to the forefront,
led by...

127
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,847
...Dr. Christina McGee,
brilliant but egocentric physicist.

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,131
It says here, Dr. McGee has secured half
a billion dollars in private funding...

129
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,808
...to develop, and I quote, "prototypes
for the technology of the future."

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,041
Well, I'll be...

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,525
Tina's messing with tachyons.

132
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,207
- Superluminal particles.
- Of course.

133
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,045
So, what could someone do
with one of those...?

134
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,009
- Tachyons.
- Thank you.

135
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,166
Well, I don't know. Become invincible.

136
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,723
If you could devise a matrix stable enough
to harness their power, you could...

137
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,091
- ...travel faster than light.
- He's gonna try again.

138
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,891
We need to get what Mercury has
and use it as a lure.

139
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,691
Exactly right.
Cisco, Caitlin, start engineering a trap.

140
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,205
- You got it.
- Of course.

141
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,731
Thanks.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,687
Iris.

143
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,329
Caitlin. What are you doing here?

144
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,007
- Oh. It's been a long day.
- It's only noon.

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,283
- I didn't sleep much last night.
- Well, me, either.

146
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,489
Um, so I was catching up on your blog...

147
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,488
...and this story caught my eye about a man
whose head and hands burst into flames.

148
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,130
- The burning man.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,763
I haven't updated that story in a while, but
there are some reports I could send you.

150
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,843
That'd be great. Thank you.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,411
Can I ask you something?

152
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,166
- Girl to girl?
- Sure.

153
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,130
Barry's been acting different
around me lately.

154
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,011
Like he's keeping
some sort of secret from me.

155
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,691
Is there anything that you know about
that I should know about?

156
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,321
Not that I can think of.

157
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,405
However, if you feel like
Barry's keeping something from you...

158
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,642
...you should probably
just ask him yourself.

159
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,043
Yeah. Thanks.

160
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,251
Of course.

161
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,565
- Yes, I need some caffeine.
- Okay.

162
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,245
- Barry Allen. Thank you for coming in.
- Dr. Tina McGee.

163
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,801
I assume this is about
last night's break-in?

164
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,291
Yes and no.

165
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,807
That's usually how things are
with you, Harrison.

166
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,725
Whoever broke in was after
one of your prototypes.

167
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,486
You'll have to narrow that down.
We have hundreds of projects.

168
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,081
One containing tachyonic particles.

169
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,525
We've had encouraging success
with tachyons, yes...

170
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,368
...but there's still a significant gap between
our prototype and any real-life application.

171
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,048
We were hoping you would lend us
your prototype to use as a lure.

172
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,164
Us? You're assisting
the police now, Harrison?

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,561
I'm a consultant on this particular case.

174
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,566
Listen, once this man is apprehended
your prototype will be promptly returned.

175
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,566
You know nobody wants to ensure
the future's technology more than me.

176
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,807
I appreciate the C.C.P.D.'s concerns,
Mr. Allen...

177
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,521
...but Mercury is quite capable
of protecting its own assets.

178
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,563
Good luck with your manhunt.

179
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,567
Hey, Caitlin, check this out.

180
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,122
I think we can fashion
an electronic barrier. Right?

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,245
We set up a ton of super capacitors,
we smooth out the inflection points...

182
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,848
...and voilé, a kick-ass force field
to trap the Opposite Flash.

183
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,046
That was me testing out a name. Heh.

184
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,440
What do you think?

185
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,004
Are you okay?

186
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,323
Ronnie's alive.

187
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,369
I saw him, Cisco.

188
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,161
- I think he was following me...
- Caitlin.

189
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,325
Ronnie died.

190
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,885
He was vaporized in the accelerator
when it went critical.

191
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,728
Ronnie's alive,
and he's out there, alone and scared.

192
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,448
And I need your help to find him.

193
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,410
Ouch.

194
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,248
- Your bruise is already healing.
- Still hurts, though.

195
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,482
Not for much longer, honey.

196
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,682
Here, come on.

197
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,970
I'll keep the light on for you.

198
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,884
Were you ever afraid of the dark?

199
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,329
If I turn this light off now,
would you be scared?

200
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,566
- No.
- That's because I'm here with you.

201
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,724
See, you're not afraid of the dark, Barry.

202
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,242
You're afraid of being alone in the dark.

203
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,051
And that goes away
when you realize something.

204
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,010
You're never really alone.

205
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,485
Time for bed.

206
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,042
- I'm thirsty.
- Ah, now you're stalling.

207
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,248
But I got you covered, buddy.

208
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,526
Good night, slugger.

209
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,686
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

210
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,730
You can turn off the light.

211
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,045
Mom! Mom!

212
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,010
Nora!

213
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,530
Barry! Heh.

214
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,363
I called your name, like...

215
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,004
Your mom's case.

216
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,288
I used to study this board every day.

217
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,928
Lately, I haven't looked at it
as much as I should have.

218
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,204
I didn't know you did that.

219
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,924
I guess there's still some stuff about me
you don't know.

220
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,565
Eddie asked me to move in with him.

221
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,411
I said yes. Heh.

222
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,888
Wow. Heh.

223
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,882
You guys are moving pretty fast, huh?

224
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,485
Well, I mean, it's been a year.

225
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,080
Eddie thought you might
feel weird about it. Heh.

226
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,967
Well, I don't...

227
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,244
Why would he say that?

228
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,891
He thinks that you like me.

229
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,201
Romantically.

230
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,206
I mean, honestly,
it sounds even silly suggesting it.

231
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,771
Um...

232
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,241
Eddie's wrong.

233
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,042
And if I've seemed weird before,
it's just that...

234
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,410
...this year has gone by really fast...

235
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,406
...and I didn't realize how far along
in your relationship you were.

236
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,285
L-leh-

237
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,325
That's what I told him.

238
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,850
Well, I guess I should get going.

239
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,201
Bye.

240
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,564
It was you.

241
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,208
You were the one in my house that night.

242
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,848
You killed my mother!

243
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,490
Why?

244
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,642
If you wanna know that...

245
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,726
...you're gonna have to catch me.

246
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,724
Not fast enough, Flash.

247
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,531
- Who are you?
- You know who I am, Barry.

248
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,164
I don't know who you are.

249
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,206
But you do, Barry.
We've been at this a long time, you and I.

250
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,408
But I'm always one step ahead.

251
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
It is your destiny to lose to me, Flash.

252
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,931
Just as it was your mother's destiny
to die that night.

253
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,171
He acted like he knew me,
like we'd done this before.

254
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,890
He was antagonizing you, Bar.

255
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,806
I would get close, and he'd pull away.
This was just some sick game to him.

256
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,924
You'll catch him, we'll help.

257
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,924
No, you don't get it, all right?
His speed, it's beyond me.

258
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,122
I'm not the fastest man alive. He is.

259
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,610
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

260
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,207
The beautiful thing about force fields
is they're impervious to speed.

261
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,567
We're almost finished
fabricating the trap.

262
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,564
All that remains is for Detective West
to procure the bait.

263
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,364
I'm on it.

264
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,765
Barry, why don't you stay here?

265
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,129
No, Joe, today is not the day
to tell me to stay behind.

266
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,050
If the judge was gonna sign this,
he would've done so already.

267
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,885
You don't want this investigation to get
any more public than it's already been.

268
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,729
This has Harrison Wells written all over it.
I am not giving you my tachyon prototype.

269
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,925
It was quite the tour
of your facility, doctor.

270
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,726
You were fine
to let us dumb cops walk around...

271
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,008
...but I majored in physics
and chemistry...

272
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,528
...and I saw a lot of stuff that
Science Showcase Magazine would love.

273
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,720
So should I call their editors directly,
or just leave a few posts on their website?

274
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,723
You'll have the device within the hour.

275
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,009
I see why Harrison holds you in such
esteem, Mr. Allen. You're very much alike.

276
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,850
Nicely done.

277
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
- Hey, Joe, you got a second?
- Not now, Eddie.

278
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,451
I read the witness statement.
The Flash was there.

279
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,491
- I know you got something in the works.
- Yeah, but you don't want any part of this.

280
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,928
I got a task force approved to capture him,
and I want in.

281
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,523
I'm not asking permission, Joe.

282
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,727
Excuse me?

283
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,288
If my task force isn't part of this,
I'll go to Captain Singh.

284
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,365
I'll tell him something's going on
and you're not talking. I'm sorry.

285
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,727
You'd do the same thing if you were me.

286
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,087
Fine.

287
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,446
We follow the ionized particles,
and that should lead us right to him.

288
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,126
The CPM's are increasing.

289
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,400
We should have told Dr. Wells and Barry.

290
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,166
No, not until we're sure it's him.

291
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,606
Oh, wow.

292
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,760
Look, Ronnie is not
like you remembered him.

293
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,442
- What does that mean?
- Just don't freak out when you see him.

294
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,366
Oh, I really wish that was
because the batteries are dead.

295
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
Ronnie?

296
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,926
Ronnie.

297
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,890
It's me, Cait.

298
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,644
Look, I brought Cisco with me.
We're here to help you.

299
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,082
You were in an accident.
Do you remember?

300
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,686
I'm not Ronnie.

301
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,804
Yes, you are. You're Ronnie Raymond.

302
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,043
I'm not Ronnie. I told you that.

303
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,804
Now get away from me.

304
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,687
Look, we need to take you back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

305
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,888
We'll help you remember who you are.

306
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,810
- Agh!
- Firestorm.

307
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,562
The tachyon device is in place.

308
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,690
- You think it'll work?
- It'll work.

309
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,571
So how do we advertise to him
that the prototype's here?

310
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,563
We'll take care of that.

311
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,681
What's the problem?

312
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,689
Look, Barry...

313
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,411
...me and Dr. Wells have spoken...

314
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,442
...and we think it would be best
if you weren't here for this.

315
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,284
What are you talking about?

316
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,484
- You're too close to this.
- Maybe you're not close enough.

317
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,450
If you hadn't been too scared
and warned me weeks ago...

318
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,568
...I could have been prepared for this.

319
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,530
I think we can all appreciate
Joe's concern for Iris, Barry.

320
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,843
That's why I have to be here.
I'm the best chance at catching him.

321
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,122
Not right now, not in this state.

322
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,851
This man stabbed my mother through the
heart and sent my father to prison for it.

323
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,968
This is my fight.

324
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,804
Not today, son.

325
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,245
Caitlin...

326
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,329
...don't worry.

327
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,050
H9)'-

328
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Now that we know he's out there,
we will find Ronnie again.

329
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,571
Why?

330
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,560
So we can throw him in there
with all the other metahuman psychos?

331
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,842
I used to play this game in my head.

332
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,885
What would I give up
forjust one more minute with him?

333
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,091
My house, my career...

334
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,768
...the rest of my life?

335
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,886
Today I finally got that minute.

336
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,042
And I wish I hadn't.

337
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,327
Seeing him like that, what he's become...

338
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,804
Dear God...

339
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,246
...I wish he had just died that day.

340
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,450
Merry Christmas, slugger.

341
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,602
Merry Christmas.

342
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,210
You all right, Barry?

343
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,522
I screwed up, Dad.

344
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,565
After years of searching...

345
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,444
...I finally found him.

346
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,051
I found the man who killed mom.

347
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,206
The man in yellow,
the one in the lightning.

348
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,607
He's out there, and I had him.

349
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,930
He got away.

350
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,807
I was so close.

351
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,844
I promised you
that I would get you out of here.

352
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,001
Every day you spent in here
has been because of him.

353
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,128
Until today.

354
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,724
Now you're in here because of me,
and I'm so sorry.

355
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,405
Barf)'-

356
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,926
Barf)'-

357
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,123
This is not your fault.

358
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,286
Look at me.

359
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,362
I know what you've given up.

360
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,603
Every decision you've made the past 14 years
has been because of me and your morn.

361
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,527
What you studied, why you became a CSI,
even with Iris.

362
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,330
- Iris?
- You're my son.

363
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,324
You don't think I know how you love her?

364
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,082
But you never pursued her.

365
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,889
You were too consumed with
what had happened to me and your mom...

366
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,530
...to let yourself have a life.

367
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,802
Well, let it go now, Barry.

368
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,086
Hear me now.

369
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,922
The man in the yellow suit...

370
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,244
...he's taken enough from us already.

371
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,606
Don't let him take any more.

372
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,531
Hey.

373
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,286
Just in time. I am almost done.

374
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,450
Agh. Are there awards for tree-trimming?
Because this is award worthy.

375
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,531
Are you okay, Bar?

376
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,201
I love you, Iris.

377
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,488
Oh, I love you too.

378
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,048
When we were kids, I loved you before
I even knew what the word love meant.

379
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,650
And then my morn died, and I had
to go live with the girl I had a crush on.

380
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,489
Look...

381
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,641
...there were so many times
that I wanted to tell you.

382
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,404
Junior prom,
when I went away to college...

383
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,882
...when I came back from college,
nights that we stayed up talking...

384
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,361
...all the birthdays, all the Christmases.

385
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,241
But I never did. I just... I kept it in.

386
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,841
After I lost my mom and my dad...

387
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,886
...I was afraid
that if you didn't feel the same way...

388
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,690
...I would lose you too.

389
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,246
That's the irony.
I was so scared of losing you that I did.

390
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,484
I know I've had our whole lives
to tell you this...

391
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,321
...and you're with Eddie now, and I know
my timing couldn't be any worse...

392
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,806
...but I just...

393
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,525
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

394
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,524
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,005
Okay.

396
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,282
Sending out another pulse.

397
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,645
You certain this trap will work?

398
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,007
I've sent up three charges
in open satellite.

399
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,767
If anyone's looking for tachyonic
particles, they'll know we got them.

400
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,525
Let's see what we caught.

401
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,051
Cisco, lights.

402
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,248
Sure thing, Dr. Wells.

403
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,051
Detective Thawne?

404
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,367
Would you like to read him his rights?

405
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,531
Joe, what are you doing?

406
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,324
Getting some answers.

407
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,251
Fourteen years ago,
you murdered Nora Allen.

408
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,120
I wanna know why. Why?

409
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,320
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

410
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,161
What do you want
with the tachyonic particles?

411
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,766
My goals are beyond your understanding.

412
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,011
Oh, I don't know...

413
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,005
...I'm a pretty smart guy.

414
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,529
I knew you were exceptionally fast. Any trap
we manufactured would have to be invisible.

415
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,685
I knew your cells could repair themselves
at extraordinary speed...

416
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,890
...so you could withstand the damage
this is doing to your body right now.

417
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,290
The supercapacitors,
the containment field is fluctuating.

418
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,649
- They need to get out of there now.
- The reason I know all this...

419
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,124
...is because your powers are almost
exactly like those of the Flash.

420
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,760
Oh, I'm not like the Flash at all.

421
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,127
Some would say I'm the reverse.

422
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,684
Dr. Wells, evacuate. Get out of there now.

423
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,921
Dr. Wells!

424
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,089
Cisco, turn off the barrier!

425
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,005
That thing's gonna get out.

426
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,242
Cisco, he's gonna kill Wells!

427
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,085
Find him!

428
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,530
Don't move or we will shoot!

429
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,211
I warned you not to hunt me.

430
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,524
Barry!

431
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,405
Our race is not yet done.
See you soon, Flash.

432
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,080
Don't look for me again.

433
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,569
Why did it...

434
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,449
...not kill me?

435
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,203
I don't know, Eddie.

436
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,011
But you know more
than you've been telling me.

437
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,208
They're called metahumans.

438
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,809
Metahumans?

439
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,481
People with very powerful abilities.

440
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,482
You and me...

441
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,770
...are the only guys on the force
that know what's really going on.

442
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,647
And we need to keep it that way...

443
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,528
...so nobody else gets hurt.

444
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,963
Can you do that?

445
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,405
And the Flash?

446
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,444
Do you know who he is?

447
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,362
Yeah, I do.

448
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,122
He's the guy
that saved both of our lives tonight.

449
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,171
I've been going over the data. I don't know
why the containment system failed.

450
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,288
I must have missed something.

451
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,683
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, Cisco.

452
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,881
But if you both feel a need
to apologize for something...

453
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,203
...you might start with not telling me
that Ronnie is still alive.

454
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,167
I asked Cisco not to say anything.

455
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,602
Once I saw what Ronnie had become,
lneededun

456
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,930
I needed time to see
if I could make him whole again.

457
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,490
- I'm sorry. I know you're mad.
- No.

458
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,204
I don't know what I would have
done differently in your situation.

459
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,291
I know I've made you a lot of promises.

460
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,125
I know I've not been able to keep them all.

461
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,126
But on my life, I promise you this:

462
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,521
We will bring Ronnie home.

463
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,726
Hey, Ban

464
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,164
You know, my mom traveled
around the world twice.

465
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,043
She spent a semester abroad in Spain.

466
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,762
She loved it so much that after
she graduated she went to Europe.

467
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,209
Didn't stop till she'd been
to a few dozen other cities.

468
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,643
She always wanted to go back,
but she never got a chance.

469
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,649
I offered to send you abroad
when you were in college.

470
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,006
Yeah, I know, I remember.

471
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,922
I couldn't take off.

472
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,681
I mean, the truth is...

473
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,446
...I'm stuck here...

474
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,889
...in Central City.

475
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,602
Fear has kept me in that living room
for 14 years.

476
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,764
Joe, I'm...

477
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,208
I was mad at you for being scared.

478
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,726
But...

479
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,240
...I mean, the truth is,
I was the one that was scared.

480
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,605
I've been afraid of the
man in yellow for...

481
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,643
...my whole life.

482
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,727
That's why I lost.

483
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,008
When you first moved in with us,
I thought it was gonna be too much.

484
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,287
I'm already a single dad...

485
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,166
...finances were tough, and you were
a little boy who just lost his mother.

486
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,011
But, man, was I wrong.

487
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,286
Within two weeks you had changed
the dynamic of the house.

488
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,011
Suddenly the house was filled with this...

489
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,247
...light...

490
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,650
...this energy.

491
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,724
I mean, you brightened up everything.

492
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,288
You'd seen more darkness
than any man will in a lifetime...

493
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,647
...and you never let it dim your soul.

494
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,803
So there I was thinking that
I'm changing your life by taking you in...

495
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,050
...but the truth is...

496
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,801
...you changed mine.

497
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,848
So don't lose that light now, Bar.

498
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,161
The world may need the Flash...

499
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,207
...but I need my Barry Allen.

500
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,644
- Let's go home.
- Yeah.

501
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,651
- Hey!
- Hey.

502
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,371
- What are you guys doing here?
- I invited them.

503
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,406
Where's Dr. Wells?

504
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,961
Uh, he wasn't feeling up
to a social gathering...

505
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,327
...but he appreciated the invitation.

506
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,082
- Eggnog?
- Yes.

507
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,968
- Merry Christmas, Barry.
- You too, Eddie.

508
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,529
Hey, l...

509
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,846
I just wanted to say...

510
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,043
...I heard you're moving in together...

511
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,484
...and I'm really happy for you.

512
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,884
Thanks.

513
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,283
Merry Christmas. Heh.

514
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,525
Mm.

515
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,730
A day like today, Grandma Esther's eggnog
seems a little light on the bourbon.

516
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,567
- Hey, Joe.
- Mm?

517
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,923
- I saw something weird tonight.
- Yeah, Cisco, I saw it too.

518
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,164
No, I mean...

519
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,166
...when the Flash and the man in yellow
were going bumper cars on each other...

520
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,800
...I was watching the electricity
coming off of them.

521
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,923
Yellow and red electricity.

522
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,286
When Barry was a kid...

523
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,922
...he saw red and yellow lightning
in his house the night his mother died.

524
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,049
There were two of them.

525
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,528
The man in yellow
may have killed Barry's mother...

526
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,846
...but there was another speedster there
that night.

527
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,568
Dad, it's time.

528
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,562
Okay, let's see.

529
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,041
Merry Christmas.
