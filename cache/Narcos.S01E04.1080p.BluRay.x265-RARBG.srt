And so, unable to buy him
and unable to scare him,

93
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,814
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery,

94
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,816
and he wrote galan a letter.

The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galan.

102
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,800
But even if we indict these narcos

they're losing a war.

Since he couldn't get to galan,

Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

117
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,388
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

118
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,598
if no judge was willing to apply it.

had to be created.

For the first time
in the history of Colombia,

126

it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

[In Spanish] Defendants, please rise.

You've been tried and convicted

00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:13,846
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

In light of this terrorism,
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,911
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority, right?

136
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,413
Well, guess again.

137
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,375
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

138
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:47,087
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,347
Sorry, agent pena, but our resources
gotta be directed at america's problems,

00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,725
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,729
[Steve]
Communists. Remember them?

144
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,233
With Reagan in the white house,
it was hard to forget.

145
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,359
In his words:

They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

147
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,950
[Steve] The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing, always had been.

148
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,579
In Hollywood, he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

149
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,665
In Washington,
he created the Reagan doctrine,

150
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,418
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

151

Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

You want to turn on the tap

you'd better be chasing reds.

00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,472
Ambassador, if the CIA
and the mil group provide assets,

155
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,516
the Colombians will get Escobar.

156
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,644
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

157
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,355
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

158
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:51,527
The CIA agrees with mil group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

159
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,863
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker, and as such,

160
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,910
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

161
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:05,165
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

162
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,875
Let the Colombians get him.

163
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,046
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100,000

164
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,299
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah, it's a fucking joke.

165
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,194
That's about what he spends on shoes,
isn't it?

166
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,304
The cnp has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

167
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,806
So what do we do now?

168
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,392
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

169
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,063
[Steve] It's true,
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

170
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,899
But delivered into the right hands,
it could make a difference.

171
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,737
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia,
honorable men.

172
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,701
But the head of counternarcotics,
general jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em.

173
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,914
And as such,
he was exactly what we needed.

174
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,667
[In Spanish]
Thank you for seeing me, general.

175
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,377
You're welcome.

176
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,047
Listen, I have general Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

177
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:58,510
With all due respect, general jaramillo...
I propose horacio carrillo.

178
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,763
But carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

179
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,682
Well, I don't want him to follow.

180
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,184
I want him to lead.

181
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,275
Go ahead.

182
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,486
Yes, general.

183
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,697
As you wish.

184
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,948
Understood.

185
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,162
What happened, honey?

186
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,039
Things with work.

187
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,333
When will horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

188
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,295
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's out with the girlfriend.

189
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,383
Tell me what's wrong.

190
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,303
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

191
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,726
The ochoas aren't happy at all.

192
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,730
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man,

193
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,483
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

194
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,610
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

195
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,695
[Pablo] Hm.

196
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,200
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

197
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,202
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

198
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,955
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

199
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,874
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

200
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,795
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police, you know?

201
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,238
And most of all, to the top brass.

202
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,132
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

203
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,300
[Gustavo] Mm.

204
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,264
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

205
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,059
- [Birds squawking]

[Gustavo chuckles]

207

It took two years
to train them to stay there.

208
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,816
They cost me a million dollars.

Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

214
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,553
That's your problem, Pablo.

215
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,139
You think that everything
can be controlled,

216
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,725
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

Ok, ok, ok, Gustavo... ok. [Sighs]

Your English is really good.

Thank you. I took a course
at the university of antioquia.

How long you been at the comuna?

221

Just a few weeks.

Is your husband
gonna help us here, too?

223

I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

- How?

Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

228
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,057
No, jaramillo's sending a message.

He's telling me I got his price wrong.

230

He's setting carrillo up for failure,
and when he does fail,

231
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,857
he'll fire him for incompetence,

He had better resources
and better information.

he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,156
[Man] Yes, sir!

309
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,241
[Men chatter in Spanish]

310
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,050
What's wrong, Gustavo?

311
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,511
You fucked us, Pablo.

312
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,140
Not only you and me.

313
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,850
You fucked the whole family.

314
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,566
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to congress...

315
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,321
Since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

316
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,740
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

317
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,414
But what the fuck...

318
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,251
A man only dies once, right?

319
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,631
[Softly] Come here.

320
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,806
[Whispers] My brother.

321
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,443
[Pablo] I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

322
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,605
- [Engine powering]
- There we go.

323
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,743
[Steve] I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

324
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,287
on hacienda napoles for the last time,

325
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,750
he got our message...
And I hope it really pissed him off.

326
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,921
You may have 800 houses, my friend,
but none of them is home.

327
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,091
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life,

328
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,136
or until we catch you...
Or kill you.

329
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,721
From now on, nowhere is safe.

330
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,433
[Overlapping chatter in Spanish]

331
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,219
[Steve] The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

332
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,579
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

333
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,876
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

334
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:37,672
Hey, if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too.

335
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,676
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

336
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,554
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

337
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,140
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

338
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:53,313
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit,
I got very lucky.

339
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,109
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown medellin.

340
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,945
We raided it,
and guess who we found?

341
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,198
Blackbeard.

342
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,659
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

343
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,246
In custody,
he would describe a cocaine empire

344
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,167
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

345
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,045
Pablo was bigger than general motors.

346
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:21,466
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the palace of justice,

347
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,760
home of Colombia's supreme court,

348
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,387
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

349
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:32,185
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

350
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,645
[Whispers in Spanish] Fuck.

351
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,440
[Whispers in English] Fuck.

352
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,567
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

353
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,819
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

354
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,239
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

355
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,509
Javi, there's some good stuff in here,
stuff we can use.

356
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,701
[Javier]
None of it can leave the room.

357
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,579
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis mcpickle

358
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,499
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis mcpickle?

359
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,252
[Steve]
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

360
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,467
Take 'em.

361
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,638
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

362
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,682
What are you talking about?

363
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,226
[Whispers] Do you want to catch Pablo
or not? [Clears throat]

364
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,065
- [Softly] Why me?
- — [whispers] Because they'll suspect me.

365
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,609
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

366
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,403
They're not gonna
search a white boy, ok?

367
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,738
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

368
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,536
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

369
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,709
- [Steve] And sometimes, bad people...
- Sefior.

370
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,999
Help you do good things.

371
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,627
[Javier in Spanish] These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

372
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,756
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis mcpickle."

373
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,431
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

374
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,016
Obviously, it's an alias.

375
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,020
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis mcpickle." [Soft chuckle]

376
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,355
Because he's not Colombian.

377
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:04,944
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

378
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,779
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

379
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,950
- What's his name?
- — we don't know.

380
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:15,580
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "mcpickle."

381
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,710
Suarez, do you ever worry
what will happen to you

382
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,088
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

383
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,800
- I'm on your side. — yeah?

384
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:31,512
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about mcpickle?

385
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,306
[Sighs]

386
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,393
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

387
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:41,356
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

388
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,694
[Chats indistinctly in Spanish, chuckles]

389
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,822
Wha... what the fuck is this?

390
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,532
This is me giving you homework.

391
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,993
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

392
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,828
And I need you to find out who it is.

393
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,790
First off, I don't fucking work for you,
Murphy, you hear me?

394
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,751
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry seal?

395
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,297
What's he up to these days?

396
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,674
Barry seal.

397
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:18,059
[Steve] Barry seal, a good ol'
southern boy who loved college football,

398
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,812
mind-altering chemicals,
and pussy...

399
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,439
Which made him perfect CIA material.

400
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:27,735
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

401
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,530
Finding Barry was easy.

402
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,700
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

403
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,244
It just so happened
to be pefia's favorite, too.

404
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,972
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

405
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,415
[Laughing]

406
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,333
No, I'm serious.

407
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,711
[Steve] Look.

408
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:48,005
[Javier] Oh, my god.
That's freckles. I know her.

409
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,549
[In Spanish] Until next time.

410
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:56,055
- [In English] Goddamn, is that Barry?
- — or should we say mcpickle?

411
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,559
Come on, we got you a ride
waiting over here.

412
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,310
[In Spanish] Hi, Vanessa.

413
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,022
[In English] It's fun to say, though,
ain't it? "Mcpickle"?

414
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,735
[Javier clears throat]

415
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,446
Have a seat, Barry.

416
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:20,163
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

417
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,957
- Well, you guys ain't got shit.
- [Javier chuckles]

418
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,795
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from medellin to Louisiana

419
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,881
- to the tune of 500 tons?
— yeah.

420
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:34,677
Yeah? Well, let's see
if that holds up in court, huh?

421
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:38,473
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from medellin to Louisiana

422
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,266
without making a refueling stop.

423
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:43,686
Yeah, according to the records,
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

424
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,314
The manifests don't lie.

425
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:50,526
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine,

426
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,280
that would be considered treason
by the us justice department, wouldn't it?

427
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:58,242
Well, damn... [chuckles]
You guys are good.

428
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,660
Communist sympathizer.

429
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,746
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big, red bow

430
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,674
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

431
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,209
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments,

432
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,836
that's treason and trafficking.

433
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,297
What's that,
two life sentences for the price of one?

434
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,508
[Javier] That's right.

435
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:20,640
Well...
I figured this days might come.

436
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,768
Why don't you uncuff me, boys.
I got something to show you.

437
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:24,977
Yeah? What's that?

438
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,772
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

439
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:31,234
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on, uncuff me.

440
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,820
[Steve]
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

441
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:37,865
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

442
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:41,994
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was
governed by the communist sandinistas,

443
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,872
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

444
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,667
for cocaine shipments to the us.

445
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,796
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into america?

446
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,214
I couldn't have made that up.

447
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,177
- [Javier] Holy shit.
- [Steve] It was too good.

448
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,052
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait, wait, wait. No.

449
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,888
This leaks wide and Barry sea!
Is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

450
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,433
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

451
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,686
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

452
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,231
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

453
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,567
- You know, I wouldn'tjudge carrillo.
- Why is that?

454
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,153
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

455
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,791
[Steve] I always admired
pefia's commitment to informants,

456
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,961
but frankly,
Barry seal wasn't an informant.

457
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,921
He was just another busted trafficker

458
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,592
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

459
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,304
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

460
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,557
to get the resources we needed,
then fuck him.

461
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,976
Strange bedfellows, indeed.

462
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,813
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

463
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,982
Washington is gonna go crazy.

464
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,484
Thank you, ambassador.

465
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,906
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

466
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,115
Of course.

467
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,451
Thank you.

468
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:11,417
[Steve] In Washington, "highly classified”
didn't carry much water.

469
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:15,504
Especially when a marine colonel named
Oliver north got his hands on the picture.

470
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,507
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

471
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:23,012
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

472
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,265
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

473
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,602
This picture shows federico Vaughan,

474
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,522
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua,

475
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:38,569
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

476
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:43,866
No, there seems to be no crime
to which the sandinistas will not stoop.

477
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:47,203
[Steve]
Being a rat is a dangerous business,

478
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,413
and Escobar's reach was long.

479
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,124
Barry seal refused federal protection...

480
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,210
- [Automatic gunfire]
- [Grunts]

481
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,338
And met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

482
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,839
Whoops.

483
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,349
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

484
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,560
- You got Barry seal killed.
- — pena, if he wanted a long life,

485
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,397
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

486
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,233
I didn't kill him, Escobar did.

487
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,528
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

488
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,780
Look on the bright side, man.

489
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,742
[Steve]
From then on, according to Reagan,

490
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,287
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

491
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,000
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

492
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,044
The us southern command in Panama
sent us a care package:

493
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:41,549
Planes, helicopters,
you fucking name it. Everything.

494
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:50,766
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

495
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,396
and burn 'em straight to the ground,
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

496
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,524
We were kicking ass,
and the narcos were feeling it.

497
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:02,069
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

498
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,449
Despite all this, we'd yet
to net one of the medellin kingpins...

499
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,244
Till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether,

500
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,264
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

501
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,288
Got it!

502
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,460
[Steve] The barrel that we tracked
brought us to tranquilandia,

503
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:21,005
medellin's biggest processing lab,
and we hit it hard.

504
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,425
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

505
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,261
But in the end,
it got us our biggest victory to date,

506
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:31,640
the first of the medellin kingpins:
Carlos lehder.

507
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,810
[In English]
In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

508
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,896
Ten times this if you give me one hour.

509
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:41,400
[In Spanish] There's no way out,
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

510
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,531
[Steve] Lehder was immediately
extradited to the states,

511
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:53,079
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

512
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:58,292
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

513
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:03,422
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

514
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,842
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos galan,

515
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:11,180
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

516
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,599
Extradition would become his battle cry.

517
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,601
[Man in Spanish] Gentlemen?

518
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,646
Thank you.

519
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:23,734
[Steve] And for the narcos,
this was a declaration of war.

520
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,947
[Duque in Spanish]
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

521
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,243
But I have already presented a motion
before the supreme court of Colombia

522
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,996
against the legality of extradition.

523
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,001
They are examining it this week
at the palace of justice.

524
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,671
Can we buy someone in that court?

525
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,841
Unfortunately, no.

526
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:50,386
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

527
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,473
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

528
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,351
Brother... even after he's dead,

529
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,813
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

530
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,815
He's totally fucked.

531
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,525
This is gringo bullshit.

532
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:08,404
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

533
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,739
We're next, aren't we?

534
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,825
You're right.

535
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,827
Pablito?

536
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,412
Do you have an answer or what?

537
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:26,046
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

538
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,301
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

539
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,970
Carlos was one of us.

540
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,852
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

541
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,220
But remember,
there's something they want more than us.

542
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,399
So, brothers...

543
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,545
It's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

544
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,612
[Murmurs of approval]

545
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,365
[Ivan in Spanish] I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

546
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,744
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

547
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:01,207
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

548
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:06,587
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

549
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:10,382
Two million us dollars.

550
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,093
It's very dangerous.

551
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:18,057
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

552
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:22,978
And it goes without saying
that it will dangerous, right?

553
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,154
[Knocking at door]

554
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,741
[Pablo] But for us, brother...

555
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:40,329
It is our duty to fight to the very end.

556
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:45,042
We have a historical obligation.

557
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,004
- We can't forget that.
- [Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

558
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,714
[Elisa] I'm his girlfriend.

559
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,890
Meet Pablo Escobar.

560
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,978
Miss.

561
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,730
- Ok. — we have a deal.

562
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,232
All right, then.

563
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,485
We were just leaving.

564
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,903
Good night.

565
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,538
What the hell is this?

566
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,748
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

567
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,544
We made a deal...
Obviously for money.

568
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,338
In exchange for what?

569
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:35,968
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
icannotsay.

570
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:43,058
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

571
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:47,521
I fight for the people...
Not for drug traffickers.

572
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,455
[In English] Connie?

573
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,373
Elisa? What's going on?

574
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,768
- I need to talk to you.
- — about what?

575
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,794
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

576
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,936
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

577
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,215
About what?

578
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:19,386
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the m-19.

579
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,573
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's gonna be bad.

580
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,600
Wait, Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

581
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,228
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

582
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,772
And you need to hide me.

583
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,691
Ok. Come on.

584

Steve's already at work,
but Javi lives downstairs.

I just hope he's here.

- Well, what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

588
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,173
I'll be right back. Go.

589
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,906
- [Connie] She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

590
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,930
Hired guerrillas called m-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

591
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,310
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of m-19.

- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and m—19 guerrillas.

Escobar and m-19?

594

She didn't tell me any details,
just that it would be bad.

No... that doesn't make any sense.

596

She asked me to hide her,
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

600
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,173
Ambassador, I got information
with Escobar and m-19. I think they're...

- [Reporter] ...Supreme court building.
- — oh, my god.

602
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,887
[Steve] "Oh, my god" is right.

603
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:48,434
Financed by Escobar, the m—19 guerrillas
stormed the palace of justice

604
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,019
and occupied the supreme court.

605
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,314
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

606
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:58,068
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

607
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,820
But it was all bullshit.

608
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,156
The military attacked.

609
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,116
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage,

610

including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

611
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,289
Most of the m-19 were killed.

612
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:14,543
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

613
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:21,925
Setting fire to the room that contained
600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

614
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,679
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

615
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,270
In the United States,
the mafia makes witnesses disappear

616
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,355
so they can't testify in court.

617
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,819
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

[Reporter] The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

- Well, come on in.

00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,549
You, up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

624
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:03,926
Put the gun away.

625
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,094
Put it away.

626
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,306
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

- Can I say something?
- No, you may not.

628

Murphy... calm down.

629
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,899
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

630
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,151
Your wife brought her to me.

631
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,572
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife, I truly do,

632
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,759
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

633
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,702
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

634
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,959
If she can tie Escobar to the siege,
I say we bring her in.

635
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,627
Well, she's m-19.

636
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,088
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

637
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,422
and then she gets disappeared.

So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

Look, all she did was warn us.

She's not on anybody's radar.

642

She's not involved in anything.

This was Escobar, classic.
He's cut a deal with m-19.

Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

649

Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

650
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,506
He doesn't hold grudges,
not if it suits his purposes.

651
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,510
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.
