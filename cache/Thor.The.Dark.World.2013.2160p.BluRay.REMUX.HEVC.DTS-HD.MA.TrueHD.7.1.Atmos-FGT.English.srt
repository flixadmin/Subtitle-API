00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,259
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

664
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,511
All nine realms
are passing through each other

665
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,930
and gravity, light, and even matter,

666
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,642
is crashing from one world to the other.

667
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,898
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

668
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:35,486
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

669
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,489
This time, the Alignment

670
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,659
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

671
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,243
It's beautiful.

672
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,914
It's simple. Any questions?

673
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,085
Yeah.

674
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,296
Can I have my shoe back?

675
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,012
(KURSE SPEAKING
ELVEN LANGUAGE)

676
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:06,141
Heal. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether.

677
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,396
And when you wake, we will kill them all.

678
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,366
(SCREECHING)

679
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,974
TYR: Jane Foster?

680
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,811
You need to come with us.

681
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,190
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

682
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,734
Our artillery cannot detect them.

683
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,610
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

684
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,909
My king, we are all but defenseless.

685
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,955
She's your prisoner now?

686
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,667
Leave us.

687
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,845
I do not wish to fight with you.

688
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,097
Nor I with you.

689
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,099
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

690
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,476
ODIN: We possess the Aether.

691
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,436
Malekith will come to us.

692
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,521
Yes, and he will destroy us.

693
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,774
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

694
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,276
No, I value our people's lives.

695
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,654
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

696
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,616
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

697
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,785
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

698
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,661
And I will destroy it and him.

699
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,458
If you fail, you risk this weapon

700
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,418
falling into the hands of our enemies.

701
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,921
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

702
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,089
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

703
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,466
we would never even know it.

704
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
If and when he comes

705
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,971
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

706
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,515
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

707
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,558
As many as are needed!

708
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,729
Ah!

709
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,069
We will fight!

710
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,115
Till the last Asgardian breath.

711
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,953
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

712
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,208
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

713
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,751
(CHUCKLES)

714
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,005
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

715
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,147
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

716
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,149
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

717
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,110
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

718
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,153
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

719
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,198
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

720
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,743
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

721
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,745
NEWSCASTER: <i>Something else
went missing this week</i>

722
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,999
<i>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

723
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,711
<i>notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</i>

724
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,170
<i>streaked nude across...</i>

725
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,882
IAN: Darcy,
you really need to look at this.

726
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,133
Your friend, Erik...

727
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,968
What was his last name again?

728
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,389
<i>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</i>

729
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,516
<i>He was later taken into police custody</i>

730
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,519
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

731
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,646
<i>Police are still refusing to confirm...</i>

732
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,200
You were not at Odin's war council.

733
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,078
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

734
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,163
No one is to come

735
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,539
or to go.

736
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,419
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

737
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,214
What use is a guardian such as that?

738
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,427
Malekith will return, you know this.

739
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,056
I need your help.

740
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,226
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

741
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,978
I'm not asking you to.

742
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,606
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged

743
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,317
whether he is or not.

744
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,110
But he is blinded, Heimdall

745
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,946
by hatred and by grief.

746
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,697
As are we all.

747
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,990
I see clearly enough.

748
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,909
The risks are too great.

749
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,787
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

750
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,580
There is no other way.

751
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,795
What do you require of me?

752
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,423
THOR: <i>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</i>

753
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,761
<i>Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.</i>

754
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,726
<i>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</i>

755
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,521
<i>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</i>

756
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,775
<i>but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

757
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,820
We must move Jane off-world.

758
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,613
The Bifrost has been shut down

759
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,490
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

760
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:17,703
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

761
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,705
One, actually.

762
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,542
No.

763
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,174
Thor. After all this time

764
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,927
and now you come to visit me.

765
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,430
Why?

766
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,809
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

767
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,561
Loki, enough.

768
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,813
No more illusions.

769
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,072
Now you see me, brother.

770
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,207
Did she suffer?

771
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,002
I did not come here to share our grief.

772
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,172
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

773
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,883
Go on.

774
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,635
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

775
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,680
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

776
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,432
Vengeance

777
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,934
and afterward, this cell.

778
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,232
(CHUCKLES)

779
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,488
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

780
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,741
What makes you think
you can trust me?

781
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,242
I don't.

782
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,079
Mother did.

783
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,874
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

784
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,126
I did so with a glimmer of hope

785
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,087
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

786
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,174
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

787
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,386
You betray me, and I will kill you.

788
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,390
Hmm.

789
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,602
When do we start?

790
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,020
He will betray you.

791
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,730
He will try.

792
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,779
This is so unlike you, brother.

793
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,906
So clandestine.

794
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,200
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

795
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,911
If you keep speaking, I just might.

796
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,830
Fine. As you wish.

797
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,373
I'm not even here.

798
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,292
Is this better?

799
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,878
It's better company at least.

800
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:35,924
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

801
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,803
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

802
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,474
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

803
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,811
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

804
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,938
given that you seem
to like them so much.

805
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,524
Oh, this is much better.

806
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,608
Ooh.

807
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,653
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

808
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,113
But the confidence...

809
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,699
I can feel the righteousness surging.

810
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,243
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

811
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,911
Honor? Patriotism?

812
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
God bless Amer...

813
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,414
(GRUNTS)

814
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,041
What?

815
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,007
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

816
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,967
My dagger, something.

817
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,389
(METAL CLANGS)

818
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,724
At last.

819
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,517
A little common sense.

820
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,977
(CLICKING)

821
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,193
And I thought you liked tricks.

822
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,906
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

823
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,741
who will see you coming
from miles away.

824
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,534

01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,851
Did he say anything before he left?

1321
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:02,145
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

1322
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:06,357
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1323
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:12,238
Oh.

1324
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:19,620
ODIN: <i>You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.</i>

1325
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:20,705
<i>You were wrong.</i>

1326
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:25,168
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1327
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:28,379
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

1328
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:33,468
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1329
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,512
My life.

1330
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:40,349
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

1331
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,229
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

1332
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,607
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1333
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:51,861
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1334
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,615
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1335
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,158
It changes you.

1336
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,661
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1337
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:06,042
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1338
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,669
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

1339
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,216
This is not for Jane, Father.

1340
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,718
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1341
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:19,138
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

1342
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,598
It changes nothing.

1343
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:24,519
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

1344
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,563
another who will not take it.

1345
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,941
Is this my legacy?

1346
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,609
Loki died with honor.

1347
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:33,945
I shall try to live the same.

1348
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,488
Is that not legacy enough?

1349
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,793
It belongs to you.

1350
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,254
If you are worthy of it.

1351
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:53,881
I shall try to be.

1352
01:40:55,299 --> 01:41:00,054
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1353
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,640
I know.

1354
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,813
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1355
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,649
even that, I could not say.

1356
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,780
It would speak only from my heart.

1357
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,575
Go,

1358
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,202
my son.

1359
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,581
Thank you, Father.

1360
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,180
No.

1361
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,183
Thank you.

1362

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1363
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:06,615
I present to you,

1364
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,828
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1365
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,497
Whoa...

1366
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:21,130
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1367
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,927
You know why we're here.

1368
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,558
Of course.

1369
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,728
But, if I may ask,

1370
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,690
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1371
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:42,777
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1372
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,405
It is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.

1373
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,533
That's very wise.

1374
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,753
I can assure you,

1375
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:07,218
it will be absolutely safe here,

1376
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,931
in my collection.

1377
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:15,518
See that it is.

1378
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,580
One down.

1379
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:40,584
Five to go.
