1
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:03,149
The town of Green Hills.

2
00:00:03,184 --> 00:00:04,811
A nice, quiet place.

3
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:08,147
-Too quiet.
-This isn't the way to the library.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,802
I swore an oath
to return these sacred tomes,

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,763
or Maddie will be dishonored
with late fees.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,139
This is just a detour.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,599
Knuckles and Tails didn't know

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,851
something mysterious
was going on at the junkyard.

9
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,770
-Who are you talking to?
-I'm narrating.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,647
Cool heroes do it
in detective movies all the time.

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,857
I wish to narrate too.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,319
Knuckles was very handsome and strong.
Much stronger than Sonic.

13
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,988
And Tails was just excited to be included.

14
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,532
Tails's narration was weak and sad.

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,035
We're on an investigation.

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,496
Wade told me there've been
weird noises up here at night.

17
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,715
Upgrade, upgrade. Need to upgrade.

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,884
Unit must upgrade and conquer the world.

19
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,803
It's one of Robotnik's drones!

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,597
-It's been upgrading itself!
-No match for me.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,057
Biologicals detected.

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,189
-The sacred tomes!
-Guys, we need a plan.

23
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,691
Tails, you take up a flanking position.
Knuckles--

24
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,319
Knuckles pretended he was listening,
but he readied his attack.

25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,946
Are you still narrating? Wait!

26
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,532
Time for a Knuckles sandwich!

27
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,715
Let's go.

28
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,093
-Let's see how fast you are.
-No!

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,518
I'm above you!

30
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,021
Over here. Over here!

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,399
Got ya!

32
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,277
I hope this wasn't doing
anything important.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,486
Not yet.

34
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,448
My eyes.

35
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,492
Don't worry, Sonic. Tails to the rescue!

36
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,914
Oops.

37
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,127
Dr. Robotnik programmed Unit
to think for itself.

38
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,966
-Watch out.
-Most interesting.

39
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,719
-Right under us. It's right under us!
-Your speed is no match

40
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,138
for this unit's processing power.

41
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,806
Go left, go left!

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,975
Your left, not my left. Your left! No!

43
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,438
Oh, boy.

44
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,607
-Unit is victorious.
-Sonic!

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,941
Do something!

46
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,319
I would,
but somebody tied my legs together.

47
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,445
You can still talk.

48
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,864
How you doing?

49
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,492
Before you blow us up,
can I ask you a question?

50
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,411
No one has ever asked Unit
a question before.

51
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,580
-Most interesting.
-Just curious.

52
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
Why are you doing this?

53
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,417
Unit's programming
is to conquer the world.

54
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,919
That sounds like Robotnik.

55
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,629
You said you think for yourself.

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,965
-What are you really into?
-What does Unit like?

57
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,134
Well, you've got a real flair for design.

58
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,677
Do you make custom furniture?

59
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,265
Truthfully, Unit's passion is poetry.

60
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,309
So why don't you conquer the world
with poetry?

61
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,394
We'd love to hear one of your poems.

62
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,563
No, I couldn't possibly.

63
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,814
It's too personal.

64
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,566
But if you insist.

65
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,445
"It's Unit's ambition
to crush all opposition..."

66
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,782
"...melancholy fit shall fall,
sudden from heaven like a weapon cloud."”

67
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,201
"Poetic phrase number 73--"

68
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,829
Don't hurt him!

69
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,414
Knuckles, no! Stop!

70
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,917
I cannot hear you
over the sound of my mighty punches!

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,171
-Stop! Not everything requires punching.
-But I'm so good at punching.

72
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,256
Poor guy.

73
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,799
He wasn't trying to kill us anymore.

74
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,467
He was reciting a poem!

75
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,928
That poem was not my best.

76
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,806
-Thank you for the destructive criticism.
-You're okay!

77
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,599
Sonic, can we keep him?

78
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,017
I don't know.

79
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,311
He's not bad anymore.

80
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,689
He'd be your responsibility, Tails.

81
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,316
You gotta clean up after him
and change his batteries.

82
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,945
My battery will last one billion years.

83
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,072
I do not trust this trash bot.

84
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,366
He's an artist now. He's okay!

85
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,161
Soon Unit will master the poetic form
and the world will cower.

86
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,663
You will be the first to fall

87
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,874
before this unit's superior prose,
red meat thing.

88
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,626
Did you hear that? It's still evil!

89
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,337
I demand justice for Maddie's books.
Wait there!

90
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,673
Thus ends one adventure for Team Sonic.

91
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,800
But their greatest adventure
was just beginning:

92
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,803
The quest of picking up
some chili dogs on the way home.
