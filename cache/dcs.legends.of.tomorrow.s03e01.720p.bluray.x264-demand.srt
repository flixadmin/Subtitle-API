1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,202
<i>Last season
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,754
I am no longer the captain.
You are.

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,714
<i>Permission to depart, Captain Lance.</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,508
I know that I am supposed to
go back to 1942.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,338
<i>I have to believe that time
is stronger than that.</i>

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,888
It's a time quake.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,535
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,516
And whose bright idea was it to do

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,811
the one thing that could jeopardize
all of time?

10
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,933
Yours.

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,692
<i>Guys,</i>

12
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,144
<i>I think we broke time.</i>

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,473
<i>I guess this means
we're not going to Aruba.</i>

14
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,974
You said you broke time.

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,830
No, I said we broke time.

16
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,533
Yeah, but it was your idea.

17
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,537
No, my idea was to save reality
and save Amaya.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,542
By violating
the first rule of time travel:

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,544
never visit the same time
and place twice,

20
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,841
thereby breaking time.

21
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,446
Perhaps we should
continue this argument

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,822
somewhere there aren't dinosaurs.

23
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,087
Whoa! Big Ben.

24
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,181
<i>So what?</i>

25
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,349
- Guys?
- I've always wanted to visit it.

26
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,434
Guys!

27
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,432
Amaya, talk to it.

28
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,379
- She can talk dinosaur?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,403
Please speed up that conversation.

30
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,282
Y'all just saw that, right?

31
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,990
And that.

32
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,330
Well, you really have buggered
everything up this time.

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,911
Her idea.

34
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,253
No matter. As you can see,
my agents are already hard at work,

35
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,254
dealing with these anachronisms.

36
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,380
Anachronisms?

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,910
<i>People, places and things</i>

38
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,572
<i>displaced from
their native time periods.</i>

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,098
I told you, I was leaving to create
an organization

40
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,345
to replace the Time Masters.

41
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,972
Fifteen minutes ago.

42
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,428
For you.

43
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,638
Forming the Time Bureau

44
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,099
has been the work of
the last five years of my life.

45
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,898
I've gotten quiet good at it,
I have to say.

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,360
Meaning, you have Time Agents at work
in the Cretaceous Period as we speak?

47
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,334
Indeed. And throughout Los Angeles,
making sure no one retains any memory

48
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,411
of this <i>unfortunate</i> incident.

49
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,915
Which is why your services
are no longer required.

50
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,709
Whoa! What?

51
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,711
Seems only fitting,
since I was the one

52
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,862
who brought this team together,

53
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,406
that I should be the one
to disband it.

54
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,761
So,
on behalf of the Time Bureau,

55
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,389
I hereby relieve the Legends
from duty.

56
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,079
<i>This isn't auditions for</i>
American Ninja Warrior, <i>you know.</i>

57
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,912
And how many times have I told you
not to play with the merchandise?

58
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,080
<i>Oh, I know that look.</i>

59
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,546
It's the look of someone who thinks
they could've gotten a better job.

60
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,468
Well, let me
tell you something, freckles,

61
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,218
you're lucky I even hired someone
who'd been reported dead. Twice.

62
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,844
<i>Especially in this economy.</i>

63
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,887
What? No thank you?

64
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,820
Thank you.

65
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,577
That's better.

66
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,154
Now, get over to Health & Beauty.

67
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,744
Somebody just spilled a whole
mess of conditioner.

68
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,058
Alan...

69
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,932
Alan, um, I've had a breakthrough.

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,602
I've told you not to interrupt me
when I'm plugged in.

71
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,192
Yes, I know this is very important
to you, but, um...

72
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,395
Alan, I've been working
on a side project.

73
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,571
Not only have I managed to
shrink organic matter,

74
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,136
but I've also streamlined
the technology, so that you can wear...

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,492
I'm not interested, brah.

76
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,572
Look, I get it, once upon a time
you were Ray Palmer, tech mogul.

77
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,394
But when you give your company to
a woman who runs it into the ground,

78
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,660
you lose all side project privileges.

79
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,915
Great news for you, though,

80
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,525
what we're doing here at Upswipz,
is trying to change the world.

81
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,876
Upswipz is a dating app
just like Tinder, except

82
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,212
you swipe up, down,
instead of left, right.

83
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,888
Which is far more intuitive.

84
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,138
And Upswipz isn't a dating app.
It's a holistic social...

85
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,934
Networking platform.

86
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,182
But, Alan,

87
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,685
my miniaturization technology has
the potential

88
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,313
to actually
make the world a better place.

89
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,107
If that were true, it'd be an app.

90
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,448
If it doesn't live on a phone,
it's not the future, Ray.

91
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,873
I've actually been to the future.
Like, three times.

92
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,812
Damn it, Wally, what did I say?

93
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,395
Ah. I was supposed to save
some of the bad guys for you.

94
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,525
Just a few.

95
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,858
You know what, I'll make it up to you.
First round is on me.

96
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,990
No. Thanks, man, we're good.

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,640
Actually, I have a girl waiting for me.

98
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,160
Next time.

99
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,627
<i>Hey.</i>

100
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,716
Sorry I'm late.
It was kind of a work thing.

101
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,967
<i>- It's okay.</i>
- Um...

102
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,842
I know a really great coffee place...

103
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,224
Alana?

104
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,567
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>
- Hi.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,702
Hey, idiot.

106
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,745
Either refill my margarita,

107
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,667
or get outta my light.
This is a private beach.

108
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,455
Listen, pal, what I...

109
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,257
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

110
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,086
I am Gaius Julius Caesar of Rome.

111
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,260
Oh.

112
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,056
Thought I recognized you.

113
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,142
Knocked off one of your casinos
in Vegas.

114
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,811
I am here to conquer all
the known world.

115
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:42,643
Right. Wait a sec.
How did you get here?

116
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,229
I imagine through the mischief
of the goddess Ate?

117
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,861
But it matters not the land
I find myself in.

118
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,151
It's but a matter of time
before my banner flies over it.

119
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,285
Is that a fact?

120
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,455
Yeah.

121
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,091
<i>Boss.</i>

122
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,379
- Rory?
<i>- I got a situation.</i>

123
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,009
I think I bumped into
one of those mechanisms.

124
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,097
<i>- Mechanism?</i>
- A nagging-ism...

125
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,809
- Anachronism?
<i>- Yes.</i>

126
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,726
Julius Caesar is in Aruba.

127
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,815
<i>Seriously?</i>

128
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,560
Seriously. I got him tied up
in my casita.

129
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,853
What do you want me to do?

130
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,445
<i>Just sit tight, and keep him safe.</i>

131
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,384
If you screw up history, the Bureau
will be on your ass

132
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,094
before you can say...

133
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,654
Son of a bitch.

134
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,453
Are you taking a personal call
during peak consumer traffic?

135
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,787
No...

136
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,867
Because I quit.

137
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,552
All right. What's so important to make
you catch a train to Central City?

138
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,883
Where's Amaya?

139
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,763
We kind of broke up.

140
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,145
What?

141
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,892
It's not a big deal.
So, what's going on?

142
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,520
Rory found an anachronism.

143
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,569
Apparently, Julius Caesar
just wound up in Aruba.

144
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,029
Mick's got him all tied up.

145
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,574
This is our chance to get
the Time Bureau to deal us back in.

146
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,153
If we pull this off, Rip might
give us our old ship back.

147
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,156
Wow. I had no idea you were so
unhappy with your new life.

148
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:27,797
Are you kidding me? I'm loving it.
I'm doing really good work.

149
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,083
Says you work at Sink Shower & Stuff.

150
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,512
Yeah. Well, even vigilantes
have to pay their bills.

151
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,681
Mmm.

152
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,553
What are you guys so content with, huh?
What are you doing?

153
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,887
I'm doing pretty good,
thanks for asking. I am, uh...

154
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:49,190
The second-most
popular superhero in Central City.

155
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,487
So, that's pretty good.

156
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,361
Well, I'm the first-most popular
in Silicon Valley

157
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,660
when I'm not changing the world

158
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,454
with a holistic
social networking platform.

159
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,835
- Let's go.
- Thank God.

160
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,754
You sure this is where they're at?

161
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,682
I bumped into one of Rip's
Time Agents a while back.

162
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,055
He may have left his badge
at my place.

163
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,013
He left it at your place?

164
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,686
All right, maybe I lifted it off him
in the morning.

165
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,041
<i>Freeze!</i>

166
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,728
- Hands in the air.
- Eyes on! Eyes on!

167
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,833
<i>Hey! Don't move!</i>

168
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,877
<i>- Ugh.
- Stay right there!</i>

169
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,878
Hello, everyone, welcome.

170
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,592
On the floor.
Hands behind your heads.

171
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,844
Uh, sorry, there must be some
kind of mistake. We're the Legends...

172
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,766
Oh, we know exactly who you losers are.

173
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,064
Wow. This floor is, like, super clean.

174
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,396
Lady, why are you so mean?

175
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,483
Maybe it's that poly-blend pantsuit
that's got her so grumpy.

176
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,818
I didn't know Men's Wearhouse
gave group discounts.

177
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,640
What's wrong with you people?
Do you want to get shot?

178
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,744
Totally rather get shot than look
like a Sears model.

179
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,788
Hold your fire! Stand down, all of you.

180
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,043
Excuse me. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

181
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,719
Hello. It's so good to see you all.
Next time, just call ahead.

182
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,295
You son of a bitch.

183
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,176
Eyes on! Eyes on!

184
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,599
There's been a slight
misunderstanding, Dr. Heywood.

185
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,267
Nate, what are you doing?

186
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,935
I want to hear Rip say it.

187
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,056
You told Amaya to go back to 1942.

188
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,766
Amaya went back to 1942?

189
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,601
It was her idea.

190
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,155
She wanted to go back home
to Zambesi.

191
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,692
What did you just say?

192
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,492
It was Amaya's idea
to go back to Zambesi.

193
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,289
I heard him, Ray.
I was just being rhetorical.

194
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,118
All right, this is just awkward.

195
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,423
So, what brings the rest of you
to the Time Bureau?

196
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,716
We found an anachronism.

197
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,336
I wasn't aware any of you were
searching for anachronisms.

198
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,511
We weren't.

199
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,932
Rory was on a bender
when Julius Caesar showed up.

200
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,101
Agent Sharpe,
have we seen any activity

201
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,600
that would match such a massive
historical displacement?

202
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,850
Absolutely not, sir.

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,398
Well, I guess you must have
missed one, then.

204
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,146
I find that very hard to believe...

205
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:40,231
Ready a go-team,
and we'll meet you at the Op-Center.

206
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,949
Sir.

207
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,906
In the meantime,

208
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,954
who fancies a tour?

209
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,505
Guess they're, uh,
not used to seeing famous people.

210
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,550
Yeah. Kind of like we're the
Founding Fathers of the Time Bureau.

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,847
In a way,

212
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,803
I suppose if you lot hadn't created

213
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,055
the greatest time-paradox
the world had ever known,

214
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,886
all these people would have
nothing to do.

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,660
<i>Unhand me, you knave!</i>

216
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,813
Is that...

217
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,396
Oh, yes. King Arthur.

218
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,024
His displacement
into the Spanish Civil War

219
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,571
caused quite the anachronism.

220
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,242
Evil sorcerer! I might have known
you were responsible for all of this.

221
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,807
Now, when he is returned
to his original time,

222
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,868
he'll have no memory
of his displacement.

223
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,454
All humility aside, we are the most
important security organization

224
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,205
that no one's ever heard of.

225
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,292
Who somehow missed the fact that
Julius Caesar is down in Aruba,

226
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,386
working on his tan.

227
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,464
I'm sure our detection system would
have picked up on his displacement.

228
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,804
Yeah, and we get that.

229
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,270
But all we are saying is if you want
to give us the old <i>Waverider</i> back,

230
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,394
we would be happy to go down there
and take care of it for you.

231
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,771
Yeah, you know, for old time's sake?

232
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,366
I'm sorry, but our old ship has
been put to new use.

233
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,221
You turned our ship into a simulator?

234
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,800
The Command Module is heading
towards a meteoroid belt.

235
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,180
The Apollo 13 astronauts will die
unless we do something.

236
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,874
Ah, that's cool, man. They're teaching
one of our old missions.

237
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,357
I've got an idea, why don't we swing
around and use our ship as a shield?

238
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,236
Kidding.
I'm not a total idiot.

239
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,242
Target the command module's oxygen
tank with our photons and fire.

240
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,116
Yes.

241
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,540
The ruptured tank propelled their
capsule out of harm's way, Captain!

242
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,958
Well done, class. See you all tomorrow.

243
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,792
We'll see how you do trying to stop
an atomic torpedo

244
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,376
from blowing up New York City.

245
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,390
What are they doing here?

246
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,891
We are here to help you.

247
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,186
That's very gracious of you,

248
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,352
but whatever it is,
we have professionals

249
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,683
who can handle the matter.

250
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,565
Along with whatever damage
Mr. Rory causes.

251
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,777
Your salad sucks.

252
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,737
You should know this is not the
first time I've been taken captive.

253
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,497
Oh, great, a story.

254
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,417
Once, when I was a young man,

255
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,291
I was kidnapped by pirates.

256
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:46,752
They ransomed me for 50 talents
of silver, a fortune.

257
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,845
My family paid the money, of course.

258
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,261
But I told my captors
they would be better off killing me.

259
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,513
Because if they did let me go,

260
00:14:55,603 --> 00:15:00,223
I promised to come back one day,
and not only to take my silver,

261
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,314
but to crucify the pirates,
one by one.

262
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,027
And that's exactly what I did.

263
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,025
You're saying I should kill you?

264
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,237
You should believe me
when I make a promise.

265
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,034
The gold in this satchel is yours.

266
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,577
Gold?

267
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:23,004
But I swear by my household gods,
it will cost you your life.

268
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,671
Oh.

269
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,430
Do we have a location on Mr. Rory?

270
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,474
We followed a trail
of petty larceny reports.

271
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,021
He's been holed up on the beach,

272
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,771
running up a room service tab
and a serious collection of STDs.

273
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,186
- That's our Mick.
- He's been busy.

274
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,236
Locking in on coordinates now.

275
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,783
Is the go-team ready?

276
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,786
Locked and loaded, sir!

277
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,492
Opening a portal.

278
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,007
You broke my nose!

279
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,858
Out of my way.

280
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,859
Our team is under attack!

281
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,190
Definitely Rory.

282
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,571
Alpha Team,
do you have eyes on Caesar?

283
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,742
<i>He's got the target.</i>

284
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,223
What do you want us to do, Command?

285
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,240
Get the hell out of there before
Mr. Rory causes any more mayhem!

286
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,666
Roger that. Initiating extraction.

287
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,335
Get off me, you damn missionaries!

288
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,131
Get the hell off me, dude.

289
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,758
This is Julius Caesar?

290
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,760
Dude, my dad's a lawyer.

291
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,470
<i>Gonna totally sue all your asses.</i>

292
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,685
What is this place?

293
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,847
An institution you will never
step foot in again, Mr. Rory.

294
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,982
Get them out of here!

295
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,061
<i>Rip.</i>

296
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,946
Look, I'm sorry, I thought...

297
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,739
That the Legends would change?

298
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,441
Since when do we need to change?

299
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,820
When you left our team, you said
you had nothing left to teach me.

300
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,998
Yes, well, unfortunately,
all of history suddenly came unglued

301
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,825
moments after I uttered those words.

302
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,204
Look. I miss the good old days,
too, Sara.

303
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,880
But times have changed.

304
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,800
Yeah, and you don't think
you need us anymore.

305
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,968
Look, Rip, this is our mess.
You have to let us fix it.

306
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,641
Using your team to fix anything

307
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,807
is like doing brain surgery
with a chainsaw.

308
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,729
Whoa. You can't leave yet!

309
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,403
Not without parking validation.

310
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,699
<i>Son of a bitch stole my money!</i>

311
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,957
Whoa.

312
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,463
This is a genuine Roman aureus.

313
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,041
This is first century B.C.

314
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,676
That means Rory really saw
Julius Caesar.

315
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,762
Duh.

316
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,575
We've got to tell Rip
that he's got the wrong guy.

317
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,965
Yeah. Like he'd listen to us.

318
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,516
He's right. We got to grab
Caesar ourselves.

319
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,720
And prove to Rip
that we've got the right stuff.

320
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,684
Sara, exit's this way.

321
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,474
Our ship's this way.

322
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,934
We're gonna steal the <i>Waverider?</i>

323
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,436
We're gonna fix our mistakes.

324
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,204
Oh, damn it! I mean, darn it.

325
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,283
There's a class in session.

326
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,829
Ah.

327
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,334
Listen up, punks. Class dismissed.
Get outta here.

328
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,963
This must be a part of
the training exercise.

329
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,336
Our ship has been boarded
by a Time Pirate.

330
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,173
On behalf of the Time Bureau,
and in accordance to Article 15.6,

331
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,100
Section B, concerning the unlawful
seizure of Time Ships...

332
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,054
Anyone else?

333
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,724
Gideon's been in sleep-mode
for five years.

334
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,738
But if I can divert her power
back to the core...

335
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,988
<i>Hello, Legends! What did I miss?</i>

336
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,823
Well, we're about to steal the ship,
go grab Julius Caesar in Aruba,

337
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,822
all before
history completely collapses!

338
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,116
<i>So, it's business as usual, then.</i>

339
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,538
Exactly.

340
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,583
Gideon, engines to power.
Turbines to speed.

341
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,497
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

342
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,378
Sounds like this old boat
needs a lube job.

343
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,672
What in the hell
do they think they're doing?

344
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,758
The hangar's sealed.
There's no way out of here.

345
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,663
Well, I'm afraid
the Legends have never permitted

346
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,270
something like logic to stop them.

347
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,150
I hope you know what
you're doing, Ms. Lance.

348
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,403
Gideon, time-jump us out of here.

349
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,655
Uh, are you sure we can time-jump
inside the building?

350
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,329
We're about to find out.

351
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,515
Gideon, when are we?

352
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,560
<i>I was only able to time-jump us
three minutes into the future.</i>

353
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,262
<i>We are still in Star City.</i>

354
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,516
<i>If you haven't noticed, the ship is
in desperate need of maintenance.</i>

355
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,817
Yeah, there's no way we're
gonna make it to Aruba.

356
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,691
Can we make it to Central City?

357
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,113
I know a good mechanic there.

358
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,202
Jefferson. What a nice surprise.

359
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,035
Lily also dropped by with some
rather exciting news.

360
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,888
Oh, well, if it's a bad time,
I can always...

361
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,503
Wait, what is it?

362
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,001
<i>Something's wrong. I can feel it.</i>

363
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,708
We may only see each other once
a week for our bonding sessions,

364
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,010
but we still share a psychic connection.

365
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,422
I dropped out of school.

366
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,472
Why would you do that? You could
have your master's in two years.

367
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,396
I know, it's just,
learning about engineering

368
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,897
is not half as fun as actually being
an engineer on a Time Ship.

369
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,522
Oh, hey, Jax!

370
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,649
Whoa. Whoa, Lily. You're...

371
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,860
What? I'm what?

372
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,237
You look healthy.

373
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,163
I'm kidding! I'm pregnant.

374
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,990
Oh, my God. Congratulations!

375
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,495
Thank you.

376
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,078
I was on sabbatical in Rome
with my boyfriend...

377
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,331
She means her future husband.

378
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,212
And we decided
we wanted to come home,

379
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,134
and break the big news in person.

380
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,551
Oh, I got to put the osso buco
in the oven,

381
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,849
but you should totally stay
for dinner. Right, Daddy?

382
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,642
- Yeah.
- Okay.

383
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,516
Dude, what?

384
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:59,691
My heart still melts when
she says that word. It's crazy.

385
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,688
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

386
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,069
Is that what I think it is?

387
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:15,498
Come on, Grey, a chance to meet
Julius Caesar and fix history.

388
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,328
Look, we have a Time Ship. We can get
you home in time for dessert.

389
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,274
That's what I told Clarissa
the last time I left.

390
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,257
And when you came home,
you had a surprise daughter.

391
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,588
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,678
Your point?

393
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,846
The point is sometimes, we screw
things up for the better.

394
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,470
That's a good motto.
We should use that.

395
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,394
Fine. Whatever. I'll come.

396
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,517
Great. Now, all we need is Amaya,

397
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,751
and we can get the band back together.

398
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,775
That's not happening.

399
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,587
- Whoa. Did I miss something?
- Mmm-mmm.

400
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,228
Amaya dumped him,
went back to 1942.

401
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,028
She didn't dump me.
She didn't dump me.

402
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,984
<i>Amaya went back to Zambesi
because Rip told her</i>

403
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,071
she has some sort of destiny
to fulfill back in 1942. That's it.

404
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,781
Unlike the rest of us, who don't have

405
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,163
crap waiting for us in the real world.

406
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,460
Speak for yourself, numbnuts.

407
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,380
I don't know about you all,
but I was destined for greater things

408
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,501
than folding towels.

409
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,820
And Rip thinks he doesn't need us
because he's got the Time Bureau.

410
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,552
Ray's right.
We're the ones who broke history,

411
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,220
we should be the ones who fix it.

412
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,766
But instead of operating
on history with a chainsaw, this time,

413
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,811
we are going to be the scalpel.

414
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,060
This your idea of subtle?

415
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,648
Just try to blend in, okay?

416
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,608
No problem.

417
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,561
Great Caesar's ghost...

418
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,697
That's him.

419
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,281
So, what I have to say to you is this,

420
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,116
are you willing to fight with me?

421
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,409
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

422
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,950
And claim this savage land for Rome?

423
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,447
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

424
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,449
What, did you teach Caesar English?

425
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,040
No. He just showed up speaking fancy.

426
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,920
Temporal linguistic dysplasia.

427
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,006
What?

428
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,798
A side effect of historical
displacement. Astonishing!

429
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,503
You know, cowards die many times
before their deaths.

430
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,098
The valiant never taste death
but once!

431
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,767
Yeah, and Delta Nu Phi sucks!

432
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,636
Delta Nu Phi sucks!

433
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,474
- Alpha Psi Gamma sucks!
- Delta Nu Phi sucks!

434
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,399
Can we not agree they all suck?

435
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,691
All right, let's shut
this toga party down

436
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,363
before things really get out of hand.

437
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,533
No powers... It could
make the anachronism worse.

438
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,952
Right, be the scalpel.

439
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,122
I've got an idea.

440
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,811
Come on, man.
You're really trying to hook-up now?

441
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,044
No, I'm creating a dating profile
on our new Upswipz app.

442
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,790
Gideon, I need you to hit every phone
on the beach with a match.

443
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,886
"Exotic beauty looking for casual sex
with young frat stud?"

444
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,633
<i>It might work.</i>

445
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,464
Now, all I need is a profile picture.

446
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,299
<i>I believe I've got that covered.</i>

447
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,854
Ooh. Not bad.

448
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,057
- For Mars.
- Yeah!

449
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,983
- For Rome.
- Yeah!

450
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,445
Death or glory!

451
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,914
All right, J.C. Party's over.
You're coming with us.

452
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,039
I'd rather fall on my sword
than surrender it to a woman.

453
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,588
Well, then, today is your lucky day.

454
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,965
Uh... Shouldn't we help her?

455
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,674
It's him I'm worried about.

456
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,983
Yep, I'd say our work here is done.

457
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:33,188
And to quote the great conqueror
himself, "We came, we saw..."

458
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,114
We kicked Caesar's ass.

459
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,656
- Suckers.
- Nice work.

460
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,582
I'd have done it faster.

461
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,968
Oh. I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

462
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,012
Easy, Mick.

463
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,341
He broke my nose, my best feature.

464
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,927
Still. We have to get him back to
his time in one piece.

465
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,623
Or he doesn't go on to
conquer the world and help

466
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,607
create the greatest empire
history has ever known.

467
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,898
We need to get moving.

468
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,818
It's not going to take Rip long
to track down a stolen Time Ship.

469
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,715
<i>Quiet so, Ms. Lance.</i>

470
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,275
It appears that you've captured
the real Julius Caesar.

471
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,652
Well done.
Now, if you'll just return him to us,

472
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,079
we'll be happy to handle
his reinsertion back into history.

473
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,485
You don't think we can handle it?

474
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,409
It's not that. Maybe it is that.

475
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,707
<i>But the fact remains that
you've hijacked our property.</i>

476
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,675
If you return it to us, along
with our anachronistic guest,

477
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,011
<i>all will be forgiven.</i>

478
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,593
I trust you'll use your best judgment.

479
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,596
Does he not know this team?

480
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,581
<i>Shouldn't we entrust Caesar's return</i>

481
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,765
to the people who do
that sort of thing professionally?

482
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,900
I thought that this was our chance to
prove that we're professional-ish.

483
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,193
Your call, Captain.

484
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,074
Gideon, plot a course
for the Time Bureau.

485
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,494
<i>I'm afraid that won't be
possible without additional repairs.</i>

486
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,946
Of course.

487
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,241
<i>Et tu,</i> Sara?

488
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,709
I'm using my best judgment.

489
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,259
You know, I've taken these engines
apart so many times,

490
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,682
feels like this ship is a part of me.

491
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,725
It is a part of you that you can take on

492
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,145
whatever adventure life
offers you next.

493
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,940
What adventure could be better
than this one?

494
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,318
I mean, I got to be a superhero

495
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,691
who traveled through time,
changing history.

496
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,319
Yes, I know.

497
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,824
Look, I know you wanna do the whole
granddad thing.

498
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:50,663
Smoke a pipe by the fire, but
I've got a whole lot of life left,

499
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,120
and I have no idea how to fill it.

500
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,211
Jefferson, you are

501
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:03,389
hands down the most gifted, capable,
driven young man I've ever known.

502
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,342
You can do anything you want to do.

503
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,788
Well, that's all well and good,

504
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,226
but what I want to do is to be half
of a nuclear-powered superhero.

505
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,650
And I can't do that
if you don't want to.

506
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,081
<i>Have you come to gloat?</i>

507
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,911
Or to grant me the mercy
of taking my own life?

508
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,497
Getting beaten by a woman
bothers you that much?

509
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,252
Yes.

510
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,879
If your intention is neither boasting
nor mercy,

511
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,973
to what do I owe the honor
of this visit?

512
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,140
You doubt
your present course of action

513
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,818
and seem to believe that Caesar
holds the key to resolving it.

514
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:03,277
There's nothing to resolve.
My course of action isn't up to me.

515
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,576
So, you believe your future lies in
the hands of the Three Fates?

516
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:11,953
No, it lies in the hands of a group
called the Time Bureau.

517
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,910
And if I go against them now,
they'll take my ship.

518
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,629
And if I screw this up,
then I lose everything.

519
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,670
And that's all you're willing to
wager for greatness?

520
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,129
Pompey said he would have my head
for going against the Senate.

521
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,640
But when I lead my army
across the Rubicon,

522
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:33,311
Rome will welcome me as a god.

523
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,186
Well, I wish
I shared your confidence.

524
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:44,989
It cost me eight years and countless
centurions to conquer Gaul.

525
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,993
But with an Amazonian queen like you
by my side,

526
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,950
I could make short work
of the rest of the world.

527
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,534
Conquering the world does sound nice.

528
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,670
But I don't need you to do it.

529
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,547
Ship's fixed, Captain.

530
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,005
Fixed enough to get us back to the
Time Bureau?

531
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,305
Mmm-hmm.

532
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,425
How about Ancient Rome?

533
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,969
Only one way to find out.

534
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,944
According to Gideon,
Caesar disappeared

535
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,368
the night before his
famous march on Rome.

536
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:34,038
No crossing the Rubicon means
no civil war, no civil war means

537
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:38,243
no Ides of March, no Ides of March
means no Roman Empire.

538
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,329
- What happens on the Ides of March?
- Mmm.

539
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,130
Well, that's when your friends,
who really aren't your friends,

540
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,708
stab you in the back
to stop your rise to power.

541
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,460
Not that you'll remember any of this.

542
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,011
Check it out.
History is back to normal.

543
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,021
And now, a little something
for the Heywood scrapbook.

544
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,149
Oh, man. That's a keeper.

545
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,863
Enjoy conquering the world.

546
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,238
<i>Perhaps my eyes deceive me,</i>

547
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,470
but that does not look
like the Time Bureau to me.

548
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,889
It says here we landed in 49 BC.

549
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:39,730
Relax. Because we just dropped off
J.C. back where he belonged.

550
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:44,025
So, history has been restored,
and we can go a-home.

551
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,023
<i>I'm afraid that's not possible.</i>

552
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,105
Why? Something wrong with the ship?

553
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,111
<i>No, but your home
no longer exists.</i>

554
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,817
<i>Here is a map of
what was formerly known</i>

555
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,403
<i>as the United States, circa 2017.</i>

556
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,308
I thought you said that
history had been restored.

557
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,039
Does that look restored to you?

558
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,038
What does Magna Hesperia mean?

559
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,996
Means Caesar went on to conquer
the known world,

560
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,168
and then the unknown world.

561
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,376
One of you fools must have
entrusted him with future knowledge,

562
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,802
something that allowed him to alter
the course of history.

563
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,847
No. No. I mean, Sara hit him with
Rip's flashy-thing.

564
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,640
Flashy-thing.

565
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,137
Oh, my God.

566
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,266
What?

567
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,808
My book.

568
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,602
What book?

569
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,318
Change of plans.

570
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,776
We're not marching on Rome, sir?

571
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,115
We're still marching.

572
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,991
But when we get there, we're going
to visit a few old friends.

573
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,336
Starting with Brutus and Cassius.

574
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,298
I can't believe you let Caesar steal
the answers to the test!

575
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,344
Why are you all looking at me?
It's not my fault.

576
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,593
How did mop head even know
there'd be a test?

577
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,224
It's a figure of speech.

578
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,097
Caesar knew
how to alter history because

579
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,974
he already knew how it would unfold.

580
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,898
Okay, so all we got to do is get back
out there and refold history.

581
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,192
Or contact Mr. Hunter and let
the Time Bureau handle it.

582
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,396
No, we do not let
those time turds have

583
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,010
the satisfaction of knowing that we...

584
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,610
That you lost the book?

585
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,910
Stop blaming me, okay? Caesar must've
swiped it when I wasn't looking.

586
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,612
- Nate's right.
- Thank you.

587
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,414
Not about it not being your fault.
About the Time Bureau.

588
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,912
They're 2,000 years away.
We can fix this before they even...

589
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,712
Too late.

590
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:37,051
- Ms. Lance, a word?
- Yeah.

591
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,720
Look, I know what you're gonna say,
but we are gonna fix this.

592
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,180
You shall do nothing of the sort.

593
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,186
My agents will clear up this mess
in no time.

594
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,900
And what if something goes sideways?
None of these guys are field agents.

595
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,651
Admit it, Rip. You need us.

596
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,733
No, Sara. You need this.

597
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,910
But just because you all found life
outside this ship boring,

598
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,739
doesn't mean you get
your old jobs back.

599
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,615
Because the Time Bureau is capable of

600
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,793
getting the job done without the mess.

601
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,131
Status?

602
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,503
We've got eyes on the target,
go-team is hot.

603
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,009
Yes, you are.

604
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,587
Watch and learn, Ms. Lance.

605
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,135
Execute.

606
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,699
<i>Asset acquired.</i>

607
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,493
Proceed to target and commence
memory erasure protocol.

608
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,287
I've seen this play before.

609
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,662
Leave the merchandise unattended,
draw the target out...

610
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,492
League of Assassins strategy?

611
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:53,503
No. It's Sink Shower & Stuff. We use
it to catch shoplift... It's a trap!

612
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,701
You've got to pull your team
out of there.

613
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,432
Agent Sharpe, initiate extraction.

614
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,634
Extract.

615
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,562
Uh... Agent Sharpe has been apprehended.

616
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,820
We were caught unprepared,
but we'll go back in and...

617
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,629
Screw things up worse
than you already have?

618
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:25,910
Boss is right. We need to go
and rescue Agent Hotcakes.

619
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,288
Please. This entire situation is
happening because of you idiots...

620
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,461
Idiots?
Idiots with special abilities.

621
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,774
We know how to handle ourselves.

622
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,882
Not against Julius Caesar, who has
an entire legion at his command.

623
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,584
We're pretty good
at taking down legions.

624
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,885
Damn straight.

625
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,852
I'm assuming the answer is no, but
do any of you happen to have a plan?

626
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,691
<i>We're about to rejoin my army.</i>

627
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,861
Be grateful.
Not only am I letting you live,

628
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,314
I am permitting you to witness
the rise of the Roman Empire.

629
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,822
The Time Bureau will never permit
you to alter history.

630
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,826
Caesar does not alter history.
He makes it.

631
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,211
Surrender your prisoner in the name
of Ares, the God of War!

632
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,880
Mars is the Roman
God of War, Jefferson.

633
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,002
Yeah, whatever.

634
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,263
- What are you doing?
- Rescuing you.

635
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,050
I can take care of myself.

636
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,401
Howdy.

637
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,237
What'd you say to him?

638
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,698
Uh... Sleep tight, buddy,
I guess. Maybe.

639
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,784
- I think this deserves a bro-hug.
- Bring it.

640
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,462
Damn, Ray.

641
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,865
You ruined my vacation.

642
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,193
And my nose.

643
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,164
Now, we're even.

644
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,913
See? Problem solved.

645
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,331
I gotta say, Ms. Lance,

646
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,165
now that I've seen your team
in action with my own eyes,

647
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,628
you're even worse than I imagined.

648
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,253
You're welcome.

649
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:03,233
Well, like Nate said, sometimes we
screw things up for the better.

650
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,399
I fail to see
how that's true in this case.

651
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,779
It's our new motto.

652
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,486
New motto? Right.

653
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,242
Does that mean
you all plan to continue

654
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,559
swashbuckling your way
through history?

655
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,246
With the Time Bureau's permission,
of course.

656
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,952
And if I deny you permission?

657
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,001
- We'll do it anyways.
- Yeah.

658
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,959
Sir, the go-team has erased the
memories of Caesar and his forces.

659
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,545
Good. We best take our leave, then.

660
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,223
Sara. Mr. Rory. Do your best
to stay out of trouble.

661
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,308
What's that?

662
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,777
It's a, uh, portal thingy.

663
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,486
Communications thing.

664
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,862
And a... Ah, yes, the memory thing.

665
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,743
So, I guess that means
you're staying.

666
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,242
Well, I kind of have to.
You'd be dead without me.

667
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,374
Cheers.

668
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,429
They're irresponsible, undependable,
unpredictable, dangerous...

669
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,677
And yet effective. At least on occasion.

670
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,286
Is that the reason
they're not warming a cell

671
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,676
back at headquarters as we speak?

672
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,414
They're not warming a cell,
Agent Sharpe, because

673
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,181
they might just be our best hope
of defeating what's coming.

674
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,601
They're the reason Mallus is a threat.

675
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,444
Indeed. But there might just come a day

676
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,399
when we need the Legends
to do what they do best.

677
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,442
Which is what, exactly?

678
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,653
Be the chainsaw.

679
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,936
Would you open a portal
back to headquarters?

680
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,998
I seem to have misplaced
my Time Courier.

681
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,045
How is she running?

682
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,632
Lousy. Rip's monkeys
really screwed up the works.

683
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,264
It's gonna take Ray months
to figure this out.

684
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,639
Why Raymond?

685
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,938
I told Sara to take us back home.

686
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,188
Oh, that's unfortunate considering

687
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,734
I've decided to stay aboard.

688
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,402
Whoa. Wait. What?

689
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,026
I Shanghaied you into our first voyage.

690
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,649
I forced this life upon you.

691
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,860
I can hardly ask you to give it up now.

692
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,531
But your life... Your family...

693
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:19,036
I'll make it home for the birth
of my first grandchild.

694
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,457
As for my family...

695
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,041
They're on this ship as well.

696
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,502
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

697
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,795
Ah.

698
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,811
You doing okay?

699
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:49,312
Yeah, nothing says doing okay like
pining over files of your ex.

700
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,232
Yeah, I was just thinking.

701
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,735
About her?

702
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,113
Yeah, about her and...

703
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:04,460
This place. I miss being on the ship.

704
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,913
Yeah, of course you do.
This is your home.

705
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,084
And she's back home, too.

706
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,426
She's happy, I'm happy.

707
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,342
She's happy, right?

708
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,807
Yeah. Totally.

709
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,307
This is the village.

710
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,933
Get out of our way, woman.

711
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,603
Actually, that's what I was gonna
tell you.

712
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,900
We have business here.

713
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,737
If you call
poaching and raping business.

714
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,160
Zambesi is under my protection.

715
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:56,629
<i>No! No, please, no!</i>
