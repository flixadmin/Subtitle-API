1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,367
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,422
Roy! Roy! Roy, stop it!

3
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:06,781
They're dead.

4
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:08,375
We have to protect him.

5
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:10,262
Yeah. As far as the SCPD is concerned,

6
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:12,264
Emiko is the one who
killed those guards.

7
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,066
Thank you for wiping that
security camera footage.

8
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:16,468
I could not get there
before the cops did.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,770
I thought that was you.

10
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:19,312
The Ninth Circle has Archer.

11
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,873
They are going to use the
intel they get from the assets

12
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:25,348
to locate the DNA of the
people involved in Cygnus X-1.

13
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,581
And that DNA could lead them
to exactly where that weapon is.

14
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,383
I copied Archer's root code.

15
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,593
No. As long as Archer's out there,

16
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:35,554
it could fall into the wrong
hands, and I don't know what

17
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:37,523
my legacy's gonna be,
but it can't be that.

18
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:39,358
You'll die a villain
just like our father,

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,194
and I will be the cause
of both of your deaths.

20
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:43,468
What did you say?

21
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,484
I had the chance to warn
our father about the Gambit,

22
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,234
that it was rigged to explode,

23
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:50,636
and I knew about it.

24
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:52,404
I let our father die because he didn't

25
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,073
deserve to live,

26
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,357
and neither do you. Bye, brother.

27
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:16,228
Overwatch? John?

28
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,904
Need some help?

29
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,278
Tommy?

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,481
Hey, Ollie.

31
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,437
It's been a while.

32

33
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,778
John!

34
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:09,214
Rene?

35
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:12,317
Dinah!

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,353
Can anyone hear me?

37
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:19,091
I'm here!

38
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:22,728
I'm here. Ohh!

39
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,030
Ohh!

40
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:34,840
You okay?

41
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:37,376
I'm good.

42
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:39,778
Can't say much for my helmet.

43
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,587
You good?

44
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:51,724
Well, my Bo staff's
smashed, but other than that.

45
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,426
- Where's Rene?
- I don't know.

46
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,195
- Rene!
- Rene!

47
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:59,064
- Rene!
- Rene!

48
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,350
Rene!

49
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:01,934
You guys want to get me out of here?

50
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,236
Rene, are you in there?

51
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:05,738
He's here. He's here.

52
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,040
Get him out!

53
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,242
- You okay?
- Move it.

54
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:14,147
We can't do it.

55
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,617
Here. Hurry!

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,480
- Let's try this.
- Grab it, grab it, grab it.

57
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,818
Grab it. Dinah, pull on 3, okay?

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,453
- Okay.
- All right. Ready?

59
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,055
- Yeah.
- 1, 2, 3. Come on!

60
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:27,292
All right. Come on. Agh!

61
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:28,928
Got you.

62
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,599
What the hell just happened?

63
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,234
Emiko just dropped a building on us.

64
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,635
That's what happened.

65
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:37,928
We got to get to Oliver.

66
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,936
As we lost contact, he was chasing Emiko

67
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,225
on the floor beneath us.

68
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,068
- We have to get there.
- Then we better hurry.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,615
Hey. Quick. Urgent. I need
our uplink gain augmenter.

70
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,717
Uh, more urgent, I have
something to tell you bef...

71
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,552
Okay. Your thing is definitely
not more urgent than mine.

72
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:56,011
- Welcome to my thing.
- What are they doing?

73
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:57,029
Don't they remember
we're on the same side,

74
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:58,331
deputized vigilantes and everything?

75
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,390
Well, apparently, they have a warrant.

76
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,726
They what?! H-hi. Excuse me. What...

77
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,777
An anonymous source sent
us surveillance footage

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,894
of last night's incident
in the subway tunnels.

79
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:08,333
Where you see Team Arrow valiantly foil

80
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,769
a terrorist attack
just like we told you?

81
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,338
Emiko Adachi didn't kill those guards.

82
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,307
Your friend Roy Harper did.

83
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:18,043
Then your whole team
lied to cover it up.

84
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,478
That's insane.

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,413
Digital forensics also investigated

86
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:23,692
that bomb, which you said was
the work of the Ninth Circle...

87
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,217
- Uh-huh.
- But that file was activated

88
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,219
from a program called Archer,

89
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,421
a program which Smoak
Tech owns the patent for.

90
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,923
Well, technically,
yes, but it was stolen.

91
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,491
This has to be a mistake. I mean...

92
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:33,742
I agree. I know this sounds shady,

93
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:34,984
but trust me... We are the good guys,

94
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:36,972
and we are after the bad
guy... well, bad girl,

95
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,397
who currently has your captain

96
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,299
and my husband trapped under a building.

97
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,568
We haven't received any word
about no buildings going down.

98
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,969
That's because it was a small detonation

99
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,406
in a chemical plant outside of town.

100
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,074
Listen! You can talk to
the team all about it,

101
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:48,998
but to get ahold of them,

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,019
I have to get ahold of a really
tiny, delicate piece of tech

103
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,750
that is in that box that
lieutenant butterfingers

104
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:53,627
is rummaging through.

105
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,263
I'm sorry, Ms. Smoak.

106
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,599
- You're under arrest.
- What?

107
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,135
- You can't do that!
- Yes, I can.

108
00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,341
Turn around!

109
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:04,222
Okay. Just... let me give
my friend a hug first.

110
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:05,825
Go ahead.

111
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,494
Plug your ears.

112
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,738
What the hell was that?

113
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,473
Oh. It's part of my new security system,

114
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:23,208
a remote-detonated nanoelectric pulse

115
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,365
that I built into the ceiling.

116
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,842
Oh. Remind me to never
get on your bad side.

117
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,356
- Is Oliver okay?
- I don't know.

118
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,625
I tried. All I got was static,

119
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,705
but if I can boost the signal,

120
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:30,967
I might be able to contact them.

121
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,251
You mean we can. I'm not letting you

122
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,853
do this alone.

123
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:37,189
Okay. Well, then let's get out of here.

124
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,739
We do not want to be here
when these guys wake up.

125
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:45,364
Crime, violence, anarchy.

126
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,099
The terrible disease that once infected

127
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,701
the streets of The
Glades has risen again,

128
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,212
but there is a cure to
the vigilante problem

129
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:55,206
and a chance for a
better, brighter future...

130
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,543
ZETA powered by Galaxy
One's Archer program.

131
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:01,446
They are the front lines
of a citywide initiative

132
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,174
to end the vigilante menace

133
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:07,853
and restore Star City's
glory once and for all.

134
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:09,922
First, Galaxy One puts
a bounty on your heads.

135
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:12,338
Now they're sending a damn
army of super robots after you?

136
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:13,759
We are just Keven Dale's scapegoats

137
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,888
for his larger agenda.

138
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,190
Which is what?

139
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,494
Turn Star City into a police state,

140
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,498
go under Galaxy One's control.

141
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,833
We can't let that happen.

142
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:23,368
Oh, yeah? And how exactly

143
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,603
are we supposed to stop them?

144
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:27,072
By destroying Archer.

145
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,641
We tried that once, remember?

146
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,076
It didn't work then, and Archer was

147
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,811
nowhere near as advanced as it is now.

148
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:34,511
That's why we have to
find the mad scientist

149
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:36,782
who upgraded my creation
into Frankenstein's monster.

150
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,550
You sure that's a good idea?

151
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,932
No, but if Galaxy One has an
army of Archer-powered assassins,

152
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,990
we don't stand a chance,

153
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:47,626
Star City loses.

154
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,661
Well, I'll put the
word out to what's left

155
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,929
of the Canary network,

156
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:52,349
see what intel they can find.

157
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:54,053
You know, if you need
a quick and dirty virus,

158
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,397
I'm sure I can whip
something up in no time.

159
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,751
It won't work. I've tried them all.

160
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:58,185
But if the network is still online,

161
00:06:58,188 --> 00:06:59,514
then they could still track our DNA,

162
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:01,669
- so we need a plan "B."
- I have a plan "B!"

163
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:05,644
And all of my plans
include you laying low

164
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:08,113
and staying safe.

165
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:10,016
Leave Archer to me.

166
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:13,653
Thank you.

167
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,333
You look shocked.

168
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:25,096
Um, is it the beard?

169
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:27,199
Uh-uh. You look good.

170
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,667
Yeah, I know.

171
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,033
Ohh. I must have a
really bad concussion.

172
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,873
Yeah, man. A building
just collapsed on you.

173
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,342
It could be a little PTSD, too.

174
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:40,278
That position that
you're in with the rebar,

175
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,117
it is remarkably similar to how
you found me all those years ago.

176
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,489
The night you died.

177
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:47,624
Yeah.

178
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:51,689
And I got to tell
you, man, it looks like

179
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,291
the same thing is gonna happen to you

180
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,293
if you don't get out of
here, like, right now.

181
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,794
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

182
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,015
Ooh. Yeah. That was close.

183
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:21,286
Um... you think you want
to pop that thing back in?

184
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:24,990
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. 1, 2, and 3.

185
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,391
Aah!

186
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:32,764
- That had to hurt.
- Yeah.

187
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,500
You have Oliver angry face on right now.

188
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:38,177
Just saying.

189
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,550
I got to get out of here.

190
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:48,447
The team might be dead.

191
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:53,185
Everything we've built
with the SCPD is... is gone

192
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,686
because of Emiko.

193
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,354
I need to... I need to get out of here.

194
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:57,923
I need to find the others,

195
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,333
and we have to stop her.

196
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:01,103
Um, isn't that gonna be kind of hard

197
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:02,760
considering she's family?

198
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:04,629
She's not my family anymore.

199
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,064
Well, I hope you weren't planning

200
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,533
on using your bow to get out of here

201
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,552
'cause...

202
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,576
Yep.

203
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,914
Overwatch? Arsenal?

204
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,013
Does anyone copy?

205
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,252
You know, I know that you
were worried about them,

206
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,554
but they are pretty resourceful people.

207
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,323
They're probably fine.

208
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,991
Let's hope you're right.

209
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:48,380
I usually am.

210
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:52,663
You know, it is insane that we both had

211
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,332
secret half sisters.

212
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,067
Well, yours didn't try
to kill you, did she?

213
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,535
Well, you should give Thea some credit.

214
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:59,605
I died before she had the chance to try.

215
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:06,209
A couple specialty arrows
left, two explosive.

216
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:08,680
Seems kind of risky considering

217
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,435
the instability of this place,

218
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:11,997
especially without a bow.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,646
Well, there are solutions for that.

220
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,852
Speaking of, uh, what about Emiko?

221
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,022
What kind of solution

222
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,058
are you planning for her?

223
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,227
The one she deserves.

224
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,097
She let our father die.

225
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:28,733
He abandoned her, Oliver.

226
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,239
She's been manipulating me,

227
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:33,737
she's been manipulating
the team for months,

228
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,974
posing as some sort of hero.

229
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,755
The woman's a murderer.

230
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:41,822
So now you're gonna be one, too?

231
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:44,825
And here I thought that we
were done with all of that.

232
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,583
I don't see another choice here, Tommy.

233
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:51,054
It is exactly that kind of attitude

234
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,359
that's gonna keep you stuck down here.

235
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,432
Looks like your mystery
contact is as good

236
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,234
at covering their tracks as you are.

237
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,302
Ugh. I know, which is
why she's so dangerous

238
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,338
and annoying.

239
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,808
So I think I finally
figured out a plan "B"

240
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,612
to keep us hidden from Archer
while we try to destroy it.

241
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:17,739
Blindspots just like the one
Keven Dale used to mask his DNA.

242
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:18,670
The only way this is going to work is

243
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,388
if we copy the exact root code
that was used in the original.

244
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,024
Okay. Well, how do we do that?

245
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:25,422
Well, we'd have to steal it
from Keven Dale's computer

246
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:27,638
in his office at Galaxy One.

247
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,325
Uh, I suppose I could break in.

248
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:32,830
No, no. I'm sorry. Not you. Me.

249
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,232
I mean, Keven Dale already recognizes me

250
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:37,935
as a fellow CEO, and besides,

251
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,283
I think he'd be a lot more agreeable

252
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,319
to me than... you.

253
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:44,122
You know, a little flirty flirt
while I hack into his computer,

254
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,192
and then we'll get what we need.

255
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:49,797
- Look. I know it's a risk.
- A big one.

256
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,834
One I am not willing to take.

257
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,747
We have a plan "A." Let's stick to it.

258
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,184
Like I said, just leave it to me.

259
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,991
You know you're still
treating me like I'm 13.

260
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:02,481
What do you mean?

261
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,210
Uh, I mean that you're doing
the exact same thing to me now

262
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:07,079
that you and dad did
all those years ago,

263
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:09,267
leaving me out of things
and then getting rid of me.

264
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,803
Your father and I, we
never wanted to let you go.

265
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,997
But you did, and then even

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,050
after everything that
happened, you still stayed away

267
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:19,710
like... like I wasn't
even part of this family.

268
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:22,547
Ooh, and I thought we had problems. Heh.

269
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:28,352
I'm just gonna go do anything else.

270
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:32,156
William, I am so sorry.

271
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:35,083
I realize now that we
made a terrible mistake,

272
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:39,088
a mistake that I am going to
regret for the rest of my life,

273
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,826
but we really thought
we were protecting you.

274
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:47,037
We just wanted you
to have a normal life.

275
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,960
At this rate, we won't find
Oliver until sometime next week.

276
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,028
Team Arrow, do you copy?

277
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,560
Team Arrow, do you copy?

278
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,628
Overwatch, is that you?

279
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,044
Yes. Are you guys okay?

280
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,959
You have me, Roy, Dinah,
and Rene. We're safe.

281
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:19,758
And Oliver?

282
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,100
He was in another part of the building.

283
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:23,341
We... we haven't been
able to contact him.

284
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,971
I'm guessing you haven't either.

285
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,958
No, but his comm unit is
still online and active,

286
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,818
so if it wasn't crushed,
it means he wasn't either.

287
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,497
- We'll find him.
- I know.

288
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,649
You guys should know I don't know what

289
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,652
Emiko is planning, but she gave the SCPD

290
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:36,349
the footage of Roy
in the subway tunnels,

291
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:37,969
and they think that we are behind

292
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,672
whatever the Ninth Circle is plotting.

293
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:42,342
So lying to the SCPD to
cover for Roy was for nothing.

294
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,656
Not to mention our reputations

295
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,362
and everything we built this year.

296
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah. Let's move.

297
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:58,476
You've always been good
at this kind of thing.

298
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:00,075
Remember when we were kids

299
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,179
and you learned how to
hotwire my dad's car?

300
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:06,483
Well, I got grounded
for an entire summer.

301
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah, because you did it 3 more times.

302
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:20,264
Then it's a good thing

303
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,266
I should only have to do this once.

304
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,919
Uh-huh. You might only
be making this worse.

305
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:39,744
All the work we've
done to prove ourselves

306
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,887
to the cops, to the city.

307
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,653
Poof! It's just gone.

308
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,849
- Along with my job.
- We don't know that.

309
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,380
All we know is that
Emiko tried to set us up.

310
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:52,408
Yeah. She lied about us being
behind the Ninth Circle attacks,

311
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:55,896
but she was telling the truth
about us covering up those murders.

312
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,778
We never should have done that.

313
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,567
Wait. Even if it meant
Roy going to prison?

314
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,021
Two people were murdered.

315
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,691
I'm gonna turn myself in.

316
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,676
- It's the only way.
- No, you're not.

317
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,592
You've already taken the
fall for us once, Roy.

318
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:08,646
Let us help you this time.

319
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,934
And because of that,
everything you've worked for

320
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:13,271
is at risk.

321
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:16,287
He's right. I'm sorry, but the SCPD

322
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,788
has already tried to arrest Felicity.

323
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,022
It's better one of us takes the fall

324
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,124
than the rest of us spends
our lives as fugitives.

325
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,594
While we're arguing,
Emiko's out there planning.

326
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,597
We need to get out of here and stop her.

327
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:28,835
Oh, that can't be good.

328
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,933
Move, move, move! Go, go, go, go!

329
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,423
All right. Is everybody all right?

330
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,576
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure.

331
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,902
- Now the lights come on.
- Uh, guys, if the lights

332
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,939
just came on, that means the
emergency generator just came on.

333
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,658
- That's a good thing, right?
- Normally, yeah,

334
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,252
but the building you're
in used to manufacture

335
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,825
some very flammable chemicals,

336
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,180
and flammable chemicals plus
sparks equals really big boom.

337
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,575
- Okay. What about Oliver?
- If you don't turn off

338
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,184
the generator soon, there's
gonna be no Oliver to find.

339
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,050
The entire building's gonna go
up in flames, and you with it.

340
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,821
All right. Let's keep moving.

341
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,801
Felicity, we're in the boiler room.

342
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:08,119
Ok. Please tell me
that's not the generator.

343
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:10,640
Well, if it sounds like a
sick dinosaur, it probably is.

344
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,342
Good news is we still
have about 8 minutes

345
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,043
before it incinerates
the whole building.

346
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,411
And where is it exactly?

347
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:17,180
Lower level, to your left.

348
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,984
What do we think that is?

349
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:23,953
- C6H6.
- Benzene.

350
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,440
Guys, that is really bad stuff.

351
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,390
- How bad?
- Try irreparable nerve damage

352
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:28,891
with severe convulsions
and a painful death.

353
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,526
But the good news is
it's heavier than air,

354
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:32,310
so you are safe on the mezzanine. Heh.

355
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:34,581
And the bad news is that
generator is not on the mezzanine.

356
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,833
Neither is Oliver.

357
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,004
The ground beneath your feet is
airtight, so it can't get to him.

358
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,840
Well, I prefer my friends alive,
so we're gonna have to find

359
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:42,466
a new way to get you to
the generator and fast.

360
00:16:57,956 --> 00:17:00,023
Again, I would like to point out

361
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:03,049
how structurally unsound
this building appears to be,

362
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,629
so maybe upping the payload
is not the best idea.

363
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:08,598
It's a risk I have to take.

364
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,471
This is it. After this,
I'm out of options.

365
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:13,736
Are you, or is this just typical Oliver?

366
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:16,606
Now come on, man. Don't you ever wonder

367
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:19,442
why you keep finding yourself
in positions like this

368
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:22,502
where things just keep getting worse?

369
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:26,282
I'm here for one reason and
one reason only... Emiko.

370
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:30,065
Right. Emiko, your half sister.

371
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:32,388
Her being my half sister doesn't matter.

372
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,591
What matters is finding
her and stopping her

373
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,794
before she hurts anyone else.

374
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,529
It's a strategy you should appreciate.

375
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,531
Why? Because of what my
father did to The Glades?

376
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,934
No, Tommy, because
of what he did to you!

377
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:52,808
Any idea what it's like to... to...

378
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:57,680
To run a scenario through
your head a million times,

379
00:17:57,682 --> 00:18:01,384
just wondering if you could've just

380
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:07,590
listened to me a little bit sooner,

381
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:11,260
but you didn't because you were blinded

382
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:13,831
by the fact that he was your father.

383
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,536
Maybe you'd still be alive today.

384
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,340
But I didn't listen,

385
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:27,176
and I didn't make the right choice,

386
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,979
at least not until it was too late,

387
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:34,250
because I was stuck,
Oliver, in my own cycle,

388
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:37,220
my father's cycle, just like you are

389
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:39,666
and just like you will continue to be

390
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,992
if you don't break free.

391
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:47,764
No. No. You're wrong.

392
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:52,235
This isn't about me.

393
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,470
This is not about my father.

394
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:57,540
This is about Emiko,

395
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,743
and the choices that she made,

396
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:03,179
they are on her.

397
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,455
Overwatch, any luck figuring
out that alternate approach?

398
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,105
Looks like there's a
room behind the generator

399
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,091
with a failsafe switch.

400
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:26,014
The air ducts should be
able to get you in there.

401
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:33,052
All right. Yeah. Looks like we're
gonna have to crawl there fast.

402
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,388
Yeah.

403
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,654
We'll never make it in time.

404
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,091
- Roy, no!
- Roy, no!

405
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:52,028
Roy, if you breathe that
stuff in, you're dead.

406
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,530
I know.

407
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,707
Stop! We'll find another way!

408
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:07,511
There's not enough time.

409
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:18,010
No!

410
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,989
Please don't tell me
he just went in there!

411
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,724
Overwatch, tell me how much time he has.

412
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:22,974
10 seconds, maybe 12.

413
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:25,374
Roy, I'm gonna need a
sitrep. Talk to me, Roy!

414
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,133
Roy? Roy!

415
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:44,536
He did it.

416
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:47,630
He did it.

417
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,181
He did it.

418
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,832
- Oh!
- Roy!

419
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,534
Oh. Come on.

420
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:12,274
Are you okay?

421
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,510
Overwatch, power's off.

422
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:16,480
We're headed out to find Oliver.

423
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:20,750
Copy that.

424
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,886
I don't know how you
ever breathe on this job.

425
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,488
I don't.

426
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,956
Come on, Oliver. Where are you?

427
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,588
Hey. Um, random question.

428
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,732
Did you add another hero
to your Justice League?

429
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:39,368
You I expected.

430
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,802
Too bad for your friend.

431
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,302
Please don't.

432
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:44,138
I thought you'd be eager
to join you husband.

433
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:47,542
Please don't kill me! I'm pregnant!

434
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:51,379
This baby is innocent

435
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:55,885
just like you were when
Robert left your family.

436
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,655
Please don't kill an innocent child.

437
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:05,263
Good to know.

438
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,666
Aah!

439
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:21,729
I think the concrete gives up.

440
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:25,465
I need to get out of here.

441
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,834
You will. Trust me.

442
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:29,435
What you really need to worry about

443
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:31,105
is what happens when you do.

444
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:38,478
- Why?
- Everything you've done

445
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,446
this year... working with the cops,

446
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,148
fighting for the city without a mask...

447
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,651
You've got a shot at
something we never had.

448
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:47,720
What's that?

449
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:50,056
A clean slate.

450
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:53,226
You can't shed your
past, but you can keep it

451
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,794
from hurting your kids.

452
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:57,686
That's something our
parents could never give us,

453
00:22:57,689 --> 00:23:02,230
but it is never, ever
going to happen, Oliver,

454
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:04,600
if you keep seeing red with Emiko.

455
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:07,540
As long as she's still breathing,

456
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:09,561
my family will never be safe.

457
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,144
You know this, Tommy.

458
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:14,814
Then you haven't moved past
your family's mistakes, Oliver.

459
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:17,880
You haven't broken the
cycle of lies and hate.

460
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:19,983
You're trapped. You're trapped

461
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,822
just like you are in this room.

462
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:27,093
But you're not here.

463
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:28,995
You are a...

464
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:31,831
You are a figment of my imagination

465
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:36,202
that has been sent
here to test my resolve.

466
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,839
Won't work.

467
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,117
Looks like you found your way out.

468
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,295
To stop Emiko, if I need to be

469
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:07,500
as ruthless to her as
she was to my father,

470
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:09,269
so be it.

471
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,473
Good luck finding your team, Oliver.

472
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,109
You're gonna need them.

473
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:21,315
Good-bye, Tommy.

474
00:24:27,722 --> 00:24:29,722
Comms just dropped off.

475
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:31,657
Yeah. We should be
getting closer to Oliver.

476
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:33,726
- You need a minute?
- No.

477
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:37,029
Ugh! Yeah. Okay. Maybe I do.

478
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:38,598
Why don't you guys go ahead,

479
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,899
find us a way downstairs?

480
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:41,301
We'll catch up.

481
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:50,575
You must be a pretty big idiot,

482
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:52,042
risking your life like that.

483
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,645
Well, we're alive, aren't we?

484
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:56,682
You're lucky to be.

485
00:24:56,684 --> 00:24:59,939
I'm surprised you even care
if I made it out alive or not.

486
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:04,724
Of course I care.

487
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,859
You're our teammate.

488
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:09,128
Maybe I shouldn't be.

489
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,256
You lost everything to protect me,

490
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,899
and you don't even know me.

491
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,201
Those guards that I killed,

492
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:17,103
they're innocent.

493
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:18,938
They had families.

494
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,241
What you did back there,

495
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:24,176
it was awful,

496
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:26,155
but we all know it
was the bloodlust, Roy.

497
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,376
That wasn't you.

498
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:28,486
No. That doesn't change the fact that

499
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,626
I put everyone else around me at risk.

500
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,575
You should have just
let me go to prison.

501
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:42,161
I was wrong. We all make mistakes.

502
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:44,664
I was just pissed because
we had just lost everything.

503
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,413
That doesn't mean I want you dead.

504
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:49,735
Maybe it's best if I am 6 feet under.

505
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:52,939
Dying is the coward's way out.

506
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,073
Every day that you stay alive,

507
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:56,353
you try to redeem yourself

508
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:59,281
for that messed-up thing you did

509
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:03,782
because this world is a better place

510
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:06,752
with a hero like you.

511
00:26:06,754 --> 00:26:08,956
Now let's go.

512
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:20,447
Bunker is clear and secure.

513
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,983
- You okay?
- Yeah. Doesn't seem to be

514
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:23,416
any permanent damage.

515
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:24,901
Just rebooting the system,

516
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:26,034
get the comms up and running,

517
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,670
and then I'm gonna check
to see if Oliver's okay.

518
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,732
Just let me repeat. You. Are you okay?

519
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,233
Almost dying? Nothing I
haven't done 100 times before.

520
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:33,813
- Am I right?
- Well, the first time you've

521
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:35,330
done it when it's not just you.

522
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,832
Sadly, no.

523
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,917
William, the poor kid, I
mean, all he ever wanted

524
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,053
was a normal life...

525
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:45,257
Loses his mom, gets
kidnapped way too many times,

526
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:48,461
the final straw... Being taken
hostage by a serial killer.

527
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:51,764
I mean, how's life gonna be
any different for this kid?

528
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:53,332
You'll make it different.

529
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:55,901
You know, you make that sound so easy.

530
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:58,971
Growing up, my parents,

531
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:02,341
it's just that they
made my life miserable,

532
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:05,545
and I promised myself
that I would do better

533
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,248
when I became a parent, that I would...

534
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,016
I would... I would just be better,

535
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:14,631
and I imagined this... This...
this life, and this is not it.

536
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:19,425
I mean, somehow, I've
done something worse,

537
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:22,428
and I've created this life where I...

538
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,064
I can't even keep my children safe.

539
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:28,819
Hey. At Smoak Tech, you
defended yourself like a badass.

540
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:31,084
You will find a way
to protect those kids.

541
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,571
- How?
- Think of it like

542
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,906
a computer program.

543
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,475
How do you secure a system?

544
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:37,643
You get a really good firewall,

545
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:39,178
and you take it offline.

546
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,480
I can't exactly take my
entire life off the grid.

547
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:43,783
- Well, why not?
- I have a company for one.

548
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:46,350
Well, luckily, you have a fantastic CTO

549
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:48,298
who can run it for you.

550
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:50,623
You want a different
life for this kid, right?

551
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,526
- Yes.
- Well, then

552
00:27:53,528 --> 00:27:57,229
you're gonna need to do
something different this time.

553
00:27:57,231 --> 00:27:58,865
Yeah.

554
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:04,870
Crime, violence, anarchy.

555
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,959
The terrible disease that once infected

556
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:09,141
the streets of The
Glades has risen again,

557
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,744
but there is a cure to
the vigilante problem

558
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:13,212
and a chance for a better...

559
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:14,814
Thought you were supposed
to go with Felicity

560
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:16,798
in case her friend needed convincing.

561
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,983
She took Roy instead.

562
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:21,620
Guess she's trying to protect me, too.

563
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,553
You know, if you're trying
to make me feel better

564
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:26,459
about being abandoned by our parents,

565
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:27,993
just don't.

566
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:29,572
Fine. Have your little pity party

567
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,908
because mom benched you.

568
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:32,477
You know that's not what this is about.

569
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,880
Then what is it about?

570
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,867
When we rescued her from Galaxy One,

571
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,905
mom apologized, you guys seemed cool.

572
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:39,839
Yeah. I thought we were, too,

573
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:42,608
but she's still pushing me
away just like she always has.

574
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,544
Okay. Fine. So maybe
she wasn't there for you

575
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:47,480
in the traditional sense,

576
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:50,749
but mom made sure that
your company was a success.

577
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:52,251
She was trying.

578
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:55,454
I didn't need her money, Mia.

579
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:57,590
I needed a mother.

580
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,584
To this day, Felicity
still hasn't told me

581
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:01,393
why she kept me out
of her life for so long

582
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:06,298
or... why she wanted no part of mine.

583
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:13,973
Look. When I first found
out mom was keeping secrets,

584
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:17,076
that she was still being a vigilante,

585
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:19,945
I didn't wallow and
feel sorry for myself.

586
00:29:19,947 --> 00:29:23,716
I confronted her, demanded answers.

587
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,689
Maybe it's time you do the same.

588
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:40,833
John?

589
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:43,636
Oliver!

590
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:46,639
Oh. Thank God!

591
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:48,175
Let's keep moving.

592
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:55,548
We're lucky this is still standing.

593
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,303
- Which way?
- East.

594
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:59,285
Felicity said it was the best way out.

595
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:02,488
Oh. It definitely is.

596
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,157
Hi, brother.

597
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:11,553
Emiko, you have one last chance

598
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:12,848
to stand down!

599
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,319
Funny, I was gonna say the same to you.

600
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:17,588
Hyah!

601
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:51,652
This place is about to explode!

602
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,288
Oliver, we have to go now!

603
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,591
Not without her!

604
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:59,459
Oliver, now!

605
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:04,438
- It's over.
- Is it?

606
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:06,442
I know about your baby.

607
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:32,944
Your family's gonna die.

608
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:34,615
I made sure of it.

609
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,212
Oliver, don't.

610
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:11,400
Oliver.

611
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:12,968
John!

612
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:22,646
Oliver.

613
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,689
Oliver.

614
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,391
Oliver!

615
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,795
What was that?

616
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:41,764
How would I know?

617
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:44,468
I'm just a figment
of your imagination...

618
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:51,207
But if I had to guess,

619
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:55,111
I'd say it's a reminder
of what it feels like.

620
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:58,948
Seeing my loved ones die?

621
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,285
Seeing my family be threatened?

622
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:09,125
What about that don't
I already know? God.

623
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:11,741
Well, then you know
exactly what it feels like

624
00:33:11,744 --> 00:33:13,095
to be your father.

625
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:19,586
The fear, how that leads to vengeance,

626
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,389
how that leads to cruelty.

627
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,639
It's why he abandoned Emiko.

628
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:25,571
It is why she is trying to kill you now.

629
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:27,774
Look, Oliver. I know that you think

630
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:29,405
that you have broken
your father's cycle,

631
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,613
but as long as you are giving in

632
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:35,350
to your worst impulses, you
are never going to be free.

633
00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:38,139
What am I supposed to do?

634
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,423
Just tell me what I'm supposed to do.

635
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:45,727
Lean in to the best parts of yourself...

636
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:49,865
Your loyalty, your selflessness,

637
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:53,102
your courage, your compassion,

638
00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:56,839
and show that side to Emiko.

639
00:33:56,841 --> 00:34:01,643
You are living proof
that people can change,

640
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:05,414
and you have got to find a
way to see that in her, too.

641
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,850
I don't know if I can.

642
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:12,554
That's okay. That's the
risk you got to take.

643
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,423
He should be in there!

644
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:17,593
Oliver!

645
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:19,328
Looks like our time's up.

646
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:27,202
You know, Tommy,

647
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:29,505
I miss you every day.

648
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:31,874
I know,

649
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,911
but I'm always with you.

650
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,795
It's time to wake up now.

651
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:47,256
Hey! He's over here!

652
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:50,959
- You okay?
- We're gonna get you out.

653
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,228
I thought we lost you
there for a second.

654
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,797
Yeah, so did I.

655
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:03,827
Oh, thank god you're alive.

656
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:06,296
Hey. Are you and the... Are you okay?

657
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:07,765
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

658
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,933
Emiko did pay us a visit, though.

659
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:11,301
Emiko was here?

660
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:12,970
Guess she left without killing you.

661
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:14,703
- You got off easy.
- Yeah. Too easy.

662
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:16,140
She must have been after something else.

663
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:17,965
- Our thoughts exactly.
- Yeah, but we checked,

664
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,044
and the only things missing are
a few arrows from the armory.

665
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:21,845
Why would she need Oliver's arrows

666
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:23,614
if we already got blamed
for the attack at the subway?

667
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:25,049
She must have had
something else planned.

668
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:26,722
Yeah, but Emiko thinks she killed us.

669
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,153
How could she pin a second attack
against a group of dead vigilantes?

670
00:35:29,155 --> 00:35:30,821
Well, the public doesn't
know that you're dead yet.

671
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:33,104
Just got an APB. Green Arrow sighted

672
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:34,957
outside of SCPD, shots fired.

673
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,660
At least now we know what she was after.

674
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,028
Oliver, we walk in there, we're going

675
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,197
in as wanted criminals.

676
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,734
Let's gear back up.
We've got to move fast.

677
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:51,351
Ah. William, right on time.

678
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:54,031
After our last meeting, I'd
hoped to hear from you again,

679
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,867
but I never expected it to be so soon.

680
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,203
Well, you know what they say...

681
00:35:57,206 --> 00:35:58,594
Strike while the iron's hot.

682
00:35:58,597 --> 00:35:59,750
- Ha!
- Heh heh heh.

683
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:01,120
I hope you don't mind,

684
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:02,819
but I was so excited when you said you

685
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:04,788
wanted to discuss our ZETA program

686
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,193
that I invited the man
who inspired it to join us.

687
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:10,994
Mr. Harris.

688
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:13,163
Mayor Ramirez. Heh.

689
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:15,299
You two know each other?

690
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:17,167
By reputation.

691
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:20,904
I bought Harris Consolidated
the day of its IPO.

692
00:36:20,906 --> 00:36:24,274
- Smart man.
- Well, we've done well enough.

693
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:26,342
Speaking of my profit margins,

694
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:27,778
who do I have to sleep with to get

695
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,445
Harris Consolidated in on those ZETAs?

696
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,925
I mean, your commercial was impressive,

697
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,819
but stopping vigilantes?

698
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,401
It's microthinking.

699
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,757
If you really want this
program to be profitable,

700
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:41,658
you have to think macro.

701
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,112
I mean, imagine what an army of ZETAs

702
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,196
could do on a grander scale,

703
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,426
and with Harris
consolidated's global reach,

704
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:52,435
why, Galaxy One could change
more than just Star City.

705
00:36:52,438 --> 00:36:54,138
It could change the world.

706
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,910
If you'll excuse me a moment, gentlemen,

707
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:02,258
something's come up which
requires my immediate attention.

708
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,815
Of course.

709
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:10,587
Have you lost your damn mind?

710
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:11,948
You nearly blew my cover.

711
00:37:11,951 --> 00:37:13,791
I'm sorry. It was a
calculated risk I had to take

712
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:14,979
to access Dale's files.

713
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,160
Is that why you've been
checking your watch?

714
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:17,723
You've been hacking him this whole time?

715
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:19,112
And now I have his blindspot code.

716
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:21,716
We should get out of here
before Dale figures that out.

717
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,236
Seems I already have, Mr. Harris,

718
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:28,071
or do you prefer Clayton?

719
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,773
Such a pleasure to finally meet the son

720
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:32,843
of Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak.

721
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:34,711
As for you, Mr. Mayor,

722
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,581
I'm afraid we've reached the
end of your political career.

723
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,184
Seize them.

724
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,969
So you're the fool who's responsible

725
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,635
for this whole Archer mess.

726
00:37:58,637 --> 00:38:01,872
You're the kid Felicity
went into hiding for.

727
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:03,707
I can see you got a
lot of your mom in you.

728
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,305
Well, that's not all you're
gonna see if you don't step back.

729
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:09,312
Alena has agreed to
help us destroy Archer

730
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:11,081
for real this time, isn't that right?

731
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,583
Well, now that you've
frozen my bank account

732
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:15,620
and shredded my passport, yes, I have.

733
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,060
I'm sorry about your Canaries.

734
00:38:24,063 --> 00:38:26,163
I never meant for Archer
to be used like that.

735
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:29,600
And how exactly did you
mean for it to be used

736
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,501
after you stole it from Smoak Tech

737
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:33,273
and sold it to Galaxy One?

738
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:35,939
It started as a software licensing deal

739
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,275
till Keven Dale turned it
into a hostile takeover.

740
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:40,848
Once he had Archer, he
threatened to use it to hunt

741
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,984
and kill everyone I loved
unless I disappeared,

742
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,682
so that's what I did

743
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:47,584
to protect them.

744
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:50,387
Why don't you get to
work taking down Archer,

745
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:53,824
so we can all come out of hiding?

746
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:56,187
I guess 3 genius brains
are better than 1.

747
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,863
Speaking of geniuses, where is William?

748
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:03,333
I spoke to him right
after you and Roy left.

749
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:04,635
Oh. Where the hell is he?

750
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,772
Mom, what's wrong?

751
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:10,207
That sequence that William ran

752
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:12,442
to steal Keven Dale's blindspot code,

753
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:13,925
I think he used it.

754
00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:16,765
How? I thought you said he could
only use it if he actually went...

755
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,394
Frak!

756
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,820
By the authority of Galaxy One,

757
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:22,353
you are under arrest.

758
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:30,011
Oh, my God. It's a slaughter.

759
00:39:36,302 --> 00:39:37,935
What happened?

760
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:39,925
I thought it was you.

761
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:43,739
Somebody dressed like you stole
the weapon from the subway.

762
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:44,975
Spread out and find Emiko.

763
00:39:44,977 --> 00:39:46,411
Wild Dog, on me.

764
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:56,320
Hyah!

765
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:57,722
Raah!

766
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:08,765
Hyah! Aah!

767
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:11,401
Emiko!

768
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,071
You just refuse to die.

769
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:24,354
Emiko has the weapon,
and she's up on the roof.

770
00:40:24,357 --> 00:40:27,691
Copy that. We'll meet you there.

771
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:31,159
Emiko, stop!

772
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,693
Don't make me do this.

773
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:39,863
You are supposed to be dead,

774
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,965
but this will be even better.

775
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:44,701
You can watch me burn
your city to the ground.

776
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:48,739
Haven't you seen enough death?

777
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:53,677
Your mother, our father.

778
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,747
I want you to be better than him.

779
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:59,483
I want you to help me...

780
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:02,187
Help me end our family's
cycle of violence.

781
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,519
We are not family.

782
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:10,094
Do it. Kill me.

783
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,500
No.

784
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:29,046
She has the weapon.

785
00:41:29,048 --> 00:41:31,214
And we have no idea
where she's gonna use it.

786
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:33,316
- We'll find her.
- Guys, we got company.

787
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:35,484
This is SCPD aerial support.

788
00:41:35,487 --> 00:41:36,920
Hold your positions.

789
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:42,823
