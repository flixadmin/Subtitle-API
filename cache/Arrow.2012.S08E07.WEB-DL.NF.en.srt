00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:01,877
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,170
-I NEED YOUR HELP, ROY.
-YOU REALLY THINK

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,839
AN ENERGY WEAPON'S
GONNA STOP THIS MONITOR GUY?

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,633
OLIVER: WE GOT THE PLUTONIUM
WITH AN ASSIST FROM ROY.

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,134
YOU'RE WORKING
WITH THE MONITOR.

6
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,595
MAR NOVU IS TRYING
TO SAVE WORLDS,
NOT DESTROY THEM.

7
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,054
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BELIEVE IT.

8
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,515
[TRANQ DARTS FIRING]

9
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,851
LYLA: THE ONLY WAY TO WIN
IS TO ACCEPT THE INEVITABLE.

10
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,477
MIA: WHERE THE HELL
ARE WE?

11
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,103
WE'RE ON LIAN YU.

12
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,527
OLIVER: THE NAME OF THE ISLAND
THEY FOUND ME ON IS LIAN YU.

13
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,738
IT'S MANDARIN
FOR PURGATORY.

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,032
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY.

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:37,162
THE MEMORIES, THE PAIN,
I'VE NEVER ESCAPED THEM.

16
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,914
THEY'RE ALWAYS WITH ME,

17
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,750
A REMINDER OF WHAT I HAD
TO ENDURE

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,838
WITH ONLY ONE THOUGHT,
ONE GOAL...

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,465
SURVIVE.

20
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:53,554
TO SAVE THE MULTIVERSE,
I MUST BECOME SOMETHING ELSE.

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:58,684
TO DO THAT, I HAVE TO RETURN
TO WHERE MY JOURNEY BEGAN...

22
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,227
PURGATORY.

23
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,110
SO THIS IS THE FAMOUS
LIAN YU.

24
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,989
WILLIAM: I DID NOT
WANT A RETURN TICKET
TO THIS PLACE.

25
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,283
THE 3 OF YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE
AND SOUND IN STAR CITY.

26
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,827
HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

27
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,203
CONNOR: A BUNCH OF GUYS
IN TAC GEAR CAME

28
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,621
AND STORMED THE BUNKER.

29
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,122
A.R.G.U.S. AGENTS.

30
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,833
SOUNDS JUST AS FUN
AS TRANQ DARTS.

31
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,668
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I NEEDED YOU HERE,

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,294
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO CONVINCE YOU.

33
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,796
JOHN: WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON, LYLA?

34
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,172
LYLA: MAR NOVU NEEDS US
TO BUILD A WEAPON,

35
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,841
AND IT HAS TO BE DONE
ON THIS ISLAND.

36
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,885
JOHN: I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING FOR THAT GUY.

37
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,386
JOHN, WE HAVE TO.

38
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,183
JOHN: SINCE WHEN DO
WE TAKE ORDERS
FROM THE ENEMY?

39
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,644
WE WERE WRONG
ABOUT NOVU, JOHN.

40
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,896
HE'S NOT OUR ENEMY.

41
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,480
SINCE WHEN?

42
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,190
HE DROPPED ME
IN AN ALTERNATE REALITY

43
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,734
IN ORDER TO TEACH ME
THE LESSON THAT

44
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,527
TO FIX THE MULTIVERSE

45
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,821
WE NEED TO WORK
WITH HIM.

46
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,073
THIS IS CRAZY.

47
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,490
I KNOW IT'S HARD
TO HEAR, JOHNNY,

48
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,409
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

49
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,827
OLIVER: JOHN...

50
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,833
HOW DO WE BUILD
THE WEAPON?

51
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,251
THE MATERIALS WE NEED
ARE ALREADY HERE

52
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,836
IN THE CRATES OUTSIDE.

53
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,713
DR. WONG HAS BEEN
EXPERIMENTING

54
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,673
WITH THE DWARF STAR PARTICLES
SINCE LEAVING HONG KONG.

55
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,341
HE'S DESIGNED SCHEMATICS
FOR THE BUILD.

56
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,552
WILLIAM: SCHEMATICS?
WHY DOES THAT MAKE
ME THINK

57
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,888
THAT THIS DR. WONG GUY
WON'T ACTUALLY
BUILD THIS THING?

58
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,389
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU
FOR THAT.

59
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,016
-SAY AGAIN?
-THE DEVICE IS POWERED

60
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,517
BY PLUTONIUM.

61
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,519
DINAH, ROY, AND RENE
ARE ON THEIR WAY HERE

62
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,938
WITH SAMPLES
FROM STAR CITY.

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,439
SO MY MISSION
WAS PART OF THIS?

64
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,066
ALL OF OUR MISSIONS
ARE A PART OF THIS.

65
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,195
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

66
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,991
WHAT AM I DOING
BACK ON LIAN YU?

67
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,534
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS,
THE ISLAND HAS SEEN

68
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,161
A RASH
OF ENERGY SPIKES.

69
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,080
IS THAT YOUR REASON
FOR IT BEING GREEN?

70
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,206
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME
THAT I WAS HERE,

71
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,001
ADRIAN CHASE BLEW IT UP.

72
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,794
YES. HARNESSING
THAT ENERGY IS THE KEY,

73
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,587
AND WE NEED TO DO IT
RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE

74
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,172
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW
LONG THE ENERGY SPIKES
WILL LAST.

75
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,802
OK. WAIT. SO WE BUILD
THIS MAGIC WEAPON
FOR THE SPACE GOD

76
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,470
AND WE STOP CRISIS?

77
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,388
THERE IS NO STOPPING
CRISIS.

78
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,932
WELL, THEN WHAT'S
THE WEAPON FOR?

79
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,517
I DON'T KNOW,

80
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,185
BUT NOVU SAID THIS
IS HOW WE SURVIVE IT,

81
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,646
AND I BELIEVE HIM.

82
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,439
IF WE CAN'T STOP
CRISIS...

83
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,696
SORRY.

84
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,949
WHAT IS HE
TALKING ABOUT?

85
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,076
OH, MY GOD.

86
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,621
WOULD THE GROUP MIND
IF I HAD A MOMENT
WITH MY KIDS?

87
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,247
OF COURSE.

88
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,593
THERE'S NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS.

89
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,805
MAR NOVU HAS SEEN
MY FATE.

90
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,431
I DON'T SURVIVE CRISIS.

91
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,393
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-I MEAN THAT HE TOLD ME

92
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,188
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME
THE DAY THAT HE WALKED IN

93
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,898
AND ASKED FOR MY HELP.

94
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,234
AND WHEN EXACTLY
WERE YOU PLANNING
ON TELLING US?

95
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,196
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING
MY FATE BECAUSE
OF THE TWO OF YOU,

96
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,700
AND I CAN'T FIGHT IT,
I CAN'T CHANGE IT.

97
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,702
SO YOU'RE JUST
GIVING UP?

98
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,705
I AM ATTEMPTING TO
SAVE THE MULTIVERSE,

99
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,834
AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP
THE TWO OF YOU SAFE.

100
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,086
WE'RE GONNA
BUILD THE WEAPON,

101
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,379
WE'RE GONNA FINISH
THIS MISSION,

102
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,717
AND THAT'S THE WAY
THAT IT HAS TO BE.

103
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,761
WELL, THEN I GUESS
WE BETTER GET TO IT.

104
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,898
LYLA, WHAT HAPPENED TO
NO MORE SECRETS
BETWEEN US?

105
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,277
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
TELL YOU.

106
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,071
SO YOU THOUGHT
TRANQING ME
AND BRINGING ME HERE

107
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,364
OF ALL PLACES WAS SOMEHOW
A BETTER EXPLANATION.

108
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,617
MAR NOVU MADE IT CLEAR
THAT SILENCE WAS

109
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,577
A REQUIREMENT
OF THE MISSION.

110
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,204
WE COULDN'T RISK
INTERFERING

111
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,914
WITH THE JOURNEYS
OF THE OTHER PLAYERS.

112
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,251
AS IN OLIVER'S JOURNEY
ENDING IN A DEATH SENTENCE?

113
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,961
WHAT DID NOVU ASK YOU
TO DO, LYLA?

114
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,755
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME
DETAILS.

115
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,340
HE JUST TOLD ME THAT
WHEN THE TIME COMES

116
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,926
I WOULD KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

117
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,720
YOU'RE JUST FINE
WITH THAT? WHY?

118
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,139
FAITH.

119
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,397
YOU REMEMBER THAT IED
THAT TOOK OUT MY UNIT
IN AFGHANISTAN.

120
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,275
I REMEMBER THAT.
OF COURSE I DO.

121
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,236
YOU WERE
THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

122
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,863
TOOK YOU YEARS TO STOP
HAVING NIGHTMARES
ABOUT THAT BLAST.

123
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,406
MAR NOVU WHEN HE
FIRST CAME TO ME,

124
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,326
HE TOLD ME HE
RESCUED ME THAT DAY

125
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,620
BECAUSE I HAVE
A GREATER PURPOSE.

126
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,789
-AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?
-A GROWN MAN IN COSTUME

127
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,332
PROPHESIZING
THE APOCALYPSE?

128
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,417
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A JOKE,

129
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,336
BUT THEN HE CAME
TO ME AGAIN,

130
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:43,010
AND HE SHOWED ME US,
OUR FUTURE

131
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:49,057
JUST WIPED AWAY,
GONE AS IF IT
NEVER EXISTED.

132
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,642
SO YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH HIM?

133
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,435
WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER
TO FIND HEROES

134
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,940
STRONG ENOUGH
TO FACE THIS CRISIS.

135
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,027
HE TOLD ME IT WAS
THE ONLY WAY I COULD
PROTECT OUR FAMILY.

136
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,074
[SIGHS]

137
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:11,288
LYLA, YOU MAY HAVE
ACCEPTED THAT THIS WAS
THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE FORWARD,

138
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,622
BUT I HAVE NOT.

139
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,708
[SIGHS]

140
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,584
I WON'T.

141
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,723
GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED THE BLACK CANARY
KNOWS HOW TO FLY.

142
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,768
FLYING'S EASY.
LANDING'S THE HARD PART.

143
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,436
KIDDING.

144
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,107
THERE IT IS...

145
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,109
PURGATORY.

146
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,402
LOOKS A LITTLE LESS
BOMBED OUT THAN
I REMEMBER.

147
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,530
WOW. AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS PLACE,

148
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,199
I DIDN'T IMAGINE
IT TO BE SO...

149
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,742
TERRIFYING?

150
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,993
BEAUTIFUL.

151
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,037
MAKES SENSE YOU'D
THINK SO

152
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,788
SINCE APPARENTLY
YOU'RE MOVING HERE.

153
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,790
MAYBE NOT.

154
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,961
THIS TIME AROUND,
YOU ARE PART
OF A TEAM.

155
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,963
ISLAND TEAM,

FOR A RELATIVELY
SMOOTH LANDING.

WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

162
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,313

SAY, "INCOMING"?

CAN YOU READ ME?

TOLD US WE WEREN'T ALONE.

GOT THE COORDINATES,

182

BUT THE PLUTONIUM LANDED
IN A DIFFERENT SPOT.

183

THERE'S A TRACKER
IN THE CASE,

BUT IT'S NOWHERE
NEAR RENE, DINAH, OR ROY.

JOHN: THE PEOPLE
ARE THE PRIORITY.

186
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,363
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
BUT WE STILL NEED
THE PLUTONIUM

OLIVER: WHATEVER
THE 3 OF YOU DO,
JUST BE CAREFUL.

194
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,917
WE DON'T KNOW WHO
THESE PEOPLE ARE
OR WHAT THEY WANT.

195

JOHN: COPY THAT.

196
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,465
AND I GUESS THAT
MEANS, WHAT, THE 3 OF US,

197
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,009
WE ARE ON
NUCLEAR WEAPON DUTY?

WITH THAT?

200

PROTECT WILLIAM.

THANK YOU.

204

WILLIAM SYNCED THIS MAP
TO THE PLUTONIUM'S LOCATION.

205
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,366
IT'S GONNA GET US
CLOSE TO THE CASE,

206
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,617
BUT THE COORDINATES
WON'T BE EXACT,

207
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,328
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SWEEP THE AREA.

208
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,455
WELL, THE SOONER
WE FIND IT, THE BETTER

209
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,291
BECAUSE I AM NOT
A FAN OF THIS ISLAND.

210
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,294
YEAH? WELL, IT HAS
THAT EFFECT ON PEOPLE.

211
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,048
YOU KNOW, I, UH...
I NEVER EXPECTED

212
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,468
TO BE ON A MISSION
WITH YOU LIKE THIS,
YOU KNOW.

213
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,927
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

214
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,598
NO OFFENSE,
BUT SHOULDN'T
THIS KODAK MOMENT

215
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,767
BE WITH YOU
AND SOMEONE ELSE?

216
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,728
-WHAT?
-YOU AND MIA.

217
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,604
OH. TRYING TO
GIVE HER A LITTLE SPACE.

218
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,440
SURE YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO AVOID A DIFFICULT
CONVERSATION?

219
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,068
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
TO ME, LAUREL.

220
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,737
OLIVER, DON'T BE
AN IDIOT, OK?

221
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,156
ALL THAT GIRL WANTS
TO DO IS LIVE UP
TO HER FATHER.

222
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,077
FINE. ALL THIS FATHER
WANTS IS TO COMPLETE
THIS MISSION

223
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,789
SO THAT MY KIDS
ACTUALLY HAVE
A WORLD TO LIVE IN.

224
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,250
WE ARE ALMOST THERE.
COME ON.

A PIECE OF ADVICE.

227
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,171
DON'T LEAVE THIS ISLAND
WITH MORE REGRETS

228
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,839
THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE
BURIED HERE.

229
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,557
OH. BUILDING THIS WEAPON
WITH 2019 TECH MAY
ACTUALLY KILL ME.

230
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,058
I MISS THE FUTURE.

231
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,065
WHAT'S THIS?

232
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,318
THOSE ARE VERY VOLATILE
DWARF STAR PARTICLES

233
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,115
THAT COULD LEVEL
AN ENTIRE CITY
OR ISLAND.

234
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,325
ALL RIGHT. WHAT CAN I DO
TO HELP, HUH?

235
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,328
WELL, DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO CALCULATE
THE VOLUME OF A SPHERE?

236
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,373
4/3 PI TIMES
RADIUS CUBED.

237
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,959
I WAS RAISED
BY FELICITY, TOO, REMEMBER?

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,336
RIGHT. WELL, DO YOU
KNOW WHAT THE PAULI
EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE

239
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,796
OF QUANTUM PHYSICS IS?

240
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,923
DIDN'T PAY
THAT MUCH ATTENTION.

241
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,633
WELL, THEN THAT
PRETTY MUCH TAKES YOU
OUT OF THE RUNNING

242
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,386
OF HELPING ME
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.

A WIRE STRIPPER.

COMPLICATED CODING

AND I'M INCLUDING 2040
WHEN I SAY, "EVER."

IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO HIDE OUT
IN THE BUNKER

248
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,364
AND MISS OUT
ON ALL THE ACTION.

249
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,032
STILL MAD AT DAD?

250
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,288
IT'S HIS LIFE.

251
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,707
HE CAN DO WHATEVER
HE WANTS WITH IT, RIGHT?

252
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,335
ALWAYS HAS.

253
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,961
YOU'RE BEING A BIT
HARSH, DON'T YOU THINK?

254
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,798
AND YOU ARE BEING
A BIT CHILL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

255
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,883
I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

256
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,638
YEAH. HE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A HERO FIRST

257
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,390
AND A DAD SECOND.

258
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,559

TRUSTED HIM.

TO KNOW MY FUTURE SON
OVER A MEAL,

262
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,573
NOT EN ROUTE
TO A PLANE CRASH.

263
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,493
THIS...THIS FEELS ABOUT
RIGHT FOR OUR FAMILY.

264
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,537

GOT INTERRUPTED

BY SOME SORT
OF INTERNATIONAL
EMERGENCY OR ANOTHER.

266

YEAH. I GUESS
YOUR DAD AND I
WEREN'T REALLY THERE

FOR YOU AND JJ.

YOU WERE THERE
WHEN IT COUNTED.

269

BEYOND PROUD TO BE THE SON

YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT.

00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,180
I THINK MAYBE
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO.

THE BAD GUYS
ON HIS OWN.

464
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,219
-WHY WOULD YOU LET HIM DO THAT?
-SERIOUSLY?

465
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,221
OK. WE HAVE TO
GO AFTER HIM.

466
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,015
LAUREL: NO. NO. WILLIAM
HAS TO FINISH THE WEAPON.

467
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,224
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR WEAPON!

468
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,059
JOHN: OLIVER
KNOWS THIS ISLAND

469
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,726
BETTER
THAN ANYONE, MIA.

470
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,894
HE'LL BE FINE.

471
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,603
PLUS IT'S SMARTER
FOR US TO STICK TOGETHER.

472
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,731
NO. WE ARE NOT LEAVING
HIM OUT THERE.

473
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,773
MIA!

474
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,943
FINE. I'LL GO
ON MY OWN!

475
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,613
-THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
-THEN DON'T COME WITH ME.

476
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,741
YOU HEARD LAUREL.
WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER.

477
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,576
-IT'S SMARTER TACTICALLY.
-ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LECTURE ME

478
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,078
ON TACTICS RIGHT NOW?

479
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,998
WELL...NO,
BUT...

480
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,624
DIG IS RIGHT.

481
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,418
I MEAN, DAD AND THIS ISLAND,
THEY GO WAY BACK,

482
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,961
AND HE KNOWS EVERY
INCH OF THIS PLACE.

483
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,838
YOU GOING OUT THERE
COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE.

484
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,882
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

485
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,384
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

486
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,387
WILLIAM.

487
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,891
LOOK. IT IS OK FOR YOU
TO BE AFRAID OF LOSING HIM

488
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,851
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WAY
THAT YOU LEFT THINGS.

489
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,519
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

490
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,106
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED WITH FELICITY.

491
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,441
YOU WERE ANGRY WITH HER,
BUT YOU STILL WANTED
TO SAVE HER.

492
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,236
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
SIT HERE AND DO
NOTHING, OK?

493
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,864
I WILL NOT LEAVE HIM
ALONE OUT THERE. I...

494
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,284
I WILL NOT...
LET HIM DIE.

495
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,414
I LET MYSELF BELIEVE
FOR JUST...

496
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,210
JUST A MINUTE THAT
I COULD ACTUALLY
HAVE MY DAD.

497
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:39,632
LOOK. WHEN I WAS A KID,
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
PUSHING HIM AWAY

498
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,509
BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT I COULD LOSE HIM,

499
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,095
AND THEN HE DISAPPEARED.

500
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,013
YEAH. NOW WE MIGHT
LOSE HIM AGAIN.

501
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,266
HOW ARE YOU SO
CALM ABOUT THIS?

502
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,101
I'M NOT,
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

503
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,811
FELICITY HAD ME DOWN
IN THAT BUNKER

504
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,562
WATCHING DAD
OUT IN THE FIELD,

505
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,150
AND I SAW THAT HE COULD
CHEAT DEATH MORE
THAN ANYONE,

506
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,735
BUT IF THIS REALLY IS
THE END,

507
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:05,449
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
THE TIME THAT I HAVE
LEFT WITH HIM BEING ANGRY.

508
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,076
DO YOU?

509
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
YAO FEI: I WAS WRONG.
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

510
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,502
STILL THAT IMPATIENT
BOY I FOUND.

511
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,045
YOU REALIZE THAT
INSULTING ME IS NOT GONNA

512
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,922
MAKE THIS GO
ANY FASTER, RIGHT?

513
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:23,301
BREATHE. REMEMBER
IN EVERYTHING, BREATHE.

514
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,305
I'M TRYING TO CUT MY WAY
OUT OF A NET, YAO FEI,
NOT SHOOT AN ARROW.

515
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,765
WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS NET IF YOU
HAD BREATHED

516
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,226
YOU KNOW WHAT FYERS
IS CAPABLE OF, RIGHT?

517
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,936
I NEED TO GET BACK
TO MY FAMILY,

518
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,604
AND I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

519
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,273
YOU COULD BE
WITH YOUR FAMILY,

520
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,774
BUT YOU CHOSE HERE
INSTEAD.

521
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,776
I CHOSE TO PROTECT THEM.

522
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,404
YOU AVOID THEM
BECAUSE YOU'RE
FATED TO DIE.

523
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,657
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING
THAT FATE FOR A LONG TIME.

524
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,577
I'VE ACCEPTED IT.

525
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,080
THAT HASN'T MADE THINGS
ANY EASIER.

526
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,748
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
TO MY KIDS?

527
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,044
WHAT I COULD NOT
TO SHADO.

528
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,462
YOU SAY GOOD-BYE.

529
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,089
I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN.

530
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,887
MY KIDS HAVE SPENT
BASICALLY

531
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,680
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES
WITHOUT ME.

532
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,686
AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO
HAVE TO DO IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

533
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,521
YOU THINK YOU
HAVE FAILED.

534
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:23,110
THE FIRST THING
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME...
SHENGCUN, SURVIVE.

535
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,029
WELL, I CAN'T DO
THAT ANYMORE.

536
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,115
SHENGCUN IS MORE
THAN BODY.

537
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,743
IT IS SPIRIT,
WHAT LIVES ON

538
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,995
LIKE I DID IN SHADO

539
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,330
LIKE SHE DOES I YOU.

540
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,457
THAT IS SURVIVE.

541
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,459
HOW DO I DO THAT?

542
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,754
YOU LIVE NOW

543
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,131
WITH YOUR CHILDREN

544
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,050
WITH THE TIME
YOU HAVE LEFT.

545
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,098
I NEED TO GET OUT
OF THIS NET FIRST.

546
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,058
ALWAYS HAVE PATIENCE.

547
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:03,025
LIKE I SAID,
PATIENCE.

548
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,402
HUH!

549
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,078
JUST CAME BY
TO CHECK ON YOU.
HOW YOU FEELING?

550
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,788
I...I'VE BEEN BETTER.

551
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,088
I'M SO SORRY, ROY.

552
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,840
I SHOULD HAVE FOUND
ANOTHER WAY TO
GET YOU OUT.

553
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,969
THIS WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

554
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,637
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

555
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,434
I MEAN, YOU
WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN THIS SITUATION

556
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,186
IF I HADN'T COME TO
FIND YOU HUB CITY.

557
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:43,107
[SIGHS]

558
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:47,278
ROY...I CAN'T
PROTECT THE PEOPLE
I CARE ABOUT.

559
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,531
YOU KNOW I WORKED
WITH YOU AND OLIVER
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

560
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,285
AND IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING,
IT'S THAT THIS TEAM

561
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:58,164
HAS EACH OTHER'S BACKS
NO MATTER THE COST.

562
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,707
THINGS JUST DIDN'T EXACTLY
GO AS PLANNED.

563
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,293
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

564
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,462
NO, BUT I WOULD
RATHER BE HERE.

565
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,713
I WOULD RATHER BE HERE
WITH YOU

566
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,882
AND WITH THE TEAM
THAN BACK IN HUB CITY,

567
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:13,553
LIVING A LIFE
ALL ALONE.

568
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,640
HEROES MAKE
SACRIFICES, JOHN,

569
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,809
AND FOR BETTER
OR FOR WORSE,

570
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,602
THIS JUST HAD TO BE MINE.

571
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,989
JOHN...WE GOT
A PROBLEM.

572
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,615
FYERS AND HIS MEN
HAVE SURROUNDED THE CAMP.

573
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,201
WE CAN EXPECT AN ATTACK
ANY MINUTE.

574
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,203
HOW LONG BEFORE
THE WEAPON IS READY?

575
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,704
I'M DONE BUILDING IT.
ONCE THE PLUTONIUM
FINISHES

576
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,622
TRANSFERRING THE ENERGY,
I CAN TURN IT ON.

577
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,167
MIA: HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?
WILLIAM: I'M NOT SURE.

578
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,002
DINAH: CAN WE TAKE THIS
TO A SAFER PART
OF THE ISLAND

579
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,712
-AND FINISH IT THERE?
-NO, NO. IT HAS TO BE HERE.

580
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,506
I'VE TAPPED INTO
THE CENTER OF
THE ISLAND'S ENERGY.

581
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,299
-WE CAN'T MOVE.
-AND IT HAS TO BE TONIGHT.

582
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,884
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
THE NEXT ENERGY SPIKE

583
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,511
WILL BE, AND WE
CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT.

584
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,847
OLIVER: WE NEED TO
BUY WILLIAM MORE TIME.

585
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,141
DAD, YOU'RE OK.

586
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,935
YEAH. AN OLD FRIEND
STEERED ME BACK.

587
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,937
I'M SORRY THAT
I TOOK OFF.

588
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,563
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

589
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,607
WILLIAM: YOU'RE
HERE NOW.

590
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,903
LAUREL: HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO BEAT
AN ARMY OF GHOSTS?

591
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,988
POWER UP
THE DEVICE.

592
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,241
THE SPHERE'S ABSORBING
THE ENERGY OF THE ISLAND,

593
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,035
AND IF THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT
THESE DEAD PEOPLE BACK
TO LIFE IN THE FIRST PLACE...

594
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,662
ACTIVATING THE DEVICE
WILL DESTROY THEM.

595
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,622
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT PLUTONIUM HERE.

596
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,124
THAT'S NASTY STUFF.
IT CAN TAKE OUT

597
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,377
THIS ENTIRE ISLAND,
US INCLUDED!

598
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,295
LYLA: IF THIS
IS OUR BEST CHANCE
OF SURVIVING THE CRISIS,

599
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,796
THEN WE NEED TO
TAKE THE RISK.

600
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,299
OLIVER: LYLA'S RIGHT.
SHE'S RIGHT.

601
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,051
THIS IS IT.

602
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,802
THIS IS OUR BEST SHOT.

603
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,265
SUIT UP.

604
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,234
YOU ARE AS FOOLISH
AS EVER, QUEEN.

605
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,319
SURRENDER!

606
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,030
I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT HERE TO
SURRENDER TO ME.

607
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,157
I'M THE ONE WHO
KILLED YOU, FYERS.

608
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,326
I'M VERY PLEASED
TO RETURN THE FAVOR,

609
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,704
A TASK YOU'VE MADE
MUCH EASIER BY
COMING ALONE.

610
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,540
OLIVER: I'M NOT ALONE.

611
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,224
WILLIAM: NOW THAT THE PLUTONIUM
HAS TRANSFERRED THE ENERGY,

612
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,603
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
POWER IT ON,

613
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,187
AND VOILA!

BUT STORIES
ABOUT YOU,

770
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:46,347
YOU KNOW, THIS
LEGENDARY GREEN ARROW
AND HIS TEAM.

771
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,227
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PROUD OF YOU

772
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,439
BECAUSE YOU WERE
A HERO, AND...

773
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,315
ALL I COULD SEE
IS THAT THAT IS

774
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,069
THE REASON THAT
YOU WEREN'T WITH ME,

775
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:04,157
AND IT'S...IT'S KIND OF
HARD TO LET THAT GO.

776
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,535
I NEVER MEANT TO CAUSE
YOU ANY PAIN.

777
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,540
YOUR MOM AND ME JUST
WANTED TO PROTECT YOU.

778
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,626
I KNOW.

779
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,420
I, UH...I UNDERSTAND
THAT NOW.

780
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,927
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

781
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,971
I HAVE HATED THIS PLACE.

782
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,474
JUST I'D THINK
ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT IT TOOK FROM ME.

783
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:34,771
IT WOULD JUST
MAKE ME SO ANGRY.

784
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,314
BUT YOU'RE NOT NOW?

785
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,358
I'M STILL
A LITTLE BIT ANGRY.

786
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,695
THIS ISLAND TAUGHT ME
TO SURVIVE.

787
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,490
IT TURNED ME
INTO SOMEONE ELSE,

788
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,409
SOMEBODY BETTER THAN
THE PERSON I WAS BEFORE.

789
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,958
SO DESPITE MY FEELINGS...

790
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:01,756
THERE ARE NO STORIES
ABOUT THE GREEN ARROW TO TELL

791
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,259
IF I DON'T MAKE MY WAY
TO LIAN YU,

792
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:08,513
AND I'M ALSO NOT STANDING
AT THIS MOMENT

793
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,474
LOOKING AT MY DAUGHTER.

794
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,854
THANK YOU FOR
LETTING ME BE A PART
OF YOUR STORY

795
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,150
EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

796
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,278
MIA, SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE GONNA CREATE
YOUR OWN STORIES.

797
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,834
SO WHAT NOW?

798
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,419
WE NEED TO GET BACK HOME

799
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,839
AND JUST BE PREPARED

800
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,133
FOR WHATEVER'S
COMING NEXT.

801
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,968
OK.

-NOT ANYMORE.

806
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,410
I'M NOW A HARBINGER
OF THINGS TO COME.

807
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,247
-AND THAT'S...
-YES.

808
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,956
THE CRISIS HAS BEGUN.

I'VE TRAVELED
ACROSS WORLDS,

812
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,395
ACROSS THE MULTIVERSE
TO DO ONE THING...

813
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,813
KILL YOU,

814
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,277
AND NOW HERE,
YOU SAVE MY LIFE.

YOUR LIFE ANEW.

817
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,911
THE KNOWLEDGE IS
WITHIN YOU.
