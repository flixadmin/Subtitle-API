1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,245
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,526
When I was a child, I saw my mother
killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,361
My father went to
prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,521
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,646
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,522
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,163
And one day, I'll find who killed my
mother and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,169
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,204
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,402
You killed my mother. Why?

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,849
If you wanna know that,
you're gonna have to catch me.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,921
Not fast enough, Flash.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,682
I love you, Iris. I couldn't
lie to you anymore. I'm sorry.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,402
My name is Barry Allen.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,365
I am not the fastest man alive.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,564
That title belongs
to the man who killed my mother.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,925
But not for long.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,360
That was too close.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,003
- He told me to make it hard.
- He didn't tell you to make him dead.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,569
Remember this is just supposed to be a
training exercise to improve Barry's speed.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,962
Cisco, you gonna
bring it or what?

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,770
Bring it.

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
Why isn't he running away?

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,684
Barry, run away.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,211
Very impressive, Mr. Allen. Your reaction to
stimuli at super speed continues to improve.

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,727
- It's still not enough.
- It will be.

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,882
Keep working like you are.
Stay focused.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,090
You will be ready next time your
man in the yellow suit comes.

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,880
I think you mean
the Reverse-Flash.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,525
What? He said it, not me.

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,922
And he's right. Yellow suit, red
lightning, and evil. The reverse of Barry.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,083
- Meh.
- Actually, I kind of like it.

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,050
I'm so ready for another round.
How many drones do you have?

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,404
Two, and they've got lasers.

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,044
No.

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,245
Told you it would break.

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,602
And the shrink says I'm crazy.

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,808
- What is this place?
- Customs warehouse.

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,771
Imported cars from Europe.

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,371
All worth a fortune.

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,009
Question. How do you suggest you and
I drive all these cars out of here?

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,483
We're not. We're not
stealing anything.

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,368
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,564
Our entrance set off
the silent alarms.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,847
The cops will be arriving
in two minutes and 14 seconds.

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,884
Bring them.

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,721
That's not for the cops...

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,770
as we discussed.

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,403
He'll be here.

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,011
You do hear that, right?

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,968
He's not coming.

52
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
We're leaving.

53
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,963
- This better make sense real fast,
buddy. - It will. Let's go.

54
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,651
- You promised I'd get to do my thing.
- I always keep my promises.

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
Seatbelt.

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,047
- Are you sure nothing's missing?
- That's what the supervisor said.

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,883
I can check again.

58
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,527
- Bar.
- Hey.

59
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,682
Uh, well...

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
the breakage indicates
that the door somehow...

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,285
had zero viscoelasticity
when it hit the ground.

62
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,169
What does that mean
to normal people?

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,001
Sorry. Uh, the steel
shattered like glass.

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,125
It was frozen, Joe.

65
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,041
- Snart.
- He's back.

66
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,086
I thought Snart was
some world-class thief.

67
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,247
All these expensive cars, he didn't
take any of them? Doesn't make sense.

68
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,683
- Eddie, put out an APB on Snart.
- Got it.

69
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,481
Snart wasn't here
to steal anything.

70
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,603
- He was setting a trap.
- For me.

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,001
- And by me, I mean...
- I know what you meant.

72
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,926
God, you're beautiful.

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,850
Mick.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,169
This is a joke. How do you know
this Flash didn't skip town, hm?

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,284
Maybe that's why he didn't
show up. Or maybe he's dead.

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,648
Or maybe someone
smarter than you iced him.

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,928
He's not dead and he
didn't leave town.

78
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,920
You will tell me what we're stealing
this time? We are partners, after all.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,687
This is what we came for.

80
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,850
That's worth money?

81
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,642
It's called Fire & Ice. An
abstract modern-day masterpiece...

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,167
said to represent
the dichotomy of being.

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,922
It represents to me that people
with lots of money buy dumb stuff.

84
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,650
Osgood and Rachel Rathaway, one of
the richest couples in Central City...

85
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,565
paid 25 million
for it in Paris.

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,922
They're flying
home with it today.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,890
Mm.

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,524
Captain Cold is back.

89
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,326
For a non-metahuman, Leonard
Snart is quite the nemesis.

90
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,401
He still has the cold gun, the one
he stole from us. The one I built.

91
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,250
What does he want this time?

92
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,886
The Flash.

93
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,921
If Snart wants a fight,
then I'll give him one.

94
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,130
- Well...
- You don't think I should?

95
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,600
I didn't say that. But, Barry, as fast as
you are, you cannot be everywhere at once.

96
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,209
And it becomes then a question of priorities.
In the last month, you have made...

97
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,046
a commitment to increasing your
speed, enhancing your reflexes.

98
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,248
It's working. You're
getting faster.

99
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,009
Okay, but what am I supposed
to do? Just ignore Snart?

100
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,570
The last time you had a fight
with Snart, a train derailed.

101
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,327
You were lucky to get
all those people to safety.

102
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,287
- Now, if you don't give him that
fight... - He may just back off.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,570
And there'll be no casualties.

104
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,924
Look, Barry, Cisco and I will
work with Joe and the police...

105
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,288
and devise a
way to catch Cold.

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,211
Yes, I said it. Soon as it came
out of my mouth, I heard it.

107
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,927
We can come up with ways
to neutralize Snart.

108
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,283
Listen, Barry, whether or
not you go after Snart...

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,485
that's your choice. We here, we
will do whatever we can to support you.

110
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,924
But after this past Christmas...

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,731
after the events with
the Reverse-Flash...

112
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,686
I just think he poses
a greater threat to all of us.

113
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Okay.

114
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,727
T-minus three days and counting.

115
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,363
Until the big move-in. You
know, I've never had a roommate.

116
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,961
But it did occur to me
if we ever get in a fight...

117
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,404
I can't just storm away and go
home because home will be with you.

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,365
- Are you predicting many arguments?
- Have you met me?

119
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,163
I remember the night we met. I
stopped a mugger who stole your bag.

120
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,409
My hero.

121
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,006
H9)'-

122
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
H9)'-

123
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,004
Eddie, you know where Joe is?

124
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,848
- Uh, I think he's upstairs in your lab.
- Okay. Thanks.

125
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,008
No second thoughts
about moving in together?

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,289
None.

127
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,607
- Joe, hey.
- Hey, I'm glad you're back.

128
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,890
- I've been going over Snarfs file.
- Yeah. I need to talk to you.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,284
Um, as CSI, my work
on this case is done.

130
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,170
And as...

131
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,160
the Flash, I don't think
I can focus on Snart right now.

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,567
Mind telling me
what brought about this change?

133
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,963
This man in yellow,
the man that killed my mom...

134
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,520
he's still out there. I have to be ready
to face him, which means amping up my speed.

135
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,763
It's a question of priorities.

136
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,206
Your mom's killer isn't the only
reason you've been doing this.

137
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,524
You told me if you could use your
powers to save someone, you would.

138
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,688
Look, Dr. Wells and S.T.A.R.
Labs are gonna work with you.

139
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,049
Cisco thinks he has a way to protect
the police against Snart's cold gun.

140
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,646
I understand if you're scared.
We talked about this.

141
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,002
Of course I'm scared, Joe.

142
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,047
This guy could run into the precinct and
kill everyone in seconds. He threatened Iris.

143
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,604
I won't let him hurt the most
important people in my life again.

144
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,283
If that means devoting every second I have
outside this place to getting faster...

145
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,126
and stopping him, that's what
I'm gonna do. I've made up my mind.

146
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,040
Aw.

147
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,369
McSnurtle the
turtle. How you been?

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,604
When did you stop sleeping with
this? He was your favorite.

149
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,082
He was. But if I remember correctly,
you took him away from me...

150
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,290
after I broke your Duke Ellington
Live at the Blue Note vinyl.

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,643
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

152
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,289
- You can have him back.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,331
L-leh-

154
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,922
Oh, Dad.

155
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,729
I'm gonna miss you, baby.

156
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,442
- Dad, I'm only 10 minutes away.
- I know.

157
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,367
Ah, don't you worry about me.
I'll be fine. Just like always.

158
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,884
_H6Y- _H6Y-

159
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,764
Came to help her pack?

160
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,801
Oh, no. No, no, no. Iris said
that she had something for me?

161
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,724
Oh. Ahem.

162
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,963
I found this in my closet. Heh.

163
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,724
I haven't seen this in years.

164
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,961
Well, the nerd survival
kit is still intact.

165
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,325
Wow.

166
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,366
Heh. I thought those
might be worth something.

167
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,485
Uh, I am so late for work.

168
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,807
I promise I'll clean
this up when I get back.

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,927
- Bye.
- Bye.Yeah.Heh.

170
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,441
Okay.

171
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,842
You mind telling me what's
going on with you and Iris?

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,684
- Nothing.
- Hm.

173
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,565
That's funny because I have
these two things called eyes...

174
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,206
and it doesn't look
like you two are fine.

175
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,131
I told Iris.

176
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,530
You told Iris you're the Flash?

177
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,362
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

178
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,401
I told her how I felt about her.

179
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,924
- Oh, God.
- Mm-hm.

180
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,366
What'd she say?

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,005
Well, I mean, she's still moving
in with Eddie, isn't she?

182
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,684
I just wanna pretend like it never even
happened. That's what we're both doing, so...

183
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,522
Well, not saying how you feel is what
got you in this mess in the first place.

184
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,922
Speaking of which, we both know she's not
gonna clean this mess up anytime soon.

185
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,125
No.

186
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,689
Sure.

187
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,091
Uh, excuse me. If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

188
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,121
You have our
attention, Mr. Ramon.

189
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,368
Okay, check it.

190
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,610
So Dr. Wells and I, we took
your ballistic shields and...

191
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,970
And we lined them with a pretty
sweet compacted heating ribbon...

192
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,566
designed to repel
temperature attacks...

193
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,089
especially those reaching absolute
zero, like Captain Cold's gun.

194
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,040
That's supposed to keep us from
getting turned into popsicles?

195
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,248
Um, yeah. Yeah, they will.

196
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,331
How are we supposed to trust anything from
S.T.A.R. Labs after you nuked the city?

197
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,685
You're right.

198
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,009
You're right.
You shouldn't trust us.

199
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,488
What happened a year ago,
that was our fault.

200
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,011
And we can't change the past,
as much as we wish we could.

201
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,330
But tomorrow is a different story.
Tomorrow's a different thing.

202
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,886
We just want the chance
to make things better.

203
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,490
Observe.

204
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,003
Dummies are one thing...

205
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,802
my officers are another.

206
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,129
You seem pleased with
yourself, doctor.

207
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,807
Well, I'm just happy to help
the police catch Snart, Joe.

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,369
- Barry might be able to help too. - I think
Cisco's heat shields are up to the task.

209
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,442
Joe, if Barry feels he's gonna
endanger lives by taking on Snart...

210
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,202
and feels he's gonna save lives by
training to take on the man in yellow...

211
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,806
that's his call.

212
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,171
You know what makes
Barry so special?

213
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,561
He wants to help everyone
he can, however he can.

214
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,451
Always has. Until now.

215
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,247
I guess it's just a question
of priorities, then.

216
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,883
You know, Barry said the
exact same thing to me.

217
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,762
I thought, "Doesn't sound like him."
I guess because it sounds like you.

218
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,480
- Hey.
- Aah!

219
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,290
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

220
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,410
- It's okay. I was just kind of focused.
- Gotcha.

221
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,766
What's Firestorm?

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,800
One of the last things Ronnie
said to me before he flew away.

223
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,411
My dead fiancé can fly. Haven't
broke that to my parents yet.

224
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,522
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I just...

225
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,650
I told Iris how
I felt about her.

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,368
- Bold choice.
- I knew where we stood before.

227
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,726
We're best friends and, I don't know, now I
just don't know what's normal for us anymore.

228
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,730
Before I met Ronnie, I knew exactly what
was going to happen every day of my life.

229
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,207
It was predictable.
I like predictable.

230
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,691
But when Ronnie and I started
dating, everything started to change.

231
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,165
He made me try Indian food
and scuba diving.

232
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,529
At first it was scary,
but then it was better.

233
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,171
Things weren't really normal with you pining
after Iris and her being totally unaware.

234
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,763
Whatever happens next,
it will be better.

235
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,050
Wait, Caitlin.

236
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,761
- Scuba.
- What about it?

237
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,649
"Self-contained underwater breathing
apparatus." It's an acronym.

238
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,681
What if Firestorm isn't a word?

239
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,890
"Fusion ignition research
experiment and science...

240
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,527
of transmutation originating
RNA and molecular structures."

241
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,730
It's 800 pages.

242
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,651
There's a lot of stuff in there, but it
mostly focuses on transmutation, which is...

243
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,481
the process of altering the structure
of an element by unzipping atoms...

244
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,445
And rebuilding it to create
an entirely new element.

245
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,962
Yeah. Well, the article
was co-written by Jason Rusch...

246
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,886
a grad student here at Hudson University.
If anybody knows what happened to Ronnie...

247
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,690
Maybe he does.

248
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,962
- Maybe.
- Thanks.

249
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,329
- Pleasant flight, Mrs. Rathaway?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.

250
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,087
Careful, please.
It's worth a fortune.

251
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,967
- Welcome home, Mr. Rathaway.
- Thank you, Ethan.

252
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,330
Sir, your son, Hartley,
he called again.

253
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,682
We don't have a son anymore.

254
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,244
Someone better call 911.

255
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,207
Move! Move!

256
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,091
Snart, freeze.

257
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,880
Mick.

258
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,010
- Aah!
- What the hell?

259
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,561
Why do they call you
people "the heat"?

260
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,922
I'm the heat.

261
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,331
Forget them, Mick.

262
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,043
- Get ready for him.
- It's beautiful.

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,240
Mick.

264
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,800
Mick.

265
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,045
Mick.

266
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,080
We go. Now.

267
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,803
Is he all right?

268
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,080
Okay.

269
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,805
- Hey. Hey, are you okay?
- I'll call you back.

270
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,209
I'm fine.

271
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,210
Snarfs new partner, he's got
this handheld flamethrower.

272
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,530
Almost everyone was treated on the scene,
but we got two in the Burn Unit though.

273
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,567
- I'm sorry. I should've
listened to you. - It's all good.

274
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,045
Next time Snart and his pyro pal show up, you
make them sorry they ever messed with you.

275
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,528
I gotta call the hospital.

276
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,007
The cop's bullet ruptured the
secondary internal fuel chamber.

277
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,047
Could have been worse. You were right to get me
to learn every part and circuit of this thing.

278
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,051
Repairing it was a snap.

279
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,291
Give me one reason
I don't kill you right now.

280
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,643
It's gonna be hard to find someone
else to listen to your speeches.

281
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,050
You lost it out there just like the last
job. You lost focus, became obsessed.

282
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,847
I'm obsessed? What about you?
You're usually counting the seconds.

283
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,244
Got the whole thing planned out.
Dotting T's, crossing I's.

284
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,488
But all you care about
now is the Flash.

285
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,449
- We have to put him down.
- Why?

286
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,811
We got the finger painting. It's worth
millions. It's ours. We're rich. Job done.

287
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,571
What about the next job?
And the job after that?

288
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,885
With weapons like these, no one can stand
against us. No one except the Flash.

289
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,567
If you want out, take
the painting and go.

290
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,170
But if you want Central City to be our home,
where we can do and take whatever we want...

291
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,765
this is our chance.

292
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,328
Your chance.

293
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,925
Mm.

294
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,047
Very motivational.
How do we get him?

295
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,724
The Flash isn't so
different from us.

296
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,249
- He's got partners too.
- Hm.

297
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,481
- Jason Rusch?
- Yes. Uh, Dr. Snow?

298
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,604
Please, call me Caitlin.
Uh, thank you for meeting me.

299
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,441
Happy to. Although to be totally
upfront, if this is about the résumé...

300
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,161
I mailed to S.T.A.R. Labs, I've
accepted a position at Mercury Labs.

301
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,124
Uh, no, actually. I wanted to
talk to you about FIRESTORM.

302
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,569
I'm sorry. Uh, this was
a mistake. I have to go.

303
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,049
No. Look, someone I care about is in trouble,
and you're the only clue I have to help him.

304
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,246
Please.

305
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,081
What's the line? I never got paranoid
until they started plotting against me?

306
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,842
Why would they be
plotting against you?

307
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,481
Because of our work.
Because of FIRESTORM.

308
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,685
Transmutation. The ability to
alter matter on a molecular level.

309
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,161
We had rudimentary success
with our stage one testing...

310
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,324
working with sand grains.
But Professor Stein said...

311
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,849
Sorry. Professor Martin Stein? He
was the co-author of the paper?

312
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,171
Yeah, he was our team leader. He didn't believe
in baby steps, so we skipped to stage three.

313
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,560
Which was?

314
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,123
We melted a concrete wall.

315
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,763
But the university
threatened to shut us down...

316
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,131
so Professor Stein published his paper
without permission. They went nuts.

317
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,926
He talked to a friend of his
to secure private backing.

318
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,687
- And who was that? - He didn't say.
He just said he'd call me later.

319
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,770
And no one has seen or heard
from Professor Stein since.

320
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,082
What do you think
happened to him?

321
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,962
All I know is that the Army showed up the
next day and confiscated all of our research.

322
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,965
So tell me, Dr. Snow, do you
think I'm being too paranoid...

323
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,804
or not paranoid enough?

324
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,049
Car trouble?

325
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,684
I hope we're not enemies.

326
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,443
What? No, of course not.

327
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,481
I thought you might blame me.

328
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,283
For pushing you to pursue your
training rather than help the police.

329
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,004
Look, I'm an adult.

330
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,005
I make my own choices,
my own mistakes.

331
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,963
And I'm glad you
push me to be better.

332
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,440
It's so weird. There was
a time in my life that...

333
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,726
I would have paid money for
your autograph. And now we're...

334
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,649
Partners.

335
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,248
I was gonna say friends.

336
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,208
In case you doubt it,
you push me to be better too.

337
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,049
Guys, you have to
come look at this.

338
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,762
When the heat gun was fired, it
increased the surrounding temperature...

339
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,766
of the air dramatically. Sort
of like an extreme heat wave.

340
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,810
- Heat Wave.
- Stop doing that.

341
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,125
Okay. I measured the temperature output
of both the cold and heat guns, right?

342
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,130
And while the cold gun
achieves absolute zero...

343
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,723
the heat gun reaches absolute hot, or
the hottest temperature an object can reach.

344
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,002
Planck temperature.

345
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,363
So potentially, these two guns
could cancel each other out.

346
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,683
Yeah, but to do that, you'd
have to make them cross streams.

347
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,564
You mean like Ghostbusters?

348
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,047
That film is surprisingly
scientifically accurate.

349
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,680
And really quite funny.

350
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,888
Hey, Joe. What's up?

351
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,770
- Joe. Anything?
- There's no sign of Caitlin.

352
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,609
Oh, my God.

353
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,049
- We're getting her back. We have
to find Snart. - Damn right we do.

354
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,730
Come on, let's go.

355
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,323
Joe. Joe. We got a hit.

356
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,410
Second pair of prints.
They belong to a Mick Rory.

357
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,210
- Who is he?
- Big-time arsonist.

358
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,926
He and Snart worked a job
last year that went bad.

359
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,402
Half of Rory's body was burned in
a fire that got out of control.

360
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,922
He escaped from an ambulance.
Hasn't been seen since.

361
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,848
Why would they kidnap
someone like Caitlin?

362
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,287
Joe. Thawne. It's
on every station.

363
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,929
Greetings, citizens
of Central City.

364
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,045
I am Leonard Snan',
but you can call me Cold.

365
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,291
I'm gonna make this
very simple for everyone.

366
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,644
That red streak you've been
hearing whispers about.

367
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,925
The one mysteriously saving
people these past few months?

368
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,971
Well, surprise, he's real.

369
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,442
He calls himself the Flash.

370
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,002
Porter and Maine.
Tonight. Sundown.

371
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,281
Come out, come out, wherever you are,
Flash. Show the whole world you're real.

372
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,686
Or this woman dies.

373
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,003
No, don't come for me.
Stay away. He'll hurt...

374
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,807
You're a friend of
his, huh? He's fast.

375
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,920
Like fire.

376
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,006
Fire, it's undefinable.

377
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,850
Heat, light, energy.

378
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,287
It's an evolution
when things burn.

379
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,010
You're sick.

380
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,327
Maybe you're the sick ones.
You ever think about that?

381
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,802
- Not really.
- Mm.

382
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,167
You've got third-degree burns.

383
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,283
Why didn't you get skin grafts?

384
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,609
The fire revealed my true self.
It showed me who I really am.

385
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,721
I wonder what your Flash will reveal
when I burn his suit and skin off?

386
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,970
Do whatever you want to me,
but leave him alone.

387
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,290
Ooh.

388
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,129
Okay.

389
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,205
You and this Flash must be really close
if you're willing to die for him, hm?

390
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,562
You want me to show you who you
really are? That'd be fun. Hm?

391
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,007
Show you who you really are.

392
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,725
Mick.

393
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,329
Time to go.

394
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,930
You better pray the next people
that come through this door is us.

395
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,763
- Hey.
- Okay. You're on.

396
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,806
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

397
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,164
Barry, after tonight, everyone's
gonna know that the Flash exists.

398
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,443
Are you ready for that?

399
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,809
I'll see you soon.

400
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,448
Did you see that? That was him.

401
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,841
- That was the Flash.
- I don't believe it.

402
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,204
Believe it.

403
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,007
The scarlet speedster.

404
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,325
Any preference on how
you'd like to die?

405
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,089
The flame? Or the frost?

406
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,486
Not in the mood for chitchat.
Gotcha. Ready when you are.

407
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,526
Cover me.

408
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,450
Run on this.

409
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,286
Barry? Barry, are you okay?
You know what you have to do.

410
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,166
Yeah. Get them to cross beams and
cancel their guns out. I know.

411
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,651
Mick.

412
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,490
Ah! Gotcha.

413
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,723
Yeah, not as easy as it sounds.

414
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,527
- Eddie. Eddie.
- Iris, what are you doing here?

415
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,127
- They evacuated Jitters. I saw your car.
- You can't be here. It's not safe.

416
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,009
Are you sure
Caitlin's here, Cisco?

417
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,648
From Caitlin's car, I pieced together
surveillance footage that lead us to this area.

418
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,564
But there's over a
dozen warehouses.

419
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,281
But only one of them has had the
heat on the last three nights.

420
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,562
And I'm betting Mick
Rory likes it hot.

421
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,484
Okay.

422
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,285
Stay behind me.

423
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,806
- Caitlin.
- Mm?

424
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,602
Caitlin, is that you? Mm-mm.

425
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,647
Caitlin, we're gonna
get you out of here.

426
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,771
Cisco. Cisco, down!

427
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,885
The fight is spreading beyond the evac
area. We need to expand the perimeter.

428
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,887
We can't. We can't
let this spread.

429
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,970
Oh, my God.

430
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,168
- Thawne, where you going?
- Eddie.

431
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,200
I thought I was gonna die.

432
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,402
Not while I'm around. Or him.

433
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,325
Hold on!

434
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,729
I got this. Go, go, g0!

435
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,566
I can't get them to cross streams.
Speed isn't getting it done.

436
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,364
You're right.

437
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,608
Maybe the way to do this
is not by going faster.

438
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,211
- It's going slower.
- Yes.

439
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,409
Okay.

440
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,602
Thanks for playing, kid.

441
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,562
I didn't see that coming.

442
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,771
Mm, I guess you win this time.

443
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,320
There won't be a next time.

444
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,922
Thank you, detective.

445
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,841
We'll burn every last one of
you pigs! Get your hands off me!

446
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,451
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

447
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,243
Yeah!

448
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,566
- Your partner's a real hot head.
- That's funny.

449
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,280
You know what's hilarious,
Snart? We got you.

450
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,121
- Congratulations.
- Get him out of here.

451
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,605
- Nice work, Eddie.
- It wasn't me.

452
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,245
It was the Flash.

453
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,321
We're not gonna be needing these
for trial. You'll make sure...

454
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,404
They'll never hurt
anyone ever again.

455
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,360
Mr. Ramon.

456
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,209
Thank you.

457
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,046
He was like a lightning bolt through the
streets. He took them both out singlehandedly.

458
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,771
- That's amazing.
- Wonder who he is?

459
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,361
You ask me, he's a hero.

460
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,282
Okay. All right.

461
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,965
I think that's it.

462
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,285
This better be it.

463
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,002
Well, like you said, I'll be 10 minutes
away, so if you forget something...

464
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,084
Okay.

465
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,849
Dad... Heh.

466
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,769
I can't say it
enough. I'll miss you.

467
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,641
You know you can come
around any time, Joe.

468
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,490
- Just give us a heads-up.
- Heh.

469
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,205
Or not.

470
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,971
Come around whenever.
You want a key?

471
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,960
I'm gonna go...

472
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,491
wait in the truck.

473
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,525
Why don't I give
you two a minute?

474
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,610
Well...

475
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,886
I know things have been really
weird between us recently.

476
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,080
Yeah, they have.

477
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,528
Did you know I can
see into the future?

478
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,960
- Really? - Oh, yeah.
Did I forget to tell you that?

479
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,725
You did not mention it, no.

480
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,882
- Wow.
- Ha-ha.

481
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,489
So, what do you see?

482
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,010
I see you and Eddie
being really happy together.

483
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,930
And things aren't weird
between us anymore.

484
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,410
Took a little time, but
everything's back to normal...

485
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,047
and we're still best friends.

486
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,483
The future doesn't sound so bad.

487
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,283
No. And it'll be here
faster than you think.

488
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,129
The Patriots continue their...

489
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,369
Dad, um, is it okay if I...?

490
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,641
Oh. Yeah.

491
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,450
My baby girl.

492
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,367
- Bye.
- See you.

493
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,491
Well...

494
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,924
You Okay?

495
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,730
Mm-hm.

496
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,608
- How about you? - It was
bound to happen sometime, right?

497
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,520
Mm-hm.

498
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,370
Want to order pizza
and watch the ball game?

499
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,925
Make it pizzas, and you're on.

500
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,844
If you ever need somebody to come
and eat your food, I'm there.

501
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,726
Besides, the laundry machines in my
building have been broken for a month.

502
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,651
I don't know why you moved into
that death trap in the first place.

503
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,041
You've got a perfectly
good room here.

504
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,006
- You said you were turning it into a gym.
- We both know I'm not turning it into a gym.

505
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,449
Besides, you've got me
running around enough as it is.

506
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,966
It is getting hard to hide the blasting in
and out of my apartment from my neighbors.

507
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,527
I suppose it would make sense
for me to move back in.

508
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,604
I am a millennial.
That is what we do.

509
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,767
Don't do it on my account.
I'll be fine on my own.

510
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,164
Oh, yeah. Me too. For sure.

511
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,850
All right, roomie. You order
the pizzas, I'll unpack.

512
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,168
Heh-heh. No way.

513
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,084
I wanna help you.
I wanna enjoy this.

514
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,249
All right.

515
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,882
You know this does
nothing to me.

516
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,929
- Just drink it.
- Mm-hm.

517
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,126
I should have burned the entire city block
down, but instead, I listened to you.

518
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,565
We had the painting. We had the
guns. We could have had everything.

519
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,042
But you had your stupid plan.

520
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,530
How's that stupid plan
working out for us now?

521
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,202
Everyone's seen the Flash now.
This changes things, again.

522
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,251
What the...?

523
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,286
- Snart.
- Relax, Mick.

524
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,450
What's going on?

525
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,405
The plan.

526
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,889
Hey, sis.

527
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,525
Nice.
