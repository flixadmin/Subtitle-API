00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,538
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,417
Together, you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,918
<i>You wanna be the new Breacher?</i>

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,375
Your thinking cap and the dark matter
is what caused this.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,459
I know!

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,465
How long before everything I know
is gone?

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,717
<i>DeVoe has taken out
everyone who has gotten in his way.</i>

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,470
<i>He created 12 meta-humans
just so he could steal their powers.</i>

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,301
<i>But why does he need
their powers?</i>

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,684
<i>The fire
that burns down Team Flash</i>

11
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,437
will also light the path
to the enlightenment.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,111
<i>Since the Age of Enlightenment,</i>

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,065
when reason, debate,
and the search for truth flourished,

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,864
the world has improved by nearly
every measure in human advancement

15
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,115
and continues to do so.

16
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,821
There is no doubt in my mind

17
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,623
that, as technology continues to bloom,

18
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,621
so will all of humanity...

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,171
Professor DeVoe, you disagree?

20
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,046
Um, well, yes, I guess, um...

21
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,545
Just... I have
a more realistic view of humanity

22
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,631
whenever technology is concerned.

23
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,714
What do you mean?

24
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,971
You spoke of the Enlightenment.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,018
One only has to look at history
to find the answers.

26
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,438
Okay. Let's. Life expectancy,

27
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,857
over the past two centuries,
has increased

28
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,276
from 50 years to nearly 70 years.

29
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,025
And... And we should assume
that's a good thing?

30
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,653
Each new day, we have to share
very limited resources

31
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,655
with anything up to 200,000
newborn babies,

32
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,705
most of whom will end up living
in abject poverty and famine.

33
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,124
Well, thank you very much,
Professor Doom and Gloom.

34
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,203
Remind me never to take
one of your history classes.

35
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,298
Perhaps you should.
There's much I could teach you.

36
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:39,715
The Taoists, in pursuit of immortality,
discovered gun powder.

37
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,513
Alfred Nobel created the Nobel Prize

38
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,603
so he wouldn't be remembered
as the man who invented dynamite.

39
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,565
History has shown us time and time again

40
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,727
that whenever a technological
advancement can be used

41
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,566
to hurt humanity, it will be.

42
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,817
You can't blame technology

43
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,648
for the way men
choose to use it, Professor.

44
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,487
You can't ignore that the best
of ideas by the smartest of men

45
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,035
often have a way of becoming corrupted.

46
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,506
You've located everything we need.

47
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,251
And now the time has come to retrieve it

48
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,802
so we can finally

49
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,759
enlighten the world.

50
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,270
Uh-oh.

51
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,574
Hey, babe. Uh, it's me.

52
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,289
Just checking in for my dad.

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,380
He really wants to know your answer
about taking the Breacher job.

54
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,253
I think his exact words were,

55
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,175
"That little son of a breach
better tell me,

56
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,761
"or they will never
find the body." Yeah.

57
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,755
But you know what? He's retired.
He can wait.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,556
So just take as much time as you need.

59
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,633
Okay, it's, um...

60
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,184
- Don't say it's fine.
<i>- You know...</i>

61
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,932
- Don't say it's fine.
- It's fine.

62
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,354
- Oh, God.
- It's fine.

63
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,437
So just vibe me whenever.

64
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,234
Okay. Bye.

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,937
<i>Ramon, speed lab, now.</i>

66
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,820
Good. Good. Good.

67
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,319
The thing we're gonna do
to get Killer Frost to appear,

68
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,451
get that massive spike in your
adrenaline production that we need,

69
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,042
is Ramon is gonna use his vibes
to shake you up on a cellular level

70
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,915
and we'll see if we can get
your old friend Killer Frost

71
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,370
to come out to play.

72
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,838
Are you sure this is gonna work?

73
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,460
Well, I mean, like any hypothesis,

74
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,838
we have to test it to get an answer.
It's what we've all done

75
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,590
since the fourth grade, known as the...

76
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,053
Scientific method.

77
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,427
Yeah, right you are, Allen. Of course.

78
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,225
Ah! Here he is. Okay, good.
So, get in position.

79
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,187
Don't worry.
I lowered the amps on this thing.

80
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,099
- Ramon, you set?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,608
- Snow, you ready?
- I'm ready.

82
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,441
Three, two, one, and...

83
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,993
- Nothing.
- All right, Ramon, more power.

84
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,118
Set? Three, two, one...

85
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,291
All right, this isn't working.
You know what? Ramon, full power.

86
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,463
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
What do you mean, full power?

87
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,006
We don't wanna blast Caitlin
across the speed lab.

88
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,879
Well, we need to get a spike
in her adrenaline.

89
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,176
- Harry, she could get injured.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,378
God, this is...

91
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,465
Look, this is gonna work, okay?
Nothing has changed. All right?

92
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,718
Snow's DNA tests, they confirm it.

93
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,768
Her meta-DNA was not spliced
by Null's powers.

94
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,393
- You mean Melting Point's powers.
- That... Right. That's what I said.

95
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,145
- Melting Point's powers.
- No, you didn't.

96
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,270
I did say that.

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,898
But, Harry, there's no dark matter
in her system anyway.

98
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,069
We're just trying to spike
her heart rate.

99
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,985
What do you mean,
there's no dark matter?

100
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,950
Harry, you knew that. We all did.

101
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,826
We did? We did.

102
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,996
No, I know.
I think I just, you know, forget.

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,370
- I forgot.
- You forgot?

104
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,622
Harry, are you okay?

105
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,170
No. He's not.

106
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,715
Harry, you're...

107
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,048
Losing my intelligence? Yes.

108
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,467
The injection of dark matter
from the thinking cap

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,176
apparently overwhelmed my synapses.

110
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,929
Instead of making my brain faster,

111
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,640
it's slowing it down.

112
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,610
Why didn't you tell us this sooner?

113
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,029
- How long until...
- No way of knowing.

114
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,616
I mean, there are days
I can think clearly, and other days,

115
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,868
I... I can't.

116
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,996
The good news is, um,

117
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,880
from what I can see,
the regression seems to be reversible.

118
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,173
Okay, great.
I'll start working on it full-time.

119
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,468
No, you won't. I did this to myself,

120
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,092
and I thought, "Oh, you know what?
Use that thinking cap.

121
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,719
"Then I can out-think DeVoe
and then stop DeVoe."

122
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,893
I was wrong. And here we are.

123
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,312
Okay, well, we're gonna fix this.

124
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,812
You and I both know
there is a ticking clock,

125
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,730
and I can't help anyone like this.

126
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,941
- Yes, you can.
- How?

127
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,324
Look, guys.

128
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,161
Ralph, Caitlin's powers, now this.

129
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,705
DeVoe knew how to break us apart,
but, I mean, we're all still here.

130
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,626
We're a family.

131
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,083
That's how we're gonna beat DeVoe.

132
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,423
All right, Allen.

133
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,884
All right.

134
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,103
Vandermeer Steel.

135
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,938
Smaller than I expected.

136
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:46,146
The first step to our enlightenment
is as simple

137
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,572
as opening a door.

138
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,165
Alloy 1771.

139
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:11,672
Now, the gallium antimonide
substrates within these

140
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:16,055
can harness power at 400% efficiency.

141
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,520
The precise amount I calculated.

142
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,979
You can pick them up.

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,481
Freeze!

144
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,776
You should let us leave.

145
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,951
I can't do that.

146
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,030
Yes, you can.

147
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,368
How are you...

148
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,004
We have what we need.

149
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,503
I suppose we do.

150
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,639
Code Red! Code Red...

151
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,264
Clifford, this is unnecessary.

152
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,351
You knew there were gonna be
casualties when we began.

153
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,144
This is his own doing.

154
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,066
Yes, my love.

155
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,914
What are we dealing with?

156
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,247
Uh, first of all, we're trying
to determine what was in that vault.

157
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,626
Watch your step right here.

158
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,210
Uh, there was no drilling.
There was no lock picked.

159
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,635
And the only thing anybody would tell us

160
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,844
about what was in the vault

161
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,888
was that it was some sort
of secretive technology.

162
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,467
Also security guard here, 24-year-old,

163
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,972
apparently shot himself.

164
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,473
Wait. A robbery and a suicide?

165
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,308
He's newly married,
has an infant at home. I...

166
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,233
This is smelling like some
meta-madness to me.

167
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,983
Who else can Kilg%re a retinal scan
and Dibny a bolt lock?

168
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,063
Hmm.

169
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,366
Okay, well, I'm gonna go interview
some people, see what I can find out.

170
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,614
All right. Cisco and I will try
to figure out what DeVoe stole.

171
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,240
All right. I'll be over here.

172
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,950
Okay, so where should we start?
I'm thinking if we can gain

173
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,421
access to their files...

174
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,294
Alloy 1771.

175
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,626
It's the only item missing
from the inventory files.

176
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,379
Or I can just stand here
and look pretty.

177
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,805
Hey, you know what
you could do actually?

178
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,881
You could vibe the gun.

179
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,183
The file didn't say what Alloy 1771 was,

180
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,727
so we need another way to learn
why DeVoe would want it.

181
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,100
Uh, vibing and DeVoe
do not mix, remember?

182
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,433
I know, man, but, I mean, what are
we supposed to do? It's the only way.

183
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,267
Barry, I don't really feel
like getting blasted

184
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,728
into a wall right now.
I'm sure there is another way

185
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,688
we can find out what this is

186
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,490
that doesn't require me
getting a migraine.

187
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,568
- It is a solar panel.
- Huh.

188
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,698
Constructed of metal
that absorbs and multiplies

189
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,368
the sun's energy at 400% efficiency.

190
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,121
What would DeVoe be doing
with a solar panel?

191
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,794
Nothing on its own.
He's got to be building something.

192
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,167
Look, I need you to vibe the gun.

193
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,673
Maybe I should put this
in movie terms for you.

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,844
Everything in DeVoe's wake is like
the <i>Home Alone</i> house. Okay?

195
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,216
It's booby trapped.

196
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,925
I would need to double my powers
just to even attempt to vibe the gun.

197
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,019
Well, hold on. I mean,
could Gypsy double your powers?

198
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,012
- That's a good idea.
- No. Not.

199
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,647
Not what?

200
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,188
Gypsy's busy. Her dad just retired.

201
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,441
She's having to do double the work.
She's... Earth-19 is a mess right now.

202
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,772
- She's swamped.
- Cisco.

203
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,734
Combining your powers could make it
so we know DeVoe's next move.

204
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,163
<i>Thanks for meeting me.</i>

205
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,865
- I need a favor.
- Okay.

206
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,452
I need you to distract Cecile
for a while.

207
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,249
What for?

208
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,922
Well, it's a thing I can't tell you
because if I do,

209
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,840
she'll read your mind and find out.

210
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,259
Why can't Iris do it?

211
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,053
Because Iris knows exactly
why I'm trying to distract Cecile.

212
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,130
Ah.

213
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,386
And therefore Barry knows,
which means that Cisco knows.

214
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,967
Fine. Whatever you need.

215
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,393
- Really?
- Yeah.

216
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,845
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

217
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,478
Great. Lose my mind,
become a babysitter.

218
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,934
No, come on.

219
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:57,150
Listen, if anybody's gonna reverse
what's happening,

220
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,989
it's gonna be those kids
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

221
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,193
I mean, they love you, Harry,
and they will never stop

222
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,778
- trying to help you.
- Mmm.

223
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,996
- So don't lose hope.
- Right.

224
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,160
And that is how I aced

225
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,122
my intro to heat transfer
in my first year at university.

226
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,749
Bravo, Dr. Milan.

227
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,919
I miss those days.

228
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,089
I was young and foolish and brave.

229
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,390
And now you're just foolish.

230
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,933
To agree to a date with someone
I first met

231
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,479
as they were so rudely disagreeing
with my professional opinion.

232
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,645
Foolish, maybe.

233
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,402
You know,
no one's ever challenged me like that.

234
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,656
It was refreshing.

235
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,621
Ah, maybe you are right about
technology's destructiveness.

236
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,448
It certainly can destroy moments.

237
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,201
Although, sometimes,

238
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,747
technology can create them as well.

239
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,577
Thanks for coming to help us, Gypsy.

240
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,825
You two are up.

241
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,577
So how do we do this?

242
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,244
Okay, so to co-vibe,
we have to be totally in sync.

243
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,580
Right? Our minds have to be
on exactly the same page.

244
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,166
- Just like always.
- Yeah.

245
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,560
- Oh! So that was weird.
- Why? What did you see?

246
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,182
I don't know. A dock?

247
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,190
- Um, looked like a shipping container.
- Number 16.

248
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,484
That must be what DeVoe
is gonna steal next.

249
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,482
He's gonna have to steal it from us.

250
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,152
All right.
It looks like we made it in time.

251
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,454
Whatever is in this container,
we can't let DeVoe have it.

252
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,657
Actually,

253
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,453
it's what's in this container
you can't let me have.

254
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,465
Well, what was in this container.

255
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,717
Hit him!

256
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,230
Gratitude for the workout,
brief as it was.

257
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,023
Later.

258
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,323
Damn it. Damn it!

259
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,155
Why didn't we see the right
container number?

260
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,496
Maybe someone's vibe
wasn't clear enough, Cisco.

261
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,369
Are you blaming me?

262
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,379
You lost you focus. What can I say?

263
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,671
Yeah, getting hit against a metal
container wall sort of does that.

264
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,048
You know, I hit that wall, too,
I'm perfectly focused.

265
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,095
Oh, well, if you're so focused,
then why did you let him get away?

266
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,798
Don't even try and put that on me.

267
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,009
I'm sorry. I didn't put that on you.
You put that on you.

268
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,219
I'm gonna put my fist in your face,
is what I'm gonna do.

269
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,436
- Guys?
- Is that how we'd work together

270
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,512
if I took the job?

271
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,814
Guys.

272
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,774
What job?

273
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,990
I brought that metal piece
from the shipping container

274
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,568
in case we wanna try co-vibing later,

275
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,245
but, um, I think we both saw
where that led us, so...

276
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,791
So you said Breacher retired.

277
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,578
He offered you a job on Earth-19
to replace him, didn't he?

278
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,788
Mmm-hmm.

279
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,373
You know, another shot in the dark,

280
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,380
but you haven't actually given
Breacher or Gypsy an answer yet.

281
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,757
- Mmm-mmm.
- Which way are you leaning?

282
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,757
I wanna be with Gypsy
more than anything.

283
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,307
It's just complicated.

284
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,347
Hey, no, man, I get it.

285
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,689
But, look, I mean,

286
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,111
maybe you guys working together
to end this

287
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,688
will make the decision easier
for both of you.

288
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,648
What if she doesn't want
the same thing as me?

289
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,484
I mean,
you're never gonna know unless you ask.

290
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,620
And listen, Cisco, I mean,

291
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,865
we can't beat DeVoe without you.

292
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,167
You're our secret weapon.

293
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,420
You and Gypsy just need to be on the
same page for that weapon to work.

294
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,793
Yeah, and I don't know that we can be.

295
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,294
All right, well, let me help you.

296
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,637
- Barry.
- No, like... Hold on.

297
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,516
So that's gonna end well.

298
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,180
Last one.

299
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,598
Okay, we, uh, need food.

300
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,150
We need wine.

301
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,486
Lots of both. Go. I'll unpack.

302
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,731
Clifford!

303
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,151
Go. Hurry home.

304
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,235
- I could stay.
- No.

305
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,319
- You sure?
- Yeah.

306
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,280
I really should. Last chance.

307
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,304
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

308
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,487
Me hunter.

309
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,241
Me hunted feast for my queen.

310
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,948
You don't believe these things
you wrote in this journal, do you?

311
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,835
This reads
like some radical's manifesto, Clifford.

312
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,376
It is a realist's awakening.

313
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,802
You declare war against every
technological philanthropist.

314
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,474
Man, man, man.

315
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,432
They're pushing us to the brink
of Armageddon

316
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,808
with their inventions.

317
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,064
No, they want to better mankind.

318
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,650
Don't be naive, Marlize.

319
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,696
The severity of our society's failings

320
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,275
require extreme ideas

321
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,079
if ever we were to restore
some semblance of balance.

322
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,749
"Technology has become a cancerous
cell in our social biology.

323
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,044
"Exorcizing it
would require a total purge,

324
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,044
"not only of the material world,
but also human consciousness."

325
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,048
This is not balance.
This is lobotomizing people.

326
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,172
It is rebooting the masses' brains

327
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,599
to let them forget their
technological crutches.

328
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,517
They are babies with pacifiers.

329
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,475
Oh, and who will teach them?
You, Professor?

330
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,182
How does any of this help humankind?

331
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,024
Don't you see, Marlize?

332
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,897
Our technology is killing us.

333
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,909
You and I, we can fix this together

334
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,824
as partners.

335
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,498
We can lead them,
all of society, humanity,

336
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,622
on the true path to enlightenment.

337
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,213
Hey, Harry.

338
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,671
DA Cecile Horton.

339
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,764
Joe said you needed to adjust
my mental activity dampener.

340
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,268
Yes. Joe, yes. I have to do that.

341
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,604
It's, um... It's not a big deal.

342
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,268
It's a standard procedure.

343
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,607
That's... Yeah, okay.

344
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,857
- I'm in.
- Well,

345
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,744
it's installing, so now you just...
You just sit

346
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,537
and wait for a long time.

347
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,002
Okay, what is happening
with your thoughts right now?

348
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,883
With my...

349
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,212
Okay. So there was an incident
with dark matter

350
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,013
I know. I know. I know.
Joe told me about that.

351
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,635
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What do you mean?

352
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,844
Your thoughts are screaming at me.

353
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,395
It's like they start to form, and then

354
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,557
it's like the more the ideas appear...

355
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,939
- The more they disappear.
- Exactly.

356
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,438
Well, that explains my "can't" days.

357
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,863
What does that mean, Harry?

358
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,652
It means, DA Cecile Horton,

359
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,204
that the more I try to use my brain,

360
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,703
the sooner I'm gonna lose it.

361
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,871
Barista, another one, please.

362
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,422
Uh, make it a double. Thank you.

363
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,375
Here you go.

364
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,459
Thanks.

365
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,670
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

366
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,802
Can't a woman caffeinate in peace
around here?

367
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,426
Hey, look... Hey.

368
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,557
I know why you're upset,
but it's all right.

369
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,637
- Really?
- Yeah.

370
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,315
Look, Cisco just thinks if he takes
the job he'll be letting us down,

371
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,526
but, I mean, he just needs
to follow his own heart,

372
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,771
do what he needs to do,
not worry about us. He knows that.

373
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,356
Wow.

374
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,449
That's actually really great.

375
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,241
So now all you guys have to do
is talk to each other.

376
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,115
Yeah, well,
that part's not so easy, so...

377
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,618
Yes, it is.

378
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,793
- What are you doing?
- What?

379
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,541
Don't even think about it.
Don't even think about it. No!

380
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,830
Okay...

381
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,506
Don't ever whoosh me again, all right?

382
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,629
I know. Totally. I'm sorry. Um, Cisco.

383
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,881
What is going on?

384
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,178
Just getting them back
on the same page, okay?

385
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,464
Cisco, Gypsy is upset because,
frankly, I mean,

386
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,176
it's taking you too long accept
Breacher's job offer. Duh!

387
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,105
And, Gypsy, Cisco, he's just worried
about abandoning his team.

388
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,432
I mean, it's not that he doesn't
want the job. Right?

389
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,358
So... Okay, so...

390
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,235
Now, you both know, right,
and you can dive in

391
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,982
and work this out.
Let's talk about this.

392
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,413
C.C.P.D. is reporting two more
break-ins at tech manufacturers.

393
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,290
Boeing Lab and the Jameson Institute.
More hardware was stolen.

394
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,791
- DeVoe.
- Is anybody hurt?

395
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,794
Um, three fatalities.
All of them security guards

396
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,716
in high-level clearance areas,
just like at Vandermeer.

397
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,340
He's taking whatever he wants,
killing anybody that gets in the way.

398
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,589
Guys, I'm sorry,
but we have to figure out

399
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,174
what kind of machine
he's building, right now.

400
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,473
Look, we have to try.

401
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,403
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,948
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- Saw that one coming.

403
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,029
- You okay?
- I'm good. Thank you.

404
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,258
- They okay?
- Tests show physically they're fine.

405
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,677
As a couple, not so much.

406
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,597
Where are you going?

407
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,299
To get these two back in sync.

408
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,259
I mean, we've got to get ahead
of this somehow.

409
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, cowboy.

410
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:55,887
What do you mean? Why?

411
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,145
Maybe you've done enough already, okay?

412
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,524
Cisco and Gypsy are clearly
going through something,

413
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,488
and, you know, it's not up to us
to counsel them through it.

414
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,315
- Well, then who is it up to, Iris?
- Just stop for a second.

415
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,695
We can't stop.

416
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,869
The second we do,
everyone could fall apart.

417
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,287
The team's hanging on by a thread.

418
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,490
- But we are hanging on, Barry.
- For how long?

419
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,951
I mean, look at what's happening.
DeVoe is killing innocent people.

420
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,538
He's stealing pieces of tech
for God knows why.

421
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,419
Just trying to keep up with him
is tearing us apart.

422
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,125
Babe.

423
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,962
You can't put it on yourself
to hold everyone together.

424
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,436
Cisco is family.

425
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,981
And when family hurts, we all hurt.
I get that.

426
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,564
But sometimes, you can't answer
their questions for them.

427
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,187
Sometimes, you just have to support them

428
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,238
while they find them on their own
whether they're together

429
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,735
or they're apart.

430
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,863
- What?
- That's it.

431
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,041
The pieces of tech don't fit together

432
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,993
because they're not supposed to.

433
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,046
He's not building one thing.
He's building multiple.

434
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,803
Harry, I know this is hard.

435
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,839
Well,

436
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,383
it is hard,

437
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,643
DA Cecile Horton, because my brain,

438
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,642
the one thing that's defined me
throughout pretty much

439
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,939
my entire life is about to...

440
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,440
Vanish, and then who will I be?

441
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,105
You'll be the exact same man
you've always been.

442
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,152
Yeah, but dumb.

443
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,277
Same man, way less intelligent.

444
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,489
Harry, there are lots of ways
to be intelligent,

445
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,869
not just using your head.

446
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,289
Right.

447
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,710
Wait.

448
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,467
Do that again. Harry.

449
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,423
- Do what?
- Do it again. Do it again.

450
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,064
- Right?
- How did you do that?

451
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,018
I saw it inside your mind
before it vanished.

452
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,272
In...

453
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,071
- Wait. So you can...
- Write down what you're thinking.

454
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,364
- Before it...
- Disappears.

455
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,567
- Wow.
- Yeah.

456
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,994
Marlize? I brought the sample.

457
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,822
- Hey.
- Hey.

458
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:21,741
Okay.

459
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,286
All right.

460
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,249
- Fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

461
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,009
Here we go.

462
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,933
Cheers.

463
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,262
- Yes.
- Yeah?

464
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,097
Yeah. Show the others.

465
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,432
Got it.

466
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,363
Hello.

467
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,947
<i>Marlize, it's me.</i>

468
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,571
Clifford.

469
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,782
I need you to come home.

470
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,666
I can't.

471
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,959
I'm making a difference here.
I'm changing lives for the better.

472
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,414
<i>These people need me.</i>

473
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,999
I need you.

474
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,844
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,552
I can't be with someone that thinks
that society is a disease,

476
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,303
that believes that our world
is being plagued by technology.

477
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,304
I am nothing without you.

478
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,857
You're a brilliant man
with a great future ahead of you.

479
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,186
What kind of future do I have
if you're not by my side?

480
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,238
I just wish that you could show

481
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,783
the same compassion for the rest
of humanity as you do for me.

482
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,116
Listen to me, Marlize. I...

483
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,328
My thoughts, I can't...

484
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,126
I just... I just don't think that...

485
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,417
Marlize.

486
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,595
<i>Marlize.</i>

487
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,513
<i>Marlize!</i>

488
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,348
So what were you gonna say

489
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,150
before we were
so alarmingly interrupted?

490
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,902
Look, I just...

491
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,235
Cisco...

492
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,572
- I don't want you to take the job.
- I don't want to take the job.

493
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,032
Oh.

494
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,494
That is such a relief.

495
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,664
Because I don't want anything to change.

496
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,637
Not only have we not
been on the same page,

497
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,602
we haven't even been on the same planet.

498
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,517
Literally.

499
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,599
We've been doing this
back-and-forth thing

500
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,853
for almost a year,

501
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,061
negotiating who gets to go
to whose Earth and when,

502
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,486
just to see each other.

503
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,780
And on the off chance
we do get to see each other,

504
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,323
there's, like, a countdown

505
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,947
until one of us has to leave,
and I'm tired of it.

506
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,780
I don't wanna have to breach to see
the woman I love.

507
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,160
I wanna wake up next to her

508
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,458
every morning.

509
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,626
So what are you saying?

510
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,297
I'm saying I want more.

511
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,339
I'm saying I don't want Breacher's job,
but I do want you.

512
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,669
I want you, too.

513
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,379
What am I supposed to do?

514
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,132
Pack up my entire life, everything?

515
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,842
Forget about my job,
my responsibilities?

516
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,268
- No, no, no.
- Just move here?

517
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,890
No, no, no.
That's not what I'm asking you to do.

518
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,643
I would never ask you
to leave the agency.

519
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,564
I know how important that is to you.

520
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,902
But tell me, and tell me honestly,

521
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,897
this, what we have,

522
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,234
is this enough for you?

523
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,621
Yes.

524
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,032
It is.

525
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,751
Well, it isn't for me.

526
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,464
<i>Hey, guys,
I need you both in the Cortex.</i>

527
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,885
- Why?
- Why?

528
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,339
I know what DeVoe is doing.
It's not one machine.

529
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,464
They're machines.

530
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,017
Machines that work together,
but they're still separate.

531
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,719
Satellites.

532
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,647
Separate satellites working together
for a single purpose?

533
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,024
So this guy really is a Bond villain.

534
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,443
Look, DeVoe would need a massive
amount of computational power

535
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,191
for them to be able to talk
to each other,

536
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,989
something to triangulate navigation
between each satellite.

537
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,657
So, like a quantum computer?

538
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,994
Mercury Labs just put a whole system

539
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,946
of quantum computers online
at their home base.

540
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,202
- That's where he's going.
- Okay, great.

541
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,249
This time we catch DeVoe by surprise.

542
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,256
Behold.

543
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,674
The key to communicating our message
of the enlightenment.

544
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,431
Polynomial time computing.

545
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,470
And a dream shall soon become reality.

546
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:21,791
Clifford!

547
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,840
Uh-uh. Don't move.

548
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,513
Barry, knock him out and then cuff him.

549
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,760
On it.

550
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,098
Gypsy, now.

551
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,315
Stop it! You're killing him!

552
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,903
Cisco, look out.

553
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,156
Barry, hit him again.

554
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,375
Enough!

555
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,164
Caitlin.

556
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,091
Caitlin, what the hell are you doing?

557
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,591
Bringing her back.

558
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:13,927
DeVoe's creating a sonic pulse.

559
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,262
You need to get out of there before...

560
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,605
Oh, I get it.

561
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,734
You'd like me to frighten you
into becoming your better half.

562
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,742
Gladly.

563
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,491
DeVoe!

564
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,537
Children should be seen, not heard.

565
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,795
I'm very sure seeing your bestie die

566
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,999
would be frightening enough,
but I can't kill the Flash.

567
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,670
Well, not just yet.

568
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,219
My plan for the enlightenment

569
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,217
requires his further participation.

570
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,808
You, however, are a lot less fortunate.

571
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,346
Barry, he's gonna kill Gypsy.

572
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,815
Now, do you feel that

573
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,563
around your throat?

574
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,194
That is the gravitational equivalent

575
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,863
of my boot bursting your wind pipe.

576
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,484
She's innocent! Leave her alone!

577
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,031
Clifford.

578
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,285
This isn't part of our plan.

579
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,912
Cisco, wake up! Wake up!

580
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,578
Our plan is to save them.

581
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,710
We can't save everyone, my love.

582
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,045
DeVoe!

583
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,793
Perhaps.

584
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,755
But I won't watch you kill
an innocent life again.

585
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,475
Yes, you will.

586
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,729
Please. Clifford.

587
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,108
Remember who you are.

588
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,286
Is this truly the lesson
you wish to bestow today?

589
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,880
Get the case.

590
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,361
- Cynthia.
- Hey.

591
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,690
What happened? Come on. It's okay.

592
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,190
<i>What did he do to her?</i>

593
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,952
Hey, talk to me. Come on. It's okay.

594
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,173
You're okay. You're okay.

595
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,634
No thefts have been reported
in the last 12 hours.

596
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,261
So DeVoe managed to get
everything he needed.

597
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,481
And we still don't know
what his next step is.

598
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,397
You know, he said something
about the enlightenment.

599
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,688
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

600
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,022
I know what he's thinking.

601
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,366
I know what he's planning.
We know what he's planning.

602
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,660
- We know what he's planning.
- Harry... Harry, wait.

603
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,078
- What?
- I can give 'em the CliffsNotes version.

604
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,154
No, no, no.

605
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,326
The component parts stolen
to create each satellite will possess

606
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,002
thirty cubic quantum systems, okay?

607
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,671
And each system is capable of...

608
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,337
Each system is capable of redirecting

609
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,963
concentrated dark matter back to Earth

610
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,670
in 10 million megawatt bursts.

611
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:40,475
Which level of range is toxic enough
to affect each and every human brain

612
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,223
on the planet
and reboot them back to a...

613
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,681
Reboot them back to a simplified state.

614
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,816
Just like mine.

615
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,101
DeVoe wants to remove

616
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,732
the intelligence of everyone on Earth?

617
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,782
Yes. Exactly, Barry. Exactly right.

618
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,470
We're really gonna do this?

619
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,514
You treat me

620
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,817
like I'm the only woman
in the multi-verse,

621
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,519
and I don't want more.

622
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,775
What is wrong with me?

623
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,199
I don't know what's wrong with me.

624
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,658
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,535
Nothing's wrong.

626
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,035
Nothing at all.

627
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,217
I guess maybe sometimes
one plus one just equals two, you know?

628
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,264
What are you gonna do?

629
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,412
Wait. Wait.

630
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,724
Goodbye, Cynthia.

631
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,894
Goodbye, Cisco.

632
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,038
- Surprise!
- What is this?

633
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,996
It's your baby shower, baby.

634
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,290
This is why you were singing
"The Girl from Ipanema"

635
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,716
in your head all day.

636
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,259
He has been planning this for days.

637
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,881
Oh! This is so sweet.

638
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,010
I feel really guilty, pulling
everybody away at a time like this,

639
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,261
- but...
- It's a perfect time to celebrate.

640
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,467
- Surrounded by family.
- Mmm.

641
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,687
You guys,
this baby is gonna be so loved.

642
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,263
Aw.

643
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,438
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

644
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,200
Why don't you go talk to him?

645
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,077
Hey, man, are you okay?

646
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,755
Not really. No.

647
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,131
Do you want some space, or...

648
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,508
Actually, I've got plenty of that
right now.

649
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,730
I'm sorry for pushing the two of you.

650
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,151
I think you both did
the right thing, though.

651
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,365
Then why does it hurt so much?

652
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,746
Caitlin.

653
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,162
Look, I don't think
you should do that again.

654
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,747
You could have gotten yourself killed.

655
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,587
I have to get her back.

656
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,174
- We will.
- No, I will.

657
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,593
<i>Clifford. Clifford.</i>

658
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:54,845
Ow.

659
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,271
It's fine.

660
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,102
It's fine.

661
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,154
When the line cut out,
I came immediately.

662
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,738
I thought I'd lost you.

663
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,123
You'll never lose me, Clifford.

664
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,161
You were right.

665
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,746
Technology has become a cancer,

666
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,924
driving civilization to consume itself.

667
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,887
A militia group found out about
the water purifier that I created.

668
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:35,262
And they just killed dozens
of people to take it.

669
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,689
Women and children slaughtered

670
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,018
for a simple piece of technology.

671
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,656
Your journal

672
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,818
wrote of a world where humanity forgot

673
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,746
that this technological menace
was capable.

674
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,833
But what I didn't tell you

675
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,583
was that I saw the truth in it
even then,

676
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,373
and it frightened me.

677
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,715
And that's why I ran.

678
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,515
And I'm not frightened anymore.

679
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,934
You believe.

680
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,511
I believe in you.

681
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,018
Enlighten them, Clifford.

682
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,809
You're the only one who can.

683
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,826
I'm nothing without you.

684
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,551
The chair will rejuvenate
your fractured scaphoid.

685
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,677
Prepare the satellites for assembly.

686
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,977
- I said prepare the satellites...
- No!

687
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,194
Initially, we set out
to enlighten the world.

688
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,235
Now, you want to rule it.

689
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,401
I am leaving you, Clifford.

690
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,830
Nothing can get in or out.

691
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,167
You dare orchestrate an exodus

692
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,874
on the eve
of humanity's greatest reckoning?

693
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,511
- You made a vow.
- To my husband!

694
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,056
But my husband is dead.

695
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,926
The Thinker's first victim.

696
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,769
The enlightenment will come
for you, too, Marlize.

697
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,980
I will be all that remains.

698
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,399
Oh, Clifford.

699
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,735
You are nothing without me.

700
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,456
Special delivery.

701
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,590
- Oh!
- Wow. You're super pregnant.

702
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,877
Looks like you're due about 21 days
from tonight, I'd say.

703
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,508
I... I mean, if I were guessing.

704
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,798
Sweetheart, who is it?

705
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,053
Uh, someone sent us a diaper bag.

706
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,342
Mmm.

707
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,643
It looks like it's a gift from someone

708
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,683
who wanted you both to know
how special you are,

709
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,732
someone who understands that
time is precious

710
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,400
and right now is all we've got.

711
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,476
Mmm-hmm.

712
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,312
Relatively speaking.

713
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,612
- Dad?
- Hey.

714
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:33,815
- Look what we got.
- Oh.

715
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,948
Who sent that? Wally?

716
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,651
Wally already sent us a bassinet,

717
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,032
which apparently was owned by Moses.

718
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,873
Was there a note...

719
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,084
Who was it?

720
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,498
Some delivery girl.

721
00:41:47,522 --> 00:41:55,522
