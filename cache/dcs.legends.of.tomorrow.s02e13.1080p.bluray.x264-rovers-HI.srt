No. The JSA thought
the pieces of the Spear would be safer

the Legion of Doom probably already knows.

- And he didn't tell you nothing?

No, he told me a lot of things.

53
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,058
(EXHALES) So what are we
gonna do with him?

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,389
Just leave him in the brig?

55

Until we figure out a way
to restore his mind,

56

then, yeah, that's the plan.

At least in the brig,
he can't hurt anyone.

Then there's more than
just "bizarro me" on this ship.

317
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,944
Like, Evil Ray? Evil Stein?

318
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,232
<i>Evil Mick?</i>

319
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,610
I guess that's just regular Mick,
but still...

320
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,359
All right. Let's find Rip,
get what we need, and get out of here.

321
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,526
Yeah.

322
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,494
(PANTING)

323
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,201
I think... I think we ditched her.

324
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
DR. HEYWOOD: Okay. Quick question, Ray.

325
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,211
Your lady dinosaur-friend...
You said she recognized your scent.

326
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,294
- Wait, I believe her name was Gertrude.
- Right.

327
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,131
I couldn't help but get the feeling that
Gertrude didn't like you very much.

328
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,091
Raymond, what aren't you telling us?

329
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,926
Well...

330
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,638
It just so happens that lady dinosaurs
are rather maternal.

331
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,801
And?

332
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,641
And I may have eaten one of her eggs.

333
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,306
- Oh!
- What'? I was starving. I needed protein.

334
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,067
I mean, one egg made me, like, 70 omelets.

335
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,397
I regret nothing.

336
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,903
All right. But you have to tell us this

337
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,155
before we walk onto Gertrude's territory.

338
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,157
This is where the delineator landed.

339
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,909
Look, if you want to stop
the Legion of Doom

340
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,570
from grabbing
your grandfather's piece of the Spear,

341
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,080
we have to retrieve it.

342
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,790
Ah. We made it.

343
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,418
Someone lives here?

344
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,578
Used to.

345
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,167
This is where I survived for six months.

346
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,958
(SNIFFS) What's that smell?

347
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,668
Male T. rex urine.

348
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,087
The only way I figured
to keep Gertrude away

349
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,300
was to douse the place with it.

350
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,761
And where did you find male T. rex urine?

351
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,476
- Well...
- Actually, I don't want to know.

352
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,102
Do I want to know what these are?

353
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265
AMAYA: Huh.

354
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,190
<i>That one looks just like Captain Lance.</i>

355
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,313
DR. HEYWOOD:
<i>That looks like a little baby Rory.</i>

356
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,606
I, uh...

357
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,195
<i>I might have gotten a little lonely.</i>

358
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,113
But, hey, the sun is setting.

359
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,199
Maybe I should go out
and catch us an iguana

360
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,831
and prepare
some of my world-famous iguana soup.

361
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,292
No, I'm good.
I brought energy bars from the ship.

362
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,707
What? Energy bars? Come on, Nate...

363
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,212
We're in the Cretaceous Period.

364
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,127
You have to
at least try the local cuisine.

365
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,546
- Uh, no.
- All right.

366
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,965
Do not leave the urine perimeter.

367
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,802
So...

368
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,057
So...

369
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,017
Here we are.

370
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,142
Waiting for fresh iguana
at Ray's castaway camp.

371
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,814
- During dinosaur times.
- Mmm.

372
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,688
So, this is our lives now.

373
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,984
(CHUCKLES)

374
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,651
I know you want to get back to the ship,

375
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,572
but there's really nothing
we can do right now except wait.

376
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,203
Not a thing.

377
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,078
Yoo-hoo.

378
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,371
(RAY LAUGHS)

379
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,999
Good thing I haven't forgotten
my survival skills.

380
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,914
(SIGHS) Like riding a bike.

381
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,836
Yeah, that's great, Ray.

382
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,514
Okay, once we find Rip,
how're we gonna get him to tell us

383
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,015
where Nate's grandfather is, if...

384
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,263
- If Rip thinks we're all evil?
- Yeah.

385
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,682
One problem at a time.

386
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,355
What's our other problem?

387
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,353
(EXHALES)

388
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,442
Go find Rip.

389
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,694
I'll hold these guys off.

390
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,277
(GRUNTING)

391
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,547
You shouldn't have come here.

392
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,052
This is our ship.

393
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,885
(GRUNTS)

394
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,393
But there's always room
for a pretty little thing like you.

395
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,728
We've got plenty of extra room
in the brig.

396

None of this is real. You're not real.

398
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,898
Oh, really?

399

Get away from me!

Look, relax. It's okay.

Get me out?

00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,275
You put me in here.

(WHISPERS) Hey, Sara, it's me.

I didn't know you knew Morse Code.

I was hoping you'd hear my signal.

Uh, who are you?

Really?

After all the time we've spent together...

418
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,230
Well, I think I'd remember if we had...

419
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,355
Are you a figment of Rip's imagination?

420
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,522
Of sorts.

421
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,983
But I'm very much real.

422
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,030
As real as the Waverider herself.

423

424
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,531
Hello, Mr. Jackson.

425
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,375
Wait. How...
How can you be Gideon? I mean...

426
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,838
Am I not what you imagined?

427
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,340
I always pictured you as a redhead myself.

428
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,347
But, uh, this is Rip's world,
I guess we're just living in it, right?

00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,092
I have to find him.

I need to ask him
where Nate's grandfather is.

431
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,513
It won't be easy getting that information.

432
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,851
What do you mean?

433
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,725
Eobard Thawne twisted his consciousness.

434
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,189
Turned friends into foes.

435
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,437
But you're still a friend.

436
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,901
Why aren't you corrupted?

437
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,406
It did not occur to Mr. Thawne

00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,034
that the AI inside the <i>Waverider</i>
needed corrupting.

But time is running out.

And Captain Hunter's true memories dim
with every passing minute.

441
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,203
Soon they'll be lost forever.

442
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,957
Rip, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

443
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,877
I know you're afraid because you think
that I'm one of your captors,

but that's a lie.

Everything that you see on this ship,

00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,794
it's only in your mind.

It was delicious, though. Thank you.

Oh. See, delicious? You're missing out.

457
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,833
Yeah. Somehow, I'll manage.

Where are you going?

- I could help you.
- I can go.

00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,251
Boys, I can take care of myself.

00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,645
So I guess we're huddling for warmth now?

463

You can't do it, Nate.

464
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,522
What? Resist your charm?

465
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,983
You can't date Amaya.

466
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,115
(SIGHS) Ray, I'm not dating Amaya.

467
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,621
You're doing something with her.

468
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,832
Why do you think I yelled "yoo-hoo"
when I came back to camp?

469
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,291
Because you're the type of guy
that still says "in a jiffy."

470
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,296
Because I didn't want to interrupt
any shenanigans.

471
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,791
And still says "shenanigans."

472
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,217
Look, I'm not dating Amaya.

473
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,470
But even if I was, so what?

474
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,139
We wouldn't make it weird on the ship.

475
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,471
That's not what I...
I don't care about that.

476
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
I've dated on the ship.

00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,141
You have? Who? Sara?

478
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,977
I mean, I know she's bisexual,
but I didn't think...

479
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,141
No, I care
about Amaya's granddaughter.

480
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,731
- You dated her?
- No, I've met her.

481
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:21,030
Look, eventually, Amaya has to go back
to her home in Zambesi in 1942.

482
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,570
And she'll have a daughter.

483
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,406
And, eventually, a granddaughter

484
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,994
who'll inherit Amaya's totem,

485
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,751
and she will become a superhero
in Detroit.

486
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,170
If you change Amaya's destiny,

487
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,752
that threatens Mari's existence

488
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,884
and the existences of all the people
that she's saved.

489
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,842
Amaya isn't like the rest of us.

490
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,424
We were recruited
because we didn't matter to the timeline.

491
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,684
But Amaya does.

492
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,179
She's special. She has a destiny.

493
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,564

00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,282
It ends with her village being destroyed

You're not exactly

Your point?

528
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:18,272
My point is you're not gonna be around
for too much longer.

And Jax has to learn
how to do this stuff himself.

I don't know who I am anymore,
Mr. Jackson.

641

What I do know is that
we've gotta get out of here.

What's going on?

643

This place only existed
because Rip believed it did.

644
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,666
But now that he's seen the truth...

645
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,675
You have to leave. Thank you.

646
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,848
Thank you for believing in me.
Even when I didn't.

647
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,272
- You have to go.
- I can't just leave you.

648
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,308
You have to.
So you can tell Martin and Rory,

649
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,273
hopefully Martin, to get me out of here.

652
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,120
Why hasn't Sara woken up?

653
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,823
She's still trapped inside.
We've gotta wake her up.

654
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,036
Mr. Rory said, if we do that,

655
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,543
we run the risk of stranding her
inside Rip's mind forever.

656
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,793
Well, I got news for you.

to "break off." It's just...

Well, everyone is being
very uncharacteristically pleasant.

775

Yeah, man.

I need to run a few tests
and we'll get you cleared for flight.
