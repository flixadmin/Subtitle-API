Davos:
A band of 20 men,
maybe less.

12
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,521
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

13
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,523
Burnt our food stores
to the ground,

14
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,859
all our siege weapons
destroyed.

15
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,111
- Dozens of tents were--
- Horses?

16
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,238
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

17
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,325
20 men rode into our camp
without a single guard
sounding the alarm?

18
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,578
The northerners know
more about their land
than we ever will.

19
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,246
Put last night's guards
in chains.

20
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,206
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with
the enemy.

21
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,585
- Find out the truth
and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

22
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,046
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press forward
to Winterfell

23
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,382
and we don't have
enough food to get us
back to Castle Black.

24
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,384
We're not returning
to Castle Black.

25
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,888
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I never claimed to be an expert
in military matters,

26
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,641
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

27
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,532
Have the dead horses
butchered for meat.

28
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,450
Man:

32
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
Open the gates.

Jon:
It was a failure.

36
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,021
It wasn't.

37
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,398
I went to save them.
I failed.

38
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,360
You didn't fail him.

39
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,737
Or him.

40
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,156
<i>Or her.</i>

41
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,909
Every one of them
is alive because of you
and no one else.

42
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,830
I don't think
that fact's lost
on them.

43
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,304
You have a good heart,
Jon Snow.

44
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,640
It'll get us all killed.

45
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,606
Alliser:
Out of my way.

46
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,248
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

47
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,583

( sighs )

49
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,300
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

50
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,553
Find some healthy
horses and a few knights
to guard you.

51
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,429
I'm sending you back
to Castle Black.

52
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,723
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

53
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,268
to send food, supplies,
fresh horses.

54
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,186
In return,
when I take the throne,

55
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,981
I'll make sure
the Night's Watch has
all the men it requires.

56
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,568
He can guard all 19 castles
on the Wall if he so wishes.

57
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,948
Your Grace,
you named me your Hand.

58
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,366
Yes.

59
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,326
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

60
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,828
especially
in time of war.

61
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,746
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

62
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,040
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

63
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,626
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

64
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,920
what does the boy say?

65
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,881
I didn't name you
Hand for your expertise
in military matters.

66
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,633
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

67
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,350
Your Grace,
perhaps Queen Selyse

68
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,519
and Princess Shireen
could accompany me.

69
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,396
My family stays with me.

70
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,648
At least let me
take Shireen.

71
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,151
<i>A siege is no place</i>
<i>for a little girl.</i>

72
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,528
My family stays with me.

73
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,747
( men coughing )

74
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,899
What's this one now?

75
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,443
"The Dance of Dragons:
A True Telling"

76
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,819
by Grand Maester Munkun.

77
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,198
Now that sounds
like a proper story.

78
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,825
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

79
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,703
He polished his shield
for a week so that it was
like a mirror.

80
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,789
And he crouched behind it
and crept forward,

81
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,916
hoping the dragon would
only see its own reflection.

82
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,086
But the dragon saw
a dumb man holding
a mirrored shield.

83
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,754
And burnt him
to a crisp.

84
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,089
( laughs )

85
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,299
Thus ending
the dragon-slaying career

86
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,261
of Ser Byron Swann.
( laughs )

87
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,723
I made you something,
Princess.

88
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,731
Do you like it?

89
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,608
He's beautiful.

90
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,194
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

91
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,989
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

92
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,740
Of course I will.

93
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,785
But why am I
getting a present?

94
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,290
Because you deserve it.

95
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,252
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

96
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,462
Gods, I was stubborn
about it.

97
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,299
Made it this far
without reading.

98
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,926
Seemed to me I could
make it to the grave.

99
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,222
Wish I'd listened to him.

100
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,059
This is my own poor way
of saying thank you.

101
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,773
For teaching me
to be a grown-up.

102
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,237
I'll be gone
for a few days,
Princess.

103
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,198
I want to hear all about
"The Dance of Dragons"
when I'm back.

104
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,284
You'll read it yourself.

105
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,967
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

106
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,307
Prince Doran.

107
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,809
Forgive us.
We started without you.

108
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,854
<i>Please, sit.</i>

109
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,440
Princess Myrcella.

110
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,025
Uncle.

111
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,818
What a lovely dress.

112
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,862
- You don't like it?
- You must be cold.

113
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,574
Not at all.
The Dornish climate
agrees with me.

114
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,453
Prince Trystane.

115
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,831
How's your jaw?

116
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,542
A fleabite.

117
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,252
What are you
doing in Dorne?

118
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,755
Looking after
the safety of my niece,
the Princess Myrcella.

119
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,883
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

120
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,386
you decided to enter
my country in secret

121
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,137
and abduct our guest
by force?

122
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,224
We received
a threatening message.

123
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,477
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

124
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,064
That necklace
was stolen from my room.

125
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,781
Oh, excellent.

126
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,033
A last meal before
the beheading?

127
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,743
Oh, I can't behead you.

128
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,079
Many in Dorne want war.

129
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,123
But I've seen war.

130
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,875
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

131
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,379
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

132
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,381
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

133
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,342
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

134
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,845
And that is precisely
what we are doing.

135
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,267
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

136
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,727
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

137
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,063
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

138
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,866
( slams )

139
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,958
King Tommen insists

140
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,961
on his sister's return
to the capital?

141
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,130
I'm afraid he does.

142
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,135
I cannot disobey
my king's command.

143
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,637
She will return with you
to King's Landing.

144
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,974
<i>And my son Prince Trystane</i>
<i>will accompany you both.</i>

145
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,895
If the alliance between
the Iron Throne and Dorne
is to continue,

146
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,521
their engagement
must stand.

147
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,440
I accept.

148
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,276
One more thing.
My brother was named

149
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,987
to the small council
before his death.

150
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,906
Your father understood
the importance

151
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,991
<i>of keeping Dorne</i>
<i>in the fold.</i>

152
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,496
With Oberyn gone,
Trystane will take his place
on the small council.

153
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,705
You have my word.

154
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,041
The word
of a kingslayer.

155
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:59,547
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

156
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,841
You are mother
to four of my nieces,

157
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,593
girls I love very much.

158
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,346
For their sake,
I hope you live
a long and happy life.

159
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,098
Speak to me
that way again,
and you won't.

160
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,485
May I inquire
as to the fate
of my man Bronn?

161
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,446
Tell me, Ser Jaime,
in King's Landing,

162
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,908
how do they
punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

163
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
He said it was
just a fleabite.

164
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,830
The fault is mine.

165
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,999
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

166
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,336
If anyone should
be punished, it's me.

167
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,631
Prince Trystane
must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

168
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,341
I'll let him decide.

169
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,890
I have learned
the value of mercy
from my father.

170
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,227
-<i> I'll set your man free.</i>
- You're a good man.

171
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,146
On one condition.

172
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,566
<i>( hands slapping )</i>

173
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,198
Why do we play?
I'm better than you.

174
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,409
I'll always
be better than you.

175
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,412
Have I ever missed once?

176
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,164
I don't think I have.
I can't recall.

177
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,625
You must love humiliation.
Or pain.

178
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,462
Which do you love most,
humiliation or pain?

179
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,591
That one hurt,
didn't it?

180
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,510
- ( smacks )
- You going to cry?

181
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,262
Give up, little sister.

182
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,764
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

183
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,767
You will.
You're thinking too much.

184
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,979
Now you're nervous.
What if she's right?

185
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,444
- Luck.
- Now it's my turn.

186
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,945
You're too slow.

187
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,655
You've always been
too slow.

188
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,080
<i>( cell door unlocks )</i>

189
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,466
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

190
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,468
You'll find out
very soon.

191
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,348
Say it one more time,
handsome.

192
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,599
Who am I?

193
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,811
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

194
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,146
And that's the truth.

195
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,815
- Slut.
-<i> ( Tyene laughs )</i>

196
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,651
Prince Doran,

197
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,320
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

198
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,365
I didn't realize there were
knights of the Blackwater.

199
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,658
Only the one.

200
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,535
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

201
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,621
Prince.

202
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,456
Sorry about
the other day.

203
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,042
Jaime:
<i>Prince Trystane here</i>
<i>is a man of mercy.</i>

204
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,252
He's agreed to grant
you your freedom.

205
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,881
I'm glad to hear it.

206
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,009
Pie looks good.

207
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,428

Oysters, clams,

How much
for your little clam?

( laughs )

217

Oysters, clams,

Oysters, clams,
and cockles.

Come on.

On behalf

may I be the first
to welcome you

231
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,920
to the Free City
of Braavos.

232
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,588
I hope your journey
was trouble-free.

233
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,673
A bit of chop
the last few days.

234
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,300
Nothing too awful.

235
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,220
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

236
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,347
And how goes
the harvest
in the Reach?

237
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,808
Ah, the vintners say
this might be

238
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,311
the best year
for red grapes
in half a century.

a cask of the Arbor's
finest your way.

Oh.

usury distasteful,
dishonorable.

Pure nonsense,

00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,177
Perhaps that is why
a man is thin.

315
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,845
Tomorrow.

316
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,890
- Tomorrow.
-<i> ( thuds )</i>

317
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,018
A girl has work to do.

318
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,951
Your rebellion is over.

319
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,579
You can swear
your allegiance
to me now...

320
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,082
or you can die.

321
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,110
( crying )

322
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,453
I believe
in second chances.

323
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,333
I don't believe
in third chances.

324
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,656
You write like
a seven-year-old.

325
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,450
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

326
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,160
<i>He didn't try</i>
<i>to make you pay?</i>

327
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,745
Mm-mmm.

328
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,956
Maybe he's changed.

329
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,334
The queen will be thrilled
to know you're bringing
her daughter home.

330
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,752
She will.

331
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,963
You love her very much,
don't you?

332
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,590
Of course,
she's my niece.

333
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,384
I wasn't talking
about her.

334
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,555
You think I disapprove?

335
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,265
Why?

336
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,184
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing
where you are from?

337
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,313
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

338
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:31,150
Here no one
blinked an eye.

339
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,694
100 years ago,

340
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,280
no one would have
blinked an eye at you

341
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,157
if you'd been named
Targaryen.

342
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,121
It's always changing,
who we're supposed to love
and who we're not.

343
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,458
The only thing
that stays the same

344
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,377
is that we want
who we want.

345
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,514
I know your
daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

346
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,767
that happened
to the man I love.

347
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,772
Perhaps even you
are innocent of that.

348
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,619
<i>( horse whinnying )</i>

349
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,374
<i>( tent flap rustles )</i>

350
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,334
Father.

351
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,214
Aren't you cold?

352
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,636
No.
What are you
reading?

353
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,347
- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

354
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,808
It's the story
of the fight between
Rhaenyra Targaryen

355
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,061
and her half-brother
Aegon for control over
the Seven Kingdoms.

356
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,897
Both of them thought
they belonged on
the Iron Throne.

357
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,109
When people started
declaring for one of them
or the other,

358
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,319
their fight divided
the kingdoms in two.

359
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,697
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

360
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,370
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

361
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,540
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

362
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,251
They never truly recovered.

363
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,336
"The Dance of Dragons."

364
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,215
Why is that a dance?

365
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,591
It's just what
they call it.

366
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,969
Hmm, doesn't make
much sense.

367
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,679
I think it's poetic.

368
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,230
If you had to choose

369
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,400
between Rhaenyra
and Aegon...

370
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,820
who would you
have chosen?

371
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,072
I wouldn't have
chosen either.

372
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,492
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything
so horrible.

373
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,619
Sometimes a person
has to choose.

374
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,041
Sometimes the world
forces his hand.

375
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:58,088
If a man knows
what he is...

376
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,176
and remains true
to himself...

377
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,056
the choice
is no choice at all.

378
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,143
He must fulfill
his destiny...

379
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,482
and become
who he is meant to be.

380
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,361
However much
he may hate it.

381
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,157
It's all right, Father.

382
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,285
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

383
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,037
It doesn't matter.

384
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,206
I want to help you.

385
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,124
Is there any way
I can help?

386
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,509
Yes, there is.

387
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,260
Good. I want to.

388
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,432
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

389
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,518
And I'm your daughter.

390
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,531
( sighs )

391
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,742
Forgive me.

392
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,411
Where's my father?
I want to see my father.

393
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,539
It will all be over
soon, Princess.

394
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,919
( crying )
No.

395
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,507
Where's my father?

396
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,260
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

397
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,554
<i>Please, let me</i>
<i>see my father.</i>

398
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,557
<i>Father, where are you?</i>
<i>Don't let her do this.</i>

399
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,311
Please let go!

400
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,606
<i>Let me see my father!</i>
<i>Where are you? Please!</i>

401
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,066
- Selyse: It's what
the Lord wants.
- Shireen: No.

402
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,153
-<i> Please! Let go! No!</i>
- It's a good thing.

403
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,238
- A great thing.
- Shireen:<i> Stop. Stop!</i>

404
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,782
- Shireen:<i> Please!</i>
- Melisandre:<i> Hear us now,</i>
<i>my Lord.</i>

405
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,118
- Shireen:<i> You can't do this!</i>
- Melisandre:<i> For you,</i>
<i>we offer up this girl</i>

406
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,787
- Please!
-<i> ...that you may cleanse</i>
<i>her with your fire</i>

407
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,706
and that its light
may lead our way.

408
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,042
Shireen:<i> Please!</i>
<i>No, please let me</i>
<i>see my father.</i>

409
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,336
If we don't act,
we'll all starve here.

410
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,129
-<i> All of us.</i>
-<i> ( Shireen crying )</i>

411
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,048
But if we make
this sacrifice...

412
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,300
Melisandre:
<i>Accept this token</i>
<i>of our faith, my Lord,</i>

413
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,886
and lead us
from the darkness.

414
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,139
- Lord of Light,
show us the way.
- Mother!

415
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,266
Mother, please!

416
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,728
Mother, please!
Mother!

417
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,897
-<i> Mother!</i>
- We can't.

418
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,815
- There's no other way.
She has king's blood.
-<i> Please don't do this!</i>

419
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,984
Melisandre:
<i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>protect us.</i>

420
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:09,988
- Please! Father, please!
-<i> For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

421
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,490

00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,492
Father, don't do this!
Please!

423

Clap your hands.

That one,
the smaller man.

No question,
that's where you
should put your money.

456
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,520
The smaller man it is.

457
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,314
I'm not putting
my money anywhere.

458
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,608
Kings and queens
never bet on the games.

459
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,068
Perhaps you should go
find someone who does.

460
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,071
People used
to bet against me when
I fought in the pits.

461
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,908
He would have
bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

462
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,868
I've spent much
of my life in this arena.

463
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,203
And in my experience,
large men do triumph

464
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,247
over smaller men
far more often than not.

465
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,584
Has your experience
ever involved any
actual fighting?

466
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,544
You yourself?

467
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,963
Have you ever
tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

468
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,093
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

469
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,596
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone
back then,

470
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,891
then they saw
a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

471
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,226
They couldn't get their
money out fast enough.

472
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,939
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

473
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,025
or... here.

474
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,902
And the big men
were always too slow

475
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,780
to stop my dagger
from going where their
muscles weren't.

476
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,617
Yes, whenever I saw
a beast like that one
standing across from me

477
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,955
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

You don't approve?

480
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,304
There's always been
more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

481
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,223
I can do without it
in my leisure time.

482
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,017
Fair enough.
Yet it's an unpleasant
question,

483
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:35,355
but what great thing
has ever been accomplished
without killing or cruelty?

484
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,650
It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,

485
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,361
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

486
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,238
I'm not talking
about myself.

487
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,949
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions
for greatness.

488
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,826
That is greatness?

489
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:51,579
That is a vital part
of the great city
of Meereen,

490
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,832
which existed
long before you or I

491
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:58,294
and will remain standing
long after we have returned
to the dirt.

492
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,463
My father
would have liked you.

will return to the dirt
as well.

498

- And how many people will die
to make this happen?

499
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,200
If it comes to that,
they will have died
for a good reason.

500
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,369
Those men think they're
dying for a good reason.

501
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,121
Someone else's reason.

502
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,707
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

503
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,293
They don't know
their own minds,
but you do?

Well said.
You're an eloquent man.

Doesn't mean you're wrong.

506
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,300
In my experience,
eloquent men are right

507
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,385
every bit as often
as imbeciles.
