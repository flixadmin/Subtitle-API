<i>ANGUS MacLANE: I just want to
point out right away</i>

any singing in space.</i>

3

you know,</i>

11

<i>that galaxy is rotating really fast
in the beginning.</i>

12

<i>ANGUS: That's pretty nerdy.</i>

51
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:32,050
<i>DEREK: Actually, the acronym
changed a couple of times</i>

52
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:36,137
<i>because a second "L" was added
midway through the production, so...</i>

53
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,222
<i>ANGUS: Why was that?</i>

54
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:38,616
<i>LINDSEY: It's because
everybody was worried</i>

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,601
<i>that people would
mispronounce the title as "Whale"</i>

56

<i>without the second "L".
I'm serious. We had to add...</i>

Was it a pronunciation thing?</i>

58
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,749
<i>ANGUS: Further putting forth
our environmental message.</i>

59
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:48,125
<i>LINDSEY: It was a pronunciation thing.</i>

60
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,377
<i>- DEREK: All right.
- It was a pronunciation thing.</i>

61
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:51,837
<i>They were like, "Everybody's gonna
mispronounce it and call it 'Whale',"</i>

62
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,506
<i>which is not nearly
as endearing or charming,</i>

63
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,241
<i>and slightly misleading, frankly,
a film called "Whale."</i>

64
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>DEREK: And that is
endearment personified right there.</i>

65
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,619
<i>That's our little friend.</i>

66

<i>ANGUS: I gotta say, there's no way</i>

67
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:02,872
<i>the hubcap would still be
that pristine...</i>

68
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:04,975
<i>DEREK: And shiny.
BILL: If it was crunched into a cube?</i>

69
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,309
<i>DEREK: Yeah. Well, nobody's
used an automobile</i>

70
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,085
<i>for 700, 800 years.</i>

71
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,713
<i>ANGUS: So, is that actually an Igloo?</i>

72
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,649
<i>- Did you talk to the Igloo people?
- LINDSEY: Yeah.</i>

73
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,968
<i>- And you got their cooler...
- Yeah.</i>

74
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:17,404

Oh, that's good.</i>

75

this guy through the whole thing?</i>

76
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,657
<i>ANGUS: What? No, I'm not that guy.</i>

77
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:25,185
<i>DEREK: I have a little bit of a
back story for Hal the cockroach.</i>

78
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,938
<i>Can you tell me, Angus,
how Hal got his name?</i>

79
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:32,609
<i>I believe it was Reardon who
wanted to call him Hal. Is that right?</i>

80
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,754
<i>- HAL the computer or...
- DEREK: No, you're incorrect.</i>

81
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:36,618
<i>- Hal Roach? Hal Roach.
- It was for Hal Roach.</i>

82
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,784
<i>Filmmaker, made a lot of</i>
Little Rascals <i>shorts in the '30s.</i>

83
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:44,955
<i>It could work on the "HAL
the computer" level, too, I suppose.</i>

84
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,373
<i>A lot of acronyms in this movie.</i>

85
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:47,851
<i>ANGUS: Yeah, it was
a double nerd reference,</i>

86
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,352
<i>which is important for any of our jokes.</i>

87
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,919
<i>DEREK: Right, right.</i>

88
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:54,173
<i>ANGUS: There's gas.
And in the future here,</i>

89
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:56,467
<i>money is just like on the streets.</i>

90
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,762
<i>So although no one is around
and it's totally lonely,</i>

91
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:01,325
<i>there's tons of money, which is nice.</i>

92
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:03,366
<i>DEREK: And this is
a perfect opportunity</i>

93
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,063
<i>to point out the copious amount
of dystopian versus utopian worlds</i>

94
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:10,206
<i>we're gonna see in this movie.</i>

95
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,151
<i>And that is a recurring theme in a lot
of science fiction movies that we love,</i>

96
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:17,362
<i>but this sort of dystopian future,
this trashed world...</i>

97
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,907
<i>ANGUS: Not for my benefit,
but for our watchers...</i>

98
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,217
<i>LINDSEY: We all know
what you mean.</i>

99
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,719
<i>ANGUS: What is the difference
between dystopian and...</i>

100
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:24,220
<i>LINDSEY: Will you please
define "dystopian" for the...</i>

<i>DEREK: Dystopian is a...</i>

<i>BILL: Are you gonna be
like Mr. Professor this whole...</i>

103
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,519
<i>ANGUS: I think
that's about the size of it.</i>

104
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:31,878
<i>Let him finish.</i>

105
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,481
<i>DEREK: He asked the question.
ANGUS: So, "dystopian"?</i>

106
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,882
<i>DEREK: Dystopian is a bleak vision
of the future.</i>

107
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:39,718
<i>Utopian is an optimistic vision
of the future.</i>

108
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,613
<i>ANGUS: There's a contrast there.
DEREK: There is a contrast.</i>

109
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,698
<i>- We have both of those things.
- We do have both of those things.</i>

110
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:46,600
<i>And I'll remind us later,
when we get to it.</i>

111
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:49,311
<i>LINDSEY: I will point it out.
ANGUS: I would like to point out...</i>

112
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:52,189
<i>I don't know how those trash piles
go into boxes there,</i>

113
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,752
<i>so that doesn't make any sense to me.</i>

114
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:55,335
<i>DEREK: Well, I know that
Ralph and his team figured out</i>

<i>- the mechanics of the sequence...
- LINDSEY: Oh, no... Yeah.</i>

116
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,630
<i>- It's incinerated.

117
00:04:58,654 --> 00:04:59,798
<i>ANGUS: Oh, it's going
the opposite direction.</i>

<i>BILL: Yeah, they go down.</i>

<i>ANGUS: Oh, I was seeing it wrong.
I was seeing it wrong.</i>

121
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,078
<i>DEREK: They put
a tremendous amount of thought</i>

122
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,247
<i>into the mechanics and the procedure.</i>

123
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,474
<i>LINDSEY: For one shot.
DEREK: For one shot.</i>

124

<i>But you know what? It's that kind of
thorough planning that makes...</i>

125

<i>LINDSEY: That makes
these movies cost $150 million.</i>

ANGUS: They put a little twist on it.</i>

00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,090
<i>DEREK: You know?
It's called verisimilitude, Lindsey.</i>

128
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:21,277
<i>It's bringing a level of truth to this.
Oh, there's a little glimpse of utopia.</i>

The introduction of live-action.</i>

<i>It's not supposed to
really be taking off.</i>

<i>BILL: No, no, no, that thing's huge.</i>

148
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,465
<i>I mean, you know,
people stand around</i>

149

That looks like he's like right there.</i>

the Igloo earlier...</i>

<i>ANGUS: I guess
we can agree to disagree.</i>

<i>LINDSEY: Many.
DEREK: Many?</i>

<i>BILL: Five or six, baby.</i>

<i>DEREK: Five or six actual objects?</i>

161

<i>DEREK: It's an anchor to
a world we know.</i>

164
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:33,789
<i>I mean, this is the closest

a lot of films... anyway.</i>

they have the little screens</i>

Was in it all the way along.</i>

<i>LINDSEY: All the way along.</i>

178

- Because we were trapped.</i>

<i>ANGUS: Yeah. Many people are
trapped by the vision of</i> Hello, Dolly!

183

<i>DEREK: Hello, Dolly! has
two great songs in it,</i>

184
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:16,581

185

<i>ANGUS: No, no,
it has three great songs.</i>

<i>DEREK: Really?
What's the third great song?</i>

187
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,671
<i>'Cause I don't know
the songs well enough.</i>

I don't know.</i>

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.

<i>- DEREK: No, no, no.
- Than I have about anything.</i>

198
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,234
<i>DEREK: But get this. In Japan,
they have a term called</i> otaku,

199
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:48,195

<i>LINDSEY: The thing is, I'm not that

203
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,411
<i>ANGUS: What about
'80s teen dramas?</i>

204
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,204
<i>- No.
- Coming-of-age films?</i>

205
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:58,723
<i>- Daddy disapproval movies, where...
- Uh-uh. Nope.</i>

<i>- No.
- DEREK: Hey, there's Hal again.</i>

209
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,754
<i>We like cockroaches.</i>

210

<i>LINDSEY: Well, we went rats last time.
We figured roaches...</i>

<i>DEREK: Yeah, yeah, well, in France...</i>

212
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,068
<i>LINDSEY: Little pieces of

there's an interesting thing.</i>

218
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,288
<i>Somebody was telling me
that while most people believe</i>

<i>that cockroaches will be the last
surviving creature on the planet,</i>

220

<i>if humans were gone, cockroaches
would apparently die out pretty quickly</i>

221
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,697
<i>because most of what they live on
is human waste.</i>

222
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,826
<i>So, while they're resistant
to nuclear, you know...</i>

223
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,787
<i>ANGUS: I was not aware
we had to prepare for this.</i>

- DEREK: In the story room,</i>

228
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,858
<i>the conversations would drift
to all of these things, and...</i>

<i>ANGUS: I'm sorry, I gotta interrupt.
I gotta interrupt. Look at that.</i>

230
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:55,095
<i>That snack cake.</i>

231

<i>ANGUS: You know what?
I can't believe</i>

239

00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,272

- All right. Well, anyway...</i>

244
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,138
<i>DEREK: But, yeah, that little cake has
two cream holes instead of three</i>

245
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,330
<i>and that's a good cream hole.</i>

246
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,183
<i>LINDSEY: Which distinguishes it
from the other snack cakes.</i>

247
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:26,518
<i>ANGUS: It is not like
the other snack cake. It is a Creamie.</i>

00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,628
<i>DEREK: Robot point of view.
That's pretty exciting.</i>

00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,311
<i>We get to see
a few robot point of views.</i>

250

<i>ANGUS: Not that I'm aware of.</i>

253
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,155
<i>BILL: You mean in terms of like
which shots were going to be?</i>

254
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,324
<i>DEREK: Well, no, just... I mean,
I think that happens in story,</i>

Terminator vision.</i>

281
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:47,038
<i>ANGUS: I'm sorry.
We said no spoilers.</i>

282
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:50,292
<i>DEREK: That's a bra. This is a G-rated
movie and there's a bra in this movie.</i>

283
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,727
<i>ANGUS: No, he thinks
it's a pair of goggles.</i>

00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,062

and that's what makes it G.</i>

<i>DEREK: This car alarm bit's
pretty funny, too,</i>

287
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:00,677
<i>- 'cause of that car alarm battery.
- LINDSEY: Paddleball.</i>

288
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,346
<i>ANGUS: Paddleball, yep.
DEREK: Diamond ring.</i>

<i>LINDSEY: Name those carats.
DEREK: You're pretty observant.</i>

290
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:06,992
<i>- How many carats in that ring?
- LINDSEY: How many carats?</i>

291
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,809
<i>Well, actually, thanks for asking.</i>

292
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:10,162
<i>ANGUS: It depends on
three Vs, right?</i>

293
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:11,687
<i>DEREK: That's a Lindsey question.</i>

<i>BILL: Aren't you gonna say that
all that stuff wouldn't fit in the Igloo?</i>

295
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,251
<i>ANGUS: Oh, no,
we'd just swap that out.</i>

<i>- Captain Bringdown?
- LINDSEY: "Captain Bringdown"?</i>

Captain Bringdown?</i>

298

<i>BILL: Well, you did...
DEREK: This is some foreshadowing.</i>

299
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,304
<i>Okay? Just so you know. There it is.</i>

300
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:27,578
<i>BILL: Now, this totally negates your
"couldn't build the tower"...</i>

301
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:30,664
<i>- ANGUS: It's a montage!
- But it's one day!</i>

302
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:33,477
<i>ANGUS: No, but we're only told that
from the lighting. We can fake that.</i>

303
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,604
<i>BILL: He gets a good start.
DEREK: This one always got me.</i>

304
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:40,382
<i>How could that plant grow inside
the refrigerator? But I guess it's open.</i>

305
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,194
<i>LINDSEY: It's not open.
ANGUS: The refrigerator was open,</i>

306
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,428
<i>and then there was a strong wind
that day, it closed...</i>

307
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:46,514
<i>BILL: If he can do
basically a base layer</i>

308
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:48,892
<i>at the widest part of
the tower in a day...</i>

309
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,060
<i>ANGUS: Okay.
BILL: Okay?</i>

310
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,438
<i>And then how many levels
are there gonna be for a trash tower?</i>

311
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:55,541
<i>DEREK: Remember, it wasn't just him.
ANGUS: Three hundred, 400.</i>

312
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,001
<i>BILL: All right.
So that's 300, 400 days, tops.</i>

313
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,753
<i>DEREK: Think about how many
WALL-Es were helping him out.</i>

314
00:11:58,777 --> 00:11:59,837
<i>BILL: He could build one in a year.</i>

315
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,030
<i>ANGUS: Okay, okay, okay.
LINDSEY: It's been 800 years.</i>

316
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,468
<i>ANGUS: That's times the rate of
the WALL-E deaths, or the other ones.</i>

317
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,470
<i>- DEREK: Yeah, how long would...
- So, if each one...</i>

318
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,496
<i>BILL: I'm just saying a single WALL-E,
our guy...</i>

319
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,748
<i>- ANGUS: Yeah.
- If he can build the base of a tower</i>

320
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,334
<i>in a day, and that's the widest part,</i>

321
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:17,504

it's gonna be, it's gonna be less.</i>

322
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:20,005
<i>He can do it in a year,
maybe a year and a half.</i>

323
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,715
<i>DEREK: Okay?
ANGUS: Yeah.</i>

<i>[ALL LAUGHING]</i>

325
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:30,474
<i>DEREK: So, Angus, something
gives me the feeling</i>

326
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:32,768
<i>that the scale of these dots bother you.</i>

327
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:36,063
<i>ANGUS: Don't prompt me for stuff
I've already talked about.</i>

328
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,482
<i>BILL: This has always
bugged me a little bit.</i>

329
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,734
<i>It's like the ship is
supposedly coming down.</i>

330
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:43,320
<i>It's got these, like, laser sights
or whatever.</i>

331
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:44,881
<i>ANGUS: It's finding
a good place to land.</i>

332
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:47,700
<i>BILL: And the little dot is
just like moving around.</i>

333
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,702
<i>- DEREK: It's triangulating.
- It's trying to...</i>

334
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,846
<i>Yeah, but does that mean
the ship is doing that, or...</i>

335
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,139
<i>ANGUS: No, no, no, no. There's like</i>

336
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,790
<i>an omnidirectional laser
on the bottom.</i>

337
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,960
<i>And what's happening with WALL-E
is that he is acting as...</i>

338
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,163
<i>Like, something that the ship
doesn't want to land on.</i>

339
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,214
<i>So that's why it's trying
to get away from WALL-E.</i>

340
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,483
<i>So if WALL-E wasn't doing that,</i>

341
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,151
<i>it would have landed
I guess next to his house.</i>

342
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,528
<i>- BILL: You're making that up.
- No!</i>

343
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,321
<i>- You are totally making that up.
- I was told...</i>

344
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:10,282
<i>DEREK: You gotta think on your feet
in this place, man.</i>

345
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:14,810
<i>It was omnidirectional laser,
or a light-emitting...</i>

346
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,580
<i>- DEREK: Laser.
- What does "laser" stand for?</i>

347
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:18,415
<i>DEREK: That's a good question.
BILL: No, no, no. It...</i>

348
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,190
<i>LINDSEY: Bill,
what's "laser" stand for?</i>

349
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,751
<i>DEREK: I didn't know laser
was an acronym, but it is.</i>

350
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:25,070
<i>BILL: "Light Amplification..."
I don't remember.</i>

351
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,905
<i>DEREK: You see,
it's just another acronym.</i>

352
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,700
<i>ANGUS: We just lost half the country
on that one.</i>

353
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:32,202
<i>- DEREK: Now here is the...
- We don't know what laser means.</i>

354
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:34,180
<i>Sort of</i> Close Encounters <i>type shot,
but you...</i>

355
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,084
<i>LINDSEY: Yeah,
that was a tricky shot, actually.</i>

356
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,626
<i>DEREK: It really works well, I think.</i>

357
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,463
<i>ANGUS: I think this would be real...
And it's a design flaw of the ship.</i>

358
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,965
<i>If you were standing underneath it,
you could not get out.</i>

359
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,550
<i>I think that that's...</i>

360
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,802
<i>DEREK: Well, he's going under,
though, so it's all...</i>

361
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:51,846
<i>- ANGUS: Well, he has that ability.
- Yeah. He doesn't dig much later.</i>

362
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,890
<i>- LINDSEY: He's a digger.
- DEREK: Yeah.</i>

363
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,391

DEREK: I don't think it would cool...</i>

it would cool down that quickly.</i>

370

sophisticated ceramic.</i>

if you're gonna have a tape that lasts</i>

695
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,507
<i>BILL: Yeah, it's not like the toaster
he keeps the tape in</i>

696

<i>is a really modern... You know.</i>

697
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,536
<i>ANGUS: That's what's kept it alive,
is heating it.</i>

698
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,414
<i>DEREK: No, the toaster doesn't work.
It's just a container.</i>

699
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:18,665
<i>Come on.</i>

700
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:20,292
<i>- BILL: How do you know?
- I know!</i>

701
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,604
<i>- Oh, 'cause you wrote it, right?
- No, I didn't write it.</i>

702
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:24,963
<i>ANGUS: Okay. He would totally die.
BILL: What?</i>

703
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,941
<i>LINDSEY: What?
ANGUS: I think if he hit the side wall...</i>

704
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:29,069
<i>DEREK: That would have been the
decapitating maneuver right there.</i>

705
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:30,862
<i>ANGUS: That's it. That's it. He's dead.
BILL: He's damaged.</i>

706
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:32,889
<i>LINDSEY: He hurt himself!</i>

707
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:34,241
<i>DEREK: So here we're coming back</i>

708

of WALL-E rebuild...</i>

<i>BILL: The cannibalism point.</i>

<i>DEREK: Self-cannibalism,
self-rebuilding.</i>

711
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:44,401
<i>ANGUS: Hold on. I got it.
BILL: So, does he have a soul?</i>

712
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,195
<i>- ANGUS: Yeah, sure.
- Does he have consciousness?</i>

713
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,407
<i>- That we can agree, yeah.
- So what part does it live in if he can</i>

714
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,283
<i>replace all these parts of himself?</i>

715
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:54,053
<i>LINDSEY: It lives in
that little deck that gets...</i>

716
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:57,747
<i>ANGUS: It's inside his chest. I believe
that his brain is inside his chest.</i>

717
00:26:58,456 --> 00:27:01,167
<i>BILL: So if that's where his soul is...</i>

718
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:03,670
<i>So if that gets destroyed,
he gets no...</i>

719
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:05,523
<i>LINDSEY: Well, let's not
ruin the end of the film.</i>

720
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:06,565
<i>DEREK: Yeah, man.
ANGUS: We already said</i>

721
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:08,925
<i>- there's gonna be spoilers...
- BILL: I said "if"!</i>

<i>- LINDSEY: Hypothetically.
- Hypothetically!</i>

723
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:12,637
<i>ANGUS: It's gotta be in his chest,</i>

724
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,931
<i>because that's...
Oh, but then that gets fried.</i>

<i>BILL: Does it get fried?</i>

726

<i>DEREK: It gets damaged,

<i>- totally destroyed.
- ANGUS: You're right.</i>

728
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:21,938
<i>I think you just discovered one
of the biggest holes in the film.</i>

729
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:24,667
<i>I think we should just stop right now
and go back and try and correct that.</i>

730
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,752
<i>BILL: I think consciousness is
an emergent phenomena.</i>

731
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:28,003
<i>DEREK: Have we already
done the prints?</i>

732
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:29,612

<i>God, that looks beautiful.
Look at that.</i>

734
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,242
<i>LINDSEY: It's Andrew's favorite shot
in the film.</i>

to her hand.</i>

<i>DEREK: Right. What keeps her fingers
floating there?</i>

00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:40,723
<i>Is it the same kind of
counter... Electromagnetic...</i>

738

<i>LINDSEY: Same thing
that keeps her head floating.</i>

<i>BILL: Yeah.
What keeps her floating at all?</i>

740

<i>DEREK: Well, no, that's just it.</i>

741
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:47,230
<i>There's some sort of...
I mean, how much thought</i>

components of EVE'S...</i>

<i>- DEREK: Right.
- Would it not naturally attract</i>

<i>WALL-E's hand in that shot?</i>

746
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:59,784
<i>DEREK: That's how much she doesn't
want to hold his hand, though.</i>

747
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,286
<i>ANGUS: Oh, it's repelling,
so it's the opposite.</i>

748
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,787
<i>DEREK: Yeah.
Maybe it's a counter-magnet.</i>

749
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,247
<i>ANGUS: Is that what it's called,
a counter-magnet?</i>

750
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:07,065
<i>DEREK: No. I don't know.
LINDSEY: The anti-magnet.</i>

751

<i>BILL: We actually don't know
what kind of force it is.</i>

752

<i>DEREK: How do you say The Force
in Huttese?</i>

753
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:12,797
<i>LINDSEY: Anyone?
BILL: I don't know.</i>

754
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,466
<i>ANGUS: I don't think the Hutts
refer to The Force.</i>

755
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,782
<i>Do they believe in The Force?</i>

756
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,093
<i>DEREK: Yeah, they do.
They're aware of the Jedi.</i>

<i>BILL: They say "Jedi."</i>

758
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:19,387

<i>LINDSEY: Is it canon?
ANGUS: "Is it canon?"</i>

00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:21,747
<i>What does that mean?</i>

761
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,041
<i>BILL: He burps and says, "Jedi."
Remember?</i>

00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:26,269

you're right, you're right.</i>

<i>I know what canon is.</i>

766

<i>took things a little more seriously,</i>

<i>DEREK: Hey, there's EVE'S POV.
Look how much different that is from...</i>

770
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:41,350
<i>ANGUS: You're interrupting
my Jedi conversation.</i>

DEREK: What did Jabba need to do?</i>

774
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:49,066
<i>ANGUS: He just needed to have
the Gamorrean guards</i>

<i>- hold on to their weapons...
- BILL: The pig guards.</i>

<i>So they didn't lose them,</i>

777

Jedis are good at,</i>

<i>LINDSEY: Yeah.
Completely cheated.</i>

785

00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:17,145
<i>So if you have more dust particles
in the air,</i>

833
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,313
<i>you're gonna have more scattering.</i>

834

<i>ANGUS: I'd like to point out that
if he can play a Pong game that long,</i>

835
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,174
<i>he's very, very patient.</i>

836
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,217
<i>DEREK: Yeah, I can't believe you guys
let a Pong shot just go by unnoticed.</i>

837
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,657
<i>ANGUS: I mean, what kind of patient
gamer can do that? I mean, I get...</i>

838
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:31,081
<i>- DEREK: I know. Up to 8, 000?
- I mean, he could probably...</i>

839
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,328
<i>LINDSEY: He's been stacking trash for
800 years. He has patience.</i>

840
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:34,496
<i>DEREK: So Pong, was that Atari?</i>

841
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,955
<i>ANGUS: I think
Tetris would blow his mind.</i>

842
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,332
<i>- Who made the original Pong?
- LINDSEY: Atari.</i>

843
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,274
<i>- Is it Atari?
- It's Atari.</i>

844
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,277
<i>BILL: You love Pong.
DEREK: No, I missed Pong.</i>

845

846
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,991
<i>- No, no...
- Like, please! Like Flynn in</i> TRON?

sitting here if it wasn't for</i> TRON.

853
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:04,526
<i>DEREK: Did we reference</i> TRON?

854
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,985
<i>ANGUS: We asked

855
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,594
<i>"and they said," Please do,</i>

<i>ANGUS: That was 1982...
BILL: "New</i> TRON"?

<i>- BILL: No, a neutron?
- Oh, got it, yeah.</i>

861
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,041
<i>LINDSEY: It's a joke.
It's a science joke.</i>

00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,501
<i>DEREK: That was
a science joke, yeah.</i>

863
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,360
<i>BILL: This is going to
look great on Blu-ray.</i>

<i>DEREK: Yeah, we are not
watching this on Blu-ray right now.</i>

865
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,466
<i>ANGUS: You can't say "Blu-ray."
You're not supposed to say "Blu-ray."</i>

866
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,993
<i>Don't you know that?
It's like saying... What if you said...</i>

867
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,346
<i>What if this was VHS times, you said,
"We're loving this on VHS"?</i>

868
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,164
<i>No one watches VHS anymore.
Some people do.</i>

869

<i>Say we say, we're watching it
on videodisc...</i>

So say we're...</i>

<i>We've just ruined it
for future generations.</i>

<i>DEREK: So this is a great little thing
with the cockroach staying still.</i>

875
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,071
<i>And he stays still, spoiler,
till the end of the movie.</i>

876
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:56,642
<i>But it's referencing the Hachiko dog
sculpture and story from Japan.</i>

877
00:32:56,726 --> 00:33:00,521
<i>In Kyoto, there's a sculpture of a dog
that waited for its master, who died,</i>

<i>and the dog waited
for years and years and years.</i>

<i>- ANGUS: What? Who fed the dog?
- Of this dog...</i>

DEREK: No, it's this uplifting...</i>

00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,362
<i>ANGUS: Who fed the dog?</i>

883

<i>BILL: That's fine, but nobody watching
this movie would see that.</i>

00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,075
<i>ANGUS: What does he eat?</i>

885
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,344
<i>DEREK: That's what
we're here to point out!</i>

886
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,829
<i>ANGUS: Oh, my gosh.
That's gold. I think it's hilarious.</i>

887
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,142
<i>DEREK: That's just a beautiful shot,
and we all acknowledge it.</i>

888
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,335
<i>BILL: Yeah.
LINDSEY: Yes, it's gorgeous.</i>

889
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,881
<i>DEREK: There he is, Hachiko Roach.
I think that's great.</i>

890
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,109
<i>ANGUS: Are you going to put that
in subtitles below, Hachiko Roach?</i>

891
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,385
<i>DEREK: No. Maybe I'm the only one
who saw it, but...</i>

892
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,595
<i>ANGUS: Okay. No way. No way.</i>

893
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,115
<i>DEREK: Okay. Talk about it. What
almost was gonna be in this star field?</i>

894
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,826
<i>ANGUS: Okay. Right here we were
gonna put the Slave One rocketing off.</i>

895
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,703
<i>DEREK: Do you know what
the Slave One is, Lindsey?</i>

896

<i>- ANGUS: Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

897
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,482
<i>I'm glad you asked, because...</i>

898
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,085
<i>LINDSEY: That's really why I'm here.
ANGUS: I'll let Bill take this one.</i>

899
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,461
<i>BILL: You do know.
You know what the Slave One is.</i>

900
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,612
<i>- No.
- Boba Fett's ship.</i>

901
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:52,798
<i>ANGUS: Do you know
who Boba Fett is?</i>

902
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,903
<i>I do know who Boba Fett is.</i>

903
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,349
<i>BILL: What he's talking about is,
in</i> The Empire Strikes Back,

904
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:00,247
<i>when the</i> Millennium Falcon
<i>is stuck to the side</i>

905

<i>of the</i> Star Destroyer, <i>and
that's how they escape detection...</i>

906
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,351
<i>ANGUS: Which one is that?
LINDSEY: Right.</i>

907
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,627
<i>And then they like float off
with the garbage</i>

908
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,647
<i>- and take off toward Bespin.
- LINDSEY: I'm with you.</i>

909
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,065
<i>- And then...
- Didn't know it was called Bespin.</i>

910
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,316
<i>ANGUS: It's the Cloud City.
Everyone knows it.</i>

911
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,550
<i>BILL: And then you see one of</i>

912

<i>the tumbling pieces of
garbage behind them</i>

913

<i>slowly right itself and become...</i>

914
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,319
<i>ANGUS: And it's basically
this moment that</i>

915
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,149
<i>establishes what
a great bounty hunter he is.</i>

916
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,828
<i>BILL: And I just have to say,
it's an American flag.</i>

917
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,287
<i>- LINDSEY: Yes.
- We had a big argument about that.</i>

918
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,705
<i>- We did.
- DEREK: How close to the ship...</i>

919
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,998
<i>"LINDSEY: And I believe
Bill said, "Look,</i>

DEREK: So I don't know if the sun</i>

923
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,907
<i>- would melt that ship.
- LINDSEY: Oh, yeah, "The End."</i>

924
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,784
<i>ANGUS: Yeah, "The End."
There's plenty...</i>

925
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,870
<i>There's about fifteen "The End"</i>

<i>BILL: But, wait, is that Saturn?</i>

929
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,086
<i>Because Saturn's not blue.
It's not blue.</i>

930
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,481

But the reason to go by the sun</i>

931
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,801
<i>originally was a reference to the</i>
Star Trek <i>slingshot around the sun</i>

<i>ANGUS: Wait, wait, wait.

00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,623
<i>ANGUS: Back up, back up. Okay, Bill,
what were you going to say?</i>

940
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,818
<i>They're going faster than light, clearly.
They're passing galaxies,</i>

941
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:15,238
<i>- passing other worlds...
- ANGUS: I buy that.</i>

942
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,633
<i>BILL: But it just looks like
they're cruising. There's no...</i>

<i>- ANGUS: I know.
- I mean, later in the movie...</i>

944
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,995
<i>ANGUS: If they're going that slowly...
DEREK: It's scenic light speed, okay?</i>

945
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,891
<i>ANGUS: It's like in Doctor Who...
BILL: So they're not going full throttle.</i>

946
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,834
<i>ANGUS: No, like in Doctor Who,
when they're drifting, in the new one.</i>

<i>BILL: I'm just asking!</i>

952
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,073
<i>ANGUS: I'm saying, if it's a reference,
then they need to be going faster</i>

953
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:44,934
<i>and they should be in a Bird of Prey
or something.</i>

954
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,686
<i>DEREK: Well, let me rephrase.
It was intended as a reference,</i>

955
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,356
<i>and then it was dismantled
when the sequence was...</i>

what that's a reference to.</i>

<i>MEN: What?</i>

958
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,879
<i>It's the</i> Millennium Falcon <i>being

This I don't understand. Wait, wait.</i>

<i>Now, all of a sudden, there,</i>

00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,690
<i>- I feel like there's a second shield.
- LINDSEY: Not when the door's shut.</i>

968
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:17,609
<i>DEREK: No, there's a shield.
BILL: No, they turn off their...</i>

969
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,444
<i>ANGUS: I always thought
there should be a shielding in there</i>

970
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,844
<i>like in</i> Star Trek.

971
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,555
<i>DEREK: But don't you see a beam?
Isn't there some energy there?</i>

972
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,932
<i>ANGUS:</i> First Contact? <i>You know,</i>

973
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,725
First Contact,
<i>when they have the energy...</i>

974
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,270
<i>There's a great scene with
Alfre Woodard and Patrick Stewart,</i>

975
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,415
<i>and she comes on the bridge and
he's trying to prove they're on</i>

976
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,167
<i>a starship 'cause she doesn't realize
they're on a starship</i>

977
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,511
<i>because she wakes up in sick bay.</i>

978
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:38,821
<i>Anyway, he shows the... He
turns off the... He says that there's like</i>

979
00:36:38,904 --> 00:36:40,757
<i>a force field, that there's no glass
or anything.</i>

980
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,700
<i>I always thought it was like that.</i>

981
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,910
<i>DEREK: Wow.
I forgot all those scenes.</i>

982
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,305
<i>BILL: I thought you were talking about
whether or not gravity was on.</i>

983
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,409
<i>ANGUS: I'm saying there's gravity
inside the starship</i>

984
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:53,251
<i>- as soon as they cross that thing.
- BILL: But we've already established</i>

985
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,838
<i>that in this universe that things can be
floated magnetically or however.</i>

986
00:36:56,921 --> 00:37:00,675
<i>I mean EVE is a floater. Chill out.</i>

987
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:01,968
<i>ANGUS: Okay.</i>

988
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:05,847
<i>DEREK: So we're going to meet
a lot of characters here really fast.</i>

989
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:11,519
<i>That's M-O, and he is the third robot
with a POV in this movie.</i>

990
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:12,830
<i>There's the Predator reference.</i>

991
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:14,248
<i>LINDSEY: Look at that.
That's perfectly cued.</i>

992
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:15,606
<i>Yeah, I didn't even plan that.</i>

993
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,608
<i>BILL: I think it'd be
more like 98% cued.</i>

994
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:20,695
<i>DEREK: Actually, you know, there's
four POVs in this, four robot POVs.</i>

995
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:21,863
<i>LINDSEY: We have Auto.</i>

996
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:23,382
<i>DEREK: Because we have
Auto coming up, so...</i>

997
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:27,118
<i>Each one had to be distinctive
so you don't get disoriented.</i>

998
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:28,745
<i>ALL: Oh, "Scrutah Mah Boot."</i>

999
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:29,888
<i>BILL: I miss "Scrutah Mah Boot."</i>

1000
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:31,849
<i>DEREK: Why don't you talk
about "Scrutah Mah Boot," Angus?</i>

1001
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:34,667
<i>"Scrutah Mah Boot" was
a line of dialogue</i>

1002
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:38,713
<i>that was uttered by an earlier version
of a human character...</i>

1003
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:40,232
<i>BILL: Back when
they didn't speak English.</i>

1004
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:41,358
<i>DEREK: Back when they were Gels.</i>

1005
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:43,468
<i>ANGUS: And they had this kind of like</i>

1006
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:45,469
<i>new language,
a kind of hybrid language.</i>

1007
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:47,471
<i>DEREK: Kind of like Huttese, but...</i>

1008
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:49,139
<i>ANGUS: Yeah,
it was similar to Huttese,</i>

1009
00:37:49,222 --> 00:37:50,807
<i>but basically it was similar to English</i>

1010
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:55,520
<i>in that "Scrutah Mah Boot"
was meant to say, "Scrub my butt."</i>

1011
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:59,441
<i>And they were this jelly-like substance
that would get a lot of dust,</i>

1012
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:02,277
<i>and so there was a M-O character
where this human character woke up</i>

1013
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,029
<i>"and was like," Scrutah Mah Boot!</i>

1014
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:06,573
<i>"Scrutah Mah Boot!
Scrutah Mah Boot!"</i>

1015
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:09,659
<i>- DEREK: And that became the mantra.
- That became this tag line...</i>

1016
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:10,845
<i>LINDSEY: Yeah, we all have T-shirts.</i>

1017
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:12,972
<i>BILL: Yeah, and that was
during the whole robot uprising.</i>

1018
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:14,790
<i>DEREK: Yeah. That was more of a...
ALL: Yes.</i>

1019
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:19,086
Spartacus <i>structure, WALL-E
liberating the slave robots...</i>

1020
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:20,170
<i>LINDSEY: The Viking gels.</i>

1021
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:21,773
<i>DEREK: Humans were gels, more...
LINDSEY: Green gels.</i>

1022
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:23,340
<i>Like an alien civilization.</i>

1023
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:26,234
<i>And midway through, it became clear
that this needed to be about people.</i>

1024
00:38:26,258 --> 00:38:28,111
<i>BILL: They were always supposed to
be humans, right?</i>

1025
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:30,363
<i>- They had just devolved...
- DEREK: No. They were pure aliens.</i>

1026
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:31,547
<i>- Really?
- For a while, yeah.</i>

1027
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:32,741
<i>ANGUS: Originally they were aliens.</i>

1028
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:34,242
<i>BILL: I thought
they were devolved humans.</i>

1029
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:35,410
<i>ANGUS: No, originally
they were aliens,</i>

1030
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:37,037
<i>then it was kind of
a</i> Planet of the Apesy <i>thing</i>

1031
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,455
<i>where it's like,
"Oh, my gosh, they're humans!"</i>

1032
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:39,956
<i>- DEREK: "They are us!" Yeah.
- Then we realized,</i>

1033
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,167
<i>"That's nowhere to go." You know,
there's</i> Planet of the Apes,

1034
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:44,628
<i>and there's the sequel,</i> Beneath the...
Beyond the... Below the...

1035
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:46,546
<i>DEREK: "Beneath. '</i>' Beneath
the Planet of the Apes."

1036
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,590
<i>ANGUS: With the bomb, right?
That's the one with the bomb?</i>

1037
00:38:48,614 --> 00:38:51,218
<i>DEREK: Yeah, yeah, with the guys
that rip off their faces. That one</i>

1038
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:53,011
<i>- comes up in conversation a lot.
- ANGUS: I don't know.</i>

1039
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:54,203
<i>DEREK: We actually did...</i>

1040
00:38:54,286 --> 00:38:55,764
<i>LINDSEY: In whose conversations
does that come up?</i>

1041
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:58,725
<i>BILL: I gotta tell you the truth. I quit
after... I've only seen the first two.</i>

1042
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:01,877
<i>DEREK: Yeah, probably... There's
some interesting, weird stuff later on,</i>

1043
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:03,814
<i>- but, yeah, you're fine.
- BILL: When the apes go to Earth,</i>

1044
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,005
<i>I know that happened,</i>

1045
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:07,109
<i>- but I didn't watch it.
- DEREK: It kind of goes off the rails,</i>

1046
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:09,820
<i>and the TV show. They kept lowering
the budget with each successive film</i>

1047
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:11,279
<i>- and then it was just worse.
- BILL: Sure.</i>

1048
00:39:11,303 --> 00:39:12,656
<i>DEREK: Angus, have you seen
Planet of the Apes yet?</i>

1049
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,681
<i>LINDSEY: As you do, yes.</i>

1050
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:16,684
<i>- I have seen</i> Planet of the Apes.
<i>- Okay. Good.</i>

1051
00:39:17,518 --> 00:39:20,563
<i>Wow. That was a major tangent.</i>

1052
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:23,190
<i>BILL: You know, tangents are
what this whole process is about.</i>

1053
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:25,442
<i>DEREK: You're actually
absolutely correct. That's true.</i>

1054
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:27,903
<i>But then you've got to learn
how to wrangle the tangents.</i>

1055
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,321
EVE!

1056
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:32,926
<i>LINDSEY: Here's humanity. Here it is.</i>

1057

<i>DEREK: If you would've helped me...</i>

1058
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:36,453
<i>Here it is. Is that John?
Is that Ratzenberger?</i>

1059
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:38,747
<i>BILL: No, that's not John.
LINDSEY: No, that's not John.</i>

1060
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:43,502
<i>DEREK: Well, one of the things that
you're gonna see entering this utopian</i>

1061
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:46,922
<i>atmosphere is that
it's actually dystopian.</i>

1062
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,859
<i>This is that dichotomy
we were talking about earlier.</i>

1063
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:50,318
<i>BILL: Okay. Now, look,
you're preaching, all right?</i>

1064
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:51,343
<i>LINDSEY: It's the irony.</i>

1065
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:56,182
<i>BILL: This is the thing. I don't think
it's our role to sit here and explicate</i>

1066
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:58,075
<i>- what we intended for him to be.
- DEREK: Well, you know,</i>

1067
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,779
<i>it's some of the thinking
that went into...</i>

1068
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,328
<i>ANGUS: Yeah,
it sounds like art school credit.</i>

1069
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:04,147
<i>What I really wanted to do is
talk about...</i>

1070
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,025
<i>BILL: Look. It's bright, it's colorful.
They tell you what to do.</i>

1071
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,794
<i>ANGUS: Yeah, okay.
What I was gonna say is...</i>

1072
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:09,879
<i>BILL: What's the movie?</i> Them?

1073
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:11,338
<i>DEREK: Well, no.
Actually, the big idea was...</i>

1074
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:15,617
<i>I mean,</i> Brave New World, <i>Aldous
Huxley kind of stuff was the intention,</i>

00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,784
<i>at least for a long time.</i>

1076

<i>LINDSEY: Well, that
and cruise ships in Vegas.</i>

<i>DEREK: Cruise ships in Vegas?</i>

1078
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:22,558
<i>ANGUS: I didn't know we had to
read books for this kind of thing.</i>

00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:24,422
<i>DEREK: Yeah, they are books.
We watch, we read.</i>

<i>DEREK: It is a Vegas cruise ship.</i>

1082
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:33,343
<i>I actually went on a wedding cruise
during this movie</i>

Observations...</i>

1084

<i>- LINDSEY: Wait, was it your wedding?
- No, no, no, it wasn't my wedding.</i>

1091

But I was able to get some interesting</i>

<i>lessons in how surreal a cruise ship is
to actually be on, and it's...</i>

<i>BILL: Is it like this,
with robots and stuff?</i>

<i>BILL: Yeah,
we kept calling them "gels."</i>

- ANGUS: If you hear us call them gels,</i>

1106
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:27,999

- Humans.</i>

1107
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:30,275
<i>DEREK: Yes, gelatinous humans.</i>

1108

<i>BILL: And for you
Pixar fan people out there,</i>

1114

<i>Lori did the scratch voice
for Mrs. Incredible.</i>

1115

00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,259
<i>DEREK: She's awesome.</i>

- "Blue is the new red"?</i>

- LINDSEY: There always is.</i>

Oh, and there's the lido deck.</i>

each other on the Couch.</i>

<i>All right. I'm sorry, Derek.
I love you.</i>

to the pool before?</i>

<i>I mean, the ship isn't that big.</i>

1143

on the keyboard?</i>

- Yeah, you can tell it's my favorite.</i>

You mean the typing-bot?</i>

DEREK: Yeah.</i>

- No, there's a difference.</i>

This is the Autopilot.</i>

Pixar movie by now probably knows.</i>

1170
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:59,022
<i>- LINDSEY: CalArts classroom A-113.

1191

the captain wears his captain coat</i>

<i>as a cape,</i>

Earth, the surface of the world

<i>BILL: I'm starting to see

We're going into the repair ward,</i>

BILL: Restraining bolts.</i>

<i>DEREK: Yeah, okay.
Why don't you say it in Huttese?</i>

<i>BILL: I don't know it in Huttese.</i>

1405
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:50,820
<i>ANGUS: Because
it isn't said in Huttese, right?</i>

if you know the language,</i>

you could probably translate it.</i>

1408

Little copper-colored...</i>

<i>LINDSEY: I've been disappointed by
both of you at least ten times in this.</i>

LINDSEY: Well, like PR-T.</i>

aren't there lens flares</i>

LINDSEY: Sure!</i>

moving buttons,</i>

<i>- graphics...

1456
00:54:56,153 --> 00:54:59,490

because it's insanely boring.</i>

1473
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:38,026
<i>No, it's just, you know, making sure
that when lights go on, they go on</i>

they're turned off, they're off.</i>

1510
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:54,829
<i>Yes, of course I've seen a sci-fi movie.</i>

1511
00:56:54,853 --> 00:56:58,982
<i>- The</i> Star Wars, <i>the</i> Star Trek?
<i>- I've seen</i> Star Wars. <i>Yeah.</i>

1512
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:00,567
<i>I've never seen</i> Star Trek.

1513
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,861
<i>DEREK: You sat in when
we did some screenings, right?</i>

1514
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:04,755
<i>ANGUS: At least you say "Trek."
I used to get so mad</i>

1515
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:06,757
<i>- when people say "Star Track."
- DEREK: Say "Star Track"? Yeah.</i>

1516
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:08,009
<i>LINDSEY: "Track"? Okay...
BILL: Oh, man.</i>

1517
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,869
<i>In elementary school,
those were fighting words.</i>

1518
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:13,788
<i>ANGUS: Also not calling them
"life savers"</i>

1519
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:15,165
<i>was a difficult thing for kids.</i>

1520
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:16,249
<i>DEREK: Lightsabers?</i>

1521
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,351
<i>ANGUS: Yeah, people call them
"life savers."</i>

1522
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,477
<i>We're like, "No, it's a lightsaber."</i>

1523
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,462
<i>- Not "laser swords"?
- No.</i>

1524
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,691
<i>DEREK: That's what they're called
in the original drafts.</i>

1525
00:57:23,715 --> 00:57:27,969
<i>- BILL: Laser sword.
- It's no joke. Ask Ben.</i>

1526
00:57:28,053 --> 00:57:29,638
<i>LINDSEY: I believe you.</i>

1527
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:30,721
Plant!

1528
00:57:30,764 --> 00:57:33,141
<i>DEREK: I think George still calls them
laser swords.</i>

1529
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:34,994
<i>LINDSEY: Is it in the grail?
What's it called?</i>

1530
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,269
<i>DEREK: What?</i>

1531
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:37,604
<i>- The canon?
- The canon.</i>

1532
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,813
<i>BILL: "The grail"!</i>

1533
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:41,167
<i>- ANGUS: No, it's not in the canon.
- It's not in the canon?</i>

1534
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:42,210
<i>DEREK: Watch, just you wait.</i>

1535
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:44,611
<i>WALL-E's gonna have canon
pretty soon, you know.</i>

1536
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,047
<i>- When you get in this...
- LINDSEY: That's implying</i>

1537
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:48,156
<i>that there's extra stuff
that gets written about it.</i>

1538
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,492
<i>I know, but look at this.
BURN-E is canon.</i>

1539
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:52,535
<i>- BILL: Totally.
- BURN-E is totally an example</i>

1540
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,096
<i>of canon.
And for those of you listening</i>

1541
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,249
<i>who haven't met BURN-E yet, he's
a little robot who does a cameo later.</i>

1542
00:57:57,415 --> 00:58:00,543
<i>And Angus is doing a short,
expanding his world.</i>

1543
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:03,255
<i>BILL: I totally like
the Jetson ring effect.</i>

1544
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:04,673
<i>ANGUS: Yeah, that's really nice.</i>

1545
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:06,108
<i>DEREK: The Jetson ring effect?
LINDSEY: You do?</i>

1546
00:58:06,132 --> 00:58:07,259
<i>BILL: Yeah, when she flies.</i>

1547
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:09,612
<i>LINDSEY: Because that was like
actually kind of a bone of contention.</i>

1548
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:13,014
<i>BILL: I know. I'm sure, but I...
DEREK: We're getting into a territory</i>

1549
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:16,142
<i>where there was a lot of debate
and discussion about</i>

1550
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:22,399
<i>the scientific plausibility of A,
a fire extinguisher in space,</i>

1551
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:25,526
<i>B, the concentric EVE rings,
and then C...</i>

1552
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:26,753
<i>LINDSEY: The survival of the plant
in space.</i>

1553
00:58:26,777 --> 00:58:27,963
<i>BILL: What are you talking about?</i>

1554
00:58:27,987 --> 00:58:30,197
<i>DEREK: Oh, the survival of the plant
and the sound.</i>

1555
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:32,866
<i>- Oh, okay, you mean... Okay, wait.
- DEREK: So scientists...</i>

1556
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,159
<i>There was a big call-out.</i>

1557
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:37,705
<i>What would a fire extinguisher do
if you pressed the button in space?</i>

1558
00:58:37,788 --> 00:58:41,792
<i>And some camps said that nothing
would happen because there was no...</i>

1559
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,270
<i>- LINDSEY: Pressure?
- Pressure, atmosphere,</i>

1560
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:46,547
<i>but others said that the pressure was
contained in the extinguisher...</i>

1561
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,400
<i>BILL: Yeah, it was pressurized.
DEREK: It's pressurized,</i>

1562
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,009
<i>so that once you pressed the button,</i>

1563
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:53,971
<i>you would have
the crystallizing stuff, but...</i>

1564
00:58:54,138 --> 00:58:57,141
<i>ANGUS: So to solve the argument,
we went to space,</i>

1565
00:58:57,224 --> 00:58:58,368
<i>which really blew the budget.</i>

1566
00:58:58,392 --> 00:59:01,645
<i>DEREK: No, I think they went to
Messages and put a call out.</i>

1567
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:03,439
<i>ANGUS: Messages is
the Pixar message board.</i>

1568
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:04,791
<i>LINDSEY: They went to
Loren Carpenter.</i>

1569
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:06,334
<i>DEREK: Yeah,
and you can always depend on</i>

1570
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:08,110
<i>someone to drop the real science.</i>

1571
00:59:08,193 --> 00:59:11,363
<i>And this is an example of real science
meeting science fantasy.</i>

1572
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,157
<i>ANGUS: Did you just say
drop science?</i>

1573
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,135
<i>LINDSEY: Drop the real science.
ANGUS: Drop the real science.</i>

1574
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,594
<i>DEREK: Yeah, yeah.
BILL: Like drop the hammer.</i>

1575
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:21,749
<i>DEREK: Or like drop the beat.
Drop the needle. I don't know.</i>

1576
00:59:21,832 --> 00:59:24,585
<i>BILL: Drop the needle on the record.
ANGUS: DJ Thompson.</i>

1577
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:26,253
<i>LINDSEY: Oh, no.
DEREK: Good Lord.</i>

1578
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:27,963
<i>[ANGUS GROANS]</i>

1579
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,591
<i>- What?
- ANGUS: It stopped.</i>

1580
00:59:30,674 --> 00:59:31,967
<i>DEREK: Oh, okay.</i>

1581
00:59:35,095 --> 00:59:40,309
<i>DEREK: Should we go back just to
get on that drop the needle tip?</i>

1582
00:59:40,392 --> 00:59:41,661
<i>BILL: Let it roll.
DEREK: It's fine to roll on.</i>

1583
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,395
<i>- You can roll that.
- LINDSEY: We're good.</i>

1584
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:50,944
<i>Sound in space, though, is an
often debated hot spot for sci-fi fans.</i>

1585
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,864
<i>And</i> 2001 <i>is the only
movie that really did it.</i>

1586
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:55,625
<i>- ANGUS: It's canon.
- That did it right...</i>

1587
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:56,698
<i>ANGUS: It's true.</i>

1588
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:57,842
<i>DEREK: and as much as
we love hearing</i>

1589
00:59:57,866 --> 01:00:01,161
<i>the sounds of the spaceships
and lasers in</i> Star Wars <i>and others.</i>

1590
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,804
<i>ANGUS: Oh, but it's the same thing
in a spy movie of having a spy</i>

1591
01:00:03,872 --> 01:00:05,266
<i>- that's drawing attention to himself.
- Right.</i>

1592
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,727
<i>- It's part of the genre conventions.
- DEREK: Or on martial arts films,</i>

1593
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:09,961
<i>you hear a lot more sound
than you would actually hear</i>

1594
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:11,397
<i>if two people were using kung fu to...</i>

1595
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:13,316
<i>ANGUS: That's true. And they don't
always flex their muscles.</i>

1596
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,633
<i>So you have a point.</i>

1597
01:00:14,716 --> 01:00:17,636
<i>DEREK: Sounds are exaggerated
for cinematic effect.</i>

1598
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,822
<i>LINDSEY: Well, it's also become part
of the lexicon for everybody,</i>

1599
01:00:19,846 --> 01:00:22,533
<i>- so it's what they're used to seeing.
- DEREK: Right, right, right, right.</i>

1600
01:00:22,557 --> 01:00:24,494
<i>- It would seem abnormal.
- And for WALL-E, even though there's,</i>

1601
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:25,995
<i>you know, I think a good deal
of hard science...</i>

1602
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:29,231
<i>- Do you know what lexicon means?
- Lexicons? Yeah, I...</i>

1603
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,047
<i>I think it's a little strange that WALL-E
can go so fast with the propulsion</i>

1604
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:37,155
<i>of the fire extinguisher.</i>

1605
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:38,508
<i>ANGUS: And how many
fire extinguishers have you...</i>

1606
01:00:38,532 --> 01:00:40,051
<i>DEREK: I mean,
how fast is he going there?</i>

1607
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:41,886
<i>ANGUS: Do you know how much juice
is in a fire extinguisher?</i>

1608
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,055
<i>DEREK: He's going as fast as that
Bug's Life camera in that shot.</i>

1609
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,140
<i>- He must be going...
- BILL: But there's no friction in space.</i>

1610
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:47,350
<i>- ANGUS: Bug's Life camera?
- There's no friction.</i>

1611
01:00:47,374 --> 01:00:49,000
<i>DEREK: Right. But EVE goes fast.</i>

1612
01:00:49,084 --> 01:00:51,920
<i>BILL: She's matching speed with him.</i>

1613
01:00:52,003 --> 01:00:53,564
<i>DEREK: So are you saying
that he's accumulating speed?</i>

1614
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:56,025
<i>ANGUS: She could go way faster.
He's the pace car in this scenario.</i>

1615
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:58,236
<i>BILL: He's accelerating, yeah.
DEREK: Is his speed accumulating</i>

1616
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,278
<i>- or accelerating?
- BILL: He's accelerating.</i>

1617
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:00,363
<i>ANGUS: He's the pace car
in this scenario.</i>

1618
01:01:00,387 --> 01:01:01,531
<i>DEREK: It's always kind of struck me</i>

1619
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:03,116
<i>as a little strange that
he could go that fast.</i>

1620
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,061
<i>BILL: If he did a squirt,
then he would go</i>

1621
01:01:08,145 --> 01:01:10,188
<i>at a constant motion,
but he's doing a constant...</i>

1622
01:01:10,272 --> 01:01:11,416
<i>ANGUS: Let me blow your mind.</i>

1623
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,750
<i>What if he hadn't
gotten out of the pod?</i>

1624
01:01:12,774 --> 01:01:14,043
<i>DEREK: All right.
BILL: Okay. Okay?</i>

1625
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:15,420
<i>It's constant motion
and accelerated motion.</i>

1626
01:01:15,444 --> 01:01:16,671
<i>DEREK: He would have exploded.
No movie.</i>

1627
01:01:16,695 --> 01:01:18,131
<i>BILL: Okay?
DEREK: And it's a very poetic scene</i>

1628
01:01:18,155 --> 01:01:21,450
<i>and I understand the creative decision
behind it, but...</i>

1629
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:22,760
<i>ANGUS: Don't bring poetry
back into it.</i>

1630
01:01:22,784 --> 01:01:23,869
<i>DEREK: Scientifically...</i>

1631
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:25,680
<i>No, it's a poetic moment.
They have a dance together.</i>

1632
01:01:25,704 --> 01:01:27,872
<i>It's a chance for WALL-E
and EVE to have a little bit</i>

1633
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,206
<i>of that love stuff.</i>

1634
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,392
<i>ANGUS: And the poetry
and then pizza,</i>

1635
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,060
<i>- and that's the movie, right?
- Poetry and pizza.</i>

1636
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:33,878
<i>- The contrast.
- WALL-E in a nutshell.</i>

1637
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:34,962
<i>Yeah.</i>

1638
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,215
<i>ANGUS: See, what's funny is he thinks</i>

1639
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:40,050
<i>you can grow pizza,
which is kind of true.</i>

1640
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:42,970
<i>DEREK: And it pays out later.
BILL: 'Cause they grow pizza?</i>

1641
01:01:43,053 --> 01:01:45,514
<i>DEREK: No.
ANGUS: He still thinks it later.</i>

1642
01:01:45,598 --> 01:01:47,808
<i>- It's kind of a charming...
- He can't let go.</i>

1643
01:01:47,892 --> 01:01:50,019
<i>- He can't let go.
- Of the dream.</i>

1644
01:01:50,102 --> 01:01:54,273
<i>- Okay. What's coming up here?
- Yeah, okay. So, this is the...</i>

1645
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:57,860
<i>Coming up very shortly

<i>and one of them watched daytime TV.</i>

1920
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:32,129
<i>- Remember that?
- DEREK: What?</i>

1921
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:33,589
<i>I'm serious,
there was one that was watching...</i>

1922
01:12:33,613 --> 01:12:36,199
<i>DEREK: Oh, was that when there was
the taskmaster guy down there?</i>

1923
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:37,635
<i>ANGUS: Yeah,
a guy watching daytime TV,</i>

1924
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:39,035
<i>and he was watching his soaps</i>

1925
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:40,203
<i>and just doing his job.</i>

1926
01:12:40,286 --> 01:12:41,472
<i>DEREK: Wow,
this movie's come so far.</i>

1927
01:12:41,496 --> 01:12:42,723
<i>BILL: Wow, I'd never remember that.</i>

1928
01:12:42,747 --> 01:12:44,016
<i>ANGUS: And everything else
I've said...</i>

1929
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,435
<i>DEREK: But the whole system with
the flattens and the cubes...</i>

1930
01:12:46,459 --> 01:12:49,212
<i>BILL: But there was the nice moment
when they recognized WALL-E</i>

1931
01:12:49,295 --> 01:12:51,381
<i>as a brethren machine.</i>

1932
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:54,384
<i>DEREK: That's still there.
That's still there, I think, in the sound.</i>

1933
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:56,237
<i>ANGUS: Oh, it's not there anymore.
DEREK: Is it not there?</i>

1934
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:58,781
<i>BILL: No. They petted him, remember?
DEREK: That's not in there anymore?</i>

1935
01:12:58,805 --> 01:12:59,990
<i>BILL: No, there's no time now.</i>

1936
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:01,117
<i>ANGUS: I don't think
it's there anymore.</i>

1937
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,743
<i>DEREK: That's too bad.
BILL: It's not there anymore.</i>

1938
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:05,854
<i>ANGUS: I forgot, we actually animated
that. We used to show them...</i>

1939
01:13:06,688 --> 01:13:10,066
<i>BILL: Well, that's because
it used to be EVE that got zapped,</i>

1940
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:12,235
<i>and her whole heart mechanism
got ripped up</i>

1941
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:14,278
<i>because we built all that
and shaded it.</i>

1942
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:16,864
<i>ANGUS: That's true,
that's the secret to our films.</i>

1943
01:13:16,947 --> 01:13:18,299
<i>We always change it, and rework it.</i>

1944
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:19,783
<i>DEREK: Keep reworking it.</i>

1945
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:21,594
<i>ANGUS: Make it twice,
get it right the second time.</i>

1946
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:24,496
<i>BILL: And it was WALL-E that
was doing the surgery on her.</i>

1947
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,974
<i>ANGUS: And if you watch the trailer,</i>

1948
01:13:25,998 --> 01:13:27,749
<i>you'll see
a different version of this shot,</i>

1949
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,169
<i>- which is not in the movie.
- DEREK: Yeah.</i>

1950
01:13:32,004 --> 01:13:34,131
<i>BILL: I kind of like that scene
where he was doing</i>

1951
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:36,574
<i>- the surgery on her.
- DEREK: There was tons of great stuff</i>

1952
01:13:37,009 --> 01:13:38,820
<i>that didn't make the final cut,
but that's just the thing, you know.</i>

1953
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:41,847
<i>You have to... It's hard.</i>

1954
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:43,932
<i>ANGUS: If it doesn't work,
even if it's pretty,</i>

1955
01:13:44,016 --> 01:13:45,641
<i>shouldn't be in the movie.</i>

1956
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:48,102
<i>DEREK: Right. But know, as you listen</i>

1957
01:13:48,186 --> 01:13:50,563
<i>to this, there's tons of great material
you're not seeing.</i>

1958
01:13:50,646 --> 01:13:53,191
<i>"ANGUS:" Know as you listen to this,</i>

1959
01:13:53,274 --> 01:13:55,252
<i>"there is tons of great material..."
Listen to you.</i>

1960
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:58,863
<i>That's awesome. You sound like
the narrator. You should narrate.</i>

1961
01:13:58,946 --> 01:14:00,986
<i>I'd love to have a Derek Thompson
narration of this.</i>

1962
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:03,784
<i>BILL: "Even now, as you watch this..."</i>

1963
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:06,287
<i>ANGUS: Here's the scene
where she's holding a chip.</i>

1964
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:09,290
<i>- "...in an alternate universe..."
- ANGUS: She's looking for something.</i>

1965
01:14:09,373 --> 01:14:10,809
<i>BILL: Yeah, but according
to quantum mechanics...</i>

1966
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:11,894
<i>DEREK: Do I really sound like that?</i>

1967
01:14:11,918 --> 01:14:13,020
<i>ANGUS: Yes,
that's what you sound like.</i>

1968
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:14,855
<i>- It's great. I love it.
- Is that what I sound like?</i>

1969
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:16,857
<i>BILL: But according to quantum
mechanics, every version of the movie</i>

1970
01:14:16,881 --> 01:14:18,549
<i>that could have been made,
did get made.</i>

1971
01:14:18,633 --> 01:14:20,635
<i>ANGUS: Does exist.
DEREK: Did get made.</i>

1972
01:14:20,718 --> 01:14:22,136
<i>BILL: So, in another universe,</i>

1973
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:23,655
<i>we're sitting on a couch,
talking about the scene</i>

1974
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,015
<i>that we left out
where WALL-E was the one...</i>

1975
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:27,159
<i>DEREK: I think in this universe...</i>

1976
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:28,368
<i>ANGUS: Yes.
And that audio commentary is</i>

1977
01:14:28,392 --> 01:14:29,870
<i>twice as entertaining
as this one, therefore...</i>

1978
01:14:29,894 --> 01:14:33,981
<i>BILL: In that universe, we get to wear
those sashes with the little knives.</i>

1979
01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:36,501
<i>- ANGUS: And we've all got goatees.
- And we've all got goatees.</i>

1980
01:14:36,525 --> 01:14:37,725
<i>- Like your brother.
- Totally.</i>

1981
01:14:37,777 --> 01:14:38,921
<i>- Your twin brother.
- That's right.</i>

1982
01:14:38,945 --> 01:14:39,987
<i>There you go.</i>

1983
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:41,340
<i>DEREK: What's that episode?
"Mirror, Mirror"?</i>

1984
01:14:41,364 --> 01:14:43,050
<i>- BILL: "Mirror, Mirror."
- That's a good one.</i>

1985
01:14:43,074 --> 01:14:44,676
<i>ANGUS: That's when I knew
I was really a Star Trek fan.</i>

1986
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,802
<i>BILL: When you knew
the name of the...</i>

1987
01:14:45,826 --> 01:14:46,929
<i>DEREK: Do you know,
I think Kirk fights</i>

1988
01:14:46,953 --> 01:14:48,388
<i>himself at least three times
in the first season.</i>

1989
01:14:48,412 --> 01:14:49,681
<i>I think there's three different episodes</i>

1990
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:51,391
<i>- where there's two Kirks.
- LINDSEY: How do you know that?</i>

1991
01:14:51,415 --> 01:14:53,560
<i>And he's either fighting himself
or interacting with himself.</i>

1992
01:14:53,584 --> 01:14:55,103
<i>BILL: I thought you said
we weren't going to talk about Kirk.</i>

1993
01:14:55,127 --> 01:14:56,128
<i>DEREK: I can't resist.</i>

1994
01:14:56,212 --> 01:14:57,272
<i>ANGUS: He's the only
match for himself.</i>

1995
01:14:57,296 --> 01:14:59,775
<i>DEREK: When I hear these dialogues,
these people discussing and arguing</i>

1996
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:02,069
<i>over which captain is the best,
I can't believe it's even a debate.</i>

1997
01:15:02,093 --> 01:15:04,238
<i>BILL: Just in the first season?
ANGUS: We talked about Kirk again.</i>

1998
01:15:04,262 --> 01:15:05,948
<i>- I'm blaming you for that.
- BILL: It's fine. Let it roll.</i>

1999
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:07,265
<i>DEREK: Kirk's all right.</i>

2000
01:15:07,348 --> 01:15:09,684
<i>- ANGUS: Okay. Fine. Let it roll.
- Just let it roll.</i>

2001
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:11,852
<i>ANGUS: Let it ride.
BILL: That's how Angus rolls.</i>

2002
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:13,604
<i>DEREK: That's how we roll.</i>

2003
01:15:15,022 --> 01:15:19,192
<i>LINDSEY: That is a ridiculous amount
of knowledge on a ridiculous subject.</i>

2004
01:15:19,276 --> 01:15:21,676
<i>BILL: It's a ridiculous amount of
knowledge on every subject.</i>

2005
01:15:21,736 --> 01:15:23,780
<i>LINDSEY: That is true. That's true.</i>

2006
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:27,742
<i>ANGUS: Here, I have a lighter</i>

2007
01:15:27,826 --> 01:15:30,453
<i>I've been keeping in my chest
for the whole film.</i>

2008
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:33,290
<i>DEREK: That was a huge thing.</i>

2009
01:15:33,373 --> 01:15:35,625
<i>- It was a huge thing.
- ANGUS: That was a huge deal.</i>

2010
01:15:37,168 --> 01:15:39,879
<i>Do we buy that he's had that thing
in his chest the whole time?</i>

2011
01:15:39,963 --> 01:15:42,090
<i>DEREK: Absolutely. Why not?</i>

2012
01:15:42,173 --> 01:15:43,883
<i>You've established
that he's a collector.</i>

2013
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:46,070
<i>BILL: Well, I'm just saying...
It was supposed to be an indicator</i>

2014
01:15:46,094 --> 01:15:48,847
<i>- of his love, his time with her...
- DEREK: Exactly. Exactly.</i>

2015
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:52,350
<i>- Because she found it interesting.
- ANGUS: I have an argument</i>

2016
01:15:52,434 --> 01:15:56,396
<i>about that shot, the laser bolt.
Is this an explosive bolt that fires</i>

2017
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:58,231
<i>towards the hole and then explodes?</i>

2018
01:15:58,315 --> 01:16:01,192
<i>DEREK: Well, there's a little bit
of an inconsistency</i>

2019
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:02,444
<i>with her bolts and blast.</i>

2020
01:16:02,527 --> 01:16:04,088
<i>- BILL: It's like a blaster.
- I think that she's...</i>

2021
01:16:04,112 --> 01:16:06,007
<i>- You see a bolt from a blaster.
- Sophisticated enough</i>

2022
01:16:06,031 --> 01:16:09,200
<i>with machinery to adjust the power
of her blast</i>

2023
01:16:09,284 --> 01:16:10,344
<i>based on what she wants to...</i>

2024
01:16:10,368 --> 01:16:11,470
<i>ANGUS: Mid-flight?
LINDSEY: Yeah...</i>

2025
01:16:11,494 --> 01:16:12,805
<i>DEREK: Sure. There's a scene later</i>

2026
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:15,332
<i>where she shoots
the TV monitor, right?</i>

2027
01:16:15,415 --> 01:16:17,959
<i>- ANGUS: Yeah, but...
- If she's shooting with that power</i>

2028
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:19,085
<i>in an elevator...</i>

2029
01:16:19,169 --> 01:16:20,604
<i>ANGUS: I'm not
debating the power, Derek.</i>

2030
01:16:20,628 --> 01:16:25,300
<i>All I'm saying is, when the bullet
leaves the gun, that at some point</i>

2031
01:16:25,383 --> 01:16:27,844
<i>from being a projectile,
it then becomes an explosive force.</i>

2032
01:16:27,927 --> 01:16:30,555
<i>- DEREK: Right.
- Without an impact. I think it would</i>

2033
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:32,408
<i>have to hit the side of that thing
and then explode.</i>

2034
01:16:32,432 --> 01:16:35,769
<i>DEREK: I mean, almost all good
shooting video games from the '80s</i>

2035
01:16:35,852 --> 01:16:38,104
<i>would have power-ups
for laser bolts and bullets.</i>

2036
01:16:38,188 --> 01:16:39,749
<i>ANGUS: So you're saying
she got a power-up</i>

2037
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:42,209
<i>- right in the middle of the shot?
- DEREK: Well, she's spirited.</i>

2038
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:44,337
<i>ANGUS: Like she shoots the gun,
she gets right through</i>

2039
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:45,671
<i>a mushroom or something,
and then boom.</i>

2040
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,114
<i>DEREK: You know what?
Her power-up is her motivation</i>

2041
01:16:48,198 --> 01:16:51,116
<i>to get WALL-E to safety.
Look at that. Look at this thing.</i>

2042
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,969
<i>ANGUS: "Her power-up is to
get WALL-E to safety"?</i>

2043
01:16:52,993 --> 01:16:56,455
<i>DEREK: It's her emotional motivation.
It's a ticking clock.</i>

2044
01:16:56,538 --> 01:16:57,915
<i>She's got to save WALL-E.</i>

2045
01:16:57,998 --> 01:16:59,309
<i>ANGUS: You remind me of
that one episode</i>

2046
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:01,126
<i>of</i> Buck Rogers <i>when Jack Palance</i>

2047

01:17:02,336 --> 01:17:03,438
<i>DEREK: Don't ever say that
I remind you</i>

2049
01:17:03,462 --> 01:17:05,440
<i>of an episode of</i> Buck Rogers
<i>'cause that's pretty creepy, man.</i>

01:17:05,464 --> 01:17:06,691
<i>ANGUS: No,
Jack Palance plays a cult leader.</i>

<i>- but Wilma Deering.
- ANGUS: Was that Erin Gray?</i>

about Dr. Theophilis.</i>

2057
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:23,190
<i>BILL: Look, between Twiki

2058
01:17:25,651 --> 01:17:28,529
<i>DEREK: You know, I saw the real...
There was a chimpanzee in there.</i>

2059
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:29,714
<i>- Do you know that?
- ANGUS: Really?</i>

2060
01:17:29,738 --> 01:17:30,799
<i>Yeah. At the Sci-Fi Museum.</i>

2061
01:17:30,823 --> 01:17:32,967
<i>ANGUS: Oh, I thought it was actually
a robotic dog in real life.</i>

2062
01:17:32,991 --> 01:17:35,053
<i>Of course, it was a chimpanzee.
It looked like a chimpanzee</i>

2063
01:17:35,077 --> 01:17:36,721
<i>- in a robotic dog suit.
- DEREK: They could have gotten</i>

2064
01:17:36,745 --> 01:17:38,622
<i>a midget or something.
But at the Sci-Fi Museum</i>

2065
01:17:38,705 --> 01:17:41,040
<i>in Seattle, you can actually
see the Daggit suit,</i>

2066
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:43,376
<i>and they've got the</i> TV Guide <i>article
which has photos</i>

2067
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:45,962
<i>- of the chimp in the suit.
- BILL: Nice.</i>

2068
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:50,007
<i>ANGUS: Originally, when he put
the wires together,</i>

2069
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:51,652
<i>there was gonna be
a whole series of things</i>

2070
01:17:51,676 --> 01:17:53,445
<i>that happened.
He was going to try different wires.</i>

2071
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,155
<i>DEREK: Oh, right. So you were
going to see some of them...</i>

2072
01:17:55,179 --> 01:17:57,533
<i>ANGUS: And one of them, originally,
was the impetus for BURN-E,</i>

2073
01:17:57,557 --> 01:18:00,518
<i>where he was gonna try a wire
and that opened up the door</i>

2074
01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:02,079
<i>outside the ship,
and BURN-E could try and go in.</i>

2075
01:18:02,103 --> 01:18:03,748
<i>And then he decided,
"No, not that wire, the other one."</i>

2076
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:06,459
<i>- And then it shut right in his face.
- DEREK: She used her blaster again,</i>

2077
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:08,777
<i>but it didn't detonate the same way.</i>

2078
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:10,046
<i>ANGUS: I'm saying that
maybe she lost</i>

2079
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:12,465
<i>- the power-up 'cause she got killed.
- BILL: What are you talking about?</i>

2080
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:14,199
<i>There's no power-up.</i>

2081

he uses the...</i>

2082
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:23,416
<i>BILL: The holo-thing?
DEREK: The holo-stick?</i>

2083
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,085
That's right. The plant.

2084
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:28,313
<i>ANGUS: Apparently the autopilot's
depth perception is terrible.</i>

2085
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:31,048
<i>BILL: It's not good, yeah.
Well, he's looking at it through a...</i>

2086
01:18:31,132 --> 01:18:33,009
<i>It's a hologram.
It doesn't have any depth.</i>

2087
01:18:33,092 --> 01:18:35,279
<i>- ANGUS: A holo-what?
- It's a holo-screen. It's a flat-screen.</i>

2088
01:18:35,303 --> 01:18:37,489
<i>It doesn't have three dimensions.
Just 'cause it pops up in space,</i>

01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:38,848
<i>it doesn't appear to have any...</i>

2090
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:40,117
<i>ANGUS: You're right,
and he does have</i>

2091
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:43,561
<i>monocular vision. Therefore,
he would not have depth perception.</i>

2092
01:18:43,644 --> 01:18:47,899
<i>BILL: I mean, it's not like the hologram
of Princess Leia that R2 shows.</i>

2093
01:18:47,982 --> 01:18:51,235
<i>- I mean, that's, you know, complete.
- ANGUS: It's pretty 2-D.</i>

2094
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:53,529
<i>- No, it's in 3-D.
- And it's breaking up.</i>

2095
01:18:53,613 --> 01:18:55,132
<i>DEREK: I thought it was 2-D.
BILL: What about the game</i>

2096
01:18:55,156 --> 01:18:56,884
<i>that Chewbacca and R2 are playing?
Those were 3-D.</i>

2097
01:18:56,908 --> 01:18:58,343
<i>DEREK: Yeah, those are
three-dimensional holograms.</i>

2098
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:01,329
<i>- BILL: They're dimensional. That's flat.
- What's that called?</i>

2099
01:19:01,787 --> 01:19:03,748
<i>ANGUS: The game?
BILL: The actual holo-game?</i>

2100
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:04,933
<i>I don't think they give it a name.</i>

2101
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:06,810
<i>ANGUS: No, they have a name for it.
BILL: Well, of course.</i>

2102
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:08,437
<i>ANGUS: Dejarik. You don't know
the Dejarik chess set?</i>

2103
01:19:08,461 --> 01:19:10,213
<i>BILL: They made up
a name for everything.</i>

2104
01:19:10,296 --> 01:19:11,482
<i>ANGUS: Okay.
Well, it still has a name.</i>

2105
01:19:11,506 --> 01:19:14,175
<i>LINDSEY: Oh my, I can't believe that.
BILL: Not canon.</i>

2106
01:19:14,258 --> 01:19:16,052
<i>DEREK: Oh, that chess set
has to be canon.</i>

2107
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:18,113
<i>ANGUS: So if it's not mentioned
in this film, it's not canon?</i>

2108
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:19,781
<i>- And by "canon," you mean...
- BILL: If it's not given...</i>

2109
01:19:19,805 --> 01:19:23,684
<i>- of the universe we are to accept.
- They gave things names later.</i>

2110
01:19:23,768 --> 01:19:26,354
<i>It's like you don't hear the name
of most of those characters.</i>

2111
01:19:26,437 --> 01:19:28,773
<i>DEREK: Even</i> Star Wars <i>was named</i>
A New Hope <i>later.</i>

2112
01:19:28,856 --> 01:19:32,109
<i>ANGUS: They never say Ewok,
but we all know it's Ewok</i>

2113
01:19:32,193 --> 01:19:33,793
<i>because of the merchandising
at the time.</i>

2114
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:36,781
<i>- So is that not canon?
- BILL: That's a good question.</i>

2115
01:19:36,864 --> 01:19:38,509
<i>ANGUS: If it's created at the time,
although mentioned...</i>

2116
01:19:38,533 --> 01:19:41,094
<i>DEREK: They never said Bossk, even
though he was the first action figure.</i>

2117
01:19:41,118 --> 01:19:42,888
<i>BILL: It's a good question.
And with Star Wars, who knows,</i>

2118
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:45,915
<i>because they are constantly
re-editing and re-shifting the universe.</i>

2119
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:47,792
<i>DEREK: Yeah,
it's a very shaky foundation.</i>

2120
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:49,627
<i>BILL: Whereas in</i> Star Trek,

2121
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:52,588
<i>there's three-dimensional chess,
they call it three-dimensional chess,</i>

<i>they play it in front of you,
and you're done.</i>

2123
01:19:54,881 --> 01:19:56,108
<i>DEREK: It's not even
three-dimensional chess.</i>

2124
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:57,425
<i>ANGUS: And they even have rules.</i>

2125
01:19:57,509 --> 01:20:00,136
<i>Two of the animators
got a</i> Star Trek <i>chess set,</i>

2126
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,700
<i>learned the rules and were playing it</i>

2127
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:03,241
<i>the entire thing. I couldn't believe it.</i>

2128
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,284
<i>- DEREK: Wow. Is it a fun game?
- No, it's boring as hell,</i>

2129
01:20:05,308 --> 01:20:08,937
<i>but they were committed to playing it
and they learned it</i>

2130
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,438
<i>and they earned our respect.</i>

2131
01:20:10,522 --> 01:20:11,916
<i>DEREK: So that's not
a dimensional hologram.</i>

2132
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,360
<i>- That's a holo-screen on the...

2133
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,046
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- BILL: Yeah, it's just flat.</i>

2134
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,905
<i>ANGUS: A projection screen.</i>

2135
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,201
<i>So it's not HD. I don't think.</i>

2136
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:27,473
<i>DEREK: I mean, it's far enough
in the future where we have to be</i>

<i>getting somewhere...</i>

2138
01:20:28,582 --> 01:20:29,725

they went back to it.</i>

2139
01:20:29,749 --> 01:20:31,727
<i>- DEREK: sophisticated...
- Well, they don't have guardrails</i>

2140
01:20:31,751 --> 01:20:33,688
<i>or anything. They don't have
any safety precautions.</i>

2141
01:20:33,712 --> 01:20:34,730
<i>Maybe they went back to...</i>

2142
01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:36,065
<i>DEREK: They didn't plan
on anything going wrong.</i>

2143
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:37,858
<i>I mean, the B & I Corporation

some mistakes in them.</i>

No! No, no, no!

01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,827
<i>DEREK: Oh, reading.
BILL: Read the book.</i>

2191
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,413
<i>LINDSEY: Books, yes.
They don't do books.</i>

2192
01:22:33,496 --> 01:22:34,706
<i>DEREK: No, I do books,</i>

2193
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:37,792
<i>- I just hadn't read that one.
- BILL: I just don't get through a...</i>

2194
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:40,128
<i>- Moon-Watcher.
- A Moon-Watcher a night, that's all.</i>

2195
01:22:40,211 --> 01:22:42,022
<i>DEREK: It's kind of amazing
when you think about it</i>

2196
01:22:42,046 --> 01:22:44,799
<i>because it's better
without knowing his name.</i>

2197
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:46,819
<i>I mean, if I had known his name
was Moon-Watcher...</i>

2198
01:22:46,843 --> 01:22:48,603
<i>LINDSEY: It's kind of
a cheesy name actually.</i>

2199
01:22:48,678 --> 01:22:51,198
<i>DEREK: It would kind of take me out
of my caveman talking to monolith...</i>

2200
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:52,908
<i>LINDSEY: You would, yeah. You'd be,
"Oh. Moon-Watcher..."</i>

2201
01:22:52,932 --> 01:22:55,369
<i>All of a sudden it goes into
a hippie realm that's not really fitting.</i>

2202
01:22:55,393 --> 01:22:58,395
<i>ANGUS: I like that the button is
conveniently placed near the ceiling.</i>

2203
01:22:58,478 --> 01:23:00,564
<i>DEREK: You're not supposed to
have to touch it.</i>

2204
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:02,527
<i>LINDSEY: You're not supposed to
know it's there.</i>

2205
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:03,668
<i>BILL: You're not supposed to need it.</i>

2206
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,044
<i>ANGUS: That's again
where we're cheating.</i>

2207
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:07,213
<i>BILL: You don't want to
accidentally turn off the autopilot.</i>

2208
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:09,030
<i>LINDSEY: Yeah. If you're not there</i>

2209
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:12,743
<i>- and it accidentally turns off...
- BILL: There's M-O.</i>

2210
01:23:13,577 --> 01:23:16,246
<i>DEREK: That's not M-O. That's M-O.
LINDSEY: There's M-O.</i>

2211
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:19,308
<i>ANGUS: See, we referenced for this
by putting everyone on a skateboard</i>

2212
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:21,001
<i>and then this is what they did.</i>

2213
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,478
<i>Those that weren't familiar with it.</i>

2214
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:23,670
<i>DEREK: We have to imagine</i>

<i>ANGUS: Ever.
DEREK: Really.</i>

2217
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:31,052
<i>These are generations later
on the</i> Axiom.

2218
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,387
<i>So none of these</i> Axiom...

2219
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:34,031
<i>BILL: And yet we're supposed to
believe that they can?</i>

2220
01:23:34,055 --> 01:23:35,533
<i>ANGUS: No, but it's like in The Matrix,
when they say,</i>

2221
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:37,910
<i>"Oh, why do your eyes hurt?
Oh, because you haven't used them,"</i>

<i>and that kind of thing.</i>

2223
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:40,455
<i>DEREK: Movies are
about make-believe, Bill,</i>

the willing suspension of disbelief is...</i>

<i>LINDSEY: And if we haven't
ruined that by now.</i>

we're all from Michigan.</i>

blowing holes in the fantasy.</i>

<i>What did he say?
"Oh, EVE can't really fold up like that."</i>

<i>LINDSEY: You guys are
all blowing holes.</i>

letting everyone know,</i>

01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:59,140
<i>there's no way her head is that shape.</i>

<i>LINDSEY: I am the romantic
in the group,</i>

is actually the reasoning behind it.</i>

2235
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:03,793
<i>DEREK: About hyperspeed?</i>

2236

<i>BILL: I'm romantic
about this warp effect.</i>

<i>That's what I'm romantic about.</i>

<i>BOTH: Whoa!</i>

2239
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,217
<i>BILL: It's kind of space art.</i>

2240

<i>ANGUS: It's kind of a Francis Bacon-y
kind of thing there.</i>

01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:13,178
<i>BILL: I like it though.</i>

<i>- I like the whole after-image.
- ANGUS: I like Francis Bacon.</i>

2243
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:17,241
<i>DEREK: There's been
a lot of efforts to do,</i>

<i>between warp drive and hyperspeed
and all of those hyper jumps</i>

<i>in the various science fictions.</i>

2249
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:29,670
<i>ANGUS: So, at the end of the story,</i>

2250
01:24:29,694 --> 01:24:31,171
<i>does he see a giant laser
and chase after it?</i>

2251
01:24:31,195 --> 01:24:32,905
<i>DEREK: No, no, I think he just...</i>

2252
01:24:32,988 --> 01:24:35,282
<i>LINDSEY: Just dies.
No, just dies of starvation.</i>

You gotta look that one up, but...</i>

2254
01:24:37,743 --> 01:24:39,971
<i>BILL: Now, do we still see
the roach go into the landing pad?</i>

2255

01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:42,891
<i>DEREK: That was a great...
BILL: I loved that one.</i>

2257
01:24:42,915 --> 01:24:45,477
<i>DEREK: I thought that was pretty, too.
LINDSEY: I know. It was a good gag.</i>

2258
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:47,354
<i>DEREK: It was a great way to finish off
the indestructible...</i>

2259
01:24:47,378 --> 01:24:48,563
<i>LINDSEY: But it kind of
took away the tension.</i>

2260
01:24:48,587 --> 01:24:49,815
<i>DEREK: Right. Well, we're sort of</i>

2261
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:50,881
<i>in emotional crisis...</i>

2262
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:52,192
<i>LINDSEY: Yeah.
We got to get to WALL-E.</i>

2263

<i>DEREK: ticking clock.
We got to get to WALL-E.</i>

2264
01:24:54,468 --> 01:24:56,154
<i>So, sadly, one of our favorite
cockroach jokes died,</i>

2265
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:58,323

<i>get landed on by the</i> Axiom.

2267

<i>LINDSEY: And he survives.
DEREK: Yes. 'Cause, get it?</i>

2269
01:25:02,643 --> 01:25:04,363
<i>He's indestructible
'cause he's a cockroach.</i>

2270
01:25:04,436 --> 01:25:05,831

Set up, set up, set up, payoff.</i>

01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:09,775
<i>ANGUS: It's a running gag,

2272
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:12,528
<i>BILL: That's pretty.</i>

2273

<i>ANGUS: It kind of looks like
The Wreck of the Zephyr there.</i>

<i>BILL:</i> The Wreck of the Zephyr?

<i>LINDSEY: The wreck of the what?
ANGUS: A book. Van Allsburg.</i>

2276
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:21,745
<i>Maybe you heard of it.
It's a picture book, my speed.</i>

2277
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:24,207
<i>BILL: I have.
LINDSEY: It's a picture book.</i>

2278
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:30,672

it's too late to change.</i>

2286
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:45,729
<i>LINDSEY: Dude,
I'm just saying the sandstorms</i>

2287
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:48,273

- DEREK: Hey, you know, they've got</i>

2288
01:25:48,356 --> 01:25:50,042
<i>a gigantic shelter to

2292
01:25:53,778 --> 01:25:56,090
<i>ANGUS: They are totally taken care of
all the time. All of a sudden,</i>

<i>you drop them in Burning Man
without their requisite water per day.</i>

<i>DEREK: Hey, was that a lawn gnome?
LINDSEY: It's a lawn gnome.</i>

01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:02,179
<i>DEREK: There was
a lawn gnome in there.</i>

- I don't think I saw that before.</i>

2297
01:26:04,997 --> 01:26:06,877
<i>BILL: See, here, this is
what I'm talking about.</i>

2298
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:11,837
<i>Like, so if WALL-E's soul is in
that circuit board that got destroyed...</i>

2299
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:14,131
<i>ANGUS: It's right behind
the circuit board.</i>

01:26:14,214 --> 01:26:15,901
<i>BILL: Like connects to that.
DEREK: Yeah. You're asking</i>

2301
01:26:15,925 --> 01:26:18,069
<i>- the wrong question because it's...
- LINDSEY: But you know what?</i>

2302
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:20,030
<i>- The soul is not...

2303
01:26:20,054 --> 01:26:22,598
<i>ANGUS: No, no, it's a soul enhancer.</i>

2304
01:26:22,681 --> 01:26:24,516
<i>LINDSEY: The soul is not
a tangible thing.</i>

<i>ANGUS: It's like the soul...
No, no, no, no.</i>

2306
01:26:26,936 --> 01:26:30,314
<i>That's like the Cerebro helmet.
That's not actually Cerebro.</i>

2307

<i>- It's just how you access Cerebro.
- BILL: That's what I asked you earlier.</i>

2308
01:26:33,816 --> 01:26:36,361
<i>Is there a single part
which houses his soul?</i>

2309

<i>ANGUS: Yeah,
I think it's right behind his chest.</i>

- Below the buttons.</i>

2315
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,598
<i>LINDSEY: No, that's the whole thing,
is that it gets replaced here</i>

2316
01:26:47,622 --> 01:26:50,166
<i>and then it reboots him,
If you will, and he becomes soulless.</i>

tases you, you don't lose your soul.</i>

2318
01:26:52,126 --> 01:26:56,714
<i>LINDSEY: And then, her touch actually
ignites that intangible soul.</i>

2319
01:26:56,798 --> 01:26:59,133
<i>DEREK: WALL-E has

<i>her own electromagnetic energy</i>

2321

The spark thing you mean?</i>

DEREK: No, the hand hold...</i>

2326

<i>But there's the spark
and there's also...</i>

<i>LINDSEY: But that
doesn't do anything.</i>

<i>DEREK: No, but she's sings the bars
of the song.</i>

2329

<i>LINDSEY: The song, but it's really
the hand hold is what kicks it in. It is.</i>

2330
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,440
<i>ANGUS: Is that like amnesia?</i>

2331

<i>- LINDSEY: Yes.
- What amnesia patients need</i>

2332
01:27:22,115 --> 01:27:23,342
<i>- is an old light bulb...
- LINDSEY: Because we went</i>

2333
01:27:23,366 --> 01:27:25,427
<i>back and forth on this. Do you know
how many times this got cut?</i>

2334
01:27:25,451 --> 01:27:27,471
<i>This was like, do you extend it,
do you not extend it,</i>

2335
01:27:27,495 --> 01:27:29,807
<i>do you cut this part out? They added
the humming at the very end.</i>

- LINDSEY: That's true.</i>

01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:36,145

<i>ANGUS: And the cockroach
doesn't know he's broken</i>

2344

<i>because he still got run over,</i>

<i>so their abusive relationship
is still intact.</i>

<i>ANGUS: No,
we had an argument about that.</i>

- LINDSEY: It's so wrong.</i>

- DEREK: No, but the combination,</i>

2375
01:28:36,521 --> 01:28:39,191
<i>- song, spark, and then...
- ANGUS: Wait. She's holding on.</i>

2376
01:28:39,274 --> 01:28:40,710
<i>DEREK: She'd been holding the hand
before the spark.</i>

<i>- ANGUS: He can't let go.
- Get this. You've got to put</i>

2378
01:28:43,236 --> 01:28:46,865
<i>the jumper cables on the engine.
But when you start the car,</i>

about a car battery.</i>

2403
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,511

- "Give them a moment."</i>

2404
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:34,888
<i>LINDSEY: Cockroach is like, "Do you

<i>"What do you want to do now?"</i>

<i>BILL: I think it's going to create
a whole generation of nerds.</i>

2595
01:36:23,482 --> 01:36:27,027
<i>ANGUS: Yeah, it might. And maybe
a thing like it's like the</i> I Am Legend,

<i>DEREK: Do you mean</i>
The Omega Man?

<i>ANGUS: No, no... Well, whatever.
It's just the idea that everyone...</i>

2599
01:36:32,115 --> 01:36:34,677
<i>- BILL: The book is I Am Legend.
- Okay, fine, the book. I'm just saying</i>

2600
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:37,996
<i>maybe everyone is a nerd,
and the non-nerds are trying to find</i>

2601
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,081
<i>a cure for the nerdery.</i>

2602
01:36:39,164 --> 01:36:41,601
<i>- DEREK: And then he finds out...
- He finds out he is the outsider.</i>

2603
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:43,585
<i>- Yes.
- You know, it's like he realizes nerdery</i>

2604

2605
01:36:44,836 --> 01:36:46,105
<i>DEREK: "I'm not gonna
let this happen."</i>

2606
01:36:46,129 --> 01:36:48,714
<i>ANGUS: The five kids out there

2608
01:36:51,592 --> 01:36:53,135
<i>DEREK: How can you not like robots?</i>

2609
01:36:53,219 --> 01:36:55,179
<i>BILL: They're motioning for us
to wrap it up.</i>

2610
01:36:55,263 --> 01:36:57,699
<i>ANGUS: I think the movie is ending
here. So what we should do is,</i>

2611
01:36:57,723 --> 01:36:59,267
<i>we should go out, grab a coffee,</i>

2612
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,161
<i>and then come back, because
we are gonna definitely have to</i>

2613
01:37:01,185 --> 01:37:03,396
<i>re-do this whole thing.</i>

2614

<i>[ALL EXCLAIMING]</i>

2615

<i>BILL: I can't do that.
ANGUS: Well, I'm gonna do my part,</i>

2616
01:37:08,526 --> 01:37:10,194
<i>and then I'll do your part as you.</i>

2617

<i>BILL: Okay.
ANGUS: Yeah, you're easy to do.</i>

2618
01:37:11,737 --> 01:37:14,240
<i>All I gotta do is take
a little bit of me...</i>

2619
01:37:14,323 --> 01:37:16,510
<i>BILL: All right, then why did you
invite me in the first place?</i>

2620
01:37:16,534 --> 01:37:19,537
<i>ANGUS: Well, I wanted to get
your tone, and learn your timbre,</i>

2621
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,665
<i>and then your sensibilities.
And combine that</i>

<i>into a nice audio commentary package
that no one will be listening to.</i>

<i>BILL: I think we should go.</i>

2624

<i>ANGUS: I think we're gone.
BILL: All right folks. Goodbye.</i>

2625
01:37:30,756 --> 01:37:32,592
<i>LINDSEY: Okay.
