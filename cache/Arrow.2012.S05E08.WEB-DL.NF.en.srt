00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,057
I KNOW, AND I'M...
I'M SORRY IF THIS
IS CONFUSING

471
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,976
OR IF I'M SCARING YOU,
BUT THE ONLY THING

472
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:31,731
IN THE WORLD THAT MAKES
SENSE TO ME RIGHT NOW

473
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,858
IS THAT I LOVE YOU,

474
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,236
AND I'M GONNA
TAKE THAT JOB
AT QUEEN CONSOLIDATED,

475
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,489
AND I SWEAR TO GOD
I'M GONNA WORK
EVERY SINGLE DAY

476
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:44,243
TO BE THE MAN
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH.

477
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,121
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

478
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,789
SORRY ABOUT
THE INTERRUPTION.

479
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,625
THE RUSSIAN LADY
DOWNSTAIRS TOLD ME
TO COME RIGHT UP.

480
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,128
YOU GOT A MINUTE
TO TALK?

481
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,379
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

482
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,134
OLIVER: NOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO I SHOULD JUST GO
BACK TO MY LIFE?

483
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,137
LOOK. HAVE YOU BEEN
GETTING OUT INTO
THE CITY LATELY,

484
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,390
SEEING MAYBE
A PARTICULAR BUILDING
THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE?

485
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,267
-SMOAK TECHNOLOGIES.
-YEAH.

486
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,643
YEAH, WHEN I WAS
WITH MY DAD,

487
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,104
I...I SAW IT,
AND IT FELT, UH...

488
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,522
-IT FELT WRONG.
-RIGHT.

489
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,901
FELICITY SMOAK
SAYS SHE NEVER
OWNED A BUILDING

490
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,361
OR A COMPANY.

491
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,156
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE,

492
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,950
BUT WHEN YOU LEFT,
I STARTED HAVING
THESE, UH...

493
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,994
VISIONS, RIGHT?
LIKE, UM...

494
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,037
UH, MEMORY FLASHES.

495
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,039
I'M GETTING THEM, TOO.

496
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,540
JOHN, WHAT IS
HAPPENING TO US?

497
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,417
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I'VE SEEN SOME
WEIRD THINGS

498
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,379
IN THE STAN,
EVEN STRANGER THINGS
AS THE HOOD, BUT THIS...

499
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,217
LOOK. WHEN YOU LEFT,
I TRIED TO DRAW ONE

500
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,886
OF THESE, UH,
MEMORY FLASHES,
AS YOU CALL THEM.

501
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,514
NEVER BEEN MUCH
OF AN ARTIST,

502
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,933
BUT THIS IS WHAT
I CAME UP WITH.

503
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,980
-WHAT THE HELL?
-I DON'T KNOW.

504
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,276
BEEN REMEMBERING THINGS.
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE DREAMS
BUT THEY'RE NOT, JOHN.

505
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,444
I DON'T THINK THAT
ANY OF THIS IS REAL.

506
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,196
WE'RE REAL,
BUT WHATEVER'S

507
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,572
PLAYING THESE
HEAD GAMES WITH US,

508
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,199
I DON'T THINK IT'S
FULLY WORKING.

509
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,575
ARE YOU SURE?

510
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,662
BECAUSE THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT...

511
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,122
THEY'VE PUT ME INTO A WORLD
WHERE I NEVER

512
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,581
GOT ON MY FATHER'S BOAT.

513
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,000
OLIVER, I DON'T KNOW
IF THESE ARE MEMORIES

514
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,169
OR FEELINGS, BUT I
THINK YOU'RE A HERO,

515
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,378
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S BECAUSE OF ANY BOAT.

516
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,506
THESE HEAD GAMES
AREN'T OVER.

517
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,218
THEY ARE GONNA PUSH BACK
AGAINST WHATEVER WE DO.

518
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,220
PUSH BACK?

519
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,387
LIKE HOW?

520
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,228
LIKE THAT.

521
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,295
[CRACK]

522
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,845
HOW DID I DO THAT?

523
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,308
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS
HARD TO EXPLAIN.

524
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,893
WELL, START TRYING.

525
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,770
WE THINK...WE THINK
WE'RE IN SOME SORT

526
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,814
OF SHARED HALLUCINATION.

527
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,108
WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY.

528
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,401
I MEAN, NOT AS CRAZY
AS ME KNOWING KUNG FU,

529
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,862
BUT IT IS DEFINITELY
UP THERE.

530
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,822
THAT WASN'T KUNG FU.
THAT WAS JETE KUNE DO,

531
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,366
AND I THINK THAT
YOU LEARNED IT

532
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,284
IN A SPOT CALLED
NANDA PARBAT.

533
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,078
NOTHING YOU ARE SAYING
IS MAKING SENSE.

534
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,746
NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE.

535
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,122
ALL RIGHT, SARA.
WHAT IS THE LAST
THING YOU REMEMBER?

536
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,456
-I DON'T KNOW.
-I MEAN, BEFORE YOU

537
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,126
CAME HERE YESTERDAY.

538
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,420
WHAT IS THE LAST
THING THAT YOU REMEMBER?

539
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,136
YOU REMEMBERED SOMETHING.
COME ON.

540
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,637
SARA, COME ON,
CONCENTRATE...

541
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,931
[ECHOING]
CONCENTRATE.

542
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,771
THERE WAS A FIGHT.

543
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,564
IT WAS 5 OF US,
AND THEN...

544
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,815
AND THEN WE WERE TAKEN.

545
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,734
JOHN:
TAKEN WHERE?

546
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,194
I DON'T KNOW.

547
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,946
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
THERE WERE 5 OF US.

548
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,446
WHO WERE
THE OTHER TWO?

549
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:12,285
RAY PALMER
AND...AND THEA.

550
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,451
I MEAN, IF THIS IS
SOME KIND OF DREAM

551
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,495
OR SHARED
HALLUCINATION,

552
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,164
THEN HOW DO WE WAKE UP?

553
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,540
BY GETTING OUT
OF HERE.

554
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,334
THE SMOAK TECHNOLOGIES
BUILDING.

555
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,336
MAYBE THE REASON
WHY THAT PLACE
SEEMS SO STRANGE

556
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,630
IS BECAUSE THAT'S
THE WAY WE GET
OUT OF HERE...

557
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,549
WHEREVER HERE IS.

558
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,931
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

559
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,558
YOU STOLE SOMETHING
FROM VAN HORN INDUSTRIES.

560
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,185
YOU MEAN THIS?

561
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,354
YEAH. HAND IT OVER.

562
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,148
OR WHAT?

563
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,275
I'LL TAKE IT
FROM YOU.

564
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,567
I DOUBT THAT.

565
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,699
YOU WANT TO GIVE UP?

566
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,452
I'M JUST
GETTING STARTED.

567
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,619
SO AM I.

568
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,402
RORY:
THAT WAS AWESOME.

569
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,862
THERE'S THE REGULATOR.

570
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,739
SHE SEEMS PRETTY
ATTACHED TO IT. HEH HEH.

571
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,574
MAYBE JUST REMOVE IT.

572
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,369
AHEM.

573
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,453
RENE: THANKS
FOR THE SAVE.

574
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,787
IS THAT ALL YOU
HAVE TO SAY?

575
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,331
I DON'T DO
APOLOGIES,
SWEETHEART...

576
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,836
BUT IF SUPERPOWERS
ARE A THING,

577
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,340
IT'S GOOD THERE ARE
GUYS LIKE YOU TO
HELP THE WORLD.

578
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,841
YOU KNOW, THE GREEN
GUY WOULD HAVE
KICKED MY ASS

579
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,967
IF I TALKED TO HIM
LIKE THAT.

580
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,720
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
WE KNOW. YEP.

581
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,433
THEA: IT'S TOO BAD
TOMMY COULDN'T
MAKE IT, THOUGH.

582
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,185
WELL, THEY'VE GOT HIM
WORKING TRIPLE SHIFTS

583
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,978
AT THE HOSPITAL
THESE DAYS.

584
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,897
BESIDES, CHICAGO
ISN'T EXACTLY
NEXT DOOR.

585
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,732
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S A DOCTOR NOW.

586
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,485
WELL, HE SAYS THE SAME
THING ABOUT YOU,
MISS ENTREPRENEUR.

587
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,445
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
RUNNING VERDANT

588
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,905
MAKES ME
AN ENTREPRENEUR.

589
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,572
NO, BUT IT MAKES YOU
SUCCESSFUL.

590
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,949
YOUR FATHER SHOULD BE
VERY PROUD

591
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,868
OF THE WOMAN
YOU'VE GROWN INTO.

592
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,996
RAY, I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU.

593
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,457
SARA...RIGHT? H-HI.

594
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,584
UM, THIS IS
MY FIANCÉE FELICITY SMOAK.

595
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,129
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.
OH, YOU'RE LAUREL'S
SISTER, RIGHT?

596
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,173
YEAH. CAN I STEAL
HIM FOR A SECOND?

597
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,634
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. OK.

598
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:39,223
RAY, DOESN'T THIS
ALL FEEL WEIRD
TO YOU?

599
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,100
A LITTLE.

600
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,394
I NEED YOU TO THINK.

601
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,188
SHE'S NOT MY FIANCÉE.

602
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,317
MY FIANCÉE'S NAME
IS ANNA...OR WAS.

603
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,693
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

604
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,029
YOU'RE REMEMBERING.

605
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,655
OLIVER: HEY.

606
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,285
ROBERT: SON,
DON'T YOU THINK

607
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,161
YOU SHOULD BE GETTING
YOUR TUXEDO ON?

608
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,955
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
OLIVER?

609
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,582
I JUST NEED TO SPEAK
WITH THEA.

610
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,292
ROBERT: I THINK I SAW HER
TALKING TO MALCOLM

611
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,751
OVER BY
THE ICE SCULPTURE.

612
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,086
YEAH.

613
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,089
SON...I THINK YOU
NEED TO CLAM DOWN.

614
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,299
WE BOTH DO.

615
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,301
YOU'RE ACTING
TERRIBLY STRANGE.

616
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,969
YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE CONCERNED

617
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,346
THAT IF YOU KEEP UP
THIS UNSTABLE BEHAVIOR

618
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,015
THAT IS NOT
GOING TO FINISH WELL.

619
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,684
THAT IS NOT GOING TO
FINISH WELL.

620
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,146
-WHAT?
-I'M JUST SAYING.

621
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,982
LAUREL, THE COMPANY.

622
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,276
THIS IS YOUR LIFE NOW.

623
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,699
NO, IT ISN'T.

624
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,160
OLIVER.

625
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,045
I'M SO...I'M SORRY.

626
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,506
ROBERT: OLLIE, OLLIE.

627
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,762
-SPEEDY.
-SHE KNOWS, OLLIE.

628
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,056
SHE KNOWS, AND SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO GO.

629
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,560
THE BETTER QUESTION IS
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?

630
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,437
BECAUSE NONE OF THIS
IS REAL.

631
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,230
IT'S REAL ENOUGH, OK?

632
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,024
IT'S...IT'S BETTER
THAN OUR REAL LIVES.

633
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,818
IN...IN THIS LIFE,
LAUREL IS ALIVE,

634
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,154
MY PARENTS ARE ALIVE.

635
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,822
BUT THOSE ARE NOT
YOUR PARENTS.

636
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,491
THEY REMEMBER THE ONLY
LULLABY THAT WOULD

637
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,369
ACTUALLY WORK
TO PUT ME TO SLEEP.

638
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,038
THEY REMEMBER
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE, OK?

639
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,207
THEY EVEN SMELL
LIKE THEM, OLLIE...

640
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,877
THEY'RE NOT THEM,
THEA.

641
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,796
I WANT THEM TO BE,
BUT...

642
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,006
BUT THEY'RE NOT.

643
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,927
WHERE ARE JOHN AND RAY?

644
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,639
THEY'RE WAITING OUTSIDE.

645
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,224
GIVE US
A FEW MINUTES.

646
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,271
WE CAN'T STAY HERE,
SPEEDY, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH WE WANT TO.

647
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,565
WE CAN'T.

648
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,815
WHY NOT?

649
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,069
WHAT IS WAITING
FOR US,

650
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,779
WHEREVER WE ARE
RIGHT NOW?

651
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,243
NOTHING. NOTHING
BUT PAIN

652
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,619
AND S-SUFFERING.

653
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,870
THEA, WE HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES.

654
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,372
WE HAVE PEOPLE
WHO COUNT ON US.

655
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,625
THERE'S FLASH
AND...AND SUPERGIRL

656
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,629
AND...AND PEOPLE
WITH ACTUAL POWERS NOW.

657
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,006
WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE,
THEY CAN HANDLE IT.

658
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:25,305
WE...WE FINALLY HAVE
A CHANCE TO BE HAPPY.

659
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,686
I MEAN, WHY...WHY CAN'T
YOU JUST FOR A SECOND ACCEPT

660
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,271
THAT MAYBE THIS IS
YOUR REWARD

661
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,524
FOR ALL OF THE SACRIFICES
YOU HAVE MADE?

662
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:40,904
I DIDN'T MAKE
THOSE SACRIFICES
FOR A REWARD, THEA.

663
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,449
I DID WHAT I DID
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS RIGHT...

664
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,703
AND SEEING ALL THIS,
IT HAS JUST...

665
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,914
IT HAS SHOWN ME THAT
THERE IS STILL SO MUCH
MORE TO DO,

666
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,834
SO PLEASE, I'M BEGGING
YOU TO COME WITH ME

667
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,836
BECAUSE I CANNOT
DO IT ALONE.

668
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,636
BUT...

669
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,347
I CAN'T LOSE
THEM AGAIN.

670
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,600
I CAN'T LOSE MY FAMILY.

671
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,567
OK. OK. ALL RIGHT.

672
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,240
I WANT YOU TO BE WELL,
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

673
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,827
I LOVE YOU, THEA.

JOHN: WHERE'S THEA?

676
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,764
THEA'S STAYING.

677
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,307
HAVE YOU EXPLAINED
TO RAY WHAT WE
HAVE TO DO?

678
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,558
YEAH. APPARENTLY,
WE HAVE TO GET TO

679
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,644
AN OFFICE TOWER THAT MY
NON-FIANCEE DOESN'T OWN.

680
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:54,687
WHICH IS
A LITTLE STRANGE.

681
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,771
ALL THAT
COMING FROM A GUY

682
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:56,689
WHO'S BEEN
HAVING MEMORIES

683
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,981
THAT HE'S ABLE
TO SHRINK.

684
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,983
WELL, WHATEVER
WE'RE DOING, WE
HAVE TO DO IT FAST

685
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,568
BECAUSE WHATEVER
THE DOMINATORS HAVE
DONE TO US,

686
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,320
THEY WOULD HAVE
BUILT IN SAFEGUARDS.

687
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,489
THEY'RE PROBABLY
MANIFESTATIONS
FROM OUR MEMORIES

688
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,073
DESIGNED TO
KEEP US HERE.

689

OHH! AGH!

690
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,036
AGH! UNH!

691
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,133
THEY'RE NOT REAL.

692
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,219
THEA: THEY CERTAINLY
LOOK REAL.

693
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,262
LET'S NOT GET
INTO THAT RIGHT NOW.

694
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,974
SPEEDY?

695
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,102
YEAH. I HAD A CHANGE
OF HEART, OK?

I CAN'T LOSE

GONNA BE A LITTLE LESS

THAN KILLING YOUR SISTER.

I CAN'T EXPLAIN,

708

00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,887
WE HAVE TO GO.

WHATEVER IT IS,
WE CAN FIX IT.

JUST CAN'T FIX.

THE WAY OUT OF HERE,

780
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,052
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

781
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,469
GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATES
DON'T HAVE

782
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,554
ANY NEGATIVE NUMBERS.

783
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,765
I MEAN, THEY DO.
ONLY WHEN...

784
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,684
OH, MY GOD. I THINK
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

785
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,077
KLIC-CLAC-TO NICK-LAVA
SHACK-TOO.

786
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,245
NICK-LAVA SHOO-LA.

787
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,005
THEA: OK. SO HOW DO WE FIND
OUR WAY OUT

788
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,548
OF AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT?

789
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,009
THIS WAY.
EVEN THOUGH IT'S
AN ALIEN TECHNOLOGY,

790
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,928
CERTAIN PRINCIPLES
OF DESIGN ARE
UNIVERSAL.

791
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,683
OR NOT.

792
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,944
RAY'S RIGHT.

793
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,029
CERTAIN PRINCIPLES
OF DESIGN ARE UNIVERSAL.

794
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,832
JOHN: YOU THINK YOU CAN
FLY ONE OF THESE THINGS?

795
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,085
I'M HOPING THAT
BETWEEN YOU, ME,
RAY, AND SARA

796
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,628
SOMEONE CAN FLY
ONE OF THESE THINGS.

797
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,888
OK. NOW WHAT?

798
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,598
OLIVER: RAY?

799
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,600
UM, NOW MIGHT BE
A GOOD TIME TO FIND
THE OWNER'S MANUAL.

800
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,232
[COMPUTERS BEEPING]

801
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,070
AND MOM SAID I WOULDN'T
AMOUNT TO ANYTHING

802
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,114
IF I DIDN'T GO
TO COLLEGE.

803
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,060
UH, I REALLY HOPE YOU
HIT AUTOPILOT

804
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,645
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY
CONTROLS ON THIS THING.

805
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,855
HOLD ON!
WE GOT INCOMING!

806
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,939
SARA: HOW DO YOU KNOW?

807
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,399
[BOOM]

808
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,860
LUCKY GUESS?

809
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,913
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO STEER THIS THING,

810
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,581
OR WE'RE NOT GONNA
LAST VERY LONG!

811
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,064
OLIVER...
NICE CLOTHES.

812
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,982
SHOPPING AT ALIEN GAP?

813
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,192
NOT FUNNY.

814
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,360
WELL, LUCKY
FOR YOU GUYS,

815
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,652
THE WAVERIDER HAS
A MACHINE THAT

816
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,112
REPLICATES OLD CLOTHES
AND WEAPONS.

817
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,573
-HI. I'M NATE HEYWOOD.
-HI. THEA,

818
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,158
AND...AND THIS IS
EXACTLY TWICE AS MANY

819
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,160
SPACESHIPS AS I EVER
THOUGHT I'D BE ON.

820
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,870
WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S A TIME SHIP.

821
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,538
-HOW'D YOU FIND US?
-I DIDN'T.

822
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,498
YOUR NERD ARMY
BACK ON EARTH DID.

823
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,000
SARA: I'M GONNA TAKE
DIG TO THE MED BAY,

824
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,459
HAVE GIDEON FIX HIM UP.

825
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,338
JOHN: WHOEVER
GIDEON IS.

826
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,049
THEA: OH...GET...OUT!

827
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,217
OLIVER:
THANKS FOR THE SAVE.

828
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,593
NATE: NO PROBLEM.

829
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,802
RAY: EXCEPT FOR
ALL OF OUR OTHER
PROBLEMS.

830
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,554
OLIVER: LIKE WHAT, RAY?

831
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,889
RAY: AFTER WE
WOKE UP,

832
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,391
I GOT A LOOK
AT THE TECH

833
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,892
THE DOMINATORS WERE
USING TO KEEP
US UNDER.

834
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,685
THEY'RE USING
A NEUROMORPHIC INTERFACE

835
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,854
SIMILAR TO HOW I MANIPULATE
THE ATOM SUIT.

836
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,399
THEA: AND...AND WAIT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

837
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,525
I...I THINK THE SHARED
HALLUCINATION

838
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,195
WAS TO KEEP OUR MINDS
OCCUPIED WHILE
THE DOMINATORS...

839
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,613
OLIVER: WHILE
THE DOMINATORS WHAT?

840
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,865
WELL, WHILE THEY
PROBED OUR SUBCONSCIOUS.

841
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,826
I'M GUESSING LOOKING
FOR INTEL.

842
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,995
WAIT. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
CHOOSE US AT RANDOM.

843
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:59,124
MAYBE THEY CHOSE US
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T
FIGHT BACK.

844
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,334
BECAUSE NONE OF YOU
ARE METAHUMANS.

845
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,253
BIGGER QUESTION...
WHAT INTEL WERE
THEY AFTER?

846
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,463
WHAT IS THEIR PLAN?

847
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,840
"KLIC-CLAC-TO NICK-LAVA
SHACK-TOO."

848
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,967
GESUNDHEIT.

849
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,427
IT'S WHAT ONE
OF THE DOMINATORS

850
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,137
SAID TO ANOTHER.

851
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,888
HEH. SOUNDS LIKE
THE BEGINNING OF
A NOT-SO-FUNNY JOKE,

852
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,848
BUT, GIDEON.

853
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,017
GIDEON: TRANSLATING.

854
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,518
THEA: DID YOU EVER
THINK THAT OUR LIVES

855
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,187
WOULD REALLY GET
THIS WEIRD?

856
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,022
GIDEON: THE PHRASE LOOSELY
TRANSLATES TO

857
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,150
"WE ARE NEARING COMPLETION
OF THE WEAPON."

858
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,192
WHAT WEAPON?

859
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,735
I'M AFRAID I HAVE
NO IDEA,

860
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,446
BUT I'M TRACKING
THE DOMINATOR MOTHERSHIP

861
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,072
YOU ESCAPED FROM,

862
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,409
AND IT APPEARS TO BE
ON A DIRECT COURSE FOR EARTH.
