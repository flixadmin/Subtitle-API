1
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,479
<i>Good morning, Presage employees.</i>

2
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,816
<i>We hope you're all ready for our exciting
team-building retreat.</i>

3
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,224
<i>Please enjoy your breakfast...</i>

4
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,881
<i>and then make your way to the bus,
which will leave shortly.</i>

5
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,115
Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put
breakfast together for the retreat?"...

6
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,368
I meant, like, some stale doughnuts,
some coffee.

7
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,869
But this is amazing.

8
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,707
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you
see my sales report for last month.

9
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,291
Oh, I saw it last night.

10
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
Shit. Has Dennis seen it?

11
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,920
Not yet.

12
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,381
Look, you just need to make a decision,
you know?

13
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,801
Are you gonna be "chef" or are you
gonna be "sales guy"?

14
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,139
I'm saying that as your friend because,
as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.

15
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,142
- As your friend, I appreciate that advice.
- Good.

16
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,940
Hold on, man, I'll be right back.

17
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,199
Molly. Your ticket's canceled.

18
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,827
Tell me that's a mistake.

19
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,662
I was gonna tell you after this weekend.

20
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,414
Uh, tell me what?

21
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,751
That I don't think it's such a good idea.

22
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,963
What, the trip? It's my brother's wedding.

23
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,758
What's going on here?

24
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,766
We should talk about this later.
Let's just...

25
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,764
What, pretend like I didn't see this for the
next two days? No, let's talk about this.

26
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,807
It's not working out, Sam.

27
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,853
We're not working out.

28
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,983
Hey.

29
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,861
Hey. Oh, it's, uh, Candice, right?

30
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,238
- Not funny.
- Oh...

31
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,618
Okay, sorry, this is not a vacation.
Okay, this is a business retreat.

32
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,412
So we're gonna be all business
for the next two days.

33
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,747
Sorry.

34
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,708
I love you, but doesn't change the fact
that you're still an intern.

35
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,257
Oh, um, but that 12:30 curfew tonight?
You should plan on breaking that.

36
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,509
Why?

37
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,804
For the naked team-building.

38
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,072
Hey, Olivia.

39
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,573
Don't forget these.

40
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,077
Oh, yeah. I keep trying to.

41
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,038
- Hmm.
- I like it. It's very Lisa Loeb.

42
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,540
Oh, well, you know...

43
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,877
I'd rather be very Olivia.

44
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,629
We got a gig on Sunday.

45
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,172
Yeah, I'll be there.

46
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,050
Morning, Peter.

47
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,678
- Looking good.
- Uh, hi.

48
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,015
Olivia. Have you slept
with every hipster in town yet?

49
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,892
Candice. Do you actually get paid
for this internship...

50
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,311
or does Daddy
just increase your allowance?

51
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,399
You know, if you wanna get rid of that
baby fat, you should try the gym.

52
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,110
They have these workout machines
that you use on your back.

53
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,361
You're good at that.

54
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,488
Sweetie, it's not fat.

55
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,701
They're called tits.

56
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,998
You're not looking so hot there,
Moll-face.

57
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,458
Gee, thanks.

58
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,461
Did you try the little jam-bread whatever
your boyfriend made?

59
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,089
I gotta tell you, he's a pre... Uh-oh, that's
what it is, is it? Did I touch a nerve?

60
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,009
- Just leave me alone, Isaac.
- Hey, Moll? Moll? Look at me.

61
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,697
If you ever need anyone to talk to...

62
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,859
I've been told I'm a good listener
by a lot of ladies. Shh, wait.

63
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,095
Tell me this is Kimber from last Tuesday.
Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber is...?

64
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,986
Hey, let's sit next to each other
on the bus.

65
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,981
No, no, I remember you.
You were, like, a bigger gal, right?

66
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,567
You know what you should do?
You should apologize.

67
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,527
- Why?
- Doesn't matter.

68
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,376
Never matters. "I'm sorry, because I..."

69
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,907
Oh, shit.

70
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,666
Hey, Stan, how's it going?

71
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,960
Uh, it's Sam, sir.

72
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,380
Did you just correct me?

73
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,091
No.

74
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,384
Look at me.

75
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,843
- What's my name?
- Dennis.

76
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,387
Look away.

77
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,763
All set, Pete?

78
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,432
Yes, sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.

79
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,268
What's the one thing
we can't recycle, Pete?

80
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,520
Wasted time, sir.

81
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,898
Exactly. I wanna be on the road
in 90 seconds.

82
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,693
Uh, well, I just saw his car,
so I'll go track him down.

83
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,112
Way to show some initiative, Stan.

84
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,072
It's gonna be a good day.

85
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,535
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

86
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,953
What's up, bud?

87
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,754
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?

88
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,257
You know,
I'm just trying to make sense of it here.

89
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,025
Three weeks ago they brought you in
as assistant plant manager...

90
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,681
- and now you got a day off?
- It's not a day off. It's a re... Re...

91
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,474
Re... Re-what? Retarded?

92
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,101
It's a retreat.

93
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,561
It's a retreat.

94
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,895
I don't wanna go. I'm
just following orders.

95
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,066
- So if you don't like it, then you can...
- I can what? What? I can what?

96
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,652
Nathan, hey. Come on, man,
we're all waiting for you.

97
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,406
- Yeah, okay.
- Now, hold on. What you gonna say?

98
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,158
What you gonna say?

99
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,704
I got 15 years on you here. You got, what,
four years in some classroom upstate?

100
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,592
Listen, if you think I'm gonna sit here...

101
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,542
Not a good idea, Roy.
Not a good idea, man.

102
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,918
We're fine for the day.

103
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,151
Why do you let him get away with that?

104
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,801
No choice. He's the union rep.

105
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,055
I fire him and suddenly
I've got a factory full of Roys.

106
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,515
But I'll win him over, even if it kills me.

107
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,517
What about you?

108
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,366
When are they gonna offer you
that permanent gig at the restaurant?

109
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,689
- They already did.
- Dude, that's great.

110
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,940
I don't know, man.

111
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,778
I mean, they wanna send me
to the flagship restaurant in Paris...

112
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
for who knows how long?
Could be six months, could be a year.

113
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,991
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.

114
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,039
Although now I'm not so sure.

115
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,668
Well, look, if you do go to Paris,
do me a favor.

116
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,253
- What's that?
- Take Roy with you.

117
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,546
Aw, hell, no.

118
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,101
Hey, Sam.

119
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,602
You coming?

120
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,354
Yeah.

121
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,946
<i>Get ready for a new
adventure at 180 Corporate Consulting.</i>

122
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,367

<i>This weekend, a professional will guide you

126
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,170
What are those for?

127
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,925
Oh, it's, um, just something I do
to relax me. And for luck.

128
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,305
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players
at this kind of thing.

129
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,598
She's superstitious.

130
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,519
Hey, Katrina, how you doing?

131
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,940
Nah, just this stupid retreat thing
with the idiots from the office.

132
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,318
No, no, no, not you, sir. Them.

133
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,530
Hold on a sec, let me go someplace
a little more private.

134
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,575
Bald's the new black, sir.
Bald's the new black.

135
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,746
Yeah, no, hang on a sec, babe. Just
gonna head on back to my private office.

136
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,575
The right-hand side!

137
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,557
Whew.

138
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,878
Ow. Damn it.

139
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,549

Oh, whoa!

145
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,822
Whoa, what the hell?

146
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,953
- Peter, did you feel that?
- What?

147
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,914
Something's wrong.

148
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,266
Look out!

149
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,562
- Molly, come on.
- Candice.

150
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,190
- Go!
- Go, go!

151
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,860

Peter! Peter!

154
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,701
No, Candice! Aah!

155
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,999
No!

156
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,713
Peter! Come on, Peter, let's go!

157
00:13:58,922 --> 00:13:59,964
Molly, come on!

158
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,592
What the fuck?!

159
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,224
Oh, no! No! No!

160
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,102
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

161
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,954
Oh, shit!

162
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,462
Over here! See the railing?

163
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,392
You can do this. Let's go.

164
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,270
Let's go. Do it!

165
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,147
You can do it. Don't look down!

166
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,277
Good. Good.

167
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,081
Run!

168
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,500
Help me!

169
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,169
- Sam!
- Olivia!

170
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,795
Olivia!

171
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,964
- Sam!
- I'm right here. I'm right here. Okay.

172
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,257
It's coming loose!

173
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,970
- Do you feel it? All right.
- Olivia, come on.

174
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,640
It's okay, it's safe. Now you've just gotta
follow this to Molly's voice, all right?

175
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,352
Come towards me.
Come on, you're almost there! Come on.

176
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,778
Come on.

177
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,280
- Come on. Come on!
- Molly.

178
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,451
No! No!

179
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,093
- Aah!
- Olivia!

180
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,597
Sam! Wait for us!

181
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,350
Oh, my God!

182
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,601
Sam!

183
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,563
Aah! Sam, be careful!

184
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,921
Sam!

185
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,299
Peter! Hurry!

186
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,305
Sam! Sam!

187
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,268
Sam!

188
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,203
Hold on!

189
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,915
Come on, come on.

190
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,969
Sam, hold on!

191
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,104
No! Peter!

192
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,003
Ow. Damn it.

193
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,923
<i>As well as define controls and procedures.</i>

194
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,760
<i>We will help you build a culture
of corporate ethics by defining...</i>

195
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,057
<i>Dust in the wind</i>

196
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,768
<i>risk management process.</i>

197
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,523
We all gotta get off.

198
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,358
What are you talking about?

199
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,069
- The bridge is gonna collapse.
- What?

200
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,277
- We're all gonna die.
- What the hell is going on?

201
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,907
We're all gonna die
if we don't get off this bridge now!

202
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,370
Stan, relax, it's just some construction.

203
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,457
Molly, please. Please, God, follow me.

204
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,459
Open the door.

205
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:53,341
This is a major liability issue. If something
happens to them, it's on us, you get that?

206
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,343
- Yeah.
- Then go get that.

207
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,179
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, all right.

208
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,265
Hey, Sam? Molly?

209
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,350
- Peter, please, just follow.
- Come on!

210
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,602
Okay, everybody just calm down.

211
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,855
- I'm gonna go help.
- Please don't.

212
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,648
Hey, guys, come on!

213
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,025
Let's go!

214
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,069
Sam, just get back on the bus.
We can talk about it.

215
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,238
Molly, Sam, come on, guys.

216
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,789
Did he seem weird to you
when he got on the bus?

217
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,631
No, he was fine. It's like he just snapped.

218
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,499
- What's going on?
- What the hell is going on out here?

219
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,718
We should, uh...

220
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,053
Holy shit!

221
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,763
Get off the bus!

222
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,862
Come on!

223
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,760
How did you know?

224
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,312
<i>That's the big question here.</i>

225
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,773
How did you know?

226
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,609
It says right here in your statement:

227
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,363
"I saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen."

228
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,115
That sounds premeditated to me.

229
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,200
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

230
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,830
I had a vision.

231
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,791
Okay. A vision.

232
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,961
Psychic phenomena, ghosts, Bigfoot.

233
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,088
You actually believe in that stuff?

234
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,339
I don't know.

235
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,802
I'll tell you what I believe:

236
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,804
There's an answer for everything.

237
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,473
There's an answer for why
you knew to warn everyone...

238
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:09,144
the bridge was going to collapse,
and minutes later, it did.

239
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:13,606
I told you, I saw it coming.
I don't know how.

240
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,108
I just did.

241
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,820
And no one else did?

242
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,657
Like I said, it just came out of nowhere.

243
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,409
Did Sam have issues with authority?

244
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,329
Did he ever demonstrate
any sort of extremist behavior?

245
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,706
No.

246
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,960
Wait. "Extremist behavior"?

247
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,171
You mean like a terrorist?

248
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,841
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?

249
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,384
Just his girlfriend.

250
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,013
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.

251
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,058
- But that was in person.
- Molly.

252
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,268
Ex.

253
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,020
Tell me about the breakup.

254
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:56,232
Was he upset? Scale of 1 to 10.

255
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,401
It's personal.

256
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,239
You must have been pissed, right?
Getting dumped like that.

257
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,408
What does that have to do
with anything?

258
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,453
I'm just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together...

259
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,831
before I start moving them around,
making them fit.

260
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:17,379
Look, I just had a hunch that something
bad was gonna happen. That's it.

261
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,424
Excuse me.

262
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,638
Forensics came back with the analysis.

263
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,474
- And?
- They're chalking it up to high winds...

264
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,559
and structural damage
from the construction.

265
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,061
"High winds"?

266
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,271
Yeah. Send everyone home.

267
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,982
You're free to go.

268
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,742
I have a feeling
we'll be seeing each other again.

269
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,285
Call it a hunch.

270
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,838
<i>Authorities are calling
the North Bay Bridge collapse...</i>

271
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,756
<i>a freak act of nature...</i>

272
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:06,594
<i>citing a highway improvement project
that may have weakened the superstructure.</i>

273
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:10,765
<i>Among the survivors were eight employees
of Presage Paper...</i>

274
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,934
<i>on their way to a business retreat.</i>

275
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,438
<i>The other 17 employees
were killed in the collapse.</i>

276
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,482
<i>And although they've been branded
the "lucky eight"...</i>

277
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:23,820
<i>the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future.</i>

278
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:44,841
Hey, guys.

279
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,134
Hey.

280
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,385
Hey.

281
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,182
Anybody know
when this thing's supposed to start?

282
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,727
When Dennis gets here, I guess.

283
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,189
That agent still hounding you?

284
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:03,860
No. You heard the news,
it was natural causes.

285
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,196
Yeah, more like supernatural.

286
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,408
How you holding up? I tried calling.

287
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,953
No, yeah, I saw. I was just tired.

288
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,207
So?

289
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,543
How did you explain it?

290
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,714
I didn't.

291
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:26,925
I couldn't.

292
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,843
Sam, there had to be a reason.

293
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,471
Heh. That is exactly
what the agent kept saying.

294
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:39,062
Whatever answer you're looking for,
I don't have it.

295
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,564
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.

296
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,151
We should all just put it behind us
and be grateful we're still alive.

297
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,407
Definitely beats the alternative, right?

298
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,450
I look out at the faces today...

299
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,246
<i>and I see family members, friends.</i>

300
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:01,668
<i>But the people that left us on the bridge
that day, they were more than that.</i>

301
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,337
<i>People like Jennifer Alcott...</i>

302
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,924
<i>Chris Boylan...</i>

303
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,802
<i>David Buckler.</i>

304
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,055
<i>Maybe you worked next to them.</i>

305
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,932
<i>Maybe you worked for them.</i>

306
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:19,894
<i>But we all worked with them, huh?</i>

307
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,189
<i>Who can forget Trevor Winn's smile?</i>

308
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,360
<i>Or Isaac Palmer.</i>

309
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,529
Did he just say my name?

310
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,116
- That's not funny.
- I know, I'm sorry.

311
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,244
I just get weird with tragedies. I'm sorry.

312
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,414
I see dead people.

313
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,459
Guys.

314
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,178
Death...

315
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,140
doesn't like to be cheated.

316
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,100
Excuse me?

317
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:00,685
What's that supposed to mean?

318
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,485
You all just be careful now.

319
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,820
Okay. Thanks for the advice!

320
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:12,989
Creepy guy.

321
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,015
How's that foie gras, Sam? Waiting on you.

322
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:58,743
Thanks.

323
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,161
Got my dessert?

324
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,546
What's the matter with it?

325
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,965
Said it was flat. No flavor.

326
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,093
- Do they want something else?
- Yeah.

327
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,469
The check.

328
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,349
Let me taste it.

329
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,233
The customer is an asshole.
The bourguignon is good.

330
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,122
Hold on.

331
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,303
You mind if I come in?

332
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,430
Yeah. Sure.

333
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,566
Thanks.

334
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,568
I thought you'd be working tonight.

335
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,988
Yeah. You know,
I worked the first shift, but...

336
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,283
there was something else I needed to do.

337
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,582
- Can I...?
- Oh.

338
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,418
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.

339
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,348
Thank you.

340
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,101
Listen...

341
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:32,313
When everything started going down
on that bridge...

342
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,236
the only thing I thought about
was you.

343
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,364
Getting you to safety.

344
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,577
You are the only thing
I care about, Molly.

345
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,915
Whatever's wrong, I can fix it.

346
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,543
You haven't done anything wrong.

347
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,546
Then, what? What is it?

348
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,132
Paris.

349
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,842
We talked about that.

350
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:05,889
I'm not going to uproot my life,
leave you, for that job.

351
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:08,600
But it's the only thing
you've ever dreamed of.

352
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,271
Life is too short, Sam.

353
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,066
You have to go after what you love.

354
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:18,276
I am.

355
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,783
You should take the job.

356
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,995
Go to Paris.

357
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,971
- Hey.
- Hey.

358
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,598
What's the matter?

359
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,227
I don't know. I'm not ready.
I don't feel ready.

360
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,939
It's been really hard to concentrate
after everything.

361
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,274
Yeah? Are you sure?

362
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:00,235
Yeah.

363
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:03,321
Because this is the last practice
before the championship.

364
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,949
And it's your last practice
of your college career.

365
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,909
I know, but...

366
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,746
I think you got this.

367
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

368
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,752
I mean, you love it out there.

369
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,755
Okay. You're right.

370
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:23,174
And besides, coach would kill me. Heh.

371
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,926
Yeah.

372
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,219
Here.

373
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,764
Thanks.

374
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,141
Come here.

375
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:34,936
Bye.

376
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,481
You got this.

377
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:51,077
You have to get a little more speed.
You gotta hit that follow-up.

378
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,793
- I'm sore from the back extensions.
- Really?

379
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,176
Okay, seriously, this is stupid.

380
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,845
They've gotta make it cooler
or we're gonna pass out.

381
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,555
They're working on it.

382
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,807
Well, they should have it fixed by now.

383
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,875
Come on, Candice. You're up.

384
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,553
Come on, Candice. You got this.

385
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,874
Candice, now.

386
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:29,426
Really strong value on this.

387
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,605
Hey, coach! How was that?

388
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,378
I wanna see you guys
run the routine all the way through once.

389
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:24,731
- That's good.
- Whew.

390
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,940
All right, Janine next. Let's go.

391
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,444
Let's go, ladies, and drink water.

392
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,408
That's it.

393
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,869
Every time, Candice.

394
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,626
- There you go.
- Thanks.

395
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,753
Nicely done, Candice.

396
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,092
Okay, go to bars.

397
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,428
Come on. Hit the floor. You can do it.

398
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,849
Go hard this time, Candice.

399
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,185
Let's be aggressive.

400
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:07,065
Here we go, Candice. Stay loose.

401
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,693
Okay, Porter, it's your turn.

402
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,529
Stay focused.

403
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,198
Good.

404
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,039
Looking good, Candice.

405
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,875
Candice? Candice?!

406
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,377
- Oh, what happened?
- Don't touch her.

407
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,212
Someone call 911.

408
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:12,464
Candice?

409
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,653
Peter.

410
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,753
I came as soon as I heard.

411
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,050
She was doing great.

412
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:03,098
She was almost finished with her routine
and then...

413
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,107
Why did it happen?

414
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,278
This doesn't make any sense.

415
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,155
I don't know, man.

416
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,994
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Peter.

417
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,552
Let's just go, Sam.

418
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,317
Hey.

419
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,528
How's it going?

420
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,448
It's weird.

421
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:04,075
Being here, I mean.

422
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,038
It's just so quiet.

423
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:12,375
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls
rerouted to corporate.

424
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,379
Yeah, well, it's depressing.

425
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:22,886
Holy crap. Did you guys
get your bereavement pay yet?

426
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:28,683
Hey, what's he doing here?

427
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:31,895
I think he just needed the distraction.

428
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,563
Yeah.

429
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,441
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.

430
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,694
Guess we all should have seen
that coming.

431
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,323
What?

432
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:47,410
You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do.
I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.

433
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:51,039
<i>Once you've handled the e-mail...</i>

434
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,127
<i>you'll need to deactivate all the
key cards of the deceased employees.</i>

435
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,752
<i>Instructions are in your binder.</i>

436
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,255
Well, shouldn't that be the job
of the facility manager?

437
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,050
<i>The facility manager's dead.</i>

438
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,970
<i>Dennis, you want me to fly someone
up there?</i>

439
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,472
No, no, I got it.

440
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:16,314
Aw, Debbie.

441
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:24,447
You were so naughty.

442
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,629
Fuck it.

443
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:48,722
Robert, my man.

444
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,441
Ow.

445
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,361
Shit.

446
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,245
You shouldn't have, buddy.

447
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,111
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?

448
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,845
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.

449
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:32,182
So, uh, who wants one?

450
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,475
Where'd you get these?

451
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:37,771
I stole it out of Roy's truck.
Ha, ha. It's good, right? Ha, ha.

452
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,481
I got something better.

453
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,483
Ooh, nice one.

454
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:43,193
Yeah, count me in.

455
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,570
Are you sure you wanna share that?

456
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:50,784
If I don't, I'll end up drinking it alone,
which is just sad.

457
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,536
Well, this day just got way more fun.

458
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:09,010
No, I did call you.

459
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:12,806
Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?

460
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,725
Because I really do
wanna take you out again.

461
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,895
Yeah, yeah, we'll do, like, a nice
romantic dinner.

462
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,523
You know,
somewhere maybe outside the city.

463
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,024
Hold up.

464
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,530
You know what? I gotta go.

465
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:30,865
No, no, no. I'm not blowing you off.

466
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:34,703
Hey, listen. Hey, who's my girl, Kimber?

467
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,621
Amber, yes, that's what I said.

468
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,872
Excuse me.

469
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:48,883
Amber? Amber, I'm sorry, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or mi...?

470
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:53,763
Sorry about that. My, uh, sister
tends to get a little chatty sometimes.

471
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,765
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

472
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:59,894
So tell me about stress relief.

473
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:03,732
And what does this really get me?

474
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,609
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

475
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:09,112
Like massage therapy?

476
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,198
Erotic massage?

477
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:17,245
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional.

478
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,374
Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional.
In fact, you know what? I kind of demand it.

479
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:27,297
I'm just trying to clarify, though, that
this professional experience ends, uh...

480
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:30,342
happy.

481
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,388
I know exactly what you need.

482
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,599
Oh, I'm sure you do.

483
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,934
- Follow me, please.
- I'd love to.

484
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

485
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,229
Slow down there a little bit.

486
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:46,316
Yeah. Yeah, you have
a lovely little canter.

487
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,447
Yum yum, dim sum.

488
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:53,948
Hold up there a second.

489
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,618
All right, these are solid.
Just making sure.

490
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:58,995
Tend to be a bit noisy,
if you know what I mean.

491
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:07,295
Ha, ha. Yo, Buddha.
Slow down on the rice cakes.

492
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,468
- Just close your eyes.
- Mm-hm.

493
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:14,886
- Relax.
- Ooh.

494
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:19,724
And someone will be in
to service you soon.

495
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,851
Oh, yeah.

496
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:36,157
Oh, yeah.

497
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:37,659
Feels dynamite.

498
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:41,746
No, no. You're going the wrong way there,
little lady.

499
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,001
Oh.

500
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,170
Wait a second, what happened
to the younger version of you?

501
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:55,593
Okay, I'm sorry.
Do you come with subtitles?

502
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:56,886
I can help you too.

503
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,221
Maybe I should go.

504
00:43:58,471 --> 00:43:59,514
Relax.

505
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:01,975
Don't know what that means. No idea. Yep.

506
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:03,601
Ow!

507
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,853
Fuck!

508
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:06,604
Your spine is all out of alignment...

509
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:09,607
No, no, that's okay.
That's okay, I'm all right.

510
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:10,942
Holy shit, you're strong.

511
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,235
Let me help you.

512
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:13,737
What are you doing? Ow.

513
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:15,280
You're a little aggressive.

514
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,531
Breathe in...

515
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,967
What's "capay"?
I don't know what that means.

516
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,034
Breathe out...

517
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:21,661
I don't want a "foo-hay."
No "foo-hay." Aah!

518
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,002
Cheers.

519
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,421
Mm.

520
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,636
Shit, that's my ride.

521
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,430
Shit. I gotta go.

522
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,349
Leaving more for us.

523
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:52,734
All right, well, more for me.

524
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:54,069
All right, bye.

525
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:55,487
- See you later.
- Okay.

526
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:56,738
Later.

527
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:00,367
This is the end,
so, what are we toasting to?

528
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:02,327
To, uh, finding new jobs.

529
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:04,895
Because it's only a matter of time
before they shut us down.

530
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,749
- Hear, hear.
- Oh. To starting over.

531
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,546
Peter?

532
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,094
It just doesn't make sense.

533
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,055
She dies doing something
that she's done...

534
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:25,141
almost every day
for the last 15 years of her life.

535
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:28,812
She said she didn't wanna do it.

536
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,272
She said she wasn't ready.

537
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:35,819
And I should have stopped her.

538
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,456
I should have done something.
I should've...

539
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,990
Peter, there wasn't anything
you could've done.

540
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:45,161
How do you know?

541
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,293
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

542
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:05,432
Hello, Agent Block? This is Dennis.

543
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,477
Yeah, Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know what.

544
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,104
Does that mean anything?

545
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,648
You told me to call if I saw anything odd.

546
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:19,362
I don't know yet, but thank you, Dennis,
and call me if you see anything strange.

547
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:20,947
Stranger.

548
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:25,452
Should we maybe have code names
for one another, do you think?

549
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,039
Over and out.

550
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:33,209
All right, ahem,
show me how this happened.

551
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:35,587
I don't think I can.

552
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:37,339
What do you mean?

553
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:43,136
I mean, I could try it a hundred times and
never re-create exactly what happened here.

554
00:46:44,554 --> 00:46:46,097
This is some freaky shit.

555
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,109
God!

556
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,741
Oh, that actually felt great.

557
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:06,826
We're not done yet, fat boy.

558
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:10,121
Oh, yeah. Awesome.

559
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:13,083
Oh...

560
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,128
Wait. Are those things even sterilized?

561
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:20,632
No, no. I'm not catching any diseases
unless I've earned them.

562
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:31,101
Wait a second. You understood that.

563
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:34,229
You speak English.

564
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:38,525
Oh.

565
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,195
Of course I understand you.

566
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:45,156
You think I'm stupid?
I'm just pretending I don't understand.

567
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,533
All right, you know what?

568
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:49,619
Let's do this.
Two billion people can't be Wong.

569
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:52,580
I said Wong. You follow me?

570
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,124
You get it, you're Chinese.

571
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,922
Ow, ow. Okay, it's in. It's definitely in.
Ow, okay, yes, it is in.

572
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,314
How many of these are you gonna
put in me?

573
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,942
Oh, uh, hey,
can you grab that for me? Thanks.

574
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:22,861
No phone calls during the treatment.

575
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:24,446
Hey.

576
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,825
That's not very nice, you know.

577
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:31,745
Now, this needle will help you grow
hair on your head.

578
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:42,088
Now, sleep for 30 minutes
and you'll feel real good.

579
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:44,132
Okay, your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes.

580
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,943
I'm not gonna lie, it's a little annoying.

581
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:48,007
Now, sleep for 30 minutes
and you'll feel real good.

582
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:50,738
Once again, Chinese lady,
I don't have a clue what you're saying.

583
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:54,100
Thirty minutes. You sleep.

584
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:06,821
Sleep.

585
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:34,891
Oh.

586
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,937
Hey! Fire!

587
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:40,980
Hello?!

588
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:42,232
Hey!

589
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,068
Hey! Hey!

590
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:47,654
Hey, there's a fire in here!

591
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,739
Hey, there's a fire!

592
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:51,825
Get in here!

593
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:56,139
Oh, shit.

594
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,453
- You should come with me.

595
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:20,121
To Paris?

596
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,958
Yeah, you know, you said it yourself.
Like, you're gonna have to start over.

597
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:26,836
Start over with me.

598
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:31,049
How many drinks have you had?

599
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:34,177
Enough. Molly, I'm serious.

600
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:38,515
Look, you were right.
If I don't take the job, I'll regret it.

601
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:41,726
But I'm not willing to lose you.

602
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:44,479
Why does it have to be
one or the other?

603
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:46,856
I'm better when you're with me.

604
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:51,695
Uh, guys, you're not gonna believe this.

605
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,726
They're saying it was a freak accident.

606
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,962
Yeah, raise your hand
if you believe that.

607
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,340
Who dies during a massage? Seriously.

608
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,592
First Candice, now Isaac.

609
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,636
It can't be a coincidence.

610
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:18,555
It's not.

611
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:20,473
Where are you going?

612
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:23,268
It's that creepy dude.

613
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:26,271
Why are you following us?

614
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,565
Who are you?

615
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:33,445
You were at the cemetery,
then the gym, now here.

616
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:35,822
What are you doing?

617
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,741
My job.

618
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,877
What's happening to us?

619
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:55,008
What makes you think I know anything?

620
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:56,384
You warned us.

621
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,888
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.

622
00:53:00,096 --> 00:53:03,099
It's just that I've seen this before.

623
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,060
You've seen what?

624
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,562
A lucky few survive a disaster.

625
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:12,859
And then one by one,
Death comes for them all.

626
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:16,780
You changed things on that bridge.

627
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:22,035
There's a wrinkle in reality.
And that wrinkle is you.

628
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:24,621
So, what, we're doomed to die?

629
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:26,623
I mean, is that it?

630
00:53:26,998 --> 00:53:30,377
We just got our lives back,
so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?

631
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:32,253
Are you saying that we can't stop this?

632
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:35,215
You were supposed to die on that bridge.

633
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,801
You're not supposed to be here.

634
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,303
You shorted Death.

635
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:43,264
So you let Death
have somebody else in your place...

636
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:46,434
and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living.

637
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:50,438
All the days and years
that they have yet to live.

638
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:54,192
And they take your place in death.

639
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:55,944
Then the books are balanced.

640
00:53:56,152 --> 00:54:01,074
Wait a minute. We kill someone, we get
their life? Is that what you're telling me?

641
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:03,535
I don't make the rules.

642
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:09,791
I just clean up after the game is over.

643
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:24,681
Maybe that's why
Candice and Isaac are dead.

644
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:28,351
They weren't supposed to survive,
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

645
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,395
No.

646
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:32,605
No, not all of us.

647
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,066
Molly made it, she didn't die.

648
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:36,609
What?

649
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:42,157
Well, when I had that vision,
or premonition, or whatever it was...

650
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:46,494
I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

651
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:47,829
You survived.

652
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:50,165
You saved her?

653
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:54,002
Why, because you decided that she
deserved to live more than the rest of us?

654
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,971
That's not what he's saying. I don't
deserve to live more than anyone.

655
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:58,798
You deserve to live
more than Candice.

656
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,133
Whoa, Peter, hang on.

657
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:02,677
No, look, guys, come on.

658
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,804
You're not drinking the Kool-Aid,
are you?

659
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:08,224
Killing people
to survive Death's list. Really?

660
00:55:09,392 --> 00:55:13,104
I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what that guy's selling.

661
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:16,316
Yeah? What else is it, then?

662
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,322
Shit.

663
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,907
We need to tell Olivia.

664
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:25,867
Come on.

665
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:31,414
My forms are all signed.

666
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:34,876
I see that it's been quite a while
since your first consultation.

667
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:37,420
What made you decide
to take the leap today?

668
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:41,800
Uh, well, a lot is going on in my life...

669
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:45,178
and I just don't wanna miss anything...

670
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:46,638
you know, important.

671
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:48,473
Same reason I had it done myself.

672
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:52,769
- Come on in back. Let's get you started.
- Okay.

673
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:54,896
Oh.

674
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:02,320
Yep, that's the first step.
You'll never need those again.

675
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:08,159
Here we are. Come on in.

676
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:20,755
What's with these?

677
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,551
Oh, just for some of
our younger patients.

678
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,723
And, um, sometimes our older ones too.
Come on.

679
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:41,901
What was that?

680
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,653
Relax.

681
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:46,656
You know, it looks a lot worse
than it really is.

682
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:51,161
Okay, I'm gently going to
position your head...

683
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:54,414
and I want you to tell me...

684
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,375
when this feels snug.

685
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:58,960
I can't move my head.

686
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:02,005
Perfect. Just what we want.

687
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,884
There we go.

688
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:09,721
Okay, now comes the fun part.
Here comes a drop.

689
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:14,267
And you will feel a little numbness
in your eye...

690
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:15,935
which is a good thing.

691
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:33,286
Deep breath.

692
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,334
Relax.

693
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:47,175
Very good.

694
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:55,058
Thattagirl.

695
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,694
There.

696
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:08,655
That's not so bad, is it?

697
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,252
Looks good.

698
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,679
- What was that?
- Just relax, Olivia.

699
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:35,348
I'm just gonna enter some data into...

700
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:40,854
Dottie!

701
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,565
Dot...

702
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:46,401
Do you know what?
My assistant's given me an incomplete file.

703
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:48,361
I'll be right back.

704
00:58:50,238 --> 00:58:52,449
Hold on, you're leaving?!

705
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:25,815
Is that supposed to be happening?!

706
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:07,357
Help me!

707
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,954
Olivia Castle. Where is she?

708
01:00:21,162 --> 01:00:22,247
She might be in danger.

709
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:24,791
She's fine.
We do this kind of procedure all the time.

710
01:00:32,882 --> 01:00:35,051
Help me!

711
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,345
Help me!

712
01:00:55,822 --> 01:00:57,615
This has never happened before.

713
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:04,039
Sam.

714
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,417
Stay with me tonight, please.

715
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,378
Of course.

716
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:17,260
Five different systems had to go wrong...

717
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:21,306
for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly. Five.

718
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:23,224
What do you want from us?

719
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,685
I want you to tell me
what you think is going on.

720
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:28,563
Two deaths? Okay, all right.
That's a coincidence.

721
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,649
Three? That's a pattern.

722
01:01:44,662 --> 01:01:46,122
Now...

723
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:49,125
I know you two didn't do this.

724
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:51,628
All right?

725
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,423
But I think you know something.

726
01:01:58,093 --> 01:01:59,260
What is it?

727
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:03,807
We don't know anything.

728
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:06,685
Take a guess.

729
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:16,027
We think we weren't supposed to survive
on that bridge.

730
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:18,405
What?

731
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:23,368
And now something
is trying to set it right.

732
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:26,621
"Something"?

733
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:29,958
That's all you got?

734
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:31,418
Right now, yeah.

735
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:37,048
But if you come up
with any other explanations, let us know.

736
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:41,845
Thank you.

737
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,853
"Something."

738
01:02:58,778 --> 01:02:59,946
Hey.

739
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:03,366
Been up long?

740
01:03:05,493 --> 01:03:10,165
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
I just kept thinking about the bridge.

741
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,796
Sam, you can't do this to yourself.

742
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,967
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about,
in the premonition...

743
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:25,889
we all got off the bus,
but the ground gave way and Candice fell.

744
01:03:27,223 --> 01:03:29,017
Then the bus tipped over.

745
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:33,146
And Isaac, he never got off the bus.
He went with it.

746
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:34,689
What are you getting at?

747
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:38,026
I know that there was just
so much going on...

748
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:41,905
Look, I know that I helped you across.

749
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:45,241
Then I reached back for Olivia.

750
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:48,203
But she didn't make it. She fell.

751
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:53,416
So first was Candice.

752
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:57,337
Then Isaac.

753
01:03:58,672 --> 01:03:59,714
Then Olivia.

754
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:03,051
They're dying in order.

755
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:06,054
Who dies after Olivia?

756
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:44,092
<i>Roy, would you come
to the control room, please?</i>

757
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,012
Uh-oh, Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.

758
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,780
Okay, schoolboy,
what do you wanna talk to me about?

759
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,742
- What is with your timecard?
- Let's talk about my timecard.

760
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,369
You cut my hours,
which means you cut my pay!

761
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:12,738
I cut everyone's hours, okay?

762
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:16,032
Corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over.

763
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,126
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.

764
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,837
- My dumb kid ain't operating at 50 percent.
- Roy.

765
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:24,090
My ex-wife, she's taking 50 percent,
so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

766
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:25,383
No, we gotta move, man.

767
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:28,887
- Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Hey!
- Look, we gotta move! Gotta move!

768
01:05:29,095 --> 01:05:30,388
We gotta move now!

769
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,734
Roy! You okay down there?

770
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,948
- Hey, Dennis?
- Hey.

771
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:53,036
They're closing us down.

772
01:05:53,244 --> 01:05:54,524
They're shutting down the plant?

773
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:58,958
Not the plant, just us.
Just sales and administration.

774
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,794
Can you believe it? Us?

775
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:03,129
It's the factory guys
that usually get laid off.

776
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:04,839
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.

777
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,384
Yeah, Dennis, we got bigger problems.

778
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:10,011
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

779
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:12,055
Who's Isaac?

780
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:15,350
Isaac Palmer, tech support.

781
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:17,644
Wasn't he dead already?

782
01:06:17,852 --> 01:06:19,187
No, Dennis.

783
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:24,734
Listen, it's going to happen to us too
if we don't do something about it.

784
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,655
Yeah, I understand.
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.

785
01:06:28,863 --> 01:06:32,909
No. No, guilt doesn't kill you.

786
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:35,036
Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.

787
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:37,038
I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.

788
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,040
Anyone could be next.

789
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:41,835
It could be you. Understand?

790
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:43,461
Nobody's safe.

791
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,213
What are you talking about?

792
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:50,176
We weren't supposed to survive
that bridge collapse.

793
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:53,263
And so now it's kill or be killed.

794
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:56,016
You get that, Dennis?

795
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,143
Whatever.

796
01:06:58,351 --> 01:07:01,187
I warned you.
Do whatever you wanna do.

797
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,735
I will.

798
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:13,783
Hey, Agent Block, it's Dennis. Um...

799
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:17,871
Listen, Pete just came in here
and he's just completely lost it.

800
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,915
He's yelling about "kill or be killed."

801
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:24,044
Oh, yeah,
it definitely sounded like a threat.

802
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:42,062
What happened?

803
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:45,148
I don't know. I don't know.
It just happened so fast.

804
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:48,026
- Nathan. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

805
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:51,905
- We heard, and we thought...
- No. No, uh, I'm good.

806
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:54,282
Did you kill him?

807
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:55,742
What?

808
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:58,495
No. No, I just...

809
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:01,539
It was just timing, you know?
He got in the way and...

810
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:02,999
No, you did, didn't you?

811
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:06,544
You saw it coming, and then you took
his life. You put him in the way.

812
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,338
No, I didn't really do anything.

813
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:11,341
- Tell us the truth: Did you or didn't you?
- Hey, Peter, calm down.

814
01:08:11,549 --> 01:08:12,926
Did you or didn't you?

815
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:17,805
Did you or didn't you?

816
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:21,643
Yes. I think I did.

817
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:23,728
I killed him.

818
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:27,774
So if the theory works,
then you traded spots.

819
01:08:27,982 --> 01:08:31,653
He should have your death,
and you should have his years.

820
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:33,654
How do we know for sure?

821
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:35,740
I think there's an order to these deaths.

822
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:40,078
They mirror the order everyone died in
on the bridge.

823
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,037
Then who would be next?

824
01:08:43,915 --> 01:08:46,167
Who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened?

825
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:47,627
Who is it, Sam?

826
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:48,877
Who's what?

827
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:56,678
Dennis! It was Dennis.

828
01:08:57,136 --> 01:08:59,096
No shit.

829
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,890
Jesus.

830
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:06,938
Why are you fighting me on this?

831
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,482
You're not seriously going to work,
are you?

832
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:13,944
Molly, Isaac died on a massage table.

833
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:16,794
If Death is gonna come for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.

834
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,700
You have to do something.

835
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:21,618
- What, kill someone so I can live?
- No, of course not.

836
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,497
We'll just have to
figure something else out.

837
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:26,750
I have figured it out.

838
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,170
Something saved me on that bridge.

839
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:32,212
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.

840
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:35,966
Maybe.

841
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:39,054
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.

842
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:45,685
So if it happens tomorrow,
or 50 years from now, whatever.

843
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:48,104
As long as we're together...

844
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:50,564
I'll be okay.

845
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:56,071
Right? Why don't you come by
after my shift...

846
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,365
and I'll make you
a nice late dinner, okay?

847
01:10:07,123 --> 01:10:08,500
All right, give me this.

848
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,678
Excuse me.
We don't have to wait for them, do we?

849
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:22,138
- I'll let you know.
- Okay, thank you.

850
01:10:37,904 --> 01:10:39,322
Veal's ready, take it out.

851
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,574
Samuel. Get to work on the bourguignon.

852
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,167
Whoa.

853
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:52,627
Pan coming through.

854
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:55,922
Whoa, watch yourself.

855
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:09,019
- Okay. Meat's in. Pick it up, eh?
- Yes, sir.

856
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,489
Whoa.

857
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:23,533
That could've been ugly, huh? Ha, ha.

858
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:26,369
Yeah. Could've been.

859
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,792
Vincent, speed it up, okay?

860
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,343
Whoa, hey!

861
01:12:04,991 --> 01:12:06,993
Hey, clean that grate.

862
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,421
- Just met your girlfriend.
- Oh.

863
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,549
Are you sure it's okay
if I make her a little something?

864
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:24,177
Make sure to clean up afterward.

865
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:27,138
I will, of course. Thank you.

866
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:29,724
And, chef...

867
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,228
The apprenticeship.

868
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:35,897
If the offer still stands...

869
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:37,440
I'd like to take it.

870
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,610
It's yours.

871
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:56,751
Okay, no more suspense.

872
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:00,630
What you've been waiting for.

873
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,801
Wow. You're gonna help me
with this, right?

874
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,428
Yeah, sure, if you want me to...

875
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:08,138
No? You don't want me to...?

876
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,098
So how's your French?

877
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:12,767
Heh. Terrible.

878
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:16,604
Oh, good. Well, then,
we can be terrible together.

879
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:19,983
- Why?
- I took the internship.

880
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:24,112
What? Sam, that's amazing.

881
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,284
I'm so proud of you.

882
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:49,179
- Peter.
- Hey.

883
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:53,975
You okay, man?
You look a little, uh, upset.

884
01:13:54,184 --> 01:13:58,146
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a rough couple days.

885
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:01,524
Yeah. Yeah, for everyone.

886
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,361
For some more than others.

887
01:14:05,153 --> 01:14:06,529
Do you mind if I come in?

888
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:09,074
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, come in.

889
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:16,206
Here, have a seat.

890
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:18,666
Thanks.

891
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:24,089
Hey, Peter.

892
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:27,050
Hi, Molly.

893
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:45,652
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?
I can make you up some pasta.

894
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:49,781
Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm good.
Uh, thank you.

895
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:53,076
Uh, I'm sorry. I just thought...

896
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:55,870
It's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.

897
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:58,915
Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.

898
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,751
Uh...

899
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,712
Still alive, I mean.

900
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,255
I'm next to go, right?

901
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,258
It's me and then you, isn't it?

902
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:15,890
Anyways, uh, I was up all last night,
you know...

903
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:19,269
thinking about if I could really do it.

904
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:23,648
- Do what?
- Take someone else's life.

905
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:29,112
If I could actually kill some stranger,
replace their life with my own.

906
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:31,948
And I thought about it.

907
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:34,784
And I convinced myself that...

908
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:37,662
yeah, I could.

909
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,709
<i>So I went on a walk.</i>

910
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:45,587
<i>You know, nowhere in particular...</i>

911
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:48,675
<i>but every couple of minutes,
an opportunity would just present itself.</i>

912
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,634
<i>Heh. Like clockwork.</i>

913
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:55,138
<i>I could just grab somebody
and pull them into an alley.</i>

914
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:59,309
Or just shove somebody off a curb
into traffic.

915
01:16:00,101 --> 01:16:01,519
<i>You know?</i>

916
01:16:02,354 --> 01:16:03,646
<i>It'd be real easy.</i>

917
01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:08,943
Peter, what did you do?

918
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:19,079
- Did you...?
- No, I didn't.

919
01:16:21,998 --> 01:16:24,000
<i>I couldn't.</i>

920
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:26,002
<i>I realized that...</i>

921
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:29,130
I couldn't kill somebody
that didn't deserve to die.

922
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:34,928
And I thought about Candice,
and I thought, "Wait a minute."

923
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,848
Candice didn't deserve to die.

924
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:43,603
Olivia didn't. Dennis didn't.

925
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:45,980
"I don't."

926
01:16:47,857 --> 01:16:49,192
Do I?

927
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:51,569
No, of course you don't.

928
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:55,949
Well...

929
01:16:57,117 --> 01:17:03,206
none of us deserve to die,
then why is it...

930
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:07,502
that you deserve to live, Molly?

931
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:10,714
You said it yourself...

932
01:17:11,881 --> 01:17:13,049
you don't.

933
01:17:18,763 --> 01:17:20,181
Go!

934
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:25,478
Repeat, shots fired.
Requesting backup. 1026 Washington.

935
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:29,607
Hide and I'll distract him.
When you can, go.

936
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:33,194
Not done yet, Sam.

937
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,157
Where is she?

938
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,954
- Where is she?!
- I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.

939
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:44,956
You're gonna have to kill me first.

940
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:47,292
Well, that doesn't do me any good.
Heh, heh.

941
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,710
Death's after you too.

942
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:51,254
This is crazy, Peter. Don't do this.

943
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:56,009
Just think for a minute, all right?

944
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:57,802
You are not a killer.

945
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:00,805
I don't wanna kill anybody, Sam.

946
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:05,352
I don't wanna die yet either.

947
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:14,611
Heh. It's not your time yet.

948
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,789
Don't worry, Molly...

949
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:29,501
I didn't kill him.

950
01:18:31,961 --> 01:18:35,632
But I didn't need to, Molly...

951
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:40,804
because Death
is gonna do that for me.

952
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:43,640
Doesn't mean I can't help it.

953
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:47,310
That's it.

954
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:32,230
- Are you okay? What's going on?
- It's Peter. He has a gun.

955
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:39,195
Oh, my God.

956
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,284
You killed him.

957
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,168
It's Sam's turn.

958
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:01,718
Peter, just go.

959
01:20:02,093 --> 01:20:05,305
You have Block's life, you're safe now.

960
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:07,640
Please.

961
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,726
I'm sorry, Molly.

962
01:20:11,936 --> 01:20:14,689
But you just witnessed the murder
of a federal agent.

963
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,863
And I'm not gonna spend
the life I just earned in prison.

964
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:35,919
Molly, go! Go get help!

965
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:06,116
You son of a bitch!

966
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:47,365
Tell Candice I love her.

967
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:48,783
Peter.

968
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:17,896
It's gone. You killed him.

969
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:20,523
So does that mean I get Block's life?

970
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:27,030
Yeah.

971
01:22:27,697 --> 01:22:29,616
I guess I do.

972
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,110
Do you mind if I take the window seat?

973
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:50,512
- You're gonna make me sit in the middle?
- Uh-huh.

974
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,847
- I'm like twice your size.
- Not really.

975
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,016
- All right.
- Sit down.

976
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:57,519
- I'll remove him.
- Fuck you. I'll remove myself.

977
01:22:57,727 --> 01:22:58,853
Get off him!

978
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:00,313
Settle down!

979
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:03,358
- Come on, Browning! Come on, you punk!
- Get off the plane!

980
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:05,985
Get off the plane. You don't understand!

981
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:07,904
Everybody just stay where you are.

982
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:13,785
- What's all that about?
- I have no idea.

983
01:23:13,993 --> 01:23:17,038
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be pulling away from the gate as...</i>

984
01:23:23,211 --> 01:23:24,295
Here we go.

985
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:27,007
<i>The cabin lights
have been dimmed for takeoff.</i>

986
01:24:11,926 --> 01:24:13,136
Sorry about that.

987
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:17,724
Oh, excuse me.

988
01:24:17,932 --> 01:24:22,562
Those passengers who got off the plane
earlier, what was that all about?

989
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,440
A kid had
a panic attack and wanted off the plane.

990
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,692
Said he had some kind of vision.

991
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:29,903
No.

992
01:24:31,988 --> 01:24:33,114
Oh, my God!

993
01:24:38,036 --> 01:24:39,079
Sam.

994
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:08,858
I got you!

995
01:25:11,027 --> 01:25:13,988
- Sam!
- Molly, hold on!

996
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:16,574
No!

997
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,328
No!

998
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:46,187
Nice of you to come, Nathan.

999
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,648
I know Roy
wasn't the easiest guy to work with.

1000
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:51,067
You know.

1001
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:53,361
I still can't believe he's gone, though.

1002
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,989
Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.

1003
01:25:56,197 --> 01:25:57,449
I guess it was for the best.

1004
01:25:58,867 --> 01:25:59,909
What do you mean?

1005
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:03,246
Company did an autopsy
for insurance purposes.

1006
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:06,499
Turns out Roy had an enlarged
blood vessel in his brain so big...

1007
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,919
it was about to burst.
They said he'd be dead any day now.

1008
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:14,257
Any day?

1009
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:16,217
Life's a bitch.

1010
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:01,806
<i>You all just be careful now.</i>
