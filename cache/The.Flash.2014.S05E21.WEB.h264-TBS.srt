00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,708
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,518
My time on this earth
is coming to an end.

3
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,972
You're part of something different now.

4
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:10,644
Part of a negative force.
Pain racing through your mind.

5
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:12,146
Thawne really got her.

6
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:13,414
Her lightning. It was red.

7
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,316
- Renée Adler.
- Sherloque Wells.

8
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:17,416
You're a meta.

9
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,027
You're from the future.

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,297
- The mission can succeed.
- What mission?

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,390
To kill every last meta-human.

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,763
Cicada's dagger can dampen powers.

13
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,662
If anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

14
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:29,797
it's this air gun.

15
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:31,398
Cicada has a lethal virus.

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,928
She stole the atomizer so
she could spread the virus.

17
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,403
Cicada is gonna kill every
meta-human in the city.

18
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:05,199
15 years, Thawne.

19
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:11,205
Tell me, how's it feel to know
you're about to become extinct?

20
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:14,408
I guess time will tell.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,912
I'm gonna miss the hell out of you.

22
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:22,883
Especially our rehabilitation time.

23
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:26,020
How about a taste of what's to come?

24
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,375
Ironic, isn't it?

25
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:51,045
The same thing that
gives you your powers

26
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,980
is gonna end you.

27
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:55,983
It's time.

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,229

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

29
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:24,078
We need to stop this
plague from spreading.

30
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,114
We will.

31
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:32,519
We can't just purge the
meta-humans in this city.

32
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,756
We need to wipe every one of them

33
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:38,359
off the face of the planet.

34
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,060
We will.

35
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:44,531
You need to promise me
this will work, Gracie.

36
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,001
I said it will.

37
00:02:56,045 --> 00:03:00,648
It's time we finish this, Gracie.

38
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:07,721
It's time to ensure our legacy.

39
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:23,270
Here's what we know
about the cryoatomizer.

40
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:25,105
Tannhauser originally t developed it

41
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:27,641
to combat land fires caused by droughts.

42
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,977
So the cryoatomizer can
disperse cold air particles

43
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,179
into the atmosphere
that triggers rainfall.

44
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:35,549
However, if Cicada can
replace the cold particles

45
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:38,757
with the cure prototypes
she stole from Cisco...

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,255
Which doesn't cure so much as it kills.

47
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,091
She could infect the entire city.

48
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,859
And every meta-human in it.

49
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:56,937
Not great but this dark cloud
does have a silver lining.

50
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,306
Which is if Cicada had everything

51
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:02,576
that she needs to carry out her plan...

52
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:04,278
would've already done so.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,542
He's right.

54
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,881
She must be missing something
or else we'd be done.

55
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,316
Yeah, but not for long.

56
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:10,651
She's not gonna waste any time.

57
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,119
Whatever it is that she needs,

58
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,761
she's out there looking
for it right now.

59
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:15,389
Well, then we move right away.

60
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,925
We get the cure to everyone who
needs it as soon as possible.

61
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:20,928
So we just up and release
some game-changing wonder drug?

62
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,597
We tested it. We know it works.

63
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,567
People need a choice now more than ever.

64
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,336
Do we have enough for the cure?

65
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:30,671
Not nearly enough.

66
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,372
Caitlin, how fast can you make more?

67
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:33,807
Guess we'll find out.

68
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,542
Okay, okay, good.

69
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:38,779
Now we just need to find
someplace to distribute it.

70
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:42,049
Well, what about CCPD?

71
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,685
It's public. Everybody
feels safe going there.

72
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,787
Yeah but gathering that
many metas in one place

73
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,089
is gonna make it one big target, right?

74
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:51,158
Cicada has the virus and the atomizer.

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,660
That makes every meta
everywhere a target.

76
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,095
Well, how about this?

77
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:58,198
You guys make up as much
of the cure as you can

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,715
and Cecile and I will talk to Singh.

79
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,535
- Yeah.
- All right.

80
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,604
I'm going to warn Renée.

81
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:04,938
Yeah.

82
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,476
All right, let's track Cicada too.

83
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,478
Get ready to face her when we find her.

84
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,447
Let's take it one step at a time.

85
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,815
Follow me.

86
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:22,222
- Is that the satellite core?
- That's right.

87
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:23,991
The reflective panels on the mirror gun

88
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:25,959
aren't the only thing we
got from the satellite.

89
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:29,963
We also have the core
and, of course, the dagger.

90
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,865
So they're all composed

91
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,834
of the exact same alloy and contain

92
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,602
- the same dark matter levels?
- Yup.

93
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,271
So if the Mirror Gun works on the core,

94
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,773
then it should work on Cicada's dagger.

95
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,810
Only one way to know for sure.

96
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:50,083
You might wanna step back.

97
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,009
I mean, you don't know
what this gun's gonna do.

98
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,752
I mean, we shouldn't be firing
this in such a small space

99
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,390
but what's life if you
don't pull down your shorts

100
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:57,858
and slide on the icery once in awhile?

101
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,827
- Here we go!
- Hm.

102
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:04,731
Um...

103
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,780
Is something supposed to happen or...

104
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,507
Where did it go?

105
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,676
It doesn't matter.

106
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:17,110
This thing works.

107
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,946
It works!

108
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:21,815
We can finally destroy Cicada's dagger.

109
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,517
If we do that, we have our powers.

110
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,352
And we can stop her.

111
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:29,089
N... Nora, are you okay?

112
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,591
Yeah, why?

113
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:34,975
Nora, earlier today you had
red lightning like Thawne's.

114
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,665
We want to make sure you're
okay to get out there.

115
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,634
I'm fine, okay?

116
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,714
Caitlin ran every test in the book.

117
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:45,305
My lightning's back to its normal color.

118
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:47,507
And besides, Thawne's Speed Force

119
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,576
is fueled by negative emotions,

120
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,713
and right now I feel
pretty dang positive.

121
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:55,949
Okay. We're your parents.
It's our job to worry.

122
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:59,553
The only one that should
be worrying is Cicada II.

123
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:05,425
You want me to open
the doors to the CCPD

124
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:06,960
to every meta in this city?

125
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:09,730
David, these people need our protection.

126
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,776
And not all metas are criminals.

127
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:15,994
You know, some of them are
doctors and students and cops.

128
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:18,772
I know but this is a police
station, not a clinic.

129
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:20,475
S.T.A.R. Labs says that the cure is safe

130
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:22,943
and it's as easy to give as a flu shot.

131
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,712
Well, S.T.A.R. Labs
isn't exactly the FDA.

132
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:28,215
Look, we have to do it here.

133
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:31,518
Red tape alone, it would take
weeks at a medical facility.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,321
If we do nothing, there's
a whole bunch of citizens

135
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,990
who could've been saved
that will die on our watch.

136
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,825
I'm not having that.

137
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:45,065
Well, you clearly believe in this.

138
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:48,523
So I'm willing to as well.

139
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,504
But that means there's going to be

140
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,539
a lot of political navigating.

141
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,876
So I'll go down to city hall
and brief them in the morning.

142
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:58,946
While I'm away, you're in charge.

143
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,494
Oh!

144
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:17,230
Sherloque, you scared me to death.

145
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:19,266
Well, I apologize.

146
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:22,269
But when you don't answer
my many emoticon pictograms,

147
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,304
no, I fear the worst, huh?

148
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:28,175
I was in the library. What
could've happened to me?

149
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:30,577
Stacks collapse. Livid librarian.

150
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,579
- Really?
- Death by Dewey Decimals?

151
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,167
Yeah, life lost by late fees?

152
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,083
- Ha-ha! There you go.
- Yeah. Oh.

153
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:37,451
Shall we?

154
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:39,686
I'm sorry I didn't...
I didn't check my texts.

155
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,221
I mean, well, actually I haven't checked

156
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:42,389
my phone all day, so...

157
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:43,557
And yet the average person

158
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,030
checks their phone 110 times a day.

159
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,428
- That's not true.
- That is true. Look it up.

160
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,365
Well, also the library's
right next to the tech lab.

161
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,867
So, you know, I get
terrible reception in there.

162
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,435
And yet that built a cell phone tower

163
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,204
less than a mile away.

164
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:59,105
Hasn't made a difference.

165
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,758
I don't know, maybe
my phone's just crap.

166
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,944
Or maybe you don't want to respond

167
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:07,514
because then you would
have to discuss your secret.

168
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:10,275
- My secret?
- Yes, your secret.

169
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,162
Run. Run!

170
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,064
What?

171
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,669
It's Sherloque. Cicada's at CCU.

172
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:41,581
So at Jitters, I saw you open
the door without touching it.

173
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,751
I know you have powers. What are they?

174
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:48,922
That.

175
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,492
I see you too.

176
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,465
Are you okay?

177
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,400
I think so.

178
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,876
Nora.

179
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:43,820
Hey, you find anything?

180
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,756
Confirmation that She-cada

181
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,557
hasn't stolen everything she needs.

182
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,792
So we have some time.

183
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:50,452
Finally some good news.

184
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:54,531
Except what she did steal was
a Quantum Tunnel Converter.

185
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,401
The first working prototype of its kind.

186
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:00,504
Yeah, that's the same face
Cisco made when he heard.

187
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,905
The converter can transform

188
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:03,940
dark matter energy to practical energy.

189
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:07,411
Cicada's gonna use her dagger
to superpower the atomizer.

190
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,379
If she wants to connect
it to the atomizer,

191
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:11,481
the last piece she'll
need is a hyper-conduit,

192
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,355
and those are pretty hard
to come by, to say the least.

193
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:17,421
She'll be lucky to locate
one in the CC area at all.

194
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,623
Well, we better find it first.

195
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,692
We'll get to it.

196
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,895
Thank you.

197
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:29,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, small sips, huh?

198
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:32,793
The second she saw
me, she wanted me dead.

199
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,479
She tried to kill me, Sherloque.

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,950
Because of what you are.

201
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:38,842
A magnokinetic meta-human!

202
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:41,217
That was something, your powers, huh?

203
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,698
I wanted to tell you, but...

204
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,326
I didn't know what you'd think.

205
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:52,023
I think...

206
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:54,027
The world of you.

207
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,000
Nothing is ever going to change that.

208
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,941
Do you think Cicada's
gonna come back again

209
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:10,144
to try to find me? To try again?

210
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,100
Yes. I don't think she'll stop.

211
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:15,421
What am I gonna do?

212
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,357
Well, you know what?

213
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,975
I believe I can help you with that.

214
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:24,557
Hey.

215
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,594
- Hey.
- Guys okay?

216
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:29,783
Yeah, uh, I need to tell you something.

217
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,519
When we were running over here,

218
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:33,124
I connected to Grace's mind again.

219
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,160
I could see through her eyes.

220
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,003
Wait, like the same thing you did

221
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,740
when Cicada attacked Alice
Bolan's birthday party?

222
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,187
Yeah, we must still be
psychically connected

223
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,211
from when I was in Grace's mindscape.

224
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,914
That's what caused the red lightning.

225
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,147
The anger that you
felt, it wasn't yours.

226
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,082
It was hers.

227
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:52,585
We can use this.

228
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:55,421
If I can see where she
is just for a second,

229
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:56,957
we can run to her.

230
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,469
Guy, this is the key
to stopping Cicada II.

231
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,105
No.

232
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:04,092
No, Nora, it's too dangerous.

233
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:05,327
We don't even know

234
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,794
- what the side effects are.
- No.

235
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:08,191
We just got the stuff out of you.

236
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,447
We're not risking
exposing you to that again.

237
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,116
Mom, I want to do this.

238
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:14,427
We'll find another way.

239
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,119
We'll find another way.

240
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:25,680
The dizziness should subside shortly.

241
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,387
Make sure he gets lots of rest.

242
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,757
Hey, we know you're feeling anxious.

243
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,492
But I promise you're safe now.

244
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:33,027
Head out that way.

245
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,729
I'm gonna go see if there's anyone else.

246
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,731
Should we reopen the Cicada tip line?

247
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,333
And Dupree's asking where you
want the security checkpoints.

248
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,735
Uh, yeah.

249
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,673
Uh, yes. Open it and,
uh, checkpoints should be

250
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:48,609
two blocks on either side of the CCPD.

251
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:49,910
Okay?

252
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,414
Uh, actually, three... three blocks.

253
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,648
Hey, you. You good?

254
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,618
Yeah, yeah. I'm good. Look.

255
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,620
They are airing Iris' story again.

256
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,422
New updates on the meta-human

257
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,291
serial killer Cicada,
who recently attacked

258
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:05,893
Central City University.

259
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,628
Now in response to these attacks,

260
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,032
The Central City Citizen
reports that CCPD,

261
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,167
in conjunction with S.T.A.R. Labs,

262
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,337
is offering a groundbreaking
meta-human cure,

263
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,205
entirely free of cost.

264
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:22,753
Maybe I should call the
night shift in earlier.

265
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,722
Oh, my God.

266
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,313
Or not.

267
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:31,552
Joe, I just felt a huge wave of panic.

268
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,194
We're about to get slammed in here.

269
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,903
Everyone, please be
patient. We'll get to you.

270
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,137
Far enough.

271
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,641
Okay.

272
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,777
Stagg, Mercury, Ivo.

273
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,312
None of them have a hyper-conduit

274
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,748
compatible with the
converter Cicada stole.

275
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,550
You know, now that I've
actually experienced

276
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:03,717
this whole time travel thing,

277
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,653
I think I understand
it a little bit better.

278
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,589
Which makes me understand
Thawne's plan less and less.

279
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,758
Why would he send Nora
back to create a new Cicada

280
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,294
only for a newer Cicada to
appear who's harder to stop

281
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,662
than the one Nora created?

282
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,931
Ralph, can we get
away from Thawne's plan

283
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,233
and try to stick to our own?

284
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:19,641
Yeah, yeah, I... I just...

285
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,483
I feel like there might be an answer

286
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,604
in this timey-wimey crap
that could help us solve this.

287
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,575
Nora, where would you find
this hyper-conduit in 2049?

288
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,844
Probably Ollins Laboratory.

289
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,446
Ollins won a Nobel Prize
for quantum engineering.

290
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:36,383
Ollins? As in Sebastian Ollins?

291
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,252
Yeah, do you know him?

292
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:40,488
He's a true genius.

293
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,235
A genius, you say.

294
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:46,594
The guy couldn't even stay awake

295
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,429
through a single physics lecture.

296
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:52,967
In fact, I'm pretty sure if
it wasn't for his very smart,

297
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,503
very considerate college roommate

298
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,449
lending him notes, helping him study,

299
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,772
he wouldn't have made
it through his finals!

300
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:02,042
Nobel Prize my ass!

301
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,944
Yeah, he knows him.

302
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,580
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

303
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:09,517
Life's too short and I'm
not about to spend my life

304
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,419
worrying about little Sebastian Ollins.

305
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,754
Found him.

306
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,689
Looks like he's been renting a warehouse

307
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,358
somewhere on the Southside

308
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,594
and then he retrofitted it
with fiber-joules technology

309
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,096
to test out his experiments.

310
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:25,733
Including one bleeding-edge hyper-conduit.

311
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,968
I'll go get it before Grace can.

312
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,970
- Right behind you.
- I, um...

313
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,840
I... I think you
should sit this one out.

314
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,441
What? Why?

315
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,677
Nora, your connection with Grace.

316
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,179
It puts you in too much danger.

317
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,214
I mean, we don't... I
think it's best for you

318
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:43,083
to just stay out of the
field until we stop her.

319
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,219
So what? Now I can't
help the team at all?

320
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,321
Nora, please understand.

321
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,456
Look, you would be much safer here.

322
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,133
All right, I'm here.

323
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,235
No sign of Cicada.

324
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,404
Great. Grab the conduit
and get out of there.

325
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,111
I think I got something.

326
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,494
Barry!

327
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,430
She's already got the conduit.

328
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,865
And she blew up Ollins' warehouse.

329
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,632
Grace has everything she needs.

330
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,292
It's just like we thought.

331
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,428
Great.

332
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,896
What?

333
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,333
With all the pieces that she's stolen,

334
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,535
Grace can now use the
dagger's dark matter energy

335
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,837
to supercharge the atomizer.

336
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,654
Apparently it wasn't enough for her

337
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,674
to just kill all the
metas in Central City.

338
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,209
With this super-charge,

339
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,945
she'll kill every meta in the country.

340
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,447
All right, look,

341
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,415
I know you guys want me
off this whole Thawne thing,

342
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,983
- but you've got to hear this.
- Ralph.

343
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,235
No, you've got to look at this.

344
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,378
You've got to hear this.

345
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,438
So just... just give
me a second, all right?

346
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:13,874
- All right.
- Please.

347
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:16,899
All right, so, this is
the original timeline

348
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:18,961
with the original Cicada, David Hersch.

349
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:20,463
This is the night of the Enlightenment,

350
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,064
when Nora interfered with the satellite,

351
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,799
giving us our Cicada, Orlin Dwyer.

352
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:27,069
That's also the same night
that Grace goes into a coma.

353
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,971
This is where it gets complicated.

354
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,639
At some point in the future,

355
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:32,975
Grace wakes up, she becomes
her own full-fledged Cicada.

356
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,377
She goes back in time,

357
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,145
she kills her Uncle with his own dagger.

358
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,581
What happens to all the
metas that Dwyer killed?

359
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,445
Do they get un-killed?

360
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,815
What about all the metas that
Grace killed in the future?

361
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,785
What did she kill them with?

362
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,688
And most importantly,

363
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,892
what happens in the timeline
where Grace never killed Dwyer.

364
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,430
Something doesn't add up.

365
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,334
You might be right.

366
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:03,172
But right now, there won't
be any future for any metas

367
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:05,241
if we don't get rid of that dagger.

368
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,877
Now. This is our last chance.

369
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,846
We have to figure out how to find Grace.

370
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,749
Or we lose everyone.

371
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:16,152
We'll go see what the satellites can do.

372
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,354
Maybe we're due for a miracle.

373
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,692
Hey, come on.

374
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,763
Hey.

375
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,198
Do you think we made the right decision

376
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,390
leaving Nora out of this?

377
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:31,933
I mean, the whole reason she came back

378
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,637
was to fight Cicada in the first place.

379
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,872
We're her parents, all right?

380
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:41,777
It's our job to protect her from harm.

381
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:46,215
The best way to do that is just
to keep her far away from it.

382
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,422
You worked for Caitlin and
Killer Frost's connection.

383
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:29,291
Let's see what you can
do for me and Grace.

384
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,394
What's taking so long?

385
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,430
Look, how much more
cure do you have left?

386
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,098
Listen, we have plenty.

387
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,634
Please, uh, we will administer the cure

388
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,636
as fast as we can, people. Okay?

389
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,838
Detective West, we
need additional squads

390
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,373
to aid the crowd control.

391
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,108
Uh, yeah, take... take two.

392
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,578
No... no, no. Take three. Two, two, two.

393
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,648
Joe, we need more alcohol swabs.

394
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,183
Babe, you okay?

395
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:55,918
Hey, oh! Hey, oh!

396
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,054
- Sherloque?
- So, Dr. Caitlin Snow.

397
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,657
This is Cecile Horton
and Detective Joe West.

398
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,259
This is my...

399
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:06,729
this is Mademoiselle Renée Adler.

400
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,164
- Hi. Adler.
- Adler. And Renée,

401
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,534
these are the people that can help you.

402
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,603
So you can actually
just remove my powers?

403
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,506
We can if you want us to.

404
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:20,106
And... and this would be permanent?

405
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,510
Oh, it's permanent, yes.

406
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,412
But better than Cicada
permanently killing you.

407
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:24,647
Am I right? Tell her detective.

408
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,504
- That's right? Right?
- Yes.

409
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:29,450
Uh, you're feeling nervous, I can tell.

410
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:32,105
But Cicada really is trying to kill

411
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,708
every meta-human in this city.

412
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,391
Hey, what's your problem?

413
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,929
Back off! I'm standing here.

414
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,331
Is something wrong with your eyes?

415
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:40,686
They're fine.

416
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,364
Then get out of my way.

417
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,266
All right, all right. Break it up.

418
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,668
We need to keep this line moving.

419
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,202
Want us to detain them, Detective?

420
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:49,338
Just give me the cure
and I'll get out of here.

421
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,974
No way! I was here first! You know that!

422
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:53,509
Sir, what should we do?

423
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:55,277
Detective, we've got one squad left.

424
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,212
Give me the cure and
I'll get out of here.

425
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:02,818
Ah-aah! Enough!

426
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,156
I need a minute to think.

427
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,593
I'm so...

428
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,428
Renée?

429
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,532
There she is. Hey, whoa,
whoa! Hey, hey! Hey, oh!

430
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:20,502
That was Cecile.

431
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:24,807
CCPD is flooded with a lot
of really scared people.

432
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,610
Are there any signs of
Grace's dark matter signature?

433
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,378
No. Nothing. Not even a...

434
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,549
Is that her?

435
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,929
Nora!

436
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:49,398
Barry, she can't hear you.

437
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,600
I don't think she can see us either.

438
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:54,010
Nora! Nora!

439
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:08,050
Nora!

440
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,813
What were you thinking?

441
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:19,186
Nora, you almost gave
yourself an aneurysm.

442
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,702
I was trying to find Grace.

443
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,682
Opening yourself up
to Grace and her rage

444
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:25,660
also opens you up to
the Negative Speed Force.

445
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:26,727
We don't know anything about it.

446
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:27,939
Don't you get how dangerous that is?

447
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,240
Yeah, I do.

448
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,558
And I still wanna try. I have to try.

449
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:34,328
Nora, you trying almost
destroyed Cisco's workshop

450
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,030
and almost got yourself killed.

451
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,833
Not to mention, what if
Cicada saw through your eyes?

452
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,568
You could've given away our location.

453
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,071
No, I made sure there
was nothing in my eye line

454
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,273
that said S.T.A.R. Labs.

455
00:23:44,276 --> 00:23:45,807
Guys, listen.

456
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,576
I saw Grace and I
almost saw where she was.

457
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:50,445
Right now she is putting
her pieces together

458
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:51,913
and when that is done,

459
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,948
thousands if not hundreds
of thousands of people

460
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,516
are going to die.

461
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,786
I can't stand around and do nothing.

462
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:02,090
Yes, you can because that's
what we're telling you to do.

463
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:12,166
When I first got here, I
would rush in to fix things

464
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:15,126
and by doing that, I always
ended up making them worse.

465
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:18,039
But I am not that person anymore

466
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,540
because of you.

467
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,976
You showed me how to use my powers.

468
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:24,312
You taught me how to
make the right choices.

469
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:29,417
And right now, I am
choosing to face this risk.

470
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,621
Nora, this is a terrible idea.

471
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:35,990
I know you feel that way.

472
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,558
But I don't.

473
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:43,931
I'm an adult capable of
making my own decisions.

474
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,701
I've made up my mind about this.

475
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:50,838
So I am asking you,
please, as my parents,

476
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,441
stop trying to keep me
away from this danger

477
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:55,543
and start helping me face it.

478
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:11,025
No, no, no, no, no. Don't
worry. I can handle it.

479
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:12,360
All right.

480
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,262
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

481
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,397
What are you doing? Those
people are overwhelmed.

482
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:17,538
They don't know what to do.

483
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,366
They need you and you
just... You walked away?

484
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:20,935
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to. It's just...

485
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,837
Okay, did I just catch
you on the phone with Singh

486
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,705
trying to find out how
fast he was gonna be back?

487
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:28,209
Cecil, I... I... I'm not
used to being in charge

488
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:31,145
of all this managerial
and logistic stuff.

489
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,314
- I'm just not cut out for that.
- What are you talking about?

490
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:34,982
Babe, I have seen you take charge

491
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:36,717
in the field a million times.

492
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,886
But that's in the field and
I always knew that I had Singh

493
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:40,989
to go to if I had any problems this way.

494
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:42,078
Now everybody's coming to me

495
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,461
and I can't answer all these questions.

496
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:48,829
Joe West.

497
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:53,167
How many times has Barry, Iris, Nora,

498
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,369
even Ralph Dibny come to you?

499
00:25:55,371 --> 00:26:00,241
Specifically come to you to
get answers to their problems?

500
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:02,083
More times than I can count.

501
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:03,552
Exactly.

502
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:06,180
And that is because
everyone of them knows

503
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,682
that when they come to you,

504
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:11,085
they're gonna get an honest answer

505
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:13,521
straight from the heart.

506
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:18,593
Babe, that heart of yours,
that is a moral compass.

507
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:22,296
It's one of the many
reasons why I love you.

508
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:25,975
Right here.

509
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:28,379
That's all you need, babe. Right here.

510
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:29,848
As long as you speak from there,

511
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:33,619
I promise you, you will
never lead anyone astray.

512
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,314
Hey, oh!

513
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,049
- Sherloque.
- Yes.

514
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,684
Sherloque, I'm sorry I ran.

515
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,987
I was... . Just feeling so overwhelmed.

516
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:49,624
All I wanted to do...
make you feel safe.

517
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,425
And then I put you in
a position where you

518
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:53,828
feel overwhelmed and not safe.

519
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,698
But look, we'll go to
S.T.A.R. Labs, quiet and safe.

520
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
We'll administer the
cure. It will be great.

521
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,402
Look, Sherloque, that's....

522
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,004
That's not why I ran away.

523
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:05,406
- It's not?
- No.

524
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:08,109
I don't wanna take the cure.

525
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:11,112
- You don't?
- No.

526
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:13,514
I love having my powers.

527
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:14,649
You do?

528
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:16,484
Y... yes and yes,

529
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:19,654
is it scary knowing that
there's a killer out there

530
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:22,189
that's targeting people like me, but...

531
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,077
I don't want to change who I am.

532
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,580
I don't want to give into fear

533
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,416
just because there's danger involved.

534
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:28,650
You know?

535
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:31,588
I want to live my life on my terms.

536
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:35,136
As a meta-human.

537
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,940
No, but you're brave.

538
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:43,678
I just worry that Cicada won't stop

539
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,952
until she kills every
meta-human on this...

540
00:27:48,992 --> 00:27:50,825
On this earth.

541
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:52,361
There is a way.

542
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:55,789
For you to still have your
powers and be free of Cicada.

543
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:58,826
- How?
- On a different Earth,

544
00:27:58,828 --> 00:28:00,561
where'd you be safe.

545
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:03,097
In your travels in your
career as a librarian,

546
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,033
have you ever heard of the
theory of the "Multi-verse"?

547
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,706
So... so this a device that opens

548
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,274
- a portal to another world.
- Yes.

549
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,809
- Right.
- Any world I choose?

550
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,877
Right. You're so smart.
You catch on so quickly.

551
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,412
You know, some people,
they just don't believe.

552
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:21,156
Well, a few weeks ago
I saw a giant shark

553
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,117
fighting a giant
gorilla on the 6:00 news,

554
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,752
- so...
- That's a good point.

555
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:26,854
Now look, this Earth that
I'm going to send you to,

556
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,522
it's... it's my Earth.

557
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:30,358
I'll have some friends
there to meet you,

558
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,193
but secret, huh?

559
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:34,929
This trip, you must not
tell anyone because if Cicada

560
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:36,497
were to find out there's multiple Earths

561
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:38,332
and each one of these
Earths contains meta-humans,

562
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:40,434
no, they would be her next target. Hmm?

563
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,305
- What?
- Come with me.

564
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:52,188
No, I must stay.

565
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,981
Now knowing Cicada is
a threat to this Earth,

566
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,084
I must fight alongside my friends.

567
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,688
You know, Team Flash, they're like...

568
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:06,060
They're like a family to
me but when I am done...

569
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:08,295
I will come find you.

570
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,634
You are the woman I
have been waiting for.

571
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:25,388
So...

572
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:27,258
I know.

573
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,285
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

574
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:33,788
All right.

575
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:39,936
Allez.

576
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,659
You were right.

577
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:14,662
We taught you how to be a hero.

578
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:17,498
So we shouldn't be angry at
you when you act like one.

579
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:20,676
I know you're just afraid I'll get hurt.

580
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:22,078
There's always going to be danger

581
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,014
that you're going to face, Nora.

582
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,707
And we can't hold your
hand through all of it.

583
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:28,375
As much as we want to.

584
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:32,146
You're our daughter
but you're not a kid.

585
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:35,282
You're right, you are capable
of making your own decisions.

586
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,653
You really think you can
control your connection

587
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,556
to the Negative Speed
Force, find Grace for us?

588
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:43,991
Yeah, I do.

589
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:46,026
All I need is for you
guys to keep our home safe

590
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,194
while I do it.

591
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:49,063
I think I know how.

592
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,976
Let's find Cicada.

593
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,231
Man, this thing brings back memories.

594
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,302
- Good ones? Bad ones?
- Thawne ones.

595
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,032
We trapped the
Reverse-Flash in this thing

596
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,738
before we even knew he was Thawne.

597
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,342
But we actually ended up
trapping his Speed Mirage.

598
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,412
While his real self
just sat there chilling

599
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,447
in his wheelchair.

600
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,150
Man, Thawne's plans got plans.

601
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,185
But fear not, true believers.

602
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:33,562
The Thawne Trap 2.0 is
smaller, sleeker, and stronger.

603
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:36,025
I've gone ahead and
sharpened the inflexion points

604
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:38,121
to account for your
Negative Speed Force energy.

605
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:41,296
So if you go full
"Dante's Peak" in there,

606
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,932
we'll be safe out here.

607
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,302
It also means I can't phase
in there if you need me.

608
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,272
Your dad and I will be
right here the whole time.

609
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,908
You always are.

610
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,210
You got this.

611
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,212
Let's go catch our big bad.

612
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,826
Excuse me! Excuse me!

613
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,829
People, please! Please!

614
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,898
Thank you.

615
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,303
For all of you I haven't
met, I'm Detective Joe West.

616
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:24,841
Now I am not a meta-human. I
don't know what that's like.

617
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:28,645
But I do know what it's like
to be afraid and overwhelmed.

618
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,249
You all came here
because you wanted answers

619
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,485
and you needed help.

620
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:41,591
Myself and everybody else here
at CCPD are here to help you.

621
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,393
So I swear to you,

622
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,929
with a little bit of
patience from all of us,

623
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:51,701
we will get through this together.

624
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,903
Thank you.

625
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,075
Officers, let's start
moving the line again.

626
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,377
We're gonna get to everybody.

627
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,755
Hold onto your butts.

628
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,133
They're connected.

629
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,090
I can see the completed atomizer.

630
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,741
But I can't see where she's taking it.

631
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,877
Remember Nora, that's not your anger.

632
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,346
It's hers.

633
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,652
Ah-ah, Nora.

634
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:45,788
I see what you're doing.

635
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,091
Okay, something pissed her off.

636
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,373
Is your memory machine
letting you back into my head?

637
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,007
No.

638
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,909
This is all me.

639
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,612
I can't let you release
that virus, Grace.

640
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,013
Thousands will die.

641
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,484
Thousands today. Even more tomorrow.

642
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,252
The world I wake up in

643
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,856
is overrun with people
with impossible powers.

644
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,258
Destroying innocent lives.

645
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,496
Ripping families apart.
Just like mine was.

646
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,565
And all of this is because of you!

647
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:38,216
Uh, is that bad?

648
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,442
Well, it's not good.
I'm pulling her out.

649
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,813
No, no. No, she'll get control.

650
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:48,518
Your Flash family created meta-humans.

651
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:53,080
The Particle Accelerator. The bus metas.

652
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:56,515
The Enlightenment satellite
which you shattered!

653
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,365
This isn't my anger.

654
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,766
It's yours.

655
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,403
You may look different, Grace.

656
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,273
But you're still the
angry little girl I met

657
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,839
the first time I came here.

658
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,212
I'm sorry you have to carry that anger.

659
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,247
But you're gonna have to carry it alone

660
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,917
because I make my own decisions,

661
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,953
and I've decided not to be like you.

662
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,035
- Nora! Nora.
- Hey!

663
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:42,271
She's... she's at CCPD.

664
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,430
Get everybody out of here right now!

665
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,732
- Cecil, go. Go!
- Move, move, move!

666
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,353
And now their end begins.

667
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,418
Cicada's at CCPD but she
could use the atomizer

668
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:23,802
to spread the virus from anywhere.

669
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,177
There are hundreds of metas there.

670
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,541
She's going to try and
take all of their lives.

671
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:30,250
Not their lives, their dark matter.

672
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:33,955
She's going to use all
those metas like a battery.

673
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,456
What are we gonna do?

674
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,325
Reach in, lose our
powers, destroy the dagger,

675
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:38,793
stop Cicada from Supergirl-ing away,

676
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:41,095
then regroup for the emotional fallout.

677
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,412
Fallout. Cisco, where did you send

678
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:46,100
Fallout's energy when
he was going nuclear?

679
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,501
Earth-15. It's a dead Earth.

680
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,869
Let's breach the atomizer there.

681
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:52,039
- I'm coming with you!
- Nora, look.

682
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,976
You've already helped.
More than enough, all right?

683
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:59,213
Okay, just do me a favor.

684
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:01,415
Blast that dagger to hell.

685
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,815
Absolutely.

686
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,524
Get out of my precinct.

687
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:20,618
Hey, Cricket freak.

688
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:23,361
You and I have some unfinished business.

689
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:32,480
- Nice hit.
- It won't keep her down long.

690
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,782
Why do we have our
powers? Did we already win?

691
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:38,052
Not yet. The dagger's in the atomizer.

692
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,519
Wait, wait, wait!

693
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:41,488
If we shoot the dagger
while it's still in there,

694
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:42,723
it could detonate the virus.

695
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:44,428
Guys, she's waking up.

696
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,060
All right, figure out a way to stop it.

697
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:48,562
- I'll keep her off your back.
- All right.

698
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:50,331
This will help.

699
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:57,252
Cisco, remove the dagger and
then breach the atomizer away.

700
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,408
Yeah, there's a slight problem there.

701
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,777
Breaching this thing
anywhere could set it off.

702
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:04,311
My powers are useless here.

703
00:38:04,313 --> 00:38:07,248
Then use your other power. Your mind.

704
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:12,286
Bring up the atomizer blueprints.

705
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:15,356
I'm gonna have to science
the crap out of you.

706
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,091
Good morning, sunshine.

707
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:19,460
A little different without your
power-dampening dagger, huh?

708
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:23,064
Oh, I don't need a dagger to kill you.

709
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,766
I never had it before
I came to this time.

710
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:58,032
You wanna kill me? Come get me.

711
00:38:58,034 --> 00:38:59,533
What she said.

712
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:06,540
Once you remove the plate,
you should be able to see

713
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,908
the control processor plane.

714
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,544
I see it. It's not gonna work.

715
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:12,980
I need a quantum computer
to hack this thing.

716
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:16,517
Wait! I have one.

717
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,152
Yeah.

718
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:23,656
Your gauntlet!

719
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,826
Damn, I love the future.

720
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:28,262
Okay, if I can connect
to the three nodes inside,

721
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:30,030
I'll override the system.

722
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:32,333
If I touch anything else,

723
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,301
hasta la vista, baby.

724
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,214
Okay.

725
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:49,016
There. I got it.

726
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,485
Yeah, great. Um, how
long for the other two?

727
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,422
However long we have left.

728
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,576
Two down.

729
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:19,180
Well, you're not great at
the Operation game, are you?

730
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,523
You suck at constructive criticism!

731
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:29,790
Cisco, get out of there.

732
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,895
Almost there.

733
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:36,630
It's in.

734
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,190
Oh, shrap.

735
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:44,594
Cisco, what's going on?

736
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,346
It's too late.

737
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:53,747
Gotcha.

738
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:03,256
- The Atomizer's off.
- Flash!

739
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:07,053
The dagger.

740
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:10,158
If anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

741
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:12,594
it's gonna be the mirror gun.

742
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,133
Something doesn't add up.

743
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:15,996
Thawne's plans got plans.

744
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,717
She didn't have the dagger
in the future.

745
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,820
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

746
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:44,736
Don't shoot it!

747
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:55,172
