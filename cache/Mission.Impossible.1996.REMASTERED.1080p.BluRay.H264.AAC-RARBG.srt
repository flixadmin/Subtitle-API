1
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,191
It was good...

2
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,071
...that you called us.

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,117
I don't know what happened.

4
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,120
We were at the bar...

5
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,374
...drinking...

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,210
...having fun...

7
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,921
I don't even know...

8
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,591
...how I got here.

9
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,137
Come on, come on.
She's been under too long.

10
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,182
You're the only one
who can help me.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,274
Come on... come on,

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,776
Tell me what I need to know.

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,111
Come on.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,363
They'll kill me.

15
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,368
You asked for my help.

16
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,705
Come on.

17
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,584
Come on.

18
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,877
The contact in Minsk...

19
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,547
The name, pal.
Give us the name.

20
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,842
Dimitri...

21
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,885
...Miediev.

22
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,818
What now?

23
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,238
Now we drink.

24
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,032
<i>Za druziye.</i>

25
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,054
Get rid of that scum.

26
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,605
Hold her still.

27
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,151
Come on.

28
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,803
Did we get it?

29
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,263
We got it.

30
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,238
Would you like to watch a movie,
Mr. Rosen?

31
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,489
No, thank you.

32
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,706
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Phelps?

33
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,291
No, I prefer the theater.

34
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,961
Would you consider the cinema
of the Ukraine?

35
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,381
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.

36
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,429
Thank you.

37
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,372
<i>Good morning, Mr. Phelps.</i>

38
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,250
<i>The man you're looking at
is Alexander Golitsyn...</i>

39
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,795
<i>an attaché at our embassy in Prague.</i>

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,713
<i>He is also a traitor.</i>

41
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list...</i>

42
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,387
<i>a record of all our deep-cover agents
working in Eastern Europe.</i>

43
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,517
<i>For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

44
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,646
<i>The portion that Golitsyn already has
contains code names</i>

45
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,856
<i>but this half is useless
without its mate</i>

46
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>which matches the code names
with their true names.</i>

47
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,239
<i>It is this half which Golitsyn plans
to steal from the embassy</i>

48
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,741
<i>during a reception tomorrow night.</i>

49
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>Your mission, Jim,
should you choose to accept it</i>

50
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,539
<i>is to obtain photographic proof
of the theft,</i>

51
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,543
<i>shadow Golitsyn to his buyer,
and apprehend them both.</i>

52
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>I've already dispatched a team,
selected from your usual group.</i>

53
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>Sarah Davies is already undercover.</i>

54
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,511
<i>Jack Harmon can hack
into any security system.</i>

55
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,847
<i>Hannah Williams
will handle surveillance.</i>

56
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,599
<i>Your wife, Claire, will cover transport,</i>

57
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,270
<i>and Ethan Hunt will be
your point man, as usual.</i>

58
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,064
<i>He is now in Kiev
and will rendezvous in Prague</i>

59
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,066
<i>at a safe house of your choosing.</i>

60
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,403
<i>As always, should you or any member
of your IM Force</i>

61
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,280
<i>be caught or killed,</i>

62
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,867
<i>the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

63
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,953
<i>This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

64
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,037
<i>Good luck, Jim.</i>

65
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,854
A very straightforward objective.

66
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,482
We photograph Golitsyn stealing
the NOC list,

67
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,610
follow him to his buyer,

68
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,778
apprehend both of them.

69
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,697
Now here's the plot.

70
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,035
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character, during a party,

71
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,329
hide in plain sight,
highest possible profile.

72
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,041
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,502
Sarah, you're at the party already

74
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,671
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

75
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,799
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

76
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,384
I haven't a thing to wear.

77
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,597
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

78
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,725
You'll mark Golitsyn,
hand him off to Hannah.

79
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,311
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

80
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,397
- Find yourself a perch and stay on him.
- No problem.

81
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,899
- Jack?
- Yeah?

82
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,569
Fingerprint security, there's access
through the elevator shaft here.

83
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,863
So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.

84
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,531
Open, close, get out.

85
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,659
Zero residual presence.

86
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,578
- Claire...
- Mmm-hmm.

87
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,080
You're cover outside in the vehicle.

88
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,916
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior,

89
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,669
- you two stay on him from there.
- Okay.

90
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,504
Anything goes wrong, I call abort.

91
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,965
Everybody walk away immediately.

92
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,302
Regroup here at 4:00 a.m. That's 0400.

93
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,262
Any questions?

94
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,140
Yeah.

95
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,018
Can we get a cappuccino machine in here?

96
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,520
'Cause I don't know what you call this.

97
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,647
I call it cruel and unusual.

98
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,066
- I made that coffee.
- Exactly.

99
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,777
Is it possible it's even worse than
that sludge you made

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,487
- in that barn in Kiev?
- Thank you.

101
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,406
Take it easy on my wife's coffee,
will you?

102
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,410
- Oh, we missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- Missed you too, Ethan.

103
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,662
Were you off on one of your
cushy recruiting assignments again?

104
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,664
Where'd they put you up this time?
The Plaza?

105
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,041
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

106
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,460
What a shame.

107
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,422
- 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

108
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,798
Fat expense account.

109
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,592
- Now he's getting soft in his old age.
- Yeah, he is. Look at him.

110
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,553
Okay, listen.

111
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,222
If that list gets out into the open

112
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,017
the names of our agents
in every country in Eastern Europe

113
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,352
will be up for grabs
to the highest bidders.

114
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,814
Third world terrorists, arms dealers,
drug lords,

115
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,109
any and everybody who'd love
to get rid of long-term coverts like us.

116
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,697
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

117
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,785
So I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

118
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,621
Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.

119
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,499
There's a camera built
right into the bridge.

120
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,961
Whatever you see, it sees,
and then it transmits it back here.

121
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,629
See?

122
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,506
Can you hear me?

123
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,176
- Of course, I can hear you.
- No, in your...

124
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,094
- You need an earpiece.
- Oh.

125
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,683
You have lovely eyes.

126
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,311
- Can you hear me now?
- Loud and clear.

127
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,772
If he has a car waiting
and he rolls,

128
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,690
you stay with him no matter what.

129
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,901
You should take the afternoon,

130
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,778
drive the streets
around this little quarter.

131
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,571
- They're confusing as hell.
- Mmm.

132
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,907
What do you think
I've been doing all morning?

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,243
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

134
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,371
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?

135
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,918
Not this week.
This week, he's fly-fishing

136
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,170
at the Oughterard Slough
in County Kildare

137
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,714
- with one of our best Irish guides.
- Yep.

138
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,966
And he won't be back anytime soon.

139
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,971
<i>...irrelevant at best
or unconstitutional at worst.</i>

140
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,681
<i>With all due respect, Senator,</i>

141
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,434
<i>it sounds as if you want
to lead the kind of charge</i>

142
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,729
<i>that Senator Frank Church
led in the 1970s</i>

143
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,940
<i>and in the process destroy</i>

144
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,108
<i>the intelligence capability
of this country.</i>

145
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,234
<i>No, John.</i>

146
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,319
<i>I want to know who these people are</i>

147
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,489
<i>and how they're spending
our taxpayers' money.</i>

148
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,992
<i>We were living in a democracy
the last time I checked.</i>

149
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,662
Stick of gum, right?

150
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,872
- No?
- No.

151
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,125
Red light, green light.

152
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,461
You come up against a lock you
can't pick, you mash them together...

153
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,423
<i>Hasta</i> lasagna, don't get any on ya.

154
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,509
You'll have about five seconds.

155
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,888
Just don't chew it.

156
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,470
Ethan, Jack's inside.

157
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,222
Let's go.

158
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,395
<i>How do you do, Senator?</i>

159
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,022
<i>I'm Rand Housman,
the ambassador's aide.</i>

160
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,815
<i>- Hello, Mr. Housman.
- How was the opera?</i>

161
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,110
Uh, it was boring.

162
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,821
Let me see if I can steer you
through this reception line.

163
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,334
<i>- How do you do, Senator?
- His wife, Mrs. Reid.</i>

164
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,252
Windows open by 2300.

165
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,755
- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague.
- How do you do, sir?

166
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,423
And Mrs. Brandl.

167
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,844
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

168
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,263
Why, of course I do.
How are you, Miss Norman?

169
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,724
He's in pocket, on the stairway.

170
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,148
Mr. Golitsyn, nice to see you.

171
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,193
Hannah...

172
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:19,948
<i>pull the shade.</i>

173
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,877
<i>Sarah, mark the package
and go to tunnel.</i>

174
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,344
Your advance team mentioned
that you'd like a tour of the facilities

175
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,638
so I've gone ahead and set one up.
Excuse me.

176
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,973
This way. Thank you.

177
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,194
Oh, great.

178
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,905
...which leads to the denied area

179
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,325
which is the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

180
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,768
Governor's in position now.

181
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,031
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- I'm sorry.

182
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,576
As you can see, there's a Marine guard
and video surveillance

183
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,037
and this place is like...
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

184
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,913
I know it's in here somewhere.

185
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,334
Now, Sergeant, why are you not
in your uniform this evening?

186
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,255
We've been ordered to wear
civilian clothes this evening, sir.

187
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,175
Be right back.

188
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,138
Tell me, Senator, do you not have
someone on your staff named Jack?

189
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,975
<i>Jack?
Well, I think we did have a Jack.</i>

190
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,520
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall, constantly late,

191
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,439
<i>behind in his work.</i>

192
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,403
<i>We were forced to tie him behind
one of my best stallions</i>

193
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,613
and drag him around

194
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,573
<i>my barn for a few days.</i>

195
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,117
Relax your crap, Foghorn.
I'm working on it.

196
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,132
Sorry, sir.

197
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,842
- Thank you.
- Have a nice evening.

198
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,927
Thank you.

199
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,220
Ah.

200
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,775
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

201
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,013
Higher.

202
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,813
He's heading to the denied area.

203
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,567
<i>Get moving, Ethan.</i>

204
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,068
He's rolling to you.

205
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,788
Jack.

206
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,625
Jack, we're in position here.

207
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,421
<i>- Jack.</i>
- I didn't touch it.

208
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,426
What about my coat?
I'm going to freeze.

209
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,760
Jack, open the doors.

210
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,814
He's in the box, Ethan. He's in the box.

211
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,691
<i>Okay.</i>

212
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,109
We're taking Golitsyn's exit.

213
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,903
- Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

214
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,324
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

215
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,827
Go.

216
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,577
- He's got it.
- All right.

217
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,790
- Saved your ass again, Jack.
<i>- Give me a break, pops.</i>

218
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,792
Such a nice ass.

219
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,877
And a lonely ass.

220
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,673
- Transport in five minutes.
- Yes, indeed.

221
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,218
Jack, we're in position.
Open the doors and let the package roll.

222
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,679
Roger that. Opening doors now.

223
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,599
Stairway, you're wrapped.

224
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,309
<i>Go to transport.</i>

225
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,399
Hey.

226
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,571
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

227
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,579
I don't have control, Jack.

228
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,498
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.

229
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,462
- Cut the power, Jack.
- Come on, Jack.

230
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,506
- Cut the power.
<i>- Jack?</i>

231
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,800
Jack?

232
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,683
<i>Jack?</i>

233
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,020
Jack?

234
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,898
Jack?

235
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,692
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

236
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,236
<i>- Jack?</i>
- Man down, Ethan.

237
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>Man down.</i>

238
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,052
<i>Ethan, stay where you are.</i>

239
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,304
I'm coming to you.

240
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,238
The package is out in the open.

241
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,368
Jim,

242
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,079
<i>he's in the open.</i>

243
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,205
En route.

244
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,393
Jim, he's in the open.

245
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,772
Jim, the package is in the open.

246
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,071
- I've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?

247
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,906
No. Abort.

248
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,700
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

249
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,998
I can't do that.

250
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,042
We're being ambushed, Ethan. Abort.
That's an order.

251
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,754
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.

252
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,047
<i>No, damn it! No! I said abort!</i>

253
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,727
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming to you.

254
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,687
Jim gave an abort.
We should walk away.

255
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,524
No. We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?

256
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,818
Now, go.

257
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,227
Where are you?

258
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,521
About 200 yards from the bridge.

259
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,897
<i>They're covering this frequency.</i>

260
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,565
Cut all radio communication.

261
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,902
<i>Repeat. Cut all radio communication.</i>

262
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,095
<i>Ethan!</i>

263
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,019
<i>Ethan...</i>

264
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,130
Sarah, abort.

265
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,299
Repeat, abort.

266
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,970
Abort!

267
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,513
Do you read me?

268
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,811
Sarah? God!

269
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,595
Claire. Oh, my God.

270
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,680
My God.

271
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,189
Oh, no. Sarah.

272
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,912
My God.

273
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,165
<i>Satcom seven.</i>

274
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,543
- Central Europe, unsecured.
<i>- Designator?</i>

275
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,921
- Bravo-echo-one-one.
<i>- Switching.</i>

276
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,760
<i>- This is Kittridge.</i>
- Go secure.

277
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,762
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

278
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,891
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

279
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,227
<i>What? Who's dead?</i>

280
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,064
- My team. My team is dead!
<i>- Jesus.</i>

281
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,107
Golitsyn's gone.

282
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,692
They knew we were coming, man.

283
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,487
They knew we were coming,
and the disk is gone.

284
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,946
<i>Are you intact?</i>

285
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,658
The disk is gone, did you...
Do you read me? The list is in the open!

286
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,118
<i>Listen, I read you.</i>

287
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,705
<i>Let's just bring you in safely
and then we'll worry about that, okay?</i>

288
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,916
<i>Were you followed?</i>

289
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,630
- I don't think so. I don't think so.
<i>- Don't think. Be sure.</i>

290
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,633
<i>- Are you clean?</i>
- Yes.

291
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:37,012
<i>Okay. Location green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.</i>

292
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,724
- You're in Prague?
<i>- One hour.</i>

293
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,031
I am...

294
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,703
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

295
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,457
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you, Ethan,

296
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,544
personally as well as professionally.

297
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,963
Yeah.

298
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,221
Here's a passport, visa. Usual drill.

299
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,058
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada, debrief you at Langley.

300
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,561
Throw the Prague police a bone or two.

301
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,730
You know, toss them a few suspects.

302
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,319
You follow me?

303
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,530
Yeah, I follow.

304
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,035
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

305
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,997
You mean, I've lost enough agents
for one night.

306
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,251
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

307
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,338
Who else is left?

308
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,134
Yeah. I see your point.

309
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,849
Why was there another team?

310
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,227
What?

311
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,564
Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

312
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,235
I don't quite follow you.

313
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,115
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.

314
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,744
The drunk Russians on the embankment
at seven and 8 o'clock,

315
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,292
the couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at nine and 11.

316
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,212
The waiter standing behind Hannah
at the top of the stairs.

317
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,838
Bow tie, 12 o' clock.

318
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,882
The other IMF team.

319
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,095
You're worried about me. Why?

320
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,599
Well, for a little over two years,

321
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,520
we've been spotting serious blowback
in IMF operations.

322
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,230
We have a penetration.

323
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,441
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet

324
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,777
from a Czech we know as Max.

325
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,697
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

326
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,534
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts,

327
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:50,205
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

328
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,542
This time, he'd gotten to someone
on the inside.

329
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,004
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

330
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,132
An operation he referred to as job 314,

331
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,176
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

332
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,432
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

333
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,478
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

334
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,064
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

335
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,654
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

336
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,871
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

337
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,706
Yeah.

338
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,586
The mole's deep inside

339
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,590
and like you said

340
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,720
you survived.

341
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,391
I want to show you something, Ethan.

342
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,896
Since your father's death,

343
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,024
your family's farm has been
in receivership

344
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,528
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

345
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,199
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.

346
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,330
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be a very expensive proposition.

347
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,416
So...

348
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,588
Why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

349
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,259
I can understand you're very upset.

350
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,262
Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

351
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,015
All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.

352
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,434
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed.

353
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,686
And you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

354
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,855
You want to shake hands with the devil,
that's fine with me.

355
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,774
I just want to make sure
that you do it in hell.

356
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,357
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

357
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,553
<i>The other day, we decoded
a message on the internet</i>

358
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,013

Job 314.

362
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,914
Job 314. I can't...

363
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,599
Job...

364
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,828
Job 3:14?

365
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,039
Job 3:14.

366
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,395
You son of a bitch.

367
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,379
Max, goods tainted.

368
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,258
Consider extremely hazardous.
Do not use.

369
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,682
Fate will be that of kings
and counselors...

370
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,022
Must meet to discuss ASAP.

371
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,204
Ethan,

372
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,125
what are you doing?

373
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,464
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you on the bridge,

374
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,634
but you weren't there.

375
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,014
<i>Ethan.</i>

376
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,517
Ethan.

377
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:51,936
Ethan?

378
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,194
Don't move.

379
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,780
Ethan.

380
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,325
Ethan, it's okay. Just calm down.

381
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,243
It's Claire.

382
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,121
- It's okay.
- You were in the car.

383
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,916
No, I wasn't.

384
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,252
I heard on the radio...

385
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,589
Shut up, I saw you. You were in the car.

386
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,342
No, I got out of the car.

387
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,428
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was just...

388
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,389
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.

389
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,267
- There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?

390
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,770
Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead!

391
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,231
They're dead! They're all dead!

392
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,950
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead?

393
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,369
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...

394
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,247
Take off your coat.

395
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,007
- Where were you, huh?
- I...

396
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,928
Where were you?

397
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,392
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

398
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,978
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?

399
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,188
- Did they send you for me?
- Who's "they"?

400
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,898
Did they send you?

401
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,900
Look, who sent you? Who sent you?

402
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,152
No one sent me. No one sent me.

403
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,321
We were supposed to be
back here at 4:00.

404
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:30,243
4:00 if we abort.
We don't return here until 4:00, 0400.

405
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,329
4:00 a.m. 4:00, Ethan, 4:00.

406
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,707
If we abort.

407
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,334
4:00 a.m.

408
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,647
I've been disavowed.

409
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,823
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.

410
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,375
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

411
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,337
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing,

412
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,798
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max,

413
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,258
for the last two years

414
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,553
to get him our NOC list.

415
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,473
What are you gonna do?

416
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,808
I'm gonna get it for him.

417
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,104
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

418
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,316
Whoever the mole is,

419
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,860
I think goes by the name of Job.

420
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,280
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list,

421
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,367
he'll find me.

422
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,244
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna talk
to Kittridge myself.

423
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,622
And I'm gonna tell him
you had nothing to do with this.

424
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,916
Claire, if you're not dead,

425
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,628
he's gonna assume you're with me.

426
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,770
The message is for Job.

427
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,734
That's right,
and I'm gonna answer it.

428
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,009
Excuse me.

429
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,178
Can I trouble you for a match?

430
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,655
Would you remove your hat, please?

431
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,203
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

432
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,040
The price of admission.

433
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,470
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood.

434
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,055
No one sees Max.

435
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,308
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

436
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:45,146
Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.

437
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,066
Well, I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

438
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,360
Well, if Max doesn't like
what you have to say,

439
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,864
you'll be wearing
that shroud indefinitely.

440
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,326
I'm willing to take the chance.

441
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,249
Very well.

442
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,216
Who are you and what are you doing here?

443
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,428
I need $150,000.

444
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,264
Oh, really?

445
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,313
And you thought

446
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,899
if you simply showed up,
I might give it to you?

447
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,528
Why not? You gave Job $125,000.

448
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,867
Hmm, the penny drops. You are not Job.

449
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,666
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

450
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:52,004
Then there was its tone,
aggressive but playful.

451
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,048
Job is not playful.

452
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,761
So you are something of a paradox.

453
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,973
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

454
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,684
Whether you like a paradox.

455
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,856
I want $150,000 today.

456
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,233
No, no.
That's quite out of the question.

457
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,239
The disk Job sold you, it's worthless.

458
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,909
It's bait, part of an internal
mole hunt.

459
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,375
And how might you know that?

460
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,296
Are you another Company man?

461
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,884
- Like Job?
- Mmm.

462
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,431
We're asking about you.

463
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,976
I'm NOC. Was.

464
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,979
Now, disavowed.

465
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,481
Why, may I ask?

466
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,484
That is the question I want to ask Job.

467
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,324
I don't know Job any more
than Job knows me.

468
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,950
Even so.

469
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,453
I'm sure you could arrange
an introduction.

470
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,787
Why should I?

471
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,624
Because I can deliver
the actual NOC list.

472
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,167
The one you have is
not only worthless,

473
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,044
it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device

474
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,046
to pinpoint your exact location.

475
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,505
Mmm-hmm.

476
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,550
Mmm-hmm.

477
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,844
Boot it up.

478
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,180
In anywhere from 30 seconds
to 10 minutes...

479
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,308
you'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like jackrabbits.

480
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,980
It's easy to say the disk is worthless

481
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,358
when you say I can't look
at the information

482
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,237
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.

483
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,407
Okay, use it.

484
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,577
But I'd suggest you pack first.

485
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,012
26,27. So far, so good.

486
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,640
Not so good for you, my friend.

487
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,142
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

488
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,135
32 and 33.

489
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,346
Doesn't mean it's a signal.
Could just be the hard drive heating up.

490
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,564
44 and 45.

491
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,913
Now.

492
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,156
Man's gone black, Barnes.

493
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,576
He's under until he decides to surface.

494
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,203
Look, we can use somebody
at the embassy.

495
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,537
Involve the local authorities.

496
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:57,375
- We can cut off his transportation...
- What can we do, Barnes?

497
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,293
Put a guy at the airport?

498
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,545
How many identities
do you think Hunt has?

499
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:03,547
How many times has
he slipped past customs

500
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,466
in how many countries?

501
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,968
These guys are trained to be ghosts.

502
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,805
We taught them to do it,
for Christ's sake.

503
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,473
Well, what do you suggest?

504
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,020
Let's not waste time chasing after him,
just make him come to us.

505
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,398
Everybody has pressure points, Barnes.

506
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,651
You find something
that's personally important to him

507
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,319
and you squeeze.

508
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,953
Gunther will never let me have
one of his apartments again.

509
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,917
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You are a good sport.

510
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,419
Thanks, Max.

511
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,797
Or is it Maxine?

512
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,383
I don't have to tell you

513
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,386
what a comfort anonymity can be
in my profession.

514
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,931
It's like a warm blanket.

515
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,105
My deal with Job was subject
to a successful boot scan.

516
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,607
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

517
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,986
What was your deal with Job?

518
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,488
Um, $6 million.

519
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,534
I'll give you the same,
but I want the complete list now,

520
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,035
not just Eastern Europe.

521
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,121
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

522
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,790
- I want the entire list.
- $10 million.

523
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,377
$10 million in negotiable
US Treasury certificates

524
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,546
in bearer form, coupons attached.

525
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,715
And one more thing.

526
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,430
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

527
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,265
Hmm.

528
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,527
Oh.

529
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,531
Max made a deal with you?

530
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,952
I deliver the NOC list,
Max delivers Job.

531
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,627
We've got 75 rounds for your Beretta
but only 20 for the SIG Sauer.

532
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,755
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor,

533
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,299
plenty of passports, and...

534
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,305
What?

535
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,183
You said it yourself.

536
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,560
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

537
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,563
Are you sure about this?

538
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,066
Jim was my husband.

539
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,860
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

540
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:33,822
We're gonna need some help.

541
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,700
We don't have a lot of time,
so they're gonna have to be local.

542
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,536
What kind of help?

543
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,405
Simple game.

544
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,699
Four players.

545
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,951
Exfil opens the pocket.

546
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,786
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

547
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,372
Bank?

548
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,374
IMF mainframe.

549
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,460
Where exactly is it?

550
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,837
In Langley.

551
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,300
In Langley?

552
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,261
The one in Virginia, Langley?

553
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,348
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

554
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:43,976
Is he serious?

555
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,937
Always.

556
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:52,276
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

557
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,112
I can fly a helicopter right in
through the lobby

558
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,655
and set it down inside the vault,

559
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,784
and it would be a hell of a lot easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

560
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,202
What are we downloading?

561
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,788
- Information.
- What kind?

562
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,040
Profitable.

563
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,001
Payment on delivery.

564
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,630
I don't know.

565
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,215
I just don't know.

566
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,387
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

567
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,849
What did they used to call you,
the Net Ranger?

568
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,726
Phineas Phreak?

569
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,647
The only man alive
who actually hacked NATO Ghost Com.

570
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,192
There was never any physical evidence
that I had anything to do with that.

571
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,527
With that...

572
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,989
That exceptional piece of work.

573
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,328
You don't know what you're missing.

574
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:50,334
- This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
- Y'all are kidding yourselves.

575
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:55,130
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU-III...

576
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,341
Krieger can get it, right?

577
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,594
May take a little time.

578
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,221
What the hell do you mean,
"a little time"?

579
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,431
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.

580
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,101
Thinking-machine laptops.

581
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,438
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes

582
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,483
with the artificial intelligence
RISC chip.

583
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,651
24 hours.

584
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,074
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

585
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,660
Luther, I guess you're
all out of excuses.

586
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,539
Hmm.

587
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:33,711
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

588
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,798
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

589
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,509
It's in what we call the stand-alone,

590
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,972
which means I'd have to be physically
at the terminal.

591
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,516
Relax, Luther.

592
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,768
It's much worse than you think.

593
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,230
The terminal is
in a black vault lockdown.

594
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,399
<i>The only person allowed in the room</i>

595
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,152
<i>has to pass through a series
of security checks.</i>

596
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,611
William Donloe.

597
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:04,366
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.</i>

598
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,038
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

599
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,417
<i>Next, he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

600
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,507
<i>And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures</i>

601
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,969
<i>are only deactivated
by a double-electronic keycard</i>

602
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,804
which we won't have.

603
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,517
<i>Now, inside the black vault</i>

604
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,394
<i>there are three systems operating...</i>

605
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,688
<i>whenever the technician
is out of the room.</i>

606
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:39,651
<i>The first is sound-sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

607
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,198
<i>The second system
detects any increase in temperature.</i>

608
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,409
<i>Even the body heat
of an unauthorized person in the room</i>

609
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,829
<i>will trigger it if the temperature rises
just a single degree.</i>

610
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:59,046
<i>Now, that temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning</i>

611
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,299
<i>coming in through an overhead duct,
30 feet above the floor.</i>

612
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,094
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

613
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,977
<i>The third system is on the floor,
and is pressure-sensitive.</i>

614
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,649
<i>The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.</i>

615
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,194
<i>And any one of these systems,
if set off...</i>

616
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,822
<i>will activate an automatic lockdown.</i>

617
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,951
<i>Now, believe me
when I tell you, gentlemen...</i>

618
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,746
<i>all three systems are state-of-the-art.</i>

619
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,044
And you really think we can do this?

620
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,216
We're going to do it.

621
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,877
We picked up alarms
in Sector 3, 7, and 12.

622
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,671
<i>Yeah, that's what I've got, too.
What sector's the air conditioning?</i>

623
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,340
<i>21, but there's no alarm
in Sector 21.</i>

624
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,259
<i>No, I gotta get in there
and shut it down.</i>

625
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,011
<i>I'm sorry,
but nobody gets into any sector...</i>

626
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,137
<i>where an alarm hasn't gone off.</i>

627
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,055
<i>You wanna blow the fire
through this whole building?</i>

628
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,766
<i>Look, no one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off...</i>

629
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,935
<i>- and it hasn't gone off in 21.
- Wait.</i>

630
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,567
<i>It's gone off. Let's go.</i>

631
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,651
Let's move.

632
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,499
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

633
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:03,837
GUARD 2:21's through here.

634
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,721
He's recruiting.

635
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,931
For what purpose?

636
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,015
Survival.

637
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,602
Too shortsighted. This guy initiates.
He's proactive.

638
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,064
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?

639
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,524
And Barnes, what the hell's that noise?

640
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,027
Uh, fire alarm, Gene.

641
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,865
Do we have to evacuate?

642
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,332
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

643
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:27,129
Krieger! Zero body count.

644
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,131
We'll see.

645
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,725
Hi there.

646
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,707
One, two, three.

647
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,918
Toast. Toast.

648
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,838
<i>- Check.</i>
- Good.

649
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,466
Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

650
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,511
<i>Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?</i>

651
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,521
Damn.

652
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,483
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.

653
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,061
He's rolling to you.

654
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,317
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

655
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:00,735
William Donloe.

656
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,003
Outer room.

657
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,092
He's coming in the vault.

658
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,391
Come on, move.

659
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,731
He's in the bathroom.

660
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,769
A-W-9...

661
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,397
<i>6-B-6.</i>

662
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,251
Holy mother of God.

663
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,212
<i>The NOC list.</i>

664
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,224
He's at the vault.

665
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,322
Four yellows.

666
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,702
One red.

667
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,172
Get moving.

668
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,717
Toast.

669
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,428
Toast.

670
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,516
<i>Merci.</i>

671
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,575
Oh, my God.

672
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,087
Yeah.

673
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,343
It's for you.

674
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,429
Kittridge.

675
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:15,873
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops, you understand?

676
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,583
It never happened.

677
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,668
What about him?

678
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:23,089
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

679
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,590
Just mail him his clothes.

680
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,047
You contacting your buyer?

681
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,384
Ethan.

682
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:15,725
Ethan.

683
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,524
Ethan.

684
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,902
Oh.

685
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,613
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt.

686
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,541
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

687
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,922
My contact is extremely shy.

688
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,469
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders. Do you?

689
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,722
Not while I'm holding this.

690
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,183
- Krieger...
<i>- Ta gueule.</i>

691
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:03,898
Don't you mean this?

692
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,233
That's not the list.

693
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,570
Oh, what's the matter?
You, you've never seen this trick?

694
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:18,871
Where'd it go?

695
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,543
It's gone.

696
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,129
What?

697
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:28,881
- You.
- No.

698
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:29,966
No?

699
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,051
Oh...

700
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,140
But not too far.

701
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,938
I know what you're thinking, Krieger.

702
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,732
You're thinking,
"Back in the computer room...

703
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,318
"I was up here, he was down there.

704
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,489
"Yes, and he was...

705
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,284
"He was carrying two disks."

706
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,664
It's so hard
to keep track of these things.

707
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:03,916
Where is it?

708
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,851
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

709
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:26,147
Try any sleight of hand with my money,
I'll cut your throat.

710
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,552
<i>You're off on one of your cushy
recruiting assignments again?</i>

711
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,846
<i>Yeah, where'd they put you up
this time, The Plaza?</i>

712
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,347
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

713
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,643
I'm so sorry.

714
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,902
Krieger was my call.

715
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,160
I'm sorry, Ethan.

716
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,084
We did what we had to do.

717
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,630
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

718
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,712
Krieger did have the NOC list?

719
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,266
Now I want you to hold on to it.

720
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:26,475
What makes you trust me?

721
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,853
Because if you knew
what you were getting into...

722
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:29,937
you never would have done it.

723
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,320
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

724
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,158
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow,
on the train.

725
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,244
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.

726
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,086
What is the range of this thing?

727
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,299
It's hard to tell.
I'm gonna have to be close.

728
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,510
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

729
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,515
<i>The unlikely setting,
a farm in the heartland of America...</i>

730
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:08,142
<i>the state of Wisconsin...</i>

731
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,227
<i>where federal agents claim to have found</i>

732
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:12,897
<i>the brains behind
an international drugs ring.</i>

733
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:16,525
<i>The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan Hunt</i>

734
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,861
<i>and her brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.</i>

735
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:22,239
<i>They were arrested this morning
by drug enforcement officers</i>

736
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:23,824
<i>in a major sting operation</i>

737
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:26,869
<i>designed to expose
the illegal manufacture</i>

738
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,580
<i>of the drug methcathinone,
known as khat.</i>

739
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,666
<i>I'm afraid what we have here is
a case of a naive and lonely widower...</i>

740
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,792
Kittridge.

741
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:03,822
Kittridge.

742
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,950
I see you've been out
visiting the folks.

743
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,369
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

744
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,873
You've been watching a little TV,
have you?

745
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:18,170
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

746
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,214
- He's in England.
- Get MI5.

747
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,383
Ethan, I wanna assure you

748
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,928
that my first order of business
after you come in

749
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,473
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped

750
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,393
and eliminated completely
from their files.

751
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,895
Look, if you come in now,

752
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,315
<i>we can plea down
the charges against you, as well.</i>

753
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,111
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?

754
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,197
Certainly, Ethan.

755
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,366
If you're dealing with someone...

756
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,911
<i>who's crushed, stabbed...</i>

757
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,956
shot, and detonated...

758
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,418
<i>five members of his own IMF team...</i>

759
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,879
how devastated
do you think you're gonna make him

760
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:04,174
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?

761
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,511
<i>I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?</i>

762
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,640
Lost him.

763
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,019
We needed three more seconds.

764
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:17,646
He wanted us to know he was in London.

765
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,120
You're a hard man to catch up with.

766
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,965
Next day I managed to drag myself
back to the safe house.

767
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,258
I must have just missed you.

768
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,470
Anyway, I checked our aliases.

769
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,138
And that's when you picked us up
in the States.

770
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,600
But you left before I could get there,
and I could check just so many places.

771
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,436
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

772
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,854
So I watched Europe.

773
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,816
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

774
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,611
You knew
I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.

775
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,571
Hey, I showed them to you.

776
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,532
I remember.

777
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,913
Jim, look, who do you think
you're kidding here?

778
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,332
A doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

779
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,917
I can sit up straight.

780
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,378
I just can't sit up straight very well.

781
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,547
Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.

782
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,509
Ethan...

783
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,722
I saw who shot me. I saw the mole.

784
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,894
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge.

785
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,231
Kittridge, Ethan.

786
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,821
Kittridge is the mole.

787
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,698
My God, of course. You're right.

788
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,790
He was at the embassy that night.

789
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,172
First, he took out Jack at the elevator.

790
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:16,849
He shot you on the bridge.

791
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,297
<i>Ethan!</i>

792
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,272
He must have had backup take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

793
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,001
How did he do Hannah?

794
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:54,780
No. No,
he could have done Hannah himself.

795
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:22,975
Why, Jim?

796
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,353
Why?

797
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,483
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable.

798
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,776
No more Cold War.

799
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,905
No more secrets
you keep from everyone but yourself.

800
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,200
Operations, you answer
to no one but yourself.

801
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,871
And then one day, you wake up,
the President of the United States is

802
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,707
running the country
without your permission.

803
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,626
The son of a bitch, how dare he?

804
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:53,046
Then you realize, it's over.

805
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:56,425
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

806
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,595
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

807
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,931
Kittridge.

808
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,727
We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch big time.

809
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,736
We won't have to. He'll come after us.

810
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,655
What's gonna make him do that?

811
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,909
What he didn't get in Prague.
The NOC list.

812
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:28,415
Whoa. Jesus, Ethan.

813
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,252
Good for you.

814
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,006
I'm meeting him tomorrow
on the TGV en route to Paris.

815
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,383
Tight security. No guns.

816
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,510
A real plus.

817
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,597
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list
to Max...

818
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,557
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

819
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,393
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

820
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,896
Krieger is gonna have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

821
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,484
Jim?

822
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,079
I was in a café waiting for you, Ethan.

823
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,042
And there she was...

824
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:16,463
standing in the rain,
alive and beautiful...

825
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,382
thinking I'm dead and gone.

826
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:25,097
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me

827
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,099
to keep going, get the job done.

828
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,438
She can't know about me, Ethan.

829
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,774
No one can, not till this is over.

830
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:37,484
You're probably right.

831
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,612
There's too much at stake.

832
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,992
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

833
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,706
- I'll call you from Paris.
- You got it.

834
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,480
What happened?

835
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,319
I sent the message to Max.

836
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,284
We're on for tomorrow.

837
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:36,460
Okay.

838
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:48,305
Come here.

839
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,640
Sir.

840
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,434
- What's this?
- Incoming, sir, for you.

841
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,145
X-ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

842
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:49,741
Gene?

843
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,916
- How long to the London Terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

844
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,626
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

845
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,374
- Yes?
<i>- Give me Max.</i>

846
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,376
It's him.

847
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,965
This was not what we discussed.

848
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,593
<i>My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.</i>

849
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,262
<i>There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.</i>

850
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,847
<i>Tear it away, you'll find the disk.</i>

851
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,717
Dear boy...

852
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,680
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

853
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:37,766
<i>Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.</i>

854
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:41,394
The mere possibility is
worth $10 million.

855
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:43,605
Baggage car, rack 3.

856
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:47,442
Silver briefcase, combination 3-1 -4.

857
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,653
<i>What about Job?</i>

858
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:53,281
Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

859
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,717
What's the matter?

860
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:15,387
- It's not transmitting.
- Try it. Try it again.

861
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,931
Damn it, I've got to get this through
before we hit the Chunnel.

862
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:33,863
- What's the problem?
- Connection denied.

863
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,701
I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

864
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,786
I always check the batteries.

865
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:42,539
Don't you give me that.
Run it through from the top.

866
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,420
This is bullshit.

867
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,213
We don't even know what Max looks like.

868
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,173
Look, we don't need to know.

869
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,426
If he's got that list,
he's gonna want to check it.

870
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,760
And that means laptops.

871
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,358
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

872
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:12,694
Hello? Hello?

873
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,572
I can't hear anything.

874
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:19,951
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's just the battery is gone.

875
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,203
It's working.

876
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:35,300
He's in the baggage car.

877
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,721
Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.

878
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,097
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

879
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:43,475
<i>The money's in the baggage car.
I'll meet you there.</i>

880
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:01,743
Barnes?

881
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,491
Ethan's right behind me.

882
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,497
Listen, Jim,
is it such a good idea to kill him?

883
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:52,919
Kittridge is here.

884
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,258
We take the money.

885
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:00,844
Ethan takes the blame.

886
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:05,348
No one else has seen you alive.

887
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,311
No one will believe him.

888
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,716
Of course...

889
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,635
I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

890
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,266
- Ethan.
- Yes.

891
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:52,228
Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

892
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:57,901
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

893
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,323
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

894
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,657
Mind telling me, Ethan?

895
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,827
Before or after I showed up in London?

896
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,580
Before London...

897
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,000
but after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

898
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:19,088
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn Gideons.

899
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,885
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

900
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,971
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk?

901
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,850
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

902
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,144
And you are the answer.

903
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:35,939
I knew about Jim.

904
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:38,107
But he didn't know about you.

905
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:40,443
In all fairness, Ethan...

906
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,613
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

907
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:47,992
But I was supremely confident,
having tasted the goods.

908
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:55,708
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife," Ethan.

909
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,879
Let's just get the money
and get out of here.

910
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:01,214
Yes, let's get the money.

911
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:05,385
Ethan, the money.

912
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,138
Give her the money.

913
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:14,352
You've earned it.

914
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,820
All $10 million.

915
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:27,115
You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.

916
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,616
Oh?

917
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,368
What's that?

918
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,597
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

919
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,518
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

920
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:01,149
You son of a bitch.

921
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,608
It's over, Jim.

922
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,285
Don't. Don't, Jim.

923
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:13,369
"Don't, Jim."

924
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:25,394
Damn!

925
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:30,399
No, it's in the tunnel!

926
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:33,444
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

927
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:35,154
Accelerate! Accelerate!

928
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,527
Red light!

929
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:41,030
Green light!

930
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:33,708
Look, we cannot just be
sitting around, okay? We need...

931
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,626
I think this is what you're looking for.

932
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:43,968
Hello, Max.

933
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,930
My lawyers are going
to have a field day with this.

934
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:50,641
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

935
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:54,103
Well, maybe we'll
just leave the courts out of this one.

936
01:43:56,814 --> 01:44:01,402
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

937
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:03,070
<i>In a freak accident,</i>

938
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:06,574
<i>a helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel</i>

939
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:10,828
<i>and collided with a high-speed train
on its way from London to Paris.</i>

940
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:14,874
<i>The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt.</i>

941
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:18,919
<i>Authorities have attributed the accident
to instrument failure.</i>

942
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:21,797
Reach your folks? How are they feeling?

943
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:22,965
About what?

944
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,178
The apology from
the Justice Department, VIP treatment,

945
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,971
you know, the whole nine yards.

946
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,433
Well, my mom was a little confused

947
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:35,102
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald

948
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:37,396
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

949
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:41,776
Cheers.

950
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:46,906
To you, Luther,
for being off the disavowed list.

951
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,449
Hey, I'm the flavor of the month.

952
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:53,287
Why don't you come back with me?

953
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,374
I just...

954
01:44:58,083 --> 01:44:59,752
I just don't know why I'd be doing it.

955
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:04,089
Gotta go catch my flight.

956
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,927
So how's it feel
to be a solid citizen again?

957
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:11,847
Man, I don't know.

958
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,101
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

959
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,854
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better...

960
01:45:19,688 --> 01:45:21,065
I'll always think of you that way.

961
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,411
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

962
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,748
Would you like to watch a movie?

963
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,501
Oh.

964
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:43,045
No, thank you.

965
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:46,090
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?

966
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,177
Aruba, perhaps?
