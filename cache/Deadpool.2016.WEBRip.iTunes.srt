1
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,850
Kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,351
Yeah, little help.

3
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:10,148
Okay, just, I have to keep my hands
on the wheel.

4
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,985
Excuse me.

5
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,946
Dopinder.

6
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,990
Pool. Dead.

7
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,617
Nice.

8
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,911
Smells good, no?

9
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,830
Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.

10
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,375
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.

11
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,504
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

12
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,842
But, Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

13
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,846
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

14
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,851
Dopinder, I'm starting to think
there's a reason I'm in this cab today.

15
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,644
Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?

16
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:52,524
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

17
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,360
When you find it, the whole world
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

18
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,363
So you gotta hold onto love...

19
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,157
tight!

20
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,160
And never let go.
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

21
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,453
-Got it?
-Yeah.

22
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,998
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

23
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,876
Sir, what does Miss Mama June
taste like?

24
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,879
-Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
-Okay, enough.

25
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,839
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

26
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,591
It's bad.

27
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,845
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

28
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,847
That's because it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

29
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,391
And I'm after someone on my naughty list.

30
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,018
I've been waiting one year, three weeks...

31
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,020
six days and...

32
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,397
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

33
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,360
And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?

34
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,736
This shit...

35
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:39,947
Boo!

36
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:01,969
They won't disappoint.

37
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,429
They'd better not.

38
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,890
And what about next month's shipment?

39
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,684
There won't be one.

40
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,269
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

41
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,896
That won't do.

42
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,736
See, we've had this small disruption
to our supply chain...

43
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,784
We'd appreciate your patience.

44
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,288
Okay.

45
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,291
We'll deliver in full the following month.

46
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,837
Pleasure doing business with you.

47
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,509
Fucking mutant.

48
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,104
Ah, shit!

49
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,522
I forgot my ammo bag.

50
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,108
-Shall we turn back?
-No, no time.

51
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,110
Fuck it. I got this.

52
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,488
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust.

53
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,239
Right here!

54
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,119
That's $27.50.

55
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,871
I never carry a wallet when I'm working.

56
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,331
Ruins the lines of my suit.

57
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,250
But, how about a crisp high five?

58
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,460
Okay.

59
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,753
Merry Christmas.

60
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,090
And a convivial Tuesday in April
to you too, Pool!

61
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,599
Shoop shooop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop

62
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,643
You're packed and you're stacked
'specially in the back

63
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,437
Brother, wanna thank your mother
for a butt like that

64
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,898
Can I get some fries
with that shake-shake boobie?

65
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,150
If looks could kill you would be an uzi

66
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,652
You're a shotgun - bang!

67
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,740
Oh, hello. I know, right?

68
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:50,494
Whose balls did I have to fondle
to get my very own movie?

69
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,122
I can't tell you,
but it does rhyme with "Polverine."

70
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:59,920
And let me tell you, he's got a nice pair
of smooth criminals down under.

71
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:04,174
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and...

72
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,885
Bad guys to kill.

73
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,559
Maximum effort.

74
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,403
Cock shot.

75
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,288
Rich Corinthian leather.

76
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,083
I'm looking for Francis!

77
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,918
Have you seen this man?

78
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,180
Yanky, yanky!

79
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,173
I've never said this, but don't swallow.

80
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,029
Shit.

81
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,657
Did I leave the stove on?

82
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,509
Now, breaking news.

83
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,429
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

84
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,723
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.

85
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,685
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.

86
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,813
The assailant appears to be armed,
dangerous, and wearing...

87
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,273
-a red suit.
-A red suit.

88
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,191
Deadpool.

89
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,944
Negasonic! Come, we have mission.

90
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,322
Colossus, wait up.

91
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,742
I've given Deadpool every chance to join us...

92
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,995
but he'd rather act like a child.

93
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,539
A heavily-armed child.

94
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,334
When will he grow up
and see benefits of becoming X-Man?

95
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,211
Which benefits? The matching unitards?

96
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,422
The house that blows up every few years?

97
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,506
Please.

98
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,884
House blowing up builds character.

99
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
You ate breakfast, yes?

100
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,555
Breakfast is most important meal of day.

101
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,768
Here, protein bar. Good for bones.

102
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,146
Deadpool may try to break yours.

103
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,947
Get out of the way!

104
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,966
Hey!

105
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,437
Wait!

106
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,898
You may be wondering,
"Why the red suit?"

107
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,858
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

108
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,110
This guy's got the right idea.

109
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,779
He wore the brown pants.

110
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,908
Fine! I only have 12 bullets...

111
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,618
so you're gonna have to share!

112
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,453
Let's count them down.

113
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:21,932
Shit.

114
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,687
Motherfucker!

115
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,106
10! Shit!

116
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:30,691
Nine. Fuck.

117
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:31,775
Eight.

118
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,318
Shit-fuck!

119
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,323
Bad Deadpool.

120
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,952
Seven. Good Deadpool.

121
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,727
Someone's not counting. Six.

122
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,546
Four.

123
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:37,925
Gotcha.

124
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,928
Right up Main Street.

125
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,141
Three, two!

126
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,060
Stupid! Worth it.

127
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,380
I'm touching myself tonight.

128
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,298
Francis!

129
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,925
Francis...

130
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,179
What the shit-biscuit!

131
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,931
Where you at, Francis?

132
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,899
You're not Francis.

133
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,368
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

134
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,048
You're probably thinking,
"My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie...

135
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,886
"but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kabab!"

136
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:08,473
Well, I may be super, but I'm no hero.

137
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,018
And, yeah, technically, this is a murder.

138
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,353
But some of the best love stories
start with a murder.

139
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,440
And that's exactly what this is.
A love story.

140
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,900
And to tell it right...

141
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,738
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeezed this ass into red spandex.

142
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:28,785
Look, would it help if I slow it down for you?
I didn't order the pizza.

143
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,623
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
Are you Mr. Merchant?

144
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,792
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant
who didn't order the fucking pie!

145
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,294
Then who placed the call?

146
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,171
I did!

147
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,925
Pineapple and olive?

148
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,386
Sweet and salty.

149
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,556
The fuck are you?
The fuck you doing in my crib...

150
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,516
Is it burnt crust?

151
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,142
God, I hope not.

152
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,645
Man, look, if this is
about that poker game.

153
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,980
I told Howie, I told him that...

154
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,984
Okay, look, just take whatever you want.

155
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,110
Thanks.

156
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,656
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

157
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,076
Jeremy, is it?

158
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,536
Wade. Wade Wilson.

159
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,665
That is a no go on the tiperoo, Jer.

160
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,166
I'm not here for him.

161
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,126
I'm here for you.

162
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,672
Okay, wow, dodged a big-time
bullet on that one.

163
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,632
Not out of the woods yet.

164
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,593
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

165
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,595
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

166
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,931
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

167
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,766
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

168
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,060
I will shoot your fucking cat!

169
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,313
I don't really know what that means.
I don't have a cat.

170
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,399
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?

171
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,697
Anyhoo, tell me something...

172
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:50,492
what situation isn't improved by pizza?

173
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,870
Do you happen to know a Meghan Orflosky?

174
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,538
Getting that right? Orflosky?

175
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,874
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

176
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,376
Because she knows you.

177
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:03,881
Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys
who take a dime to beat a fella down.

178
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,842
And little Meghan, she's not made of money,
but lucky for her...

179
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,177
I got a soft spot.

180
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,721
-But I'm a...
-A stalker.

181
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,806
Threats hurt, Jer.

182
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:16,310
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

183
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,563
So keep away from Meghan.

184
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,522
Cool?

185
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,815
Yes, sir.

186
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:22,608
Then we're done.

187
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,235
Wait. We are?

188
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,945
Yeah. We're totally done.

189
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,072
You should’ve seen your face.

190
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,407
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

191
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,783
Soft spot, remember?

192
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,370
You even look
in her general direction again...

193
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:39,124
and you will learn in the worst of ways
that I have some hard spots too.

194
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,461
That came out wrong.

195
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,796
Or did it?

196
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:58,977
Meghan?

197
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,649
You've heard the last of Jeremy.
He's sorry.

198
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,318
No friggin' way.

199
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,784
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

200
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,371
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

201
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,289
Hey, think you could fuck up
my step-dad?

202
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,000
I give a guy a pavement facial,
it's because he's earned it.

203
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,961
Hey, wait!

204
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,755
You're my hero.

205
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,299
No-no-no-no. That I ain't!

206
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,470
Nope. Never will be.

207
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,347
Fuck you, Wade.

208
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,184
I'm just a bad guy
who gets paid to fuck up worse guys.

209
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,229
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.

210
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,606
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

211
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,317
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies...

212
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,070
except we knock out the teeth
and take the cash.

213
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,156
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

214
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,033
Buck! Liefeld...

215
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:56,326
Hey, Wade!

216
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,329
Wade Wilson, patron saint of the pitiful.
What can I do for you?

217
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,123
I'd love a Blow Job.

218
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,666
Oh, God, me too.

219
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,710
The drink, moose knuckle. But first...

220
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,422
Hey, and I ain't taking
any babysitting money, all right?

221
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,299
Make sure that gets back to Ms...

222
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,341
Orlovsky.

223
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,342
Yeah, her.

224
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,635
You sure?

225
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,346
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

226
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,307
I bet you let the kid off easy, too.

227
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,267
He's not a bad kid, Weas.

228
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,685
Just a little light stalking.

229
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,187
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

230
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,147
I was traveling to exotic places...

231
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:29,193
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then...

232
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,528
Killing them.
Yeah, I've seen your Instagram.

233
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,281
So what was Special Forces
doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

234
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,866
That's classified.

235
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,202
They have a wonderful TGI Fridays.

236
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,537
All right, Kahlua, Baileys and...

237
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,872
whipped cream.

238
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,999
I give you a Blow Job.

239
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,876
Why do you make me make that?

240
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,711
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

241
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:51,215
Take that over to Buck, please,
and tell him it's from Boothe. Little foreplay.

242
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,550
Remind me what good will come of this?

243
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,636
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

244
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,220
Boothe!

245
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,222
-Easy, man.
-Hold up! Hold up!

246
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,264
What you want?

247
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,394
-Cheers. To your health.
-Fuck you.

248
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,064
Come here, you fat fuck!

249
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,565
That's a new stool.

250
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,905
Stay the fuck down.

251
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,243
Whoa! Took his ass out!

252
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,203
All right, move. Move, move, move.

253
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,287
Buck, go rest.

254
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,915
Boothe got hit then went down.

255
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,380
Yeah, he's still breathing.

256
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,592
Nobody wins today.

257
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,261
Nice try, Wade.

258
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,931
You got me. I picked Boothe
in the dead pool. Who did you pick?

259
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,933
Yeah, Wade, about that...

260
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,226
No.

261
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,478
You did not bet on me to die.

262
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,901
You bet on me to die. Wow.
Motherfucker, you're the world's worst friend.

263
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,612
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.

264
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,906
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

265
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,784
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

266
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,119
I never win anything.

267
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,287
Whatever.

268
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,913
Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!

269
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,251
Domestic, nothing imported.

270
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:17,176
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

271
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,470
Tight.

272
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,099
-Vanessa.
-Wade.

273
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,602
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

274
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,229
I'd hit that.

275
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,316
Buck, you best apologize before...

276
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,860
Yeah, that.

277
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,570
Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf.

278
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,488
-I'm sorry.
-Breathe through the nose.

279
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,699
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

280
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,992
Let go. Okay. Hey...

281
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,245
-Hakuna his tatas. He's sorry.
-I'm working on it.

282
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,247
Get out of here. Go. Go cast a spell.

283
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,250
Hey. Hands off the merchandise.

284
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,836
Merchandise?

285
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,797
So you...

286
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,257
bump fuzzies for money?

287
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,050
Yep.

288
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,343
Rough childhood?

289
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,427
Rougher than yours.

290
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,054
Daddy left before I was born.

291
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,223
Daddy left before I was conceived.

292
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,767
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

293
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,477
Where else do you put one out?

294
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,811
I was molested.

295
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,563
Me too. Uncle.

296
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,899
Uncles. They took turns.

297
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,818
I watched my own birthday party
through the keyhole of a locked closet...

298
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,237
which also happens to be my...

299
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,114
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

300
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,242
You had a dishwasher.

301
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,868
I didn't even know sleep.

302
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,163
It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags,
brownie mix and clown porn.

303
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,460
Who would do such a thing?

304
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,590
Hopefully you, later tonight?

305
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:46,348
Hey, what can I get for $275 and a...

306
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,268
a Yogurtland rewards card?

307
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,937
Baby, about 48 minutes
of whatever the fuck you want.

308
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,148
And a low-fat dessert.

309
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,449
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

310
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,911
It's time to put balls in holes.

311
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,455
You said whatever I want.

312
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,165
I get it.

313
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,126
You love skee ball.

314
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,461
Apparently more than you love vagina.

315
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,963
That's a tough call.

316
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,133
I just wanna get to know
the real you, you know.

317
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:25,012
Not the short-shorted, two-dimensional
sex object peddled by Hollywood.

318
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,138
Balls in holes.

319
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,265
Balls in holes.

320
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,933
Prepare to lose tragically.

321
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,101
Bring it, big man.

322
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,144
Okay.

323
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,863
The limited edition Voltron:
Defender of the Universe ring, por favor.

324
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,824
Okay. Here we go.

325
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,911
Had my eye on this sucker for a while.

326
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,787
And I will take the pencil eraser.

327
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,247
Okay.

328
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:55,083
You are now the protector
of the planet Arus.

329
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,085
And you can erase stuff...

330
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,462
written in pencil.

331
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,255
M'lady?

332
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,632
Well, I hate to break it to you...

333
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,509
but your 48 minutes are up.

334
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,803
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

335
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:11,350
FYI, five mini lion-bots come together
to form one super-bot, so...

336
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,811
Five mini lion-bots? Three minutes.

337
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:15,812
Deal.

338
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,148
What do we do with the remaining
two minutes, 37 seconds?

339
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,025
Cuddle?

340
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,864
How long can you keep this up?

341
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,157
All year?

342
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,711
Happy Valentine's Day.

343
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,971
Happy Chinese New Year.

344
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,347
Year of the Dog.

345
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,728
Relax.

346
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,398
And Happy International Women's Day.

347
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,072
No. No. No.

348
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,576
Happy Lent.

349
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,124
-Wade?
-Sorry.

350
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,500
Happy Halloween.

351
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:19,751
Happy Halloween.

352
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,221
Happy Thanksgiving.

353
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,433
I love you.

354
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,314
If your left leg is Thanksgiving...

355
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,024
and your right leg is Christmas...

356
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,860
can I visit you between the holidays?

357
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,614
That sweater is terrible.

358
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,325
But red looks good on you.

359
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,492
Red's your color.

360
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,286
Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.

361
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,413
Listen, I've been thinking...

362
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,289
Really?

363
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,791
...about why we're so good together.

364
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,293
Why's that?

365
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:05,797
Your crazy matches my crazy.
Big time.

366
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,928
And, we're like two jigsaw pieces,
you know, the weird curvy edges...

367
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,722
You put them together
and you can see the picture on top.

368
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:15,599
Right.

369
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,309
Wade...

370
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,562
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

371
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,106
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

372
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,276
Will you...

373
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,404
-stick it in my...
-Marry me?

374
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:33,408
Jinx?

375
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,453
Where were you hiding that?

376
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:37,496
Nowhere.

377
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,249
They say one month's salary. So...

378
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,291
You mean?

379
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,459
I do.

380
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,502
That's my line.

381
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,465
I love you, Wade Wilson.

382
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,634
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

383
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:51,510
Yes!

384
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,012
Yes!

385
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,599
I feel just like a little girl.

386
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,274
What if I just held on and never let go?

387
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,860
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

388
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,362
Star Wars jokes.

389
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,030
Empire.

390
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,702
Jesus Christ.
It's like I made you in a computer.

391
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,040
Hey.

392
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,126
Perfect.

393
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,798
-Let's see.
-All right, wee break.

394
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,133
Shake it, yeah.

395
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,515
Here's the thing.

396
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,851
Life is an endless series of train-wrecks...

397
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:44,396
with only brief,
commercial-like breaks of happiness.

398
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,066
This had been the ultimate commercial break.

399
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,780
Which meant it was time to return
to our regularly scheduled program.

400
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:54,573
What the...

401
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,825
Oh, my God. Wade?

402
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,374
You're clowning.

403
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,251
You're not clowning?

404
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,669
I sense clowns.

405
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,590
People react to news
of late-stage cancer differently.

406
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:16,178
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.

407
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:21,850
So what do we do?

408
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,686
Surely there is something we can do.

409
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,482
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer...

410
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,068
and there were all these
new experimental drugs from Germany.

411
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:35,364
Vanessa's already working on
Plan A, B, all the way through Z.

412
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:39,201
Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.

413
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,246
Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.

414
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:43,455
Or the last.

415
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:44,998
Mr. Wilson...

416
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,458
Mr. Wilson?

417
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,169
Take your time to process this.

418
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,130
It's important not to do anything rash.

419
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:08,939
Now, if I were a 200-pound sack
of assholes named Francis, where would I hide?

420
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:38,802
A hush falls over the crowd
as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson...

421
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:42,306
out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

422
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,642
His form looks good.

423
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,565
And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.

424
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,484
Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing...

425
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,778
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

426
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,281
Giving him the business.

427
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:00,782
Incoming!

428
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:05,662
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

429
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,671
Looking good, Francis. Well rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

430
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,216
Ringing any bells? No?

431
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,430
How about now?

432
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,603
Wade fucking Wilson.

433
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,398
Well, hello, gorgeous.

434
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,443
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

435
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,655
Yeah. And whose fault is that, huh, Francis?

436
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,740
Yeah, time to undo
what you did to this butterface.

437
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,785
Please, you should thank me.
Apparently, I made you immortal.

438
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,745
I'm actually quite jealous.

439
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,039
Yeah, but this ain't
a life worth living, is it?

440
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:55,254
Now, I'm about to do to you
what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90s.

441
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:58,423
Dad?

442
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:06,473
I think we can all agree that shit just
went sideways in the most colossal way.

443
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:09,476
Well, maybe not the most.

444
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,730
This is my most prized possession.

445
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,357
Wham?

446
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,234
No, no, no. Wham!

447
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:21,238
Make It Big is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

448
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,200
So, am I supposed to just smile
and wave you out the door?

449
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:26,827
Think of it like spring cleaning.

450
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,161
Only if spring was death.

451
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:32,165
God, if I had a nickel for every time
I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.

452
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,668
Sounds like you do.

453
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:39,464
Bernadette is not going anywhere,
because you're not going anywhere.

454
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,299
Drink.

455
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:43,468
You're right. Cancer is only in my liver,
lungs, prostate, and brain.

456
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,636
All things I can live without.

457
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,974
You belong here at home.

458
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:52,644
Surrounded by your Voltron
and your Bernadette, and your me.

459
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:57,441
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

460
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:05,365
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-opening-for-the-
Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.

461
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:10,662
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

462
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,665
I want you to remember me.

463
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,044
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

464
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,879
Well, I wanna remember us.

465
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,006
I swear to God,
I will find you in the next life...

466
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,218
and I'm gonna boom-box Careless Whisper
outside your window.

467
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,677
Wham!

468
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,059
No one is boom-boxing shit. Okay?

469
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,021
We can fight this.

470
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,360
Besides, I just realized something.

471
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:47,324
You win. Your life is officially
way more fucked up than mine.

472
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,746
I love you.

473
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,551
Wade.

474
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:08,971
Weas.

475
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,557
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

476
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,725
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

477
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,435
How about three shots of Patrón?

478
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:19,231
Or how about Triticum aestivum, wheatgrass.

479
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,649
Excellent for the immune system.

480
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,776
Jesus Christ. You sound like Vanessa.

481
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:23,986
Here, check it out.

482
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:27,489
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

483
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,283
I'm sure they're all FDA approved.

484
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,703
Chechnya. Isn't that where you go
to get cancer?

485
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,497
You got China and Central Mexico.

486
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:38,208
You know how they say "cancer" in Spanish?

487
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,293
No.

488
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,670
El Cáncer.

489
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,547
I could have guessed that.

490
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,465
Look how happy you look here.

491
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:49,511
Mind if I keep this? Put it up,
so I can remember when you looked alive.

492
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:51,972
At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool.

493
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,725
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

494
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:56,351
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

495
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,815
And that guy over there
came in looking for you.

496
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:04,735
Real Grim Reaper type.

497
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,737
I don't know. Might further the plot.

498
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:11,825
Boothe.

499
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,951
Wade.

500
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,249
Mr. Wilson.

501
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,918
How can I help you?

502
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,670
Besides luring children into a panel van.

503
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,382
I understand you've recently
been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

504
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,550
Stalker alert.

505
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,761
It's my job. Recruitment.

506
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,931
I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.

507
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,351
But you're a fighter. Special Forces.

508
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,728
41 confirmed kills.

509
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,688
One every seven weeks.

510
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,607
Same rate most folks get a haircut.

511
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,026
It's to wash the taste out.

512
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:49,530
It's tough to forget being so impressive.

513
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,659
And now you spend your days
sticking up for the little people...

514
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,244
People change. What do you want?

515
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,664
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

516
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:04,294
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

517
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,007
And what's more, give you abilities
most men only dream of?

518
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:16,764
I'd say that you sound like an infomercial,
but not a good one, like Slap Chop.

519
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,433
More Shake Weight-y.

520
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:21,478
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.

521
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,688
We won't just make you better.

522
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,692
We will make you better than better.

523
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:28,985
A superhero.

524
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:34,324
Look, Agent Smith,
I tried the hero business and it left a mark.

525
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,411
But if I ever hit "fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

526
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,666
Shit. We're within 500 yards of a school,
so you may wanna...

527
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,880
His drink's on him.

528
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,304
What did he say?

529
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,537
Hey, what's going on?

530
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,040
Hey. Sorry.

531
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,502
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

532
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:30,547
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

533
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:42,476
Hey, they've made three of those movies.

534
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:46,647
At some point you have to wonder
if he's just a bad parent.

535
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:04,665
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you...

536
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,918
but what it does to the people you love.

537
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,921
Who knew if this guy could save my life...

538
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,507
but I knew there was only
one way that I could save hers.

539
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,930
Isn't that what superheroes do?

540
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:36,321
Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing.

541
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,201
Pro: They pull down a gaggle of ass.

542
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,619
Local dry cleaning discounts.

543
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:46,707
Lucrative film deals, both origin stories
and larger ensemble team movies.

544
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,918
Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.

545
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,670
You know, I can hear you.

546
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:54,882
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

547
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,633
Stay right here.

548
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,094
You've been warned before, Deadpool.

549
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:03,015
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

550
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,267
You will both be coming with us.

551
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:09,229
Look, Colossus, I don't have time for the
goody two-shoes bullshit right now!

552
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,106
And you are?

553
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,568
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

554
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,071
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

555
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:19,865
That's the coolest name ever!

556
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:24,036
So, what, you're like, his sidekick?

557
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,579
No. Trainee.

558
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,080
Let me guess.

559
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,625
X-Men left you behind on what?
Shit detail?

560
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,792
What does that make you?

561
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,253
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

562
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,546
Can we trade names?

563
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,215
Can we go?

564
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,634
Look! I'm a teenage girl.

565
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,886
I'd rather be anywhere than here.

566
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,138
I'm all about long sullen silences...

567
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,642
followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

568
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,437
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

569
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:53,023
or mean comment? Go on.

570
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,567
You got me in a box here.

571
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,570
We can't allow this, Deadpool.

572
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,072
Please, come quietly.

573
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:02,407
You big chrome cock-gobbler!

574
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,450
That's not nice.

575
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:04,993
You're really gonna fuck this up for me?

576
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:09,748
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick-tips has it coming.

577
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,334
He's pure evil.

578
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,004
Besides... nobody's getting hurt.

579
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,595
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

580
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:26,807
Wade, you are better than this.

581
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:30,352
-Join us. Use your powers for good.
-Heads up.

582
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,812
Be a superhero.

583
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:32,771
Listen!

584
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:35,148
The day I decide to become
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler...

585
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:38,610
who rooms with a bunch of other
little whiners at the Neverland mansion...

586
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:43,532
of some creepy, old, bald,
Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker...

587
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,325
on that day...

588
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,619
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

589
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,163
But until then,
I'mma do what I came here to do.

590
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,958
Either that or slap the bitch outta you!

591
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,251
-Wade...
-Hey.

592
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:55,502
Zip it, Sinéad!

593
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:56,670
Hey, douche-pool!

594
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:57,921
And I hope you're watching...

595
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,428
Quite unfortunate.

596
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,058
That does it!

597
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:15,814
Canada!

598
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,233
That's not good.

599
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,359
Wade, please.

600
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:20,402
Cock shot!

601
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,031
Your poor wife.

602
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,866
You really should stop.

603
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,830
All the dinosaurs feared the T. rex.

604
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,712
I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!

605
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:39,922
This is embarrassing.

606
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,466
Please, stay down.

607
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:46,011
You ever hear of the one-legged man
in the ass-kicking contest?

608
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,513
Do you have off switch?

609
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,349
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.
Or is that the on switch?

610
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,266
Enough!

611
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,903
Let us go talk to the Professor.

612
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,197
McAvoy or Stewart?

613
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,449
These timelines are so confusing.

614
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:11,453
"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!"

615
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:13,038
You will recover, Wade.

616
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,957
You always do.

617
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:22,881
You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.

618
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:27,803
Oh, my God.

619
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:28,887
Nasty.

620
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,101
There's the money shot, baby.

621
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,520
Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.

622
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,867
Rock, meet bottom.

623
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,370
And when life ends up breathtakingly fucked...

624
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,875
you can generally trace it back
to one big, bad decision.

625
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,170
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburgh.

626
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,256
This? Well, this was mine.

627
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,258
Mr. Wilson.

628
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:12,181
Nothing warms my heart more
than a change of someone else's.

629
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,932
You finally hit "fuck it."

630
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,102
Just promise you'll do right by me.

631
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,771
So I can do right by someone else.

632
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,981
Of course.

633
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,483
And please don't make the super-suit green.

634
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,278
Or animated.

635
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,829
Move it! Keep moving.

636
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,592
This place seems sanitary.

637
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,595
My first request is warmer hands.

638
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:55,432
And, Jesus, a warmer table.

639
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,852
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

640
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:01,021
I'm thinking "pork and beans."

641
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:06,527
Easy.

642
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,822
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

643
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:12,991
I'm calling wang.

644
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,121
What's up with the matches?

645
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:21,124
Oral fixation
or just a big Stallone fan?

646
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:23,961
Patience, Angel.

647
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,630
All in good time.

648
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,590
Are you here for the turndown service,
or what?

649
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,426
We have another talker.

650
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,303
I'm just excited about my first day
at superhero camp.

651
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,514
Shut the fuck up.

652
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:40,811
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

653
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,856
I manage this workshop.

654
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,235
My welcome speech used to be
full of euphemisms like...

655
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:51,905
"This may hurt a little."
"This may cause you some discomfort."

656
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:54,241
But I've grown blunt.

657
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,910
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

658
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,622
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

659
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:04,001
into men of extraordinary abilities.

660
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,881
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly...

661
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:10,632
Wrong.

662
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,387
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.

663
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:19,558
For it to work we need to subject
you to extreme stress.

664
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,317
You've heard that whole
"make an omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?

665
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,485
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

666
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,198
I was a patient here once myself, you know.

667
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,242
The treatment affects everyone differently.

668
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,412
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

669
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:44,750
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes.

670
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,212
Also scorched my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

671
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:53,759
And, in fact, I no longer feel anything.

672
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:05,062
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

673
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:07,105
You have something in your teeth.

674
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,234
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

675
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:13,195
A little nugget of romaine lettuce
or something.

676
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,616
It's been bothering me for a long time.

677
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:20,118
Made you look.

678
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,872
Is Ajax your actual name?
Because it sounds suspiciously made up.

679
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,040
What is it really?

680
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:27,501
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

681
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:29,127
Mitch? The Rickster?

682
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:31,296
Is it Basil Fawlty?

683
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,131
Joke away.

684
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,468
One thing that never survives this place
is a sense of humor.

685
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:38,262
We'll see about that.

686
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:39,638
I suppose we will.

687
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,558
He's all yours.

688
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,809
Come on.

689
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:47,437
You're gonna leave me all alone here
with less-angry Rosie O'Donnell?

690
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:53,902
This is how it's going to work.

691
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:56,947
Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum...

692
00:44:57,573 --> 00:45:00,075
so we're going to have to
make you suffer.

693
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:06,665
If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate
and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

694
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,797
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you...

695
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:18,343
in new and different ways,
each more painful than the last...

696
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:23,348
until you finally mutate.

697
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,185
Or die.

698
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,651
You mean like a bucket list?

699
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,987
Like a fuck-it list.

700
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,698
I'd really like to light a spliff
off the Olympic torch.

701
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,159
Pass it to me right after.

702
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:48,165
Let's not forget naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

703
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:52,336
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

704
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,714
Finally, giving Meredith Baxter-Birney
a Dutch oven.

705
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:59,134
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

706
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:07,226
Making banana pancakes for my kids.

707
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:12,689
Vanessa.

708
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,570
I wanna see Vanessa.

709
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,030
You're lovely.

710
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:23,492
I don't know about anyone else,
but I'm touched.

711
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:24,660
We were just joking.

712
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:26,995
No, no. It's okay.

713
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,748
I encourage distractions.

714
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:32,876
Wouldn't want you giving up on us,
now would we?

715
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,753
Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham.

716
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,090
How tough can he be...

717
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,051
with a name like Francis?

718
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:42,761
Francis?

719
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,471
That's his legal name.

720
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:48,559
He got "Ajax" from the dish soap.

721
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:54,189
F-R-A-N-C-I...

722
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,024
Oops!

723
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:00,696
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

724
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,033
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

725
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,493
You are so relentlessly annoying.

726
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:07,578
Thanks.

727
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,871
Never heard that before.

728
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:12,165
Why don't you do us all a favor
and shut the fuck up?

729
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,209
Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

730
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,754
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

731
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:21,049
See, here's the problem
with round-the-clock torture...

732
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:24,052
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

733
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,016
Is that what you think?

734
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,815
If this doesn't unlock your mutation,
then, well...

735
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:38,942
nothing will.

736
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,362
Now, what we're going to do is lower
the oxygen concentration in the air...

737
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:45,032
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

738
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:48,493
If your brainwaves slow,
meaning you're about to pass out...

739
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,287
then we'll turn up the O2.

740
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,748
If your heart rate slows...

741
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:55,501
meaning you're able to catch your breath...

742
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,919
we'll turn it back down.

743
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:01,215
And that's where we'll leave you.
Right there.

744
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,884
And I thought you guys were dicks before.

745
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,345
You know the funniest part of this?

746
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:09,473
You still think we're making you a superhero.

747
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:13,769
You. A dishonorable discharge.

748
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,563
Hip-deep in hookers.

749
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:18,899
You're nothing.

750
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,318
Little secret, Wade.

751
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:26,240
This workshop doesn't make superheroes,
we make super-slaves.

752
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:31,078
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

753
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,247
Who knows what they'll have you doing?

754
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:37,543
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

755
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:42,548
Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.

756
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:45,509
What the fuck is wrong with you?

757
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:53,600
You're never going home after this.

758
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,853
Now there's a brave face.

759
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:58,438
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

760
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:04,695
Seriously, you actually have something
in your teeth now.

761
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:07,990
Enjoy your weekend.

762
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,075
"Weekend"? Back up.

763
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:11,326
Weekend?

764
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:55,120
Did I say this was a love story?

765
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,623
No, it's a horror movie.

766
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:16,266
Fucking hell.

767
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,561
Looks like someone lost his shot
at Homecoming King.

768
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:21,688
What have you done to me?

769
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:25,108
I've merely raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

770
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,277
You sadistic fuck!

771
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:29,488
I've cured you, Wade.

772
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:31,949
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.

773
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,827
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

774
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,665
Yeah, I've seen similar side effects before.

775
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,000
I could cure them...

776
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:47,256
but where's the fun in that?

777
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:52,135
Now, I'm gonna shut you in again, Wade.

778
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:55,889
Not because I need to.

779
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,562
Because I want to.

780
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,244
Oh, well.

781
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,495
Go ahead.

782
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:23,542
You smell like shit.

783
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:27,880
Motherfucker.

784
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,716
It's all right, it's all right.

785
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,552
I think we owe him that one, yeah?

786
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:36,180
You take off. Go on.

787
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:38,307
Off you go.

788
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:50,903
Quick question.

789
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:55,240
What's my name?

790
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,331
Didn't think so.

791
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,919
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

792
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:04,828
You don't want to kill me.

793
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,122
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

794
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,430
What's my name?

795
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:12,771
Wade.

796
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,175
I didn't just get the cure to el cáncer...

797
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,346
I got the cure to el everything.

798
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:33,268
But there was only one thing...

799
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,937
that really mattered.

800
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:05,425
Come on, let's go.

801
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,517
Oh, that must hurt.

802
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:15,978
Thank you so much.

803
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:30,158
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

804
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,618
Look at his face.

805
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,037
Oh, my God. Poor guy.

806
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,205
Honey, don't stare.

807
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:36,415
Freak.

808
00:57:56,768 --> 00:58:00,105
No way. I'm not making her life
as ugly as mine.

809
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:02,941
Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.

810
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:04,318
Bullshit!

811
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:07,613
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

812
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,199
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

813
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:12,951
Do you like what you see?

814
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:14,369
No.

815
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,832
You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

816
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,042
Yeah.

817
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,169
Not gently. Like it was hate-fucking.

818
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,129
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

819
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:27,799
and that was the only catharsis that
they could find without violence.

820
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:30,427
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

821
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:33,180
is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

822
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,140
And he's gone. Poof!

823
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,892
Yeah, well you gotta do something
to remedy this...

824
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:39,978
because as of now,
you only have one course of action.

825
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,271
Damn straight.

826
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:43,190
-Find Francis.
-Star in horror films.

827
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:44,191
What?

828
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:46,443
Star in your own horror films.

829
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:50,322
Because you look like Freddy Krueger
face-fucked a topographical map of Utah.

830
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:52,908
Here's what I'm actually gonna do.

831
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,619
I'm gonna work through his crew
until somebody gives up Francis...

832
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,038
force him to fix this,
then put a bullet in his skull...

833
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,748
and fuck the brain hole.

834
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,918
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

835
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,170
But the douchebag does
think you're dead, right?

836
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:05,921
Yeah.

837
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:07,840
That's good.
You should keep it that way.

838
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,550
What, like, wear a mask?

839
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:12,553
Yes. A very thick mask.
All the time.

840
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:14,304
I am sorry...

841
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,974
you are haunting.

842
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:18,934
Your face is the stuff of nightmares.

843
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:20,352
Like a testicle with teeth.

844
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:22,145
You will die alone.

845
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:23,814
I mean, if you could die.

846
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:26,400
Ideally, for others' sake.

847
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:27,693
That'll do.

848
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,778
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

849
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,697
like Wade the Wisecracker...

850
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:35,242
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.

851
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:37,119
Shit.

852
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:38,787
What?

853
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,623
I put all my money on you and now...

854
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,250
I just realized I'm never gonna win the...

855
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,168
Dead pool.

856
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:50,465
Captain Deadpool.

857
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:53,468
No, just...

858
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,262
-Just Deadpool, yeah.
-Just Deadpool.

859
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,264
To you, Mr. Pool.

860
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:00,058
Deadpool.
That sounds like a fucking franchise.

861
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,742
This shit's gonna have nuts in it.

862
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:18,827
Where's Francis?

863
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:34,760
Where's Francis?

864
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:44,853
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

865
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:49,107
Or wear red. Dumbass.

866
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,294
Don't make me ask twice.

867
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,047
Where...

868
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:14,216
is Francis?

869
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,510
He made me ask twice.

870
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,554
Is the mask muffling my voice?

871
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,810
Where's Francis?

872
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,273
Where the fuck is Francis?

873
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:41,326
You're about to be killed by a Zamboni.

874
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:42,578
Where's Francis?

875
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:45,122
No! Please!

876
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:49,209
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

877
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,379
You little spider monkey!

878
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:58,927
Where... is... Francis?

879
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:01,346
This is confusing.

880
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:04,349
Is it sexist to hit you?
Is it more sexist to not hit you?

881
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,685
I mean, the line gets real... blurry.

882
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,979
WHERE IS FRANCIS?

883
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:13,817
Tell me where your fucking boss is
or you're gonna die!

884
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,069
In five minutes!

885
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:27,956
Don't hesitate to call me.

886
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,766
Nice to see you, Jared.

887
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,393
I'll take the footlong...

888
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:49,728
fully loaded.

889
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,954
41 confirmed kills.

890
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:09,414
Now it's 89. About to be 90.

891
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:11,458
Mr. Wilson?

892
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:15,420
You're looking very alive.

893
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:17,297
Only on the outside.

894
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:20,884
-This is not going to end well for me, is it?
-This is not gonna end well for you, no.

895
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:22,094
Where's your boss?

896
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:23,762
I can tell you exactly...

897
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,349
Oh, you'll tell me, but first...

898
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,227
You might wanna look away for this.

899
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:31,520
Now this little piggy went to...

900
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:35,941
Thank you, Agent Smith.

901
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:40,279
Taxi!

902
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,283
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

903
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:47,661
And we all know how this turned out.

904
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,833
Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.

905
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,634
There. All caught up.

906
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,477
We're here.

907
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:16,481
Sorry about bleeding in all your garbage.

908
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:24,823
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

909
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:29,536
Some kinds of anger can't be managed...

910
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:34,666
like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!

911
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:39,838
That said, when it comes time to licking wounds,
there's no place like home.

912
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:44,927
And I share that home with someone you've met,
the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al.

913
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:46,887
God, I miss cocaine.

914
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:48,222
Her.

915
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:51,934
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

916
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:54,728
That's like 16 walls.

917
01:04:55,270 --> 01:05:00,692
She's like Robin to my Batman,
except she's old, and black, and blind.

918
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:02,402
And I think she's in love with me.

919
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:06,240
Wait, pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too.

920
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,251
Al?

921
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,921
Morning, sleepyhead.

922
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:24,716
It smells like old lady pants in here.

923
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,718
Yes, I'm old. I wear pants.

924
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,345
But you're no lady.

925
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:31,181
So comfy.

926
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:34,977
Upside of being blind:
I've never seen you in Crocs.

927
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,520
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

928
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:37,521
Yes, I know.

929
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:40,732
Downside of being blind...

930
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,943
I hear everything in this duplex.

931
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:46,530
Sit on a stick.

932
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:47,573
Bactin?

933
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:51,702
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

934
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:56,748
How's that Kullen coming along?
IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.

935
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,751
You're telling me.
I don't mind the Kullen.

936
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:01,670
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

937
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,965
Please. Anything's an improvement
over the Hurdal.

938
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:08,510
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

939
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:11,930
No, I didn't get excited
till I saw the Kullen.

940
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:13,140
Screw, please.

941
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:14,558
Here? Now? Just kidding.

942
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,809
I know it's been decades.

943
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:16,977
You'd be surprised.

944
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:18,770
Pretty grossed out.

945
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,192
Ta... Da.

946
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:32,117
I wish I never heard of Craigslist.

947
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:35,162
And I quote, "Looking for roommate,
blind to life's imperfections.

948
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,330
"Must be good with hands."

949
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,624
Or would you rather
I build the IKEA, and you pay rent?

950
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,542
Why such a douche this morning?

951
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:42,419
Let's recap.

952
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,796
The cock thistle that turned me into this freak...

953
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:46,465
slipped through my arms today...

954
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,343
Arm.

955
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:52,930
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super sexy ex back...

956
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:55,265
and prevent this shit
from happening to someone else.

957
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:59,061
So, yeah, today was about as much fun
as a sandpaper dildo.

958
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:02,523
#driveby.

959
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:22,000
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

960
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:26,213
Fucking Wade Wilson.

961
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,508
Suppose I'd wear a mask, too
if I had a face like that.

962
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,718
I only wish I healed the same.

963
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,475
Still, we'll put him out of our misery.

964
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:39,768
On our terms.

965
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:41,937
Right. And when he heals?

966
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:44,064
He can't.

967
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:46,692
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

968
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:50,696
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

969
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:53,532
I like a challenge.

970
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:57,035
But he's bad for business.

971
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,787
Now let's go find him.

972
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,668
Tylenol PM?

973
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,212
You can stick that
where you stuck the Bactin.

974
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,048
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

975
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,052
and I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

976
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,974
But I appreciate the gesture.

977
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:24,354
Am I crazy,
or is your hand really small?

978
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:26,148
About the size of a KFC spork.

979
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,527
I get why you're so pissy...

980
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:33,572
but your mood's never gonna brighten
till you find this woman...

981
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:35,032
and tell her how you feel.

982
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:38,452
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo?
She wouldn't have me.

983
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:40,203
If you could see me, you'd understand.

984
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:41,371
Looks aren't everything.

985
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:42,538
Looks are everything.

986
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,707
You ever heard David Beckham speak?

987
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,752
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

988
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,421
Think Ryan Reynolds got this far
on his superior acting method?

989
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:51,881
Love is blind, Wade.

990
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:52,591
No.

991
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:55,176
You're blind.

992
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:58,764
So, you're just gonna lie there and whimper?

993
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:00,890
No, I'm gonna wait till this arm
plows through puberty...

994
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:02,935
and then I'm gonna come up
with a whole new Christmas Day plan.

995
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:06,522
In the meantime,
you might wanna leave the room.

996
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:09,608
I bet it feels huge in this hand.

997
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:13,654
Go, go, go.

998
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:17,157
So, the doctor says, "The bad news is
you don't have that long to live."

999
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,783
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

1000
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:20,743
The doctor says, "Five."

1001
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,412
The guy says, "Five what?"

1002
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:26,332
The doctor says,
"Four, three, two..."

1003
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:35,050
Can I help you ladies?

1004
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:38,804
I do hope so.

1005
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:47,145
I heard you might be able to point me
in the direction of a friend of mine.

1006
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:48,689
Name of Wade Wilson.

1007
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:51,358
Sorry.

1008
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:52,984
I don't know the name.

1009
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,661
Hey, you're not supposed to be
behind the bar.

1010
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,292
I've seen this girl.

1011
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,836
This must be Vanessa.
I've heard so much about you.

1012
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,342
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around.

1013
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:20,512
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1014
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,682
Easy, Angel.

1015
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:25,100
Put the little man down.

1016
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,437
We have everything we need now.

1017
01:10:28,854 --> 01:10:29,897
You sure?

1018
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:33,692
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1019
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:36,403
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

1020
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:41,783
Thanks for having my back, guys.

1021
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:51,084
Wade, we have a fucking problem.
And by "we," I mean "you."

1022
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,629
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1023
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:57,007
Is there a word for half afraid,
half angry?

1024
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,176
Yeah, "afrangry," I guess.

1025
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:01,011
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1026
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:02,054
Fuck me!

1027
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:04,306
Maybe not start with that.

1028
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:13,524
Hey, coming onto our stage right now...

1029
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:15,734
give it up for Chastity!

1030
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:21,907
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1031
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:24,076
Better find her fast before numbnuts does.

1032
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:25,619
How do you know she's in here?

1033
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:28,789
Because I'm constantly stalking that fox.

1034
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:57,276
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time...

1035
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,279
Especially from this angle.

1036
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:27,806
You can't buy love,
but you can rent it for three minutes.

1037
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:33,520
You weak motherfucker!

1038
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:35,314
Come on!

1039
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:39,818
Come on, get it together.
This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa.

1040
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:45,324
Here we go.

1041
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,494
Maximum effort.

1042
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,166
Vanessa.

1043
01:12:56,668 --> 01:13:00,839
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about an old boyfriend.

1044
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,284
I knew it was you.

1045
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,038
The weird, curvy edges.

1046
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:36,458
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1047
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,387
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

1048
01:13:57,396 --> 01:13:58,939
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1049
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:02,442
I saw her head to the back.
Go get her, tiger.

1050
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,222
Motherfucker!

1051
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,600
-Wait, wait. Let's... Just...
-Cock juggling...

1052
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:36,560
-We can talk about what we're gonna...
-Jiminy! Fuck face!

1053
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:37,895
Okay, or you can hit that.

1054
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:39,771
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Fuck! Fuck!

1055
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:42,482
-No, no. All right. Hey!
-Fuck! Fuck!

1056
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:43,984
-Fuck!
-Hey.

1057
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:47,112
Relax. Relax. Okay.

1058
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,488
Okay. I think that’s a good start.

1059
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:50,616
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking...

1060
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:51,658
Wait.

1061
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,202
-Find it! Find it.
-What?

1062
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:54,661
-I'm gonna get angry.
-Okay. All right.

1063
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:56,872
All right. Okay. All right.

1064
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,248
Here. This is Vanessa.

1065
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,334
-What?
-No, wait. It's Francis.

1066
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,002
He wants you to come to him.

1067
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:04,463
-What is that?
-That's the shit emoji.

1068
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:06,965
You know, it's the turd
with the smiling face and the eyes?

1069
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,343
I thought it was chocolate yogurt
for so long.

1070
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:11,261
I need guns.

1071
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:12,471
Okay, which ones?

1072
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:13,639
I need all the guns!

1073
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,890
All right. Okay.

1074
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,037
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1075
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:40,040
We all know what I can do with 12.

1076
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,668
Hey, hey, careful with that, Ronnie Milsap!

1077
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:43,794
We're downrange.

1078
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,799
I was gonna spend the night assembling the Börje,
but this is holding my interest.

1079
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,803
I told you, we're going with the Urvaj,
not the Börje.

1080
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,847
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1081
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:57,683
Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.

1082
01:15:57,724 --> 01:15:59,476
Nah. Come on. Let's go.
Cough it up.

1083
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:01,353
Up, up, up.

1084
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:03,897
Down, down, down.

1085
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:04,648
Fuck you.

1086
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,486
.45 cal. I like it.

1087
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:12,906
Wade...

1088
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:16,827
I'd go with you, but I don't want to.

1089
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:22,541
Listen, Al...

1090
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:28,797
if I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

1091
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:34,845
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine
buried somewhere in the apartment...

1092
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:37,681
right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.

1093
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:44,479
You wanna get fucked up?

1094
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:56,074
Put her down over here.

1095
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:07,503
Go on then.

1096
01:17:09,922 --> 01:17:12,508
Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.

1097
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:16,303
Wow. You're a talker too. You and Wade.

1098
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:19,598
I've been trying to tell you assholes,
you've got the wrong girl.

1099
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,183
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1100
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:24,895
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1101
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,271
Like a cockroach...

1102
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:27,606
but uglier.

1103
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:32,110
Now, I may not feel, but he does.

1104
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:35,072
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1105
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,499
Ripley, from Alien 3!

1106
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:47,960
Fuck, you're old.

1107
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:52,089
Fake laugh. Hiding real pain.

1108
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,507
Go get Silver Balls.

1109
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:55,801
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

1110
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:58,345
Like there's something wrong with
eating before sundown or saving money.

1111
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:02,140
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

1112
01:18:02,724 --> 01:18:04,643
He's got my girl.

1113
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,061
You're gonna help me get her back.

1114
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,313
Wade? Is that you?

1115
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:12,776
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,
and I got an offer that you can't refuse.

1116
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,655
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1117
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,782
It's a big house.
It's funny that I only ever see two of you.

1118
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:22,119
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1119
01:18:25,664 --> 01:18:27,124
And that is why, in my opinion...

1120
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:30,377
the movie Cocoon
is pure pornography.

1121
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:32,671
Who brought this twinkly man?

1122
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:34,798
Twinkly, but deadly.

1123
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,886
My chrome-penised friend back there
has agreed to do me this solid.

1124
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:43,473
In exchange, I said that I would
consider joining his boy band.

1125
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:44,808
It's not boy band.

1126
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:45,893
Sure it's not.

1127
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,896
So, any luck winning Gita back?

1128
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:52,149
I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool...

1129
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:55,819
but Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1130
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,197
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

1131
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:05,078
Dopinder?

1132
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:08,040
What was that?

1133
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:15,714
That was Bandhu in the trunk.

1134
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:17,674
Ban who?

1135
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:20,511
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1136
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,221
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1137
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:26,058
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish,
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

1138
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:29,061
I did not tell him to do that.

1139
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:31,813
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1140
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:35,067
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1141
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,235
I'm so proud of you.

1142
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:38,570
Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like.

1143
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:39,530
Kill him.

1144
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,698
And then, win Gita back...

1145
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,535
the old fashioned way:
with your boyish charm.

1146
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:45,911
Kidnap her.

1147
01:19:47,454 --> 01:19:48,622
He's super dead.

1148
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:55,712
I presume a crisp high five?

1149
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:57,089
For you? 10.

1150
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:01,385
Okay, guys, let's get out there
and make a difference.

1151
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,303
You know what to do.

1152
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,890
Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!

1153
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,102
Time to make the chimi-fuckin'-changas.

1154
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:13,230
Not often a dude ruins your face...

1155
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:16,233
skull-stomps your sanity,
grabs your future baby mama...

1156
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:20,445
and personally sees to four
of your five shittiest moments.

1157
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:24,658
Let's just say, it's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

1158
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:38,964
Hey.

1159
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,299
Where's your duffle bag?

1160
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:00,569
Bandhu?

1161
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:04,239
Leave a message and have a happy day.

1162
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:05,616
God damn it!

1163
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:07,367
I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way...

1164
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:10,829
with two swords and maximum effort.

1165
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,831
Cue the music.

1166
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:31,475
Wade Wilson!

1167
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:33,644
What's my name?

1168
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:35,854
I'mma fuckin' spell it out for ya.

1169
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:39,274
Go get some.

1170
01:21:39,316 --> 01:21:40,484
Superhero landing.

1171
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:42,528
She's gonna do a superhero landing.
Wait for it.

1172
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:48,325
Superhero landing!

1173
01:21:48,867 --> 01:21:49,952
You know, that's really hard
on your knees.

1174
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:51,703
Totally impractical. They all do it.

1175
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:55,499
You're a lovely lady,
but I'm saving myself for Francis.

1176
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:56,750
That's why I brought him.

1177
01:21:56,792 --> 01:22:00,003
I prefer not to hit a woman,
so please...

1178
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:10,305
I mean, that's why I brought her?

1179
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:14,017
Oh, no, finish your tweet.
It's not... That's...

1180
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:15,644
Just give us a second. Yeah.

1181
01:22:15,686 --> 01:22:17,020
There you go. Hashtag it.

1182
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:20,232
Go get her, tiger.

1183
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:30,659
I so pity the dude who pressures
her into prom sex.

1184
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:32,911
All right, then. Fire!

1185
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:46,300
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

1186
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:47,384
Language, please.

1187
01:22:47,426 --> 01:22:48,594
Suck a cock.

1188
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,288
Look away, child.

1189
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:18,373
Look away!

1190
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:27,049
Wait!

1191
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:28,258
Wait!

1192
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,301
Cease fire!

1193
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:30,677
Cease fire!

1194
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,179
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1195
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:37,267
You only work
for that shit-spackled muppet fart.

1196
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:41,355
So, I'mma give you a chance
for y'all to lay down your firearms...

1197
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:44,399
in exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle...

1198
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:47,903
possibly even lover-like treatment.

1199
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:51,240
Fine.

1200
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,199
Commando!

1201
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:05,314
Teabag!

1202
01:25:09,902 --> 01:25:10,861
Bob?

1203
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:12,905
Wade?

1204
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:14,239
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since...

1205
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:16,575
-Jacksonville. Fridays.
-Since TGI Fridays.

1206
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:19,077
Well, what the hell!

1207
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,163
God, come here, you.

1208
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:25,292
How are the kids? Good?

1209
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:27,753
And Gail?
She's still fixing that tuna casserole?

1210
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:30,589
So good! But bad for the waistline,
if you know what I'm talking about.

1211
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:40,641
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1212
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:41,725
That is so sweet.

1213
01:25:43,185 --> 01:25:44,102
Thanks.

1214
01:25:56,365 --> 01:25:59,952
Does he write you notes too?
He's such a romantic.

1215
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,703
Don't worry, baby. I'm comin'.

1216
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,122
Fire!

1217
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:13,173
Hey!

1218
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:14,466
Climb on!

1219
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:53,046
Motherfucking...

1220
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:06,894
Motherfucker should have worn
his brown pants.

1221
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:10,856
You were right, beautiful.

1222
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:13,442
Red really is my color.

1223
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:15,319
Wade?

1224
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,236
Don't worry, baby...

1225
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:18,697
I'mma get you out of that shit-box.

1226
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:21,408
What better way to crawl back inside
that head of yours?

1227
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:23,368
Oh, you never left.

1228
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,537
But you did, asshole!

1229
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:27,039
Deep breath, darling.

1230
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:29,708
Oh, wait.

1231
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:32,377
Wrong choice of words.

1232
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:37,466
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1233
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:38,592
'Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1234
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:42,054
I hear you grow back body parts now,
Wade.

1235
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:43,430
When I'm finished...

1236
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,516
parts will have to grow back you.

1237
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:46,683
Good one.

1238
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:49,520
Yep, that was a good one.

1239
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:50,521
Let's dance.

1240
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:53,148
And by dance, I mean...

1241
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,274
let's try to kill each other.

1242
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:51,164
Fine. Fists.

1243
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,292
Sounds like your last Saturday night.

1244
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:17,292
Asshole!

1245
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,641
Hang in there, baby!

1246
01:31:15,142 --> 01:31:17,102
-Wade!
-I gotcha!

1247
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:22,482
I got a plan. You're not gonna like it.

1248
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:34,244
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1249
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:42,711
Don't worry. I'm totally on top of this.

1250
01:31:58,727 --> 01:31:59,811
Damn it!

1251
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:03,607
Maximum effort!

1252
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:46,942
Thanks.

1253
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:53,532
Just take it slow.

1254
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:06,587
Oh, my God! That was so...

1255
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:39,203
There are no words!

1256
01:33:40,245 --> 01:33:43,874
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

1257
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:45,626
What?

1258
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:50,881
You stupid fucking idiot.

1259
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:55,969
Did you really think
there was a cure... for that?

1260
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,805
What?

1261
01:33:59,264 --> 01:34:00,349
You heard me.

1262
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:03,310
No.

1263
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:04,603
No!

1264
01:34:11,777 --> 01:34:14,780
So, you mean to say...

1265
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:19,826
after all this, you can't fix me?

1266
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,538
It sounds even stupider when you say it.

1267
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:27,668
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do
the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

1268
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:33,340
Any last words?

1269
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:36,301
What's my name?

1270
01:34:37,427 --> 01:34:38,720
Who fucking cares?

1271
01:34:38,762 --> 01:34:39,555
Wade!

1272
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:43,559
Four or five moments.

1273
01:34:44,142 --> 01:34:45,143
I'm sorry?

1274
01:34:45,185 --> 01:34:47,563
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1275
01:34:48,272 --> 01:34:49,147
To?

1276
01:34:50,315 --> 01:34:51,650
Be a hero.

1277
01:34:53,652 --> 01:34:56,405
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.

1278
01:34:56,446 --> 01:35:00,033
Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero,
go to work a hero.

1279
01:35:00,826 --> 01:35:02,619
Not true.

1280
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:07,833
Over a lifetime, there are only four
or five moments that really matter.

1281
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:10,711
Moments when you're offered a choice.

1282
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:14,923
To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw,
save a friend...

1283
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:18,343
spare an enemy.

1284
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,137
In these moments...

1285
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:23,807
everything else falls away.

1286
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:27,060
The way the world sees us.

1287
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:28,437
The way we...

1288
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:33,692
Why?

1289
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,987
You were droning on.

1290
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:40,073
Sure, I may be stuck
looking like pepperoni flatbread...

1291
01:35:40,115 --> 01:35:42,910
but at least fuckface won't heal from that.

1292
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,787
If wearing superhero tights...

1293
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:47,706
means sparing psychopaths...

1294
01:35:47,748 --> 01:35:49,917
then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em.

1295
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:52,419
Not everyone monitors a hall like you.

1296
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:53,629
Just promise...

1297
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:57,424
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout
for the next four moments.

1298
01:35:57,466 --> 01:35:59,092
Oh, shit.

1299
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:05,098
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy,
about to stand in front of a girl...

1300
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,475
and tell her...

1301
01:36:06,517 --> 01:36:08,602
What the fuck am I gonna tell her?

1302
01:36:08,644 --> 01:36:11,897
Well, you better figure it out.

1303
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:14,650
I can't even tell you...

1304
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:15,776
I deserved that. That, too.

1305
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:18,278
No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

1306
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,113
Start talking!

1307
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:23,742
I'm sorry.

1308
01:36:23,992 --> 01:36:25,452
I'm so sorry.

1309
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:28,830
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1310
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:32,417
I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner.

1311
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:34,545
It's been rough couple of years.

1312
01:36:34,586 --> 01:36:35,254
Rough?

1313
01:36:43,053 --> 01:36:44,888
I live in a crackhouse.

1314
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:47,474
With a family of 12.

1315
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:50,769
Every night we spoon for warmth.

1316
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:53,856
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1317
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:59,736
There's nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

1318
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:10,038
So, you live in a house.

1319
01:37:18,881 --> 01:37:21,842
I should have come and found you sooner.

1320
01:37:23,302 --> 01:37:27,264
But, baby, the guy under this mask,
he ain't the same one that you remember.

1321
01:37:31,643 --> 01:37:32,853
You mean this mask?

1322
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:54,583
And this one.

1323
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:57,836
In case the other fell off.

1324
01:38:00,797 --> 01:38:03,091
All right. Yeah, just...

1325
01:38:03,133 --> 01:38:04,843
Like a Band-Aid, just give it a...

1326
01:38:04,885 --> 01:38:07,095
Owdie 5,000.

1327
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:08,096
Wait, wait, wait...

1328
01:38:10,057 --> 01:38:11,308
Are you sure?

1329
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:14,186
I'm sure.

1330
01:38:24,696 --> 01:38:25,572
Wow.

1331
01:38:26,949 --> 01:38:28,075
Yeah.

1332
01:38:34,998 --> 01:38:36,333
Hey...

1333
01:38:38,585 --> 01:38:40,337
After a brief adjustment period...

1334
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:42,798
and a bunch of drinks...

1335
01:38:44,216 --> 01:38:46,176
it's a face...

1336
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,266
I'd be happy to sit on.

1337
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:03,443
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1338
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:04,278
No.

1339
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:06,780
Super-penis.

1340
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:08,699
Come on, Wade. Language.

1341
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:10,325
Young one is present.

1342
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:13,287
What are you still doing?

1343
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:16,039
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

1344
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:18,876
You, go be a really big brother
to someone.

1345
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:20,669
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.

1346
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,671
And you, chicken noodle...

1347
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:24,506
nothing compares to you.

1348
01:39:24,548 --> 01:39:26,633
Sinéad O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1349
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:29,386
That's all right. You're cool.

1350
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:33,015
What in the ass?

1351
01:39:33,056 --> 01:39:36,101
That was not mean!
I'm proud of you!

1352
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:39,688
We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.

1353
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:42,858
For a second there, it felt like
we were three mini-lion robots...

1354
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,110
coming together to form one super robot.

1355
01:39:45,986 --> 01:39:47,196
There's a stupid.

1356
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:48,280
Yeah.

1357
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:56,121
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1358
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:01,001
Come here.

1359
01:40:10,886 --> 01:40:13,847
Wham! As promised.

1360
01:40:26,902 --> 01:40:28,070
See?

1361
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:31,698
You don't need to be a superhero
to get the girl.

1362
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:34,618
The right girl will bring out the hero in you.

1363
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:38,622
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot.
Pull out.

1364
01:40:38,664 --> 01:40:40,249
There we go, that looks nice.

1365
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,668
That's gonna be about the only thing
that's pulling out tonight.

1366
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:46,088
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?

1367
01:40:46,129 --> 01:40:49,967
Till next time, this is your friendly
neighborhood pool guy singing...

1368
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:55,889
I'm never gonna dance again
the way I danced with you

1369
01:47:05,843 --> 01:47:07,386
You're still here?

1370
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:13,058
It's over. Go home.

1371
01:47:14,726 --> 01:47:19,064
You're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

1372
01:47:20,107 --> 01:47:23,151
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1373
01:47:23,193 --> 01:47:25,863
With an eye patch
and a saucy little leather number?

1374
01:47:25,904 --> 01:47:27,531
Go. Go.

1375
01:47:33,787 --> 01:47:36,331
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1376
01:47:36,373 --> 01:47:39,585
For the sequel, we're gonna have Cable.

1377
01:47:39,626 --> 01:47:42,045
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1378
01:47:42,087 --> 01:47:44,381
We have no idea who we're gonna
cast yet, but it could be anybody.

1379
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:47,718
Just need a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren...

1380
01:47:47,759 --> 01:47:50,262
Keira Knightley. She's got range.
Who knows.

1381
01:47:50,304 --> 01:47:51,722
Anyway, big secret.

1382
01:47:51,763 --> 01:47:56,268
And don't leave your garbage all lying around.
It's a total dick move.

1383
01:47:57,227 --> 01:47:58,270
Go.
