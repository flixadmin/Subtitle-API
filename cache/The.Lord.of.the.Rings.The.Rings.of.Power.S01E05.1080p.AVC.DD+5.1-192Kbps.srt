
1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,075
I need your oath.

2
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:11,908
The first traces of a new ore.

3
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:14,717
Elrond has been
very convincing in his assurances

4
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:18,075
that Gil-galad bore no ill intent
when he sent him here.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,801
There is something more at work.

6
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:21,991
Go to Lindon.
Find out what.

7
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,648
You're off the Sea Guard!
All three of you!

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,533
Enough!

9
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:29,575
I just ruined my friends' lives,
shamed our family name.

10
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:33,741
Go to the Men who have taken refuge
in the old watchtower.

11
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,825
Deliver to them a message.

12
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:39,116
That your people may live
if you forsake all claim to these lands

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,825
and swear fealty to him.

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,991
One day, our true king will return.

15
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:49,325
I believe the man you hold
in your dungeons is the lost heir in exile

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
to the throne of the Southlands.

17
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,450
I call on you to fight with me...

18
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,075
- I will serve!
- I will serve!

19
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:57,616
...before Sauron
claims their lands for his own.

20
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:04,075
You have lied, brought a dangerous
outsider into our midst.

21
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,033
We're going to be left behind.

22
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,833
This is how we keep up
with the others.

23
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,158
He helps us, and... and we help him.

24
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:04,283
My great thumb. My great thumb.

25
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,200
No. Mi... Migration.

26
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,783
Like, mi-gra-tion.

27
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,991
Means, like, to move.
What we do, Harfoots.

28
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:17,075
You see, we... we winter in Old Forest,

29
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,158
and mid-summer, we make for Norfield Glen
to snail while the snailing's good.

30
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,200
- "Snails, snails"?
- Snails, yeah.

31
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:26,866
And at the first blush of the oak leaves,
we head to the Grove.

32
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,575
A whole orchard,

33
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:31,158
popping with bar apples, plums,

34
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,658
apricots, carrots,
you'll... you'll love it.

35
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:40,033
Of course, the only trouble is there's
a hundred perils between here and there.

36
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:44,700
"Perils"?

37
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,908
Like a danger.

38
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,158
You know, big folk, wolves, fog, rain,

39
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:55,700
hill-trolls, cave-trolls,
anything that'll kill ya.

40
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,783
"Kill"?

41
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,908
Means to make somethin' dead.

42
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:17,908
I'm peril.

43
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:21,700
No. No, no, you're not.

44
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,950
- It's more...
- No. Fireflies.

45
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,658
That was just an accident. It's...

46
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:29,283
You're not a peril.

47
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,491
You're good.

48
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,075
I'm good?

49
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:40,158
You're good.
Because you're here to help.

50
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,783
Nori!

51
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,283
Oh, great.
Others should be ready by now.

52
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:50,908
Quick sticks!

53
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,491
Let's go.
Come on.

54
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,408
I... I'm...

55
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,741
I'm good.

56
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,491
Poke me with that crutch again,

57
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,991
I'll pluck the hair off your toes
in your sleep.

58
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,283
And I'll pluck off my ears
while you're at it.

59
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,325
It'd save me listenin' to your snorin'.

60
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,741
Oh, stuff.
I do not snore.

61
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,950
Yes, you do.

62
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,950
Come on, now.
Grove's not gonna migrate to us.

63
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:25,033
Might help us move faster
if you sang us your mam's walking song.

64
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,658
Yeah, go on, Pops, give us a warble.

65
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,825
Oh, come on, it'll do us some good.

66
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,325
The sun is fast fallin'

67
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:39,116
Beneath trees of stone

68
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:42,866
The light in the tower

69
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,991
No longer my home

70
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:48,950
Past eyes of pale fire

71
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,283
Black sand for my bed

72
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,866
I trade all I've known

73
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,283
For the unknown ahead

74
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:04,950
Call to me
Call to me lands far away

75
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:11,450
For I must now wander this wandering day

76
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:14,575
Away I must wander

77
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:18,283
This wandering day

78
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:22,075
Of drink I have little

79
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:24,991
And food I have less

80
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:30,950
My strength tells me no
But the path demands yes

81
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:37,241
My legs are so short
And the way is so long

82
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:40,325
I've no rest nor comfort

83
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:44,908
No comfort, but song

84
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:50,783
Sing to me, sing to me
Lands far away

85
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:56,700
Oh, rise up and guide me
This wandering day

86
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,158
Please promise to find me

87
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:04,241
This wandering day

88
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:08,241
At last comes their answer

89
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,033
Through cold and through frost

90
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:16,741
That not all who wonder or wander are lost

91
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,200
No matter the sorrow

92
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:23,408
No matter the cost

93
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,991
That not all who wonder

94
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:31,033
Or wander are...

95
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:36,116
Lost

96
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,158
The tunnel is complete, my lord.

97
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:48,158
Your arm.
Show it to me.

98
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,866
How does it feel?

99
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,283
Like fire, Lord-father.

100
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:06,950
I wish you could feel it like I do.

101
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:10,950
For soon, it will be gone.

102
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:17,866
And with it, the part of me
that knew its warmth as well.

103
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,075
I shall miss it.

104
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,533
Summon the legions.
It is time.

105
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,908
Our enemy vows to attack.

106
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,741
In exchange for mercy,

107
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,533
we've been ordered to abandon this tower

108
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,783
and swear fealty to their commander.

109
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,825
I know I'm not the king you have awaited.

110
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,908
But if you choose
to stand with me and fight,

111
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:24,408
this tower will no longer
be a reminder of our frailty,

112
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,741
but a symbol of our strength.

113
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:32,575
Who will stand with me?

114
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,616
Who among you will stand and fight?

115
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:47,301
- Aye, let's do it.
- Aye.

116
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,866
Stand and fight?

117
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,116
Stand and fight?

118
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:56,116
You will die.

119
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,950
I say it'd be better to take our chances

120
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,950
bowing to the supposed enemy.

121
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,200
I have looked that enemy in the eye.

122
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,700
He's not your deliverance.

123
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:10,491
You think you are?

124
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:12,741
Elf?

125
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,408
I'll say this for our ancestors.

126
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,450
They lived!

127
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,075
Together, we can survive this.

128
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,991
Follow me, and together, we will!

129
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,658
Come on. Let's go.

130
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:35,866
Come on. Follow me. Come on!

131
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,950
Come on!

132
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,241
Follow me!

133
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:45,200
Theo!

134
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:49,200
It's our chance.
It's our time. Come on.

135
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:52,325
With me. Come on, lad.
Follow me, lad.

136
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,533
Right. Okay.
Give me a hand, will ya?

137
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:09,116
Higher. Higher!

138
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:18,283
Enough for that run, lads.

139
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,616
Ferry it out now.

140
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,116
- Father.
- Isildur.

141
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,533
May we speak?

142
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,575
Why wasn't I chosen for the expedition?

143
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,283
- Thought you were going west.
- Not anymore.

144
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,741
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

145
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,741
And what is that?
In your words.

146
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,033
I don't have words for it.

147
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,450
That's why I'm trying so hard to find it.

148
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,075
Why I'm asking for your help.

149
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:59,575
Wish I could provide it.

150
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:03,075
But we've far more volunteers
than we could ever hope to accommodate.

151
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,408
Half the city wants a spot on those boats.

152
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:10,575
Slip me to the front of the line.

153
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,700
What are your qualifications?

154
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,283
- "Qualifications"?
- Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

155
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:21,908
- You know I'm twice the sailor...
- Do you belong to the Sea Guard?

156
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:25,241
What about the Queen's Guard?
Merchant's Guild?

157
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:26,676
- This is about uniform.
- Horseman's Guild?

158
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
You're being absurd.

159
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:30,700
While you were feigning fidelity
to the traditions of this isle,

160
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:33,741
these men were living them.

161
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:38,075
Finding ways to contribute.
To serve.

162
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,408
Something of which
you evidently care little.

163
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,491
I care.
I'm ready to serve.

164
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,700
Nothing would make me prouder.

165
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:53,241
But you had your chance.

166
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,700
And you made your choice.

167
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:04,759
Risk Númenorean lives

168
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:07,825
for some grimy Southlander
and a warmongering Elf?

169
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,051
Consul Pharazôn!

170
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,616
Why are you sending
our kinsmen off to die?

171
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,616
Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

172
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,908
- Pharazôn!
- Come with me.

173
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,783
Forgive me for not sending word to you sooner.
Been a trying week.

174
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,283
Why didn't he stop this?

175
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,616
- He's loyal to her. Rightly or...
- Wrongly.

176
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,575
There are many who feel as you do.

177
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,801
Not enough to sway him yet,
but given the right push...

178
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:32,950
Then it must be you.
He will listen to you.

179
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:37,450
When I speak, his ears close up.

180
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:43,575
So speak louder.

181
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,991
Oi, Southlander.

182
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,325
You have visitors.

183
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,283
And where did the enemy head next?

184
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:46,075
Further south, I should think.
Towards the watchtower of Ostirith.

185
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,783
I'll inform the Sea Guard.

186
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,658
My thanks, Lord Halbrand.

187
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:01,450
I'm certain your fellowship will prove
just as invaluable once we make landfall.

188
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,283
"Landfall?"

189
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:08,741
Galadriel informed us of your aspiration
to unite your people.

190
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,200
Did she now?

191
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,200
I trust she was not speaking in haste?

192
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,908
As a matter of fact,
it was my intention...

193
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,408
My companion is merely feeling
the weight of his task.

194
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,908
I have no doubt, come time,
he will do his part.

195
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,533
Given that I've staked my name upon it,
I should hope so.

196
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,700
Queen Regent, your father
has requested your presence in the tower.

197
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,366
"Galadriel informed us."

198
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,700
I wondered how the queen knew
to waylay me at her father's bedside.

199
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,408
It never occurred to me
you'd hand me over for a guild crest.

200
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,241
You used me.
After I all but begged you to let me be.

201
00:16:56,325 --> 00:17:00,408
I have just convinced Númenor
to send five ships

202
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,325
and 500 men to aid your people

203
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:05,908
and place a crown upon your head.

204
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,283
Many might assume you used me.

205
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,033
Find another head to crown.

206
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,325
I don't like it here.

207
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,075
Oh, it's okay, Dil.
It's just the trees.

208
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,033
What madness made them go this way?

209
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,783
Rockfoot Pass must be blocked in.

210
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:47,283
Won't get any easier in the dark.
Keep movin'.

211
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,116
"Easier in the dark."

212
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,283
Wolves.

213
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,950
Why don't you tell me
what's really goin' on?

214
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:23,825
These woods have never been
this bare this time of year.

215
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:25,366
It's as plain as lip fungus.

216
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,741
He is responsible, isn't he?
The big fella.

217
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:30,033
What precisely do you expect me
to do about it?

218
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:32,366
What you ought
to have done at the camp.

219
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,075
Take their wheels and leave them!

220
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,116
What's it gonna take?

221
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,616
Make a widow of somebody?

222
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,283
Or an orphan?

223
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,741
People are gettin' hungry.

224
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,950
Stay close.

225
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:57,908
Hmm.

226
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:07,033
Oh, this is very strange.
Most peculiar.

227
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,450
Most peculiar.

228
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,533
Oh!

229
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,950
- You nearly caused my heart to burst.
- Malva.

230
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,616
- We saw footprints.
- In the mud.

231
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,075
- Lots of 'em!
- One at a time, please!

232
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:39,366
Run!

233
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,783
Come on! Run!

234
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,200
Nori!

235
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:10,658
Nori! Nori!

236
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,408
Nori, get away from there!

237
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,491
Nori! Nori!

238
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:17,575
No! It'll get you!

239
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,366
Hold your ground, Ontamo.

240
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,408
Make your father proud.

241
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,283
Their strokes fall like the Stone-giants
of the North Moors.

242
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,116
And yet?

243
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,575
They are untested against this foe.

244
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:33,908
Perhaps the Elf would be willing to offer
some instructions?

245
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,450
There are many ways to kill an Orc.

246
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:48,075
But for you,
I will keep it strong and simple.

247
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:51,408
Stab, twist, gut.

248
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:55,366
Come at me.

249
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,575
We will see who can score flesh.

250
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:02,491
Anyone that does, I will promote...

251
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,491
To lieutenant.

252
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:53,116
Swordsmanship is about balance,
rather than strength.

253
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,116
Fight with your feet.
Not your arms.

254
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:17,658
The Elf is fighting a soldier
in the square.

255
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:41,366
Don't plant roots.

256
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:43,783
Keep moving.

257
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,866
Never trust brute force to best an Orc.

258
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:16,075
It's often easiest to outmaneuver them.

259
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:22,825
Well done, Lieutenant.

260
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,366
Never known a smith's aide
who could do that.

261
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:56,741
It's not too late to stop this.

262
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:00,616
Your cousin may hold the scepter,
but it's you the people follow.

263
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,116
- With their help you could...
- Could what?

264
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,283
Assert your influence.

265
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:09,658
Sometimes the folly of youth is enough
to make an old man weep.

266
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:18,325
Is it folly to try and stop a war?

267
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,741
It's folly to kick against the current.

268
00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:25,866
You see, the tide may rise
and drown a man,

269
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,783
or fall and sweep him out to sea.

270
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:32,825
The trick of mastering the current
is to know which way it will turn next.

271
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,283
You all but single-handedly
prevented our last king

272
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,116
from dragging us back to the old ways.

273
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,283
Don't tell me you couldn't
sway Míriel's mind now.

274
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:42,533
And what makes you think Míriel's mind
and my own are not as one on this?

275
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:45,741
Because my father would sooner die
than take orders from an Elf.

276
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,658
"Orders from an Elf"?

277
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:21,241
When all this has ended,
Elves will take orders from us.

278
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:25,533
Now, my cousin can go to war
for Galadriel if she wishes.

279
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,158
I go to war for Númenor.

280
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,450
How could this be for Númenor?

281
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:33,866
Have you learned nothing?

282
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,908
Soon, we will save
the low men of Middle-earth,

283
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,283
lift them up, and give them
the king they've long awaited.

284
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:43,783
A king who will be forever in our debt.

285
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,283
Now, contemplate, if you can,
how that might benefit us.

286
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:54,491
Ores, forests, trades, tribute...

287
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,908
I wouldn't dare stop that.
Not for all the salt in the sea.

288
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,366
And neither should you.

289
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:12,158
The kingdom!

290
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:15,991
- The kingdom is in danger. I must...
- The danger has passed, Father.

291
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:20,491
We are doing now
what you always believed we must.

292
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:23,908
We're restoring our connection
with the Elves.

293
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:28,116
I'm going to Middle-earth.

294
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,908
Míriel?

295
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,033
Yes, Father.

296
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:46,950
It's me.

297
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:53,741
Don't go to Middle-earth.

298
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,075
All that awaits you there is...

299
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,783
What, Father?
What awaits me?

300
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:06,575
Darkness.

301
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,700
Can you believe it?

302
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,450
Everyone's talkin' about what you did.

303
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,575
Never seen 'em take a shine
to an outsider like this before.

304
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,575
Brought you some beeswax.

305
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:33,658
Slather some on that paw,
should help with the tenderness.

306
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,200
Hey.

307
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:10,991
Stop.
Please.

308
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:18,408
To an enduring union
between our two great peoples,

309
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:20,408
Khazad and Noldor.

310
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:22,616
- To the union.
- To the union.

311
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,658
Before our wines ascend,

312
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,033
Lord Durin, I should like to commend you.

313
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:33,116
Khazad-dûm has been called the quietest
of Dwarven kingdoms,

314
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,991
but in recent months,
your furnaces are said to be burning

315
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:40,533
as bright as the eyes of Aulë himself.

316
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:42,825
Your mines delving ever deeper.

317
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:47,658
To what do you credit
this new invigoration?

318
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:51,575
I might ask the same of Lindon.

319
00:30:53,158 --> 00:30:56,783
Shipping off its warriors,
expandin' its cities.

320
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:00,450
Bit sudden for Elves, no?

321
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:05,283
Typically takes you people weeks
just to decide to take a sh...

322
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,741
If I may...

323
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,033
The hand of time crawls
so slowly for our kind.

324
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:15,200
We often overlook the years of effort
we perceive as taking but a moment.

325
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:18,116
In so doing, I would not wish
to offend our guest.

326
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,450
I would think our Dwarven friend
far too stout of heart

327
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:24,366
to be offended by an honest inquiry.

328
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,491
I have an honest inquiry for you.

329
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:34,200
From where did you procure the table?

330
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,866
Why do you ask?

331
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,533
This stone grows only at certain depths.

332
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,950
So rarely do our resonators
locate a deposit.

333
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:48,575
We consider each to be a precious gift.

334
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:55,783
We reserve its use
for the most sacred purposes.

335
00:31:57,241 --> 00:32:00,241
Monuments or tombs,

336
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:03,491
to our honored dead.

337
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,866
Please forgive our sacrilege, Lord Durin.

338
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:22,408
We shall have to send it home with you,
so it can be treated with proper respect.

339
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:30,075
It's good to know there's still
some honor left among the Elves.

340
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,200
Your Grace.

341
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:37,116
To the union of our two peoples, then.

342
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,366
To the union.

343
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:51,325
Your loyalty to the Dwarf is admirable.

344
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:55,116
Loyalty to a friend
ought to be expected.

345
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,908
Regardless of his race.

346
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:00,200
Does it justify lying to your king?

347
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:03,325
I wonder, High King, if it is in fact you
who has been lying to me.

348
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,908
I went to Khazad-dûm with a proposal
of friendship, but in truth,

349
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,616
you sought something far more tangible,
didn't you?

350
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,950
Are you familiar with
The Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir?

351
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,783
Recount it for me, please.

352
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,783
An obscure legend regarded by most
to be a apocryphal.

353
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:30,116
Recount it, Elrond Peredhel.

354
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:35,908
It speaks of a battle,

355
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,950
high among the peaks
of the Misty Mountains.

356
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:43,700
Not over honor or duty.
But over a tree.

357
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:47,033
Within which some claim
was hidden the last of the lost Silmarils.

358
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:03,408
On one side,
fought an Elven warrior,

359
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,158
with a heart as pure as Manwë,

360
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:08,991
who poured all of his light
into the tree to protect it.

361
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,366
On the other, a Balrog of Morgoth,

362
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,825
who channeled all his hatred
into the tree to destroy it.

363
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:20,825
Amidst their duel unending,
lightning ensnared the tree...

364
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:27,741
Forging of their conflict, a power...

365
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:32,825
A power as pure and light as good.

366
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:35,908
As strong and unyielding as evil.

367
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,908
They say it seeped down the roots
into the mountain depths,

368
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:43,991
where for centuries now, it has waited.

369
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,533
Durin was right.

370
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,950
Then you admit the Dwarves did find it.

371
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,116
The ore containing the light
of the lost Silmaril.

372
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,033
I admit only this.

373
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:56,991
I promised Durin never
to reveal his people's secrets.

374
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:00,866
And what if keeping
your promise to his people

375
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:04,450
meant ensuring the doom of your own?

376
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,825
We first took notice of it
just prior to Galadriel's return.

377
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,700
We hoped that by sending her away,

378
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:48,491
and so bringing an end
to the last vestiges of war,

379
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:50,783
we might arrest the decay.

380
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,700
But despite our every effort,

381
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,700
our decline has only quickened.

382
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,908
The blight upon this tree
is but an outer manifestation

383
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:03,533
of an inner reality.

384
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,533
That the light of the Eldar,

385
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:10,033
our light, is fading.

386
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,408
Who else knows about this?

387
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,408
Precious few.

388
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,700
I ask again, and for the last time,

389
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,700
did the Dwarves find the ore or not?

390
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:35,450
I swore an oath to Durin.

391
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:42,116
To some, that may now hold little weight.

392
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:47,075
But in my esteem,

393
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,658
it is by such things
our very souls are bound.

394
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,783
I do not intend to let mine slip away
on the basis of mere hope.

395
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:02,450
Hope is never mere, Elrond...

396
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,450
even when it is meager.

397
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:08,991
When all other senses sleep,

398
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:13,366
the eye of hope is first to awaken,
last to shut.

399
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:18,950
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth now,

400
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:24,408
the armies of darkness will march
over the face of the earth.

401
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:25,741
It will be the end,

402
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:29,950
not just of our people, but all peoples.

403
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,533
If the hope of preventing
that is not reason enough

404
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:37,075
to make you reconsider your oath,

405
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:40,075
I suggest you find another.

406
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:10,616
What was the land immortal hands

407
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,950
Rose up from Sundering Sea?

408
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:17,366
Land of the gift, land of the star

409
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,866
To shine eternally?

410
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,408
'Twas Númenor
Fair Númenor

411
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:27,825
Bright isle filled with grace...

412
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,033
I said it won't be dangerous.

413
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:34,991
I wager it'll all be over
by the time I get off the boat.

414
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:36,450
Just don't tell my father.

415
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:40,450
He keeps crowing to everyone with ears,
his future son-in-law's a war hero.

416
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,116
Sing! Come on, sing.

417
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,908
You remember the words, don't you?

418
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:47,950
After hearing you squawk them all night,
I fear I'll never forget them.

419
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:52,491
Perhaps Isildur will sing with you.

420
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:54,658
Oh, bless our every breath...

421
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,033
This should be interesting.

422
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:59,825
Make our great land to ever stand

423
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:02,075
Our swords to conquer death

424
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:05,033
- The answer's no.
- I haven't said anything yet.

425
00:39:05,116 --> 00:39:06,325
I've known you 15 years.

426
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,248
You think I don't know
what you're here to say?

427
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:11,158
- It's actually 16, but I mean...
- Ontamo.

428
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:13,700
Right.
What have I come to say?

429
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,408
A fairly lavish apology,
which Ontamo, of course,

430
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:17,825
would've accepted instantly,

431
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:19,009
but I wouldn't have.

432
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:20,533
And do you know why?

433
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:25,575
You're only apologizing because you think
now that I've been promoted,

434
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:27,491
I can get you on the expedition.

435
00:39:31,908 --> 00:39:33,366
- Can you?
- Right.

436
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,116
I'd just like to say,
I wouldn't have accepted instantly.

437
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,176
- But I am glad that you apologized.
- No, he didn't.

438
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,491
I did!

439
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:44,575
But I'll gladly do it again.
I'm sorry I started the fight.

440
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:48,408
Now please bring me with you.

441
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:50,783
No.

442
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,283
What'll it take to make this right?

443
00:39:56,408 --> 00:39:57,825
Fine, you get a free hit.

444
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:01,325
Jaw, gut, your choice.
One hit.

445
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,033
Three.

446
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,658
Uh, two.

447
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:09,491
Actually...

448
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,200
That felt like three.

449
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:23,200
So, you'll bring me on the ship?

450
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:27,158
Isildur, you're my oldest friend.

451
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:31,950
And if you want to know the truth,
you're probably still my best, but...

452
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,533
- What?
- Ontamo, please.

453
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:36,950
I can't, in good conscience, stake my name

454
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:40,116
recommending you for a duty
that you might well decide to abandon.

455
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,325
- It'll be different this time.
- Hmm.

456
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:45,825
One day, I hope it will be.

457
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,283
One day, I hope you find something

458
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,700
that you would be willing
to sacrifice anything for.

459
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:58,283
I'll take care of Berek for you.
I promise.

460
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,033
Berek's going?

461
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,783
The horsemaster recruited him.

462
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:07,700
Sorry, Isil.
The sea is always right.

463
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:59,950
Are you stowing away?

464
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,825
Are you about to burn the boat?

465
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:12,825
Get out of here this moment.
I won't let anyone know I saw you.

466
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,158
- Hand me the lantern.
- Don't.

467
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:17,825
Give it.

468
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:53,366
Gather every hand.
Hurry!

469
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,491
Get them out.
Quickly.

470
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,575
Get them out!
Isildur?

471
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:09,450
Isildur?

472
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
What happened?

473
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,783
He was in a fishing boat.
A cask must've gone up.

474
00:43:15,866 --> 00:43:17,783
A cask?

475
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:21,866
He saved my life.

476
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,533
He could've just left,
but he saved my life.

477
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:25,866
Captain!

478
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,283
We have reason
to suspect a passing brigand,

479
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:47,283
but we've yet to identify him.

480
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:50,950
We're fortunate we didn't lose
the rest of the ships as well.

481
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:54,783
This was clearly an attempt
to kindle your doubts, Queen Regent.

482
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:58,158
- Do not let it.
- I'm forced to disagree with the Elf.

483
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:00,658
Perhaps we did act in haste.

484
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,200
A kingdom should be led.
Not dragged.

485
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:05,075
I recommend we delay the voyage

486
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:07,866
until we've had time enough
to win more hearts to your cause.

487
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,950
Our enemy grows stronger every day.
Perhaps every hour we hesitate.

488
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:15,325
Remember why you chose this path.
Remember your faith.

489
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:17,533
Do you think I could forget?

490
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:22,491
- We still have three ships.
- And your father's blessing.

491
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:27,908
What of Lord Halbrand?

492
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:30,241
He awaits our departure.

493
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:31,741
I'm sure he does.

494
00:44:35,908 --> 00:44:37,991
Shall I tell the Sea Guard to stand down?

495
00:44:44,366 --> 00:44:48,408
This council will reconvene at first light
to make a final decision.

496
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,783
See to it Lord Halbrand attends.

497
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,291
What have you been
able to ascertain?

498
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:05,950
Elrond, forgive me.

499
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:07,825
Forgive you?

500
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:09,283
That I did not tell you sooner.

501
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,408
You knew.

502
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,533
I begged him to allow you
into our confidence from the start,

503
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,700
but the High King forbade it.

504
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:27,075
And this... this mithril...

505
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:30,950
It is our only salvation?

506
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:35,075
Elrond, I have tested it
under every duress.

507
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:38,950
Nothing diminishes its light.

508
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:44,408
We believe if we can secure
vast quantities of it quickly,

509
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:49,908
enough to saturate every last Elf
in the light of the Valar once more...

510
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:53,908
Then, yes.

511
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:58,200
Yes. It very well could be.

512
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:09,450
I am sorry.

513
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,283
That the High King deceived me?

514
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,700
Or that now our people are doomed
unless I break an oath?

515
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:21,908
And betray a friend?

516
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:29,200
I was there, Elrond,
the night your father set sail.

517
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:37,241
A mortal man, who believed
he could convince the very Gods

518
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:40,866
to come to war in our aid.

519
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:46,158
I heard your mother
pleading with him not to go,

520
00:46:46,241 --> 00:46:50,075
asking him, imploring him, why,
why must it be him?

521
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:54,075
And do you know what he said?

522
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:02,075
Because he was
the only one who could do it.

523
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:25,741
I was wrong to use you.

524
00:47:26,825 --> 00:47:28,241
For that, I'm sorry.

525
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:33,491
Tomorrow, the queen
will call you to audience.

526
00:47:33,575 --> 00:47:37,741
Your voice at that meeting may well decide
whether this mission stands or falls.

527
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,741
- Help me.
- I think I've helped you quite enough.

528
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,033
Then help yourself.

529
00:47:45,783 --> 00:47:48,700
Stop fighting me, and together,
let us fight them.

530
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,700
Not so long ago, men like me
were fighting alongside them.

531
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:55,450
Men like you.
Not you, yourself.

532
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,116
You're wrong.

533
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:11,700
You don't know what I did
before I ended up on that raft.

534
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,366
You don't know how I survived.

535
00:48:27,325 --> 00:48:28,825
How we all survived.

536
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:38,408
And when these people discover it,
they will cast me out.

537
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:41,616
So will you.

538
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:48,616
Sometimes to find the light,
we must first touch the darkness.

539
00:48:52,408 --> 00:48:54,158
What do you know of darkness?

540
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,033
Whose dagger was it, Galadriel?

541
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:02,533
Who is it you lost?

542
00:49:03,783 --> 00:49:04,783
My brother.

543
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,700
What happened to him?

544
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,408
He was killed.

545
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:10,741
In a place of darkness and despair.

546
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:13,533
By servants of Sauron.
Is that enough for you?

547
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:15,116
So this is about vengeance?

548
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,575
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking seawater.

549
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:20,200
Then what is it?
Why do you keep fighting?

550
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:24,366
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

551
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:27,575
The least you can do is tell me why.

552
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:31,116
Why do you keep fighting?

553
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,950
Because I cannot stop.

554
00:49:47,033 --> 00:49:49,325
The company I led mutinied against me.

555
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,908
My closest friend conspired
with the king to exile me.

556
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,325
And each of them acted as they did...

557
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:06,616
Because I believe
they could no longer distinguish me...

558
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:10,158
from the evil I was fighting.

559
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:17,366
I'm sorry.

560
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,200
For your brother.

561
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:24,658
For all of it.

562
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,950
I'm sorry.

563
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:30,825
Your sorrow cannot ease my pain.

564
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:35,116
And nor will a hammer and tongs
ease yours.

565
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,366
There is no peace
to be found for you here.

566
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,950
And nor for me.

567
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:43,450
No lasting peace in any path,

568
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:45,866
but that which lies across the sea.

569
00:50:47,533 --> 00:50:50,533
I have fought for centuries,
seeking to earn mine.

570
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:54,033
This is how you earn yours.

571
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,283
Long have I awaited this day.

572
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,450
The day your kind would return at last,

573
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:25,950
lift us up from the muck and the filth,

574
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:30,908
to take our rightful place at your side.

575
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,616
I pledge my undying service to you.

576
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:43,200
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

577
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:05,908
You are Sauron, are you not?

578
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:18,533
Hey, hey... Wait...

579
00:52:21,991 --> 00:52:24,783
I'll serve you, then.
Whoever you are.

580
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:39,991
Only blood can bind.

581
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:49,825
Waldreg?

582
00:52:58,283 --> 00:52:59,533
Waldreg...

583
00:53:02,158 --> 00:53:03,825
Waldreg, no.

584
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:06,366
No.

585
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:08,825
No.

586
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:11,783
No.

587
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:14,116
No.

588
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:16,116
No!

589
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,366
Lift your aim next time.

590
00:53:24,325 --> 00:53:26,533
And don't be so afraid of the string.

591
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,033
Why bother trying to teach me?

592
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,616
Because it took me over 200 years

593
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,366
to develop the bravery
that's keeping me standing here tonight.

594
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:40,616
You found it in only 14.

595
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,533
And we're going to need it
in the fight to come.

596
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:45,991
All my life,
your kind has watched us.

597
00:53:46,075 --> 00:53:47,825
Counting every whisper.

598
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,783
Every kitchen knife too sharp.

599
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:54,616
We're all about to be buried in this tower.

600
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,491
So why be buried with us?

601
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:01,200
Because in counting the whispers
and the knives,

602
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,908
I've come to know the voices
and the hands of those behind them.

603
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,700
Half of us just left.

604
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:10,616
But half stayed.

605
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:13,158
Including you.

606
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:21,283
So lift your aim.

607
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:41,033
There's something you don't know.

608
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:51,033
I've seen this before.

609
00:55:38,991 --> 00:55:40,200
It is a key.

610
00:55:42,325 --> 00:55:46,825
Conjured by some forgotten craft
of the enemy, to enslave your ancestors.

611
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,450
A key to what?

612
00:55:51,491 --> 00:55:53,241
I do not know.

613
00:55:53,325 --> 00:55:56,116
The enemy commander spoke of becoming a god.

614
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,866
Of giving the Orcs a home in these lands.

615
00:55:59,866 --> 00:56:02,533
But whatever his design,
this much is certain.

616
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:08,241
Our enemy knows your son
has what he needs to enact it.

617
00:56:14,408 --> 00:56:15,616
How long?

618
00:56:17,158 --> 00:56:18,325
Days.

619
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,408
Maybe hours.

620
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:29,075
We can survive this, Bronwyn.

621
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:31,158
There is a way.

622
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:33,908
There must be.

623
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:39,033
There is one.

624
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:43,991
No! Bow to the enemy,
and you take away everything.

625
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:47,575
From your son, and his sons after him.

626
00:56:49,283 --> 00:56:53,283
Your people have worked an entire age
to earn back their virtue.

627
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:57,116
Would you undo it all
in just one moment of despair?

628
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,033
There must be another way.

629
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:04,616
Name it.
I beg you.

630
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:11,158
See?

631
00:57:12,658 --> 00:57:14,658
You were right to watch us.

632
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:18,408
Because we are destined for the darkness.

633
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:21,616
It's how we survive.

634
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:26,366
Perhaps it's who we are.

635
00:57:28,283 --> 00:57:29,783
Who we will always be.

636
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,325
There's far more at stake here
than just our lives.

637
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,616
When Morgoth was at war,
whole continents sank.

638
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:43,366
Who is to say what horrors
this might unleash,

639
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,116
should our enemy obtain it?

640
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
What power do we have to stop him?

641
00:57:47,825 --> 00:57:49,741
Look around.
It's over.

642
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:51,616
- Not yet.
- Soon enough.

643
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:55,908
And when they march upon us,
this tower will fall.

644
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:14,991
Nampat!

645
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,200
Nampat!

646
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:23,366
Nampat!

647
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,408
Nampat!

648
00:58:30,408 --> 00:58:31,450
Nampat!

649
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,075
Nampat!

650
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:01,950
You made it up, didn't you?

651
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:04,700
Disa's been wanting a new table
for years, so...

652
00:59:12,283 --> 00:59:14,033
Ah, come on, it's not that heavy.

653
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:17,116
It is not the weight of the table
that burdens me.

654
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,575
So why don't you come out with it?

655
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:22,075
Because a burden shared
may either be halved or doubled.

656
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:24,241
Depending on the heart that receives it.

657
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:28,700
Aulë's beard!
Enough with the quail sauce.

658
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:31,741
Give me the meat, and give it to me raw.

659
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,908
I have not been truthful with you, Durin.

660
00:59:41,866 --> 00:59:44,741
I did not come to Khazad-dûm
for friendship, but ambition.

661
00:59:46,241 --> 00:59:47,741
I did not know it.

662
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,866
But I came for mithril.

663
00:59:57,991 --> 00:59:59,241
Why?

664
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,366
Without it,

665
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:07,866
my kind must either abandon these shores
by spring, or perish.

666
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:10,991
Perish?

667
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,116
Perish how?

668
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:21,783
Our immortal souls
will dwindle into nothing,

669
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:25,116
slowly diminishing,

670
01:00:26,116 --> 01:00:27,783
until we are but shadows,

671
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,866
swept away by the tides of time.

672
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,950
Forever.

673
01:00:48,908 --> 01:00:54,658
So the fate of the entire Elven race
is in my hands?

674
01:00:55,658 --> 01:00:57,366
So it would appear.

675
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,283
Say that again.

676
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:11,283
The fate of the entire Elven race
is in your hands.

677
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:21,408
Whose hands?

678
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,116
Yours.

679
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,491
Hmm.

680
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:43,491
Fetch your feathery shirts.
Let's start walking.

681
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,950
- Durin...
- Don't thank me yet.

682
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,783
Thank me after we find a way
to convince my father.

683
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:51,075
Now can we please get moving?

684
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:52,991
It's a long journey back.

685
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:56,033
And all this sunlight is startin'
to give me a sour stomach.

686
01:01:56,658 --> 01:02:00,241
Under one condition.
Tell Disa the table's from me.

687
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,075
Don't push your luck, Elf.

688
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:25,616
Lord Halbrand,
the Queen Regent summons you.

689
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Look whose father secured him a post.
Again.

690
01:04:40,283 --> 01:04:42,158
I earned mine.
Same as you.

691
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:43,450
Soldier.

692
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,283
Report to the horsemaster.

693
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:51,158
Thought I was in cavalry.

694
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:52,575
You are.

695
01:04:55,908 --> 01:04:57,158
Stable sweep.

696
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:17,741
Soldiers!

697
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:07,950
Clear the lines!

698
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,116
Square the sail!

699
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,200
We head nor'-east.

700
01:06:13,908 --> 01:06:15,158
For Middle-earth.

701
01:06:16,741 --> 01:06:17,950
Yes!
