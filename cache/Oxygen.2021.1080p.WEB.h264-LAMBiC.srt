00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,541
Help!

3
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,708
Help!

4
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,833
System failure. Oxygen level: 35%.

5
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,500
Where am I?

6
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,166
I am your
Medical Interface Liaison Operator,

7
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,000
MILO, programmed
to answer all your medical needs.

8
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,375
Someone… Who did…

9
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,291
What's going on? Why can't I remember?

10
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,583
You're highly agitated.

11
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,208
- Would you like a sedative?
- No.

12
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,083
Let me out.

13
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,791
I cannot satisfy that request for now.

14
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,041
What's going on?

15
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,791
Did you drug me? Did someone… Who?

16
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,458
MILO, what's going on?

17
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,875
- Would you like a progress report?
- Yes.

18
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,916
Fault detected.

19
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:18,625
The heat level in processor 3-54
has depleted oxygen reserves.

20
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,333
Suspension of medical cryogenics.

21
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,125
"Cryogenics"?

22
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,541
I'm in the hospital.

23
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,625
Okay, I'm in the hospital.

24
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,625
Help! Help me!

25
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,833
I'm awake! Anybody there?

26
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,708
Please. I'm awake!

27
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,291
Can you hear me?

28
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,208
Anybody there? Can you hear me? I'm awake!

29
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,583
Help!

30
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,750
Anybody there? Can you hear me?

31
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,833
Help! Help me!

32
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,041
Oxygen level: 34%.

33
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,708
Okay.

34
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,125
Pod, cryogenic pod.

35
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,875
I'm sick. I have to be sick.

36
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,125
I'm terminal. I'm gonna die.

37
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:51,791
Okay. Normally,
medical units are monitored…

38
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,000
But here, there's a problem.

39
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,958
Someone will come.
If there's a problem, someone will come.

40
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,375
MILO? Has anyone
been informed of my pod's failure?

41
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,000
Failure diagnostic
transmitted at 04:32 GMT.

42
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,041
Received at 04:33 GMT.

43
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,125
- Is someone coming?
- No response yet.

44
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,958
It'll be okay. They know I'm awake.

45
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,291
I'm in a hospital.
I'm safe. It'll be okay.

46
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,000
Not in a box.

47
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,166
Not in a box.

48
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,625
Focus. Focus on breathing.

49
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,708
On breathing. The wind.

50
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,416
Breathe. That's it.

51
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,541
I'm not in a box.

52
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,416
Not in a box.

53
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,541
MILO.

54
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,125
Who am I?

55
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,291
What's my name?

56
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,666
MILO, patient identification.

57
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,416
Patient identity: Omicron 267.

58
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Specify.

59
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,750
You are bio-form Omicron 267.

60
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,125
Display bio-form image.

61
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,291
MILO, under what name
is patient Omicron 267 registered?

62
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,750
Omicron 267 is registered as Omicron 267.

63
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,333
That helps. Thanks.

64
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,791
Close image.

65
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,583
Oxygen level: 33%.

66
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:40,875
I suggest reducing consumption
to delay asphyxiation.

67
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,666
What's my problem? Why am I here?

68
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,833
Would you like to access
the medical diagnosis for patient 267?

69
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,833
Yes.

70
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,166
Searching medical diagnosis.

71
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,708
I'm here to get well.

72
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,708
Medical report unavailable.

73
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,666
What? Why? You offered it to me.

74
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,166
Cryogenic reanimation procedure
incomplete.

75
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,625
How long will it take?

76
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,208
Seven minutes and 53 seconds.

77
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,541
MILO.

78
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,791
MILO, please, I'm begging you, open it.

79
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,416
Let me out, please.

80
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,750
Please. Let me out.

81
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,458
MILO? MILO, unlock.

82
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,166
Unlocking is currently not recommended.

83
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,791
Proceed with unlocking.

84
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Procedure initiated.

85
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,833
Awaiting authorization code.

86
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,958
Please provide
the administrator password to continue.

87
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,916
I don't have it. I don't have it!

88
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,250
Awaiting authorization code.

89
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,208
I don't have the code!

90
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,958
Procedure interrupted.

91
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,291
The system.

92
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,958
The system may have transmitted.

93
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,666
MILO, I want to call the outside.

94
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,833
External communications
are currently unavailable.

95
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,666
How was the diagnosis transmitted?

96
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,500
All data is transmitted
via the central data line.

97
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,750
Okay. Can you use the central data line
to send an audio transmission?

98
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,875
- Affirmative.
- Okay.

99
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,750
Do you wish
to launch the transmission now?

100
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,791
Yes. Call the operations center.

101
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,166
The operations center
does not feature in the data.

102
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,166
Call…

103
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,083
Call the police, MILO.

104
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,625
There are 247 contact numbers
for the police.

105
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,333
- Which one should I call?
- The first on the list.

106
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,333
- Hello!
- Hello. Can you hear me?

107
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,958
You have reached the police department.

108
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,875
All calls are recorded.

109
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,083
To report a crime
or prevent a crime, please...

110
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,000
- Go ahead.
- Hello? Hello.

111
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,583
- Ma'am, I…
- Can you hear me?

112
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,083
Okay. I'm locked in.

113
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,958
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- I'm having trouble hearing you.

114
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,083
I'm in a cryogenic pod,
and I'll soon run out of oxygen.

115
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,833
A medical cryogenic pod?

116
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,791
Yes. It's sealed,
I can't get out. You must help me.

117
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,500
- Okay. Which hospital are you in?
- I don't know. I woke up in the pod.

118
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,375
I can't remember anything.
It's sealed. I can't get out.

119
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,833
Can't you knock to alert someone?

120
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,416
I tried. I knocked.
I tried, but no one came.

121
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,666
- Okay. Give me your name and address.
- I don't know it.

122
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,500
You know that a false report is a crime?

123
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,416
No, you must believe me. Help me. Please.

124
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:29,541
- Are you serious?
- Yes. Can you track my call?

125
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,208
All right.

126
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,416
Try to remember. A place…
Anything that could help us.

127
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,166
- I don't know...
- The last thing you remember.

128
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,875
A hospital, I think.

129
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,625
The emergency room.

130
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,208
I don't know, it's all a blur.

131
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,041
- I'm scared.
- Calm down, ma'am.

132
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,291
Don't worry, we'll get you out.

133
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,291
The computer…

134
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,583
The computer has to know.

135
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,000
MILO, location of the unit.

136
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,166
Unit location impossible to determine.

137
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,458
Have you found me?

138
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,208
It takes time. We're struggling
to locate your transmitter.

139
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,541
- What do you mean?
- We're trying to zero in.

140
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,000
Maybe I'm buried, underground.

141
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,291
- Try to stay calm.
- Maybe I've been buried alive.

142
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,500
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Stop telling me to calm down!

143
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,708
Listen, tell me everything
you can about the pod.

144
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,333
The manufacturer,
serial number, whatever you can find.

145
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,500
- Okay.
- Look.

146
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,500
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

147
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,833
Made by Cryosalide.

148
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:41,708
Serial number: 7485945375 - 267.

149
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,000
Have you located me?

150
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,833
We're still having some problems.

151
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,041
I'm underground, right?

152
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,416
If I'm underground, you'll never find me.

153
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,875
Listen to me, ma'am. We'll find you.

154
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,833
I have to pass you to my superior.

155
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,208
What? No, you can't leave me.

156
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,875
- I won't leave you. The line stays open.
- No, you can't go.

157
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,875
It'll only take a second. That's all.

158
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
Don't go, please.

159
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,500
We're transferring your call.

160
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,500
I should have accepted that sedative.

161
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,958
- Would you like a sedative?
- No.

162
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,208
Connection failure.

163
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,666
Focus.

164
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,541
Okay.

165
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,458
Cryogenics units…

166
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,291
Cryogenics units are medical labs.

167
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:43,958
MILO, can you do
a DNA search for Omicron 267?

168
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,666
Affirmative.

169
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,416
DNA analysis complete.

170
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,375
- Look for a genetic match.
- One match found.

171
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,250
DNA SEARCH: OMICRON 267

172
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,041
"Elizabeth Hansen."

173
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,333
Elizabeth.

174
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,666
Elizabeth.

175
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,000
Liz.

176
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,583
Liz.

177
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,708
Is someone there?

178
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,416
Help! Can you hear me? Anyone there?

179
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,791
Can you hear me?

180
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,625
Help! Can you hear me?

181
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,333
- Incoming call.
- Hello?

182
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,375
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

183
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,416
Ma'am?

184
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,416
Can you hear me?

185
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,458
My name's Elizabeth Hansen.

186
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,125
But I think people call me Liz.

187
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,875
Good. That's good. It'll help us.

188
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,333
I'm Captain Moreau.
Science and Technology.

189
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,583
Can you make out…

190
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,291
Hello? No.

191
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,041
Hello?

192
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,291
- Amplifying network.
- Elizabeth, are you there?

193
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,000
- Yes, can you hear me?
- Hello, can you hear me?

194
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,416
- Yes. Don't go again.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

195
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,375
I'll stay with you. Promise.
How's your oxygen?

196
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,041
What's going on? Have you found me?

197
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,125
Liz? No, Liz, focus.
It's important. What's your oxygen level?

198
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,708
I'm at 31%.

199
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,250
- So, how long do we have?
- How long to do what?

200
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,791
Yes, Liz, listen to me.
I need to know how much time we have.

201
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,791
Elizabeth? Liz? Are you there?

202
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,500
MILO. How long before the oxygen runs out?

203
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,708
Maximum estimated time
with moderate consumption: 72 minutes.

204
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,458
With current level
of consumption: 43 minutes.

205
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,583
Forty-three minutes?

206
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,416
I need you to tell me
everything you remember.

207
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,583
Anything at all. Suspect behavior,
someone who might want to hurt you.

208
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,416
Hurt me? I don't think so. I don't.

209
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,583
- Or maybe, I suppose, but I don't know.
- I need you to think.

210
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,916
What are you hiding from me?
What's going on?

211
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,541
Try to focus, please.

212
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,291
You're not telling me the truth.

213
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,125
Tell me.

214
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,250
You know where I am
and won't tell me, is that it?

215
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,875
No, we haven't managed to locate you.

216
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,791
What?

217
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,375
According to the manufacturer,
that unit was destroyed three years ago.

218
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,208
Three years ago?

219
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,750
I'm sorry, Liz.

220
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,666
MILO, full medical check-up
for Omicron 267.

221
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,500
All parameters are normal.
No illness or abnormality detected.

222
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,458
- I'm not sick.
- Liz…

223
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,375
- I'm not sick.
- I need you to stay strong.

224
00:21:58,916 --> 00:21:59,750
I'm not sick.

225
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,625
Life expectancy
for Omicron 267 patient: 82 years.

226
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,750
I shouldn't be here.

227
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,708
Someone put me in here!

228
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,416
I'm not sick!

229
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,333
Alert.

230
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:17,375
Blood pressure: 210/130. Pulse: 142 bpm.

231
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,333
Liz, are you there?

232
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,041
Stay with me, okay?

233
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,166
We'll get you out. Listen to me.

234
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,666
Focus on my voice. Can you do that?

235
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,000
There, that's it. Calm down.

236
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,416
I know it's tough, but you must stay calm.

237
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,958
Save your breath. Liz, we'll find you.

238
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,458
We're doing all we can.

239
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,458
Really? And what exactly
are you doing right now?

240
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,333
I have men going over
all the information we have about you.

241
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,125
And my team is on its way
to meet the manufacturer.

242
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,833
Cryosalide. I need
the admin codes to open the unit.

243
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,458
- The codes?
- Yes.

244
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,375
Okay.

245
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,375
I'll see if we can find them for you.

246
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,541
- How long will it take?
- I don't know.

247
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:03,541
It's 2:00 in the morning,
and they're not very cooperative.

248
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,958
We need a subpoena. My guys are on it.

249
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,500
We'll soon get you the codes.

250
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,916
- It's just longer than exp…
- Hello?

251
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,041
- Don't tell me…
- No…

252
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,250
- Network amplification underway.
- No, no, no.

253
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,583
- Network amplification underway.
- Hello?

254
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,125
MILO, reconnect.

255
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,500
- Connection lost.
- Try again.

256
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,666
Connection failure.

- Palliative care directive launched.

265
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,458
Obligatory sedation protocol.

266
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,583
What? No palliative care.

267
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,833
I still have 40 minutes. No.

268
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,916

Twenty-three? Why 23?

276
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,000
Twenty-three.

What? Seventeen minutes?
No, that's impossible.

281
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,958
Someone who could help me.

282
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,750
Someone who knows me.

283
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:23,500

Shit.

326
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,833
Shit.

327
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:06,000
Oxygen level: 21%.

328
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,458
Yes.

329
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,583
Okay, how does it open?

330
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,375
No, it's not real.

331
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,875
There's no rat.

332
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,458
Your pulse is high.

333
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,458
A sedative is recommended.

334
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:50,750
Would you like a sedative?

335
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,375
No.

336
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,541
Yes.

337
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:36,458
Alert. Damage detected.

338
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:00,333
Warning. Any deliberate damage
to a Cryosalide unit

339
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,750
is a European federal offense
punishable by ten years imprisonment.

340
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,166
Yeah, so is kidnapping.

341
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,708
Attempted breach
controlled by electric shock.

342
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,500
Bio-form preserved.

343
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,125
Would you like a sedative?

344
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,333
I'm gonna die.

345
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,625
I'm gonna die.

346
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,458
I'm gonna die.

347
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,166
Incoming call.

348
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,250
MILO, accept.

349
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,083
- Elizabeth, are you there?
- Yes, hello.

350
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,208
- Yes.
- And you…

351
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,625
MILO, boost the network.

352
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,125
Network amplification underway.

353
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,291
Can you hear me?

354
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,291
Got her.

355
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,625
Liz, listen. We have the subpoena.
My men are at Cryosalide.

356
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,916
You have the codes?

357
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yes, we'll get them shortly.

358
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,333
It's nearly over, Liz.

359
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,000
- You've got me?
- We've got you.

360
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,708
Captain Moreau?

361
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,875
- Moreau?
- It's going to be okay.

362
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,458
There's a problem, right?

363
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,708
Tell me what's going on.

364
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,250
Oxygen level: 17%.

365
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,750
What? Seventeen percent?

366
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:09,000
Seventeen percent? But I was at 20%.

367
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,000
What's happening, Liz? Talk to me.

368
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,708
I don't know. I'm losing track of time.

369
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,541
I see images. I see things.

370
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,000
No, Liz. Listen to me carefully.

371
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,750
You're experiencing a psychotic episode
induced by isolation.

372
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,166
Liz, prisoners of war go through that too.

373
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,625
Your number that wasn't assigned,

374
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,666
was that real or not?

375
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,583
What? No, we were cut off. I didn't move.

376
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,541
I kept trying to reach you.

377
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,416
Liz, pull yourself together.

378
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,166
Focus on what you know is real.

379
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,375
Focus on your body,
on what you know is real.

380
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,083
Find a way to focus on your body.

381
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,083
Okay.

382
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,916
Elizabeth, are you there?

383
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,125
Liz?

384
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,875
- Are you still there?
- Injury detected on bio-form.

385
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,833
- Hello? Liz…
- Status: no threat to life.

386
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,250
Liz?

387
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,208
Liz, talk to me.

388
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,166
Are you sure you want to do it?

389
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,625
Yeah.

390
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,458
Hello, Liz?

391
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,333
NAME: FERGUSON LÉO
HOSPITAL: CLARA DANIELS HOSPITAL

392
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,416
Liz, please.

393
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:57,416
Intravenous antibiotic administered
to prevent infection.

394
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,791
Antibiotics? Why, Liz? What did you do?

395
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,416
I focused on what's real.

396
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,125
How long have I been missing?

397
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,750
You were active on social media
a few days ago.

398
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,750
And no one has reported you missing.

399
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,250
I have a husband. Léo.

400
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,791
And I think we were trying to have kids.

401
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,500
- Léo?
- Yes.

402
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,250
What? Who are you talking to?

403
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,375
- No one.
- Is it about Léo?

404
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,291
No.

405
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:31,958
Is he well?

406
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:35,291
Find Léo. He'll know what happened.

407
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,208
Listen to me.

408
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,291
According to our information,
you were never married.

409
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,666
What?

410
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,166
No, no, no.

411
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,833
We were trying to have kids.

412
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,208
MILO, search for Dr. Léo Ferguson.

413
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,375
No result.

414
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,791
What?

415
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,708
That's not possible. It's not.

416
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,958
He was there. No, that's not possible.

417
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,500
RESULTS FOR
"FERGUSON"

418
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,708
That's not possible.

419
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:05,500
MILO, search for Dr. Elizabeth Hansen
at the Science and Technology Awards.

420
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,333
No.

421
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:11,000
No.

422
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,333
- Elizabeth.
- No, no, no…

423
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,625
That's impossible.
We were both in the photo.

424
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,125
We were together. He was there.

425
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:20,250
I called him. Someone answered.

426
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,375
A woman. She knew him.

427
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,000
- What woman?
- A woman…

428
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,708
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing. She hung up.

429
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,958
She knew him.

430
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,250
She knew him. She knew Léo.

431
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,708
No, she wasn't real.

432
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What's going on?

433
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,833
Liz, listen to me. Léo isn't real either.

434
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,458
- He was real.
- Yes, I know.

435
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,416
I know you're convinced of it.

436
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,958
Your mind's playing tricks on you,
that's all.

437
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,208
To help you to keep going.

438
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,083
You have to trust me. I'll get you out.

439
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,333
You're lying to me.

440
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,875
You played basketball.

441
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,458
What?

442
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,333
At college. You were gifted.

443
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,083
I thought you'd like
to hear something about yourself,

444
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,375
and during my search, that struck me.

445
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,708
Basketball?

446
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,625
Yes.

447
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,958
It stood out from the rest.

448
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,166
Doctorate in bioengineering,
grants, awards…

449
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,583
You are impressive.

450
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,291
Does it ring a bell?

451
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,625
No.

452
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,125
You were born in Stockholm.

453
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,541
Your mother was single
and raised you alone.

454
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:32,166
She brought you here
when you were six years old.

455
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,375
Alice. Her name's Alice.

456
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:36,291
No.

457
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,916
Her name isn't Alice?

458
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Isabelle.

459
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,916
No, no, no. I can see her.

460
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,916
- No, Liz…
- I can see her.

461
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,041
Liz, never mind. Stay with me.

462
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,708
You went to Oxford
after medical school in Paris.

463
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,916
Oxford.

464
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,791
I remember Oxford. That's where I met Léo.

465
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,708
That's where I met him.
He's real. I know he is.

466
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:58,625
Elizabeth?

467
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,750
Look for Léo. I swear he exists.

468
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,791
Oxygen level: 15%.

469
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:07,375
- Alert. Blood pressure at 210/130.
- Where are you? You should have found me.

470
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,291
Stay strong. Just a few more minutes.

471
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,833
I need the codes.

472
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,833
I have guys at Cryosalide
getting the codes.

473
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:17,666
But why? What? It's taking too long.

474
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,875
Who are you talking to?

475
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,625
What? Hello?

476
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:26,416
Who are you talking to?
I hear you talking to someone.

477
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,083
- You're hearing things.
- You're talking. No, no.

478
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,166
Liz. We're on it. We're close.
We're really close.

479
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,750
- You're lying.
- We're 20 minutes away.

480
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,750
- Are you doing this to me?
- We're nearly there.

481
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,583
I was in the army.
I spent months underground.

482
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:40,958
You're doing this to me.

483
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:44,125
I've been in that situation.
I know what you're going through.

484
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,416
- I'm with you...
- MILO, hang up.

485
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,416
- No, Liz...
- MILO, hang up.

486
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,333
- Wait.
- Disconnected.

487
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,125
Incoming call.

488
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:37,916

Reject call.

490
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,833
Call rejected.

491
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,541
MILO, play the last 30 seconds
of the last transmission again.

492
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,458
I need the codes.

493
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,416
I have guys at Cryosalide
getting the codes.

494
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,750
But why?

495
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,000
Who are you talking to?

496
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:00,916
Pause.

497
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:04,500
Play the last five seconds again.

498
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:12,791
Pause.

499
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,875
Turn up the volume and play it back.

500
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,583
Tell her she's hearing things.
That it's the stress.

501
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,250
Again.

502
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,625
Tell her she's hearing things.
That it's the stress.

503
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,458
Who are you talking to?

504
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,083
Pause.

505
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,250
Incoming call.

506
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,458
Reject call.

507
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,500
Call rejected.

508
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,583
Can you see me? Can you hear me?

509
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,375
What do you want from me?

510
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,541
Incoming call.

511
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,666
Are you assholes messing with me?

512
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,750
MILO, accept the call.

513
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,416
Who are you?

514
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,000
Why are you doing this to me?

515
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:00,916
Hello?

516
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,375
Don't hang up.

517
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,500
Answer me, please.

518
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,333
You're in a cryogenic unit, is that right?

519
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,416
You called me, looking for Léo.

520
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,166
Listen, we don't have much time.

521
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,041
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

522
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,583
Something must have gone wrong.

523
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,916
- I want to talk to Léo.
- Impossible.

524
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,041
You must listen to me. I can help you.

525
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,583
I won't listen until I speak to Léo.

526
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:24,666
That's impossible.

527
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,666
I want to talk to him now. Put him on now.

528
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,083
Léo is dead.

529
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,250
What?

530
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,708
I don't believe you.

531
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,416
You really need to listen to me.

532
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,625
- Liz… No.
- Go to hell.

533
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,250
- MILO, end the call.
- No, wait...

534
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:46,083
Call ended. Oxygen level: 14%.

535
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,250
Incoming call.

536
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:51,625
Incoming call.

537
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,458
MILO, accept call.

538
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,500
Listen to me.

539
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,500
I can help you.

540
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,708
No one else can help you
at this point, Liz.

541
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,916
How do you know my name? I never told you.

542
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,833
No need. I knew who you were
the moment I heard your voice,

543
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,458
even though I couldn't believe it.

544
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,166
Tell me who you are and the others.

545
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,125
I don't know who you spoke to,
but I know what's going on.

546
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,666
- MILO, end...
- I know the codes.

547
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,583
Give them to me.

548
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,458
- I'll do that, but you have to listen...
- Give them to me.

549
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,666
You can't use them to open the unit.

550
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,708
- MILO, end the...
- Okay, okay.

551
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:34,833
Uppercase N-M-347.

552
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:38,500
Lowercase C-D-A.

553
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,208
Transfer of administrator control.

554
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:48,750
Administrator control transfer launched.
Enter the password.

555
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:54,750
Uppercase N-M-347. Lowercase C-D-A.

556
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,291
Liz, don't open it. Please.

557
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:02,916
Administrator control transfer complete.
Administrator privileges granted.

558
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:10,291
MILO, unlock.

559
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,583
Unlocking activated.

560
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,000
Please, no. You'll die.

561
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:19,541
I can prove it.
If you open the unit, you'll die.

562
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,083
MILO, pause unlocking.
You have ten seconds.

563
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,125
Thank you. Just let me explain.

564
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,750
- Eight seconds.
- Okay, okay!

565
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,875
Go to "system preferences."

566
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,250
Find the centrifuge controls.

567
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,583
- System preferences.
- Please. Just let me explain.

568
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:34,000
Centrifuge controls.

569
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,541
Got them.

570
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,500
It's set at one. Switch to…

571
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,500
Switch to what?

572
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,041
- This isn't how you should find out.
- Switch to what?

573
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,458
MILO…

574
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,416
Zero. Switch to zero.

575
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,541
Switch to zero.

576
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,208
Please, Liz. Don't do it.

577
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,541
Turning off microthrusters.

578
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,625
I'm sorry, Liz. I really am.

579
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:11,666
Alert. Lengthy exposure to weightlessness
can be harmful to the bio-form.

580
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,333
Liz.

581
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,916
Liz!

582
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:28,791
Where am I?

583
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:32,583
Around 40,389 miles from Earth.

584
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,250
No, no, no.

585
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,875
MILO, distance from Earth?

586
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,875
Forty two thousand, seven hundred
and thirty-five miles.

587
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,916
That's not possible.

588
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:52,333
Sorry, Liz. But time is limited.

589
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:56,750
You'll soon be beyond the range
of our communication satellites.

590
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,416
THRUST INITIALIZATION? CANCEL - OK

591
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,750
Centrifuge rotation launched.
G-1 launched.

592
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,833
Oxygen level: 13%.

593
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,250
Liz, please.

594
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,750
You were placed in hypersleep
to allow you to carry out your mission.

595
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,291
But something went wrong.

596
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,458
I can't bring you home.

597
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,625
But I designed the system,

598
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,458
and maybe we could
put you back into hypersleep.

599
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,333
It would give you a chance. Please.

600
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:28,916
What mission?

601
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,666
If we can locate the damage,
divert the affected systems…

602
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,833
What mission?

603
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:41,708
Colonizing a planet
orbiting around Wolf 10-61,

604
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,875
14 light-years from Earth.

605
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,500
But you only just left.

606
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:50,333
Your HIVE transporter hasn't yet engaged
its nuclear-powered thrust.

607
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,916
No, no, no.

608
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,833
Liz, we have to act fast.

609
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,500
This isn't real.

610
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:14,791
Was it a military operation?
Do I work for the Ministry of Defense?

611
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,541
Yes. Do you remember?

612
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,750
Why the army?

613
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:21,708
The human race will die out
in two generations.

614
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,708
That can't be made public.

615
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,333
Did he know?

616
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,416
Who?

617
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,041
That guy. Moreau.

618
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,750
When I asked for help, he was kind,

619
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,583
- but he was lying to me, right?
- Liz.

620
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,125
He had no choice.

621
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:42,083
As soon as the police
looked for information about you,

622
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,541
the Ministry got involved.

623
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:48,000
Everything said after that
was only what they wanted you to hear.

624
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:48,916
But why?

625
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,958
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?

626
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,125
The fog of memory.

627
00:53:56,208 --> 00:54:00,875
It was impossible to foresee your reaction
or the memories that would return first.

628
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,666
You're a threat.

629
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:06,000
Speak to the wrong person,
and it all goes public.

630
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:11,166
General panic, chaos.
They couldn't take that risk.

631
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,291
I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.

632
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,708
He didn't tell me Léo was dead.
He said he wasn't real.

633
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:23,583
Liz, everything… I mean everything…
Everything was done

634
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,958
from the moment they realized
you'd regained consciousness

635
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,250
to prevent you
from recovering your memory.

636
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,250
So he was playing for time.

637
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,500
He was waiting…

638
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,000
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.

639
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,750
Léo was real…

640
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,291
And he's dead.

641
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,875
Yes.

642
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,000
Twelve percent.

643
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,750
We're running out of time.

644
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,333
What happened to him?

645
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:24,208
He was sick.

646
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:26,958
Léo got sick,

647
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,750
like millions of others
who were killed by the virus.

648
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,416
Liz?

649
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,541
No, no, no. That doesn't add up.

650
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,333
They said I went missing three days ago.

651
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,041
You've been in hypersleep
much longer than that.

652
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,375
How long?

653
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,000
How long?

654
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,416
Twelve years.

655
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,291
I'm really sorry, Liz.

656
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:11,000
You're wasting your time and your oxygen.

657
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,875
In ten minutes, you'll be out of range,
and we won't be able to communicate.

658
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,083
Either you die alone,
or you help me to solve the problem

659
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,875
- and give yourself a chance.
- No.

660
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,083
- I know what I'd choose.
- Okay, okay, okay.

661
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,000
Where do we begin?

662
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,666
Okay, first we need to figure out
what woke you up.

663
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:34,291
MILO, why was the bio-form awakened?

664
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:39,583
Processor 3-54 overheating
due to loss of oxygen reserves.

665
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:41,250
What is processor 3-54 used for?

666
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:45,458
Processor 3-54 monitors and stimulates
the subject's cerebral activity

667
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:47,125
to avoid cellular atrophy.

668
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,833
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.

669
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,208
I agree.

670
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,708
We must divert
the cerebral activity monitor

671
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,041
to another processor
assigned to non-essential functions.

672
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:02,291
MILO, list all the processors
linked to non-essential functions.

673
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:06,708
All functions assigned to processor 694.

674
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,708
Is there any danger to the bio-form

675
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,041
if all functions of processor 694
are deactivated?

676
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,916
Zero danger for the bio-form.

677
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,958
So, go on. Go on, deactivate them.

678
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,250
Deactivation underway.

679
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,458
MILO,

680
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:35,000
transfer all functions
of processor 3-54 to 694.

681
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,708
The data exceeds processor capacity.

682
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,291
Damn.

683
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,416
Shit.

684
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,708
What do we do now?

685
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,583
We have to make
some difficult choices now.

686
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,166
Deactivate systems
that don't have priority.

687
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,166
Find…

688
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,625
Too late. They're here!

689
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,625
- Find a way to install a shunt…
- What do you mean, they're here?

690
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,083
Return to hypersleep.

691
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:58,666
But do it
before the oxygen hits two percent,

692
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,875
or you won't have enough
for resuscitation.

693
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,958
But I won't know how to do it.

694
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,166
You do know. You have all the answers.

695
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,375
Figure out what triggers your memories,
then you'll find those you need.

696
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,958
You designed it. I won't know how.

697
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,083
On the ground!

698
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,916
- Hello?
- Right now!

699
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,833
- No.
- Hello?

700
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:19,000
Find what triggers your memories.

701
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,166
Get on the floor!

702
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,541
- Two percent. Find Léo.
- On the floor, I said!

703
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,916
Find Léo.

704
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,000
Connection lost.

705
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,416
Shit, shit, shit. MILO, reconnect.

706
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,916
This number is unassigned.
Please check the number.

707
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,916
Don't leave me alone, please.

708
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:51,916
Okay.

709
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,958
Okay, okay, okay. I worked on this thing.

710
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,166
I worked on it.

711
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:01,791
MILO, who authorized Omicron 267's
participation in this mission?

712
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:07,458
Participation of Omicron 267
authorized by Hansen, Elizabeth, Dr.

713
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,291
Yeah, of course.

714
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,750
So that's me. That's me.

715
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,333
It's me.

716
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,500
A thing only I know. Only I know.

717
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,750
"Find Léo." What does "find Léo" mean?

718
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,625
What does it mean?

719
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,458
What does it mean, damn it, "find Léo"?

720
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,625
What does it mean?

721
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,875
How do I do it?

722
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,375
Oxygen level: 11%.

723
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:39,833
Okay. Think.

724
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,291
MILO, show me all low-priority processors.

725
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,416
Okay, okay, okay.

726
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:51,750
Okay.

727
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,541
Too many. There are too many.

728
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,958
Explain kinetic regulation.

729
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:06,916
Kinetic regulation delivers
weak electric impulses to muscle groups

730
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,625
to prevent atrophy.

731
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,583
Okay. And if we deactivate it,
what happens?

732
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,208
Degeneration of muscular tissue.

733
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,125
And that's considered low priority, right?

734
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:19,583
Yes, because the bio-form
would survive the journey.

735
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,250
To die on being resuscitated.

736
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,375
The bio-form would survive
between three hours and ten days.

737
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:29,541
MILO, limit results to only processes
that can be interrupted

738
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,791
without reducing life expectancy.

739
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,166
No non-priority processes
can be interrupted

740
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,000
without reducing life expectancy.

741
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,458
Difficult choices.

742
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:43,375
Find what triggers the memories.

743
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,666
Come on.

744
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,958
If you have something to say,
now's the time.

745
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,666
I'm out of my mind.

746
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:34,708
Warning. Any deliberate damage
to a Cryosalide unit

747
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,125
is a European federal offense
punishable by ten years imprisonment.

748
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,916
So go on, electrocute me.

749
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,958
Warning.

750
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,125
Warning.

751
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:41,125
Warning.

752
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,291
Don't you worry.

753
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,375
We'll meet again.

754
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,541
And that's our entry system.

755
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:26,458
MILO, search for Alice Hansen in Paris.

756
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:27,750
One result.

757
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,083
Call that contact.

758
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,125
No network detected.

759
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,541
Amplify transmission.

760
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,208
Transmission amplified.
Attempted connection.

761
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,750
Hello?

762
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:54,916
Mom?

763
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,416
Sweetheart? Is that you?

764
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,291
What's wrong?

765
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,083
I think…

766
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:09,333
What? I can't hear you…

767
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,416
I just wanted to hear your voice.

768
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:18,125
Liz, my love, what's going on?

769
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,083
I don't think anyone will come.

770
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:30,291
Who won't come? Is everything all…

771
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:35,500
I tried to find him.
I don't know where else to look.

772
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,166
I'm supposed to know, but I don't.

773
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,958
Why didn't you come to see me on Sunday?

774
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:46,958
It's not good for you,
being alone in that house.

775
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:52,541
I'll come to see you.
No, even better, you come here.

776
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:55,416
Spend a little time with me.

777
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,750
He won't tell me what to do.

778
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:03,458
Are you in a car? I can hardly hear you.

779
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:07,083
No, I'm in…

780
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:13,250
What? You shouldn't call while driving.

781
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,666
I'm in…

782
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,458
Are you there? Liz…

783
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,166
I love you, Mom.

784
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:29,291
I can't hear… what… saying…

785
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,625
I was saying I love you.

786
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,541
No network detected.

787
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:50,541
Alert. Oxygen level: 6%.

788
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:16,666
MILO, how long will Omicron 267 live
once the oxygen runs out?

789
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,416
Omicron 267 will live
for approximately three minutes

790
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,875
once the oxygen runs out.

791
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:44,125
And how long will Omicron 267 live
during decompression in outer space?

792
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,833
It is estimated
that the subject should remain conscious

793
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:50,458
for between nine and 11 seconds,
during which extreme pain will be felt.

794
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:01,416
Oxygen level: 5%.

795
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:07,166
MILO, unlock.

796
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:11,083
Unlocking is not recommended at this time.

797
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:13,750
Transfer control and unlock.

798
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:17,041
Control transfer sequence initiated.

799
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:18,458
Enter the code.

800
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:22,458
Uppercase N-M-347.

801
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,041
Lowercase C-D-A.

802
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,416
See you soon, Léo.

803
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,041
Unlocking procedure initiated.

804
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,125
Decompression in five…

805
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:39,666
Four…

806
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:42,208
Three…

807
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:44,500
Two…

808
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,125
One.

809
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,875
- Abort. Abort unlocking.
- Unlocking aborted.

810
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,625
Find Léo.

811
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:52,541
MILO…

812
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,541
MILO, how many Omicron units are there?

813
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,875
There are 10,000 Omicron units.

814
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,250
Where are they located?

815
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,750
Impossible to determine
the units' location.

816
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,083
Specify variables.

817
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:13,333
In relation to Omicron 267…
Can you turn off that alarm?

818
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:18,541
All units are located within a radius
of 173 feet of Omicron 267.

819
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:19,875
Can I get a visual?

820
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,625
Visual already created.

821
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,208
No. I want a visual of the other units.

822
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:28,791
Visual of the cryogenic units
already established.

823
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,333
MILO, I can't see a thing.

824
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,750
Human visualization capacity
hampered by photochromic UV filtration.

825
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,750
Deactivate filtration.

826
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:02,333
Prolonged exposure to UV rays
could harm the bio-form.

827
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,791
Filtration activated.

828
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,583
How many units are still operational?

829
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:19,666
Nine thousand, five hundred
and sixty seven are fully operational.

830
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,916
Four hundred and thirty three
have been lost.

831
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,708
Is this unit considered lost?

832
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:29,166
Omicron 267 status: lost.

833
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,875
How many woke up in lost units?

834
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,958
I don't understand the question.

835
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:41,291
How many woke up, you bastard?
How many are waiting to die?

836
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:43,333
I don't understand the question.

837
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,541
How many have you trapped?

838
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,333
I don't understand the question.

839
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:51,333
MILO, how many bio-forms
have revived in lost units?

840
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:54,375
One. Omicron 267.

841
01:11:58,333 --> 01:11:59,416
And the others?

842
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,916
They expired
in the collision with asteroid X375.

843
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,041
Is Léo on board?

844
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,791
I don't understand the term "Léo."

845
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,125
Can you show me the interior of the units?

846
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,708
- Affirmative.
- Go on.

847
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,916
Limit the search to the men.

848
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:31,541
There are too many.

849
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:38,833
Alert. Oxygen level: 4%.

850
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:41,416
No, I don't have time.
I don't have time for this.

851
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:44,375
Seventeen.

852
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,083
Seventeen.

853
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,916
Seventeen.

854
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:54,583
No, that's not it.

855
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:57,958
267.

856
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:06,875
MILO, is unit 42 still operational?

857
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,416
Unit 42 is fully operational.

858
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,041
Can you show me the bio-form?

859
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:23,041
Can you uncover his face?

860
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:27,708
Omicron 42 is enveloped
in the organic cocoon

861
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:28,875
for reasons of preservation.

862
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:32,375
Can you remove it
without damaging the bio-form?

863
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,750
The cocoon is self-regenerating.

864
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:39,083
So open it and show me his face.
Can you uncover his face?

865
01:13:55,791 --> 01:13:56,833
You're alive.

866
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:00,625
You're alive.

867
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,166
Liars.

868
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,166
All liars.

869
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:22,583
Where's his scar? Why doesn't he have his…

870
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:25,958
Why is it gone?

871
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,375
It's not possible.

872
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,083
MILO.

873
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,958
MILO, do another search
for Elizabeth Hansen.

874
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,041
There are
1,292 academic articles including...

875
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,916
Videos. Show me videos.

876
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,958
MEMORY TRANSFER

877
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:55,708
"Memory transfer."

878
01:14:57,583 --> 01:14:59,166
Play the video.

879
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:03,083
Numerous attempts
at memory transfer have taken place.

880
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:08,083
But the scientific community
has given up pursuing this goal,

881
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:13,375
the general consensus
being that memory transfer is impossible.

882
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,083
That didn't stop me.

883
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:19,500
I developed
an offensive personality transfer in rats.

884
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:24,333
This fresh approach provided
the necessary framework for success.

885
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:29,083
As emotions are chemical surges
taking place in the body

886
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:32,083
in reaction to experiences,

887
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:35,666
they are coded
in the form of muscular memory.

888
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:42,000
A little like water recording the size,
shape, and speed of a stone that falls

889
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,458
in the form of undulations.

890
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,291
By stimulating the original muscles

891
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,291
to kindle the memories,

892
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:55,250
the undulations were recorded
with a liquid polymer, then archived.

893
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:58,666
We thus transform the data into experience

894
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,750
and make the reproduction identical

895
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:04,500
to the original.

896
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:07,458
Down to the smallest memory.

897
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:13,375
And our rat, despite
never having explored this maze…

898
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:17,875
- That's not possible.
- …already knows the way out.

899
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:29,291
MILO, how old is Omicron 267?

900
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:35,958
Omicron 267 is 12 years, 42 days,
17 hours and 56 minutes old.

901
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,625
Can you play back the last transmission?

902
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,208
- Hello?
- No.

903
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:47,333
Not that one.

904
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,458
The one before that.

905
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:54,958
I can help you. No one else
can help you at this point, Liz.

906
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,833
How do you know my name? I never told you.

907
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:59,875
No need. I knew who you were
the moment I heard your voice,

908
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,625
even though I couldn't believe it.

909
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:06,291
Stop. Can you do voice recognition
of the person who called me?

910
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:09,875
Voice recognition underway.

911
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,125
Call made by Hansen, Elizabeth, Dr.,

912
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:17,083
born January 3, 2003 in Stockholm, Sweden.

913
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,500
I'm you.

914
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,000
I'm you in a box.

915
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:30,875
MILO.

916
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,125
What is Omicron 267?

917
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:44,291
Omicrons are non-contaminated
genetic human reproductions

918
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:48,333
designed to propagate
the human race on Wolf 10-61c.

919
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:56,916
I'm a clone.

920
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,708
I'm a fucking clone.

921
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:05,958
I'm a fucking clone!

922
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:12,916
I've never been outside this box!

923
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,416
I'm disposable!

924
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,458
I'm space waste!

925
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,875
I don't wanna die!

926
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,083
Why did you do this to me?

927
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,041
Oxygen level
approaching critical threshold.

928
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,250
MILO, record a message for Omicron 42.

929
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,083
Recording activated.

930
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,458
Léo…

931
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,458
If you get this message,
it means you made it, and I…

932
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,875
I ran out of time.

933
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,625
I have the memory
of a whole life with you.

934
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:29,416
I feel I know your laugh, your smell…

935
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,083
I remember that
we were trying to have children…

936
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:40,541
That we didn't have any
because it wasn't reasonable.

937
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:46,375
But it's crazy because I feel that
like a gap inside of me.

938
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:49,250
It's absurd.

939
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,083
Because we don't know each other.

940
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,250
I've never touched you. I've never

941
01:19:58,416 --> 01:19:59,458
smelled you…

942
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:06,208
I know our life by heart
although I've never lived it.

943
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:09,708
Well, this life…

944
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,041
This life of…

945
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,416
- MILO, how long have I been awake?
- 102 minutes.

946
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,250
Yes, this life of 102 minutes…

947
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,750
Well, I'm on my way out and…

948
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:28,666
Be happy.

949
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,458
I just want to…

950
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,291
I just want to…

951
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:47,708
I want to live.

952
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:50,958
MILO!

953
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:53,875
MILO, show me
those low-priority processors again.

954
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,333
Sorry, but…

955
01:20:56,416 --> 01:21:00,500
I may be genetically designed to love you,
but, in fact, I don't know you.

956
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:05,208
We'll have a drink together
when I get over all of this.

957
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:07,791
Alert. Oxygen level: 3%.

958
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:09,708
- What's going on?
- Interruption.

959
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:11,000
What does that mean?

960
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:12,875
What does that mean?

961
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,958
Chance of survival
below acceptable parameters.

962
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,375
CEP launched.

963
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:20,833
- One minute to administration.
- What's CEP?

964
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:22,750
Charitable Euthanasia Protocol.

965
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,458
- What?
- Fifty-eight.

966
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:25,750
- Ignore it.
- Fifty-seven.

967
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:28,250
The CEP order can't be ignored.

968
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:31,458
54, 53, 52…

969
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:36,416
- Administered how?
- Intravenously administered. 49, 48…

970
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,750
But it's disconnected!

971
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:42,291
Secondary unit in functioning condition.
45, 44, 43…

972
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:45,875
- Release the abdominal belt.
- 42, 41, 40, 39… Instruction unknown.

973
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,416
- Release the harness.
- Instruction unknown. 37…

974
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,083
Release the safety belt.

975
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:54,291
Instruction unknown. 35, 34…

976
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:58,041
- Remove the umbilical ring.
- 33, 32, 31…

977
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,208
Release.

978
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:05,250
29, 28, 27, 26, 25…

979
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,500
- Why isn't it stopping?
- 24, 23,

980
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:11,666
22, 21, 20,

981
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:17,166
19, 18, 17, 16,

982
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,833
15, 14, 13,

983
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:27,041
12, 11, 10, 9, 8,

984
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:31,791
7, 6, 5, 4,

985
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:34,541
3, 2, 1.

986
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:37,083
CEP administered.

987
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:48,250
Heart rate elevated.
Would you like a sedative?

988
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:55,333
You need my authorization for a sedative,
but not for a lethal injection?

989
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:58,000
Are you still recording the message?

990
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:02,750
Yes. I am still recording
a message for Omicron 42.

991
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:06,208
Léo, can you hear what I'm forced
to put up with? I mean, seriously…

992
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:14,250
MILO, which processor controls
the euthanasia protocols?

993
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:20,250
Processor 67-526
is assigned to all disaster scenarios.

994
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,416
All scenarios
where you're supposed to kill me?

995
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,583
- Yes.
- Deactivate it.

996
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:29,125
Deactivation of disaster scenarios
is contrary to the United Nations ruling

997
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,208
concerning the Ethics of Medical Practice.

998
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,875
In other words, if we deactivate,

999
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,791
you won't be able to kill me,
even if I beg you to?

1000
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,208
Affirmative.

1001
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:44,958
Okay. Deactivate them.

1002
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:50,041
And redirect
all remaining functions of processor 3-54.

1003
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:53,166
Deactivation of disaster scenarios.

1004
01:23:56,916 --> 01:24:01,208
All functions
of processor 3-54 are now reassigned.

1005
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:10,500
Okay. Launch the return
to hypersleep protocol for the bio-form.

1006
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,916
Implementation impossible.
Bio-form disconnected.

1007
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:20,625
Intravenous assistance unhooked.

1008
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:25,541
Medical umbilical ring unhooked.
Cerebral activity unhooked.

1009
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:30,958
Okay. Think.

1010
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,375
Think of the easiest thing.

1011
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,958
Does the bio-form need two IVs?

1012
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:40,125
Affirmative. P1 for nutriments,
P2 for hypersleep management.

1013
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,750
Oxygen level critical.

1014
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,208
It's going to go away.

1015
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:10,833
It's not real.

1016
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:12,458
Not real, it's not real.

1017
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:17,291
It wasn't me!

1018
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,333
I didn't clone you.

1019
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:39,375
Oxygen level: 2%.

1020
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Intravenous P2 connected.

1021
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:22,250
Okay.

1022
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:53,958
Medical umbilical ring connected.

1023
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:17,416
Come on.

1024
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,208
Intravenous P1 connected.

1025
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,416
Two electrodes inactive.

1026
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:07,291
Cerebral activity monitor connected.

1027
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:09,791
Oxygen level: 1%.

1028
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,750
MILO, do I stand a chance
of surviving resuscitation?

1029
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:30,125
No. An oxygen level of two percent
is the strict minimum for resuscitation.

1030
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:37,625
I imagine the promise was that

1031
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,958
we'd wake together,

1032
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,750
but I won't be there.

1033
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,041
I've tried everything.

1034
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,708
I'm not the only one lost…

1035
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:52,125
I'm not the only one lost.
There are others.

1036
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:54,833
There are others.

1037
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,041
MILO, end of recording.

1038
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:02,750
Recording ended.

1039
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,166
Goodbye, Léo.

1040
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:16,333
Oxygen level: 0.6%

1041
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,083
The others!

1042
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:46,416
MILO, how much oxygen
is left in the lost units?

1043
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,333
One hundred eighty-seven lost units
are at full capacity.

1044
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:52,791
Divert the oxygen
from the lost units to unit 267.

1045
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,125
Diversion impossible to carry out now.

1046
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:59,708
Access to individual oxygen reserves
is limited for security reasons.

1047
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:03,958
It will require
approximately 14,227 minutes

1048
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:06,750
to ignore the security restriction.

1049
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,791
It is recommended
placing the bio-form in hypersleep

1050
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,291
for reasons
of preservation during the maneuver.

1051
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:20,250
Can you do that, MILO?

1052
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:23,125
Do you want to begin
the return to hypersleep protocol

1053
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:25,166
while I carry out the maneuver?

1054
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,833
Yes.

1055
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:36,125
I could kiss you right now. Yes.

1056
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,500
Launch the hypersleep protocol.

1057
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:43,500
Return to hypersleep protocol launched.

1058
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:45,333
Would you like a sedative?

1059
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,791
Yes.

1060
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,750
Administration underway.

1061
01:30:56,375 --> 01:31:00,875
Initialization of cryoprotector
transfusion for vitrification.

1062
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:06,666
Security lock bypass launched.

1063
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:12,083
Body temperature: 98.7°F.

1064
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,583
MILO, I'm sorry for hitting you.

1065
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,666
Apology accepted.

1066
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,958
MILO, tell me about the planet.

1067
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:28,458
What's it like?

1068
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:32,125
Wolf 10-61c
has an orbital cycle of 18 days.

1069
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,916
Its mass
is around four times that of Earth.

1070
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,083
Its lack of rotation makes life impossible

1071
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:42,375
on its sun-facing side, which is too hot,
and on its dark side, which is too cold.

1072
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:46,208
The inhabitable area is therefore
on the border of day and night.

1073
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,708
Tell me about the journey.

1074
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:53,833
Once nuclear-powered thrust is engaged,

1075
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:57,291
it will take 34 years
to cover the 14 light-years

1076
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,208
between us and Wolf 10-61c.

1077
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:07,041
On arrival, the HIVE sowing vessel
will break up to free the 9,568 units

1078
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:10,500
that will enter
the atmosphere of Wolf 10-61c.

1079
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:12,708
Thanks to their individual
helix-shaped device...

1080
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:16,708
MILO, tell me about the beach in Maui.

1081
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:21,416
Kapalua Bay is a white-sand beach
in the shape of a crescent moon

1082
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,708
situated in the northwest of the island.

1083
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:26,125
It is protected by two coral reefs.

1084
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,833
The aquatic bio-forms include

1085
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:35,916
butterflyfish, parrotfish,
damselfish, blue surgeonfish,

1086
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,500
Moorish idols, Achilles tangs,

1087
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:43,083
wrasses, yellow boxfish,

1088
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:47,708
bluefish, triggerfish, yellowfin goatfish,

1089
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:53,000
porcupinefish,
crevalle jacks, trumpetfish…

1090
01:32:53,083 --> 01:32:53,916
MILO.

1091
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:58,041
Rename Omicron 267…

1092
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:00,416
Liz.

1093
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:04,083
Omicron 267 renamed Liz.

1094
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,041
Thank you.

1095
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,625
Good night, Liz.
