1
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,948
Check it out.

2
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,063
What are you doing here?

3
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,195
I said, what are you doing here?

4
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,006
I want to see what he's made of.

5
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,715
Our instructions were to break him down...

6
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,967
...not kill him.

7
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,261
Some guys break different than others.

8
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,392
So now let's see how tough you are.

9
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,226
Where is he?

10
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,812
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

11
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,648
Run. He's getting away. Hurry.

12
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,066
Lights ready, Act One preset.

13
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,577
Final preparations complete.

14
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,828
Everyone standby please.

15
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,613
What was that?

16
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,114
I don't know.

17
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,072
It's just a fleshwound.

18
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,701
Seal the building. Close the exits.

19
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,267
If anything were to happen to you -

20
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,144
Nothing's going to happen to me.

21
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,104
Stop the car.

22
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,759
Your card isn't working.

23
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:10,917
Now let's see what you're made of.
