1
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,714
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

2
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,395
Mr. Thrombey? You up there?

3
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,965
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

4
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,410
Shit!

5
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,766
You killed him, you bastard!

6
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:39,867
You murdered him!

7
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,401
I didn't murder nobody!

8
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:42,736
You slashed his face open.

9
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,172
You left him bleeding in
the street like a stuck pig,

10
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:47,407
then you crushed his skull
with a forklift

11
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,810
and burned his hands off
to erase the fingerprints!

12
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:51,145
You'll never prove it.

13
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,479
We have the nanny-cam footage!

14
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:54,647
Alice, turn that off now, please?

15
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:56,616
You're under arrest for...
Why? It's almost over.

16
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,618
Now. Please, just turn it off.
What? They're finding out who did it

17
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,720
and the WiFi sucks in my room,

18
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,754
so give me a break.
Turn it off, now.

19
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:01,722
There's two minutes left.
Alice!

20
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,858
What? There isn't even anything bad on.
Off!

21
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,525
It's just normal TV

22
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:06,861
and they're just talking!
They're talking murder on it!

23
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:07,761
Normal TV, and they're just talking!

24
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,863
Your sister just had a friend
she loved...

25
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:10,865
Okay, okay! Okay! Whatever.
Slit his throat open

26
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,900
and she doesn't need to
be hearing that right now!

27
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,402
Let's be sensitive!

28
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,774
Alice, you can keep watching
your show, it's fine.

29
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,009
No, I guessed who did it anyway.

30
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,944
It's okay.
I'm sorry, Marta.

31
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,580
It's okay.

32
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:28,383
It's Harlan's son.

33
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,187
Hi, Walt.

34
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,455
Hi, Marta, it's Walt.
Mmm-hmm.

35
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,490
Would you mind coming
to the house early?

36
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:40,660
The police have a few more
questions for everybody.

37
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:41,797
What?

38
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,583
Hey.
Excuse me, Ma'am.

39
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:04,718
You with the help?

40
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,587
Hey! Her name's Marta.
She was Grandad's nurse.

41
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,523
She's with us.
"The help"?

42
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,259
It's okay.
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,797
No, it's not okay.
What the hell?

44
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,533
Aw.

45
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:25,708
How are you doing?

46
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,043
Not very good.

47
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,046
Alone.

48
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:34,750
Lots of this and not knowing
what to do next.

49
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:39,552
Marta, anything you need...

50
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:41,057
You're part of this family.

51
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,226
Thank you.

52
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:48,028
How you doing, Kiddo?
Linda.

53
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,230
How are you?

54
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,769
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

55
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,670
I thought you should
have been there.

56
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,639
I was out voted.
Get arrested!

57
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,944
Die up your own ass for all I care!
Richard.

58
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,680
He's not coming.

59
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,247
Ransom. Little shit.

60
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,250
Missed the funeral.

61
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:10,583
Excuse me.

62
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:11,986
Uh, we're ready for you now.

63
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:13,721
We'd like to see you
one at a time.

64
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,956
All right.
Uh, I'll go first.

65
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,992
I'm assuming this will all be
wrapped up

66
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,793
before the memorial tonight.

67
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,295
We'll do our best, Ma'am.

68
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,699
So...

69
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,302
How you doing, Kiddo?

70
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:31,038
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,806
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliot,

72
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,341
and this is Trooper Wagner.

73
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:37,811
Now, um, I'm going to record this,

74
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,780
just to make things easier.

75
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:43,350
All right, we're with
Linda Drysdale Nee Thrombey,

76
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,219
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

77
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,954
and discussing the events
that took place

78
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:49,023
the night of his demise
one week ago.

79
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,324
November eighth.

80
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,161
We're very sorry for your loss.

81
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,330
Thank you.
That means a lot.

82
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:58,265
So, we understand on that night

83
00:05:58,267 --> 00:05:59,700
the family had gathered

84
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,769
to celebrate your father's
85th birthday?

85
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:03,037
Yes.

86
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,839
How was it? Uh...
The party?

87
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,076
Pre-my-dad's-death?

88
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:09,810
Oh, it was great.

89
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,079
Did anyone besides the family
show face?

90
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,782
Um, Fran, the housekeeper.

91
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:17,751
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

92
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,820
Jacob?
And I've dated Italian guys.

93
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:21,688
You know what I mean?
It was like...

94
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,124
Marta, Harlan's caregiver.

95
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,260
Good girl. Hard worker.

96
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:27,830
Her family's from Ecuador.

97
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,330
And Wanetta.

98
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,699
Great Nana. Harlan's mom.

99
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:35,035
Hi, Nana.
His mom?

100
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,237
Nana?
Wow. How old is she?

101
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,039
We have no idea.

102
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,208
Okay, um, and your son, Ransom,

103
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,010
did he attend as well?

104
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:44,780
Yes, but he left early.

105
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:48,918
Ransom, are you leaving?

106
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,089
Right, um...

107
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:56,824
Would you say that all three
of you showed up

108
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:57,993
around the same time?

109
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:00,329
No.

110
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:06,200
Richard came early to help
the caterers set up.

111
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,168
Okay.
And you and your husband, Richard,

112
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,803
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

113
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,072
No. It's...
It's my company.

114
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:13,707
Right. Right. Sorry.

115
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,409
I built my business
from the ground up.

116
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,377
Oh, just like your father.

117
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,047
You two were very close.

118
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:23,417
We... We had our own secret
way of communicating.

119
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,787
I mean, you had to
find that with Dad.

120
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,822
You had to find a game
to play with him,

121
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,261
and if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

122
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,801
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

123
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,304
I don't know.
Do they?

124
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:45,472
Very much not.

125
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,341
Don't know why I said that.

126
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,743
But my wife, Linda, does.

127
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:52,112
Harlan started out with a
rusty Smith Corona

128
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,447
and built himself into

129
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,383
one of the best-selling
mystery writers of all time.

130
00:07:56,385 --> 00:08:00,756
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

131
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,557
Sure.

132
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,193
For the record,
I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,

133
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,862
Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

134
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,365
So, you run your father's
publishing company?

135
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,901
Yeah. It's my...
It's our...

136
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,969
Uh, it's the family's
publishing company.

137
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,206
Dad trusts me to run it.

138
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,040
Thirty languages.

139
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,911
Over 80 million copies sold.
A real legacy.

140
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:25,779
Mmm-hmm.
You guys fans?

141
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:28,315
I mean, I don't do much
fiction reading myself, but...

142
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,017
Big fan.
I'm a big fan.

143
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,219
I mean, his plots are just like...

144
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,487
Like, I won't spoil it for
you but...

145
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:35,155
Okay, like Thousand Knives?

146
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,490
The Cow and the Shotgun?

147
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,959
Like, where do you
come up with that?

148
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:40,494
Well, Dad said the plots just

149
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,496
popped into his head, fully formed.

150
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,064
It was the easy part for him.

151
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:48,235
Um, so you're in the area, right?

152
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,938
Uh, you guys probably arrived
around the same time.

153
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,839
Uh...

154
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:55,275
We all got here around 8:00.

155
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,444
My wife, Donna, she's my rock.

156
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:01,982
Jesus, Donna!
Are you all right?

157
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,918
My son, Jacob, he's 16.

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,221
Very politically active.

159
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:08,989
The boy is literally a Nazi.

160
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,325
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

161
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,194
Kids today with the Internet,
it's amazing.

162
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,165
So the night went well?

163
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,300
I mean, we're all gutted, but, uh,

164
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:22,536
I was happy to have
that night with him.

165
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:25,072
To be by his side.
To think about our books

166
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,808
and what we've accomplished
with them.

167
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,479
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

168
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:33,947
Passing the torch.

169
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,183
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,

170
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:38,218
Harlan Thrombey's daughter-in-law?

171
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,021
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I married his son, Neil.

172
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,123
We had one daughter, Meg.

173
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,127
And then Neil passed on
15 years ago.

174
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,229
But you remained close
to the Thrombeys?

175
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:51,932
Oh! They're my family.

176
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,938
I feel simultaneously freed by

177
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,008
and supported by them.

178
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:07,950
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

179
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,150
Sorry, the nugget of...

180
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,518
Flam.

181
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,855
Oh. Yeah, Flam,
your skincare company. Sorry.

182
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,058
I forgive you.

183
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:17,924
Yeah, it's skincare,

184
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,127
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

185
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:22,396
Self-sufficiency with an acknowledgement

186
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:23,630
of human need.

187
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:24,998
That's Flam.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,933
But it's also Harlan.

189
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,403
He got me and Meg through some
tough times.

190
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,004
Grandad gives my mom
a yearly allowance

191
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,439
and he's never missed wiring

192
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,476
a tuition payment to my schools.

193
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,446
He's a genuinely selfless man.

194
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,515
But you left the party early?

195
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,582
Have fun.

196
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,884
To see some friends at Smith.

197
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,652
You know Dad pays for her

198
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:49,589
crypto-Marxist-post-deconstructural-

199
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,893
feminist-poetry-theory-whatever major?

200
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:55,195
She could have stuck
around for the cake.

201
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,965
I think Linda was upset.

202
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:59,535
Hmm.

203
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:02,338
But Harlan understood.

204
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:07,974
Right.

205
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:11,445
Um, you two showed up to the
party around the same time...

206
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,613
If I could pause?

207
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:14,616
Because I just...

208
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,017
Who is that guy?

209
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,952
And why are we doing all this again?

210
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,253
This is just some follow-up questions.

211
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:21,689
Um, we're attempting to be thorough,

212
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:23,390
so we can figure out
the manner of death.

213
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,991
So by "Manner Of Death,"

214
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:26,460
you mean if someone killed him?

215
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:28,495
If one of us killed him?

216
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:30,931
One of his family killed him?
No, no, Walt, Walt, no, no...

217
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,332
Is that what you're suggesting, Lieutenant?

218
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,400
No one's saying that, okay?

219
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,070
This is all pro-forma.

220
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:36,605
Okay.

221
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:39,308
So who the fuck is that?

222
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:41,274
Um...

223
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:43,510
This is Benoit Blanc.

224
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:46,313
Benoit Blanc?
Yes.

225
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,115
Mr. Blanc is a private investigator

226
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:49,282
of great renown.

227
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:50,550
Wait a minute.

228
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,721
I read a tweet about a
New Yorker article about you.

229
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:56,223
"The Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths."

230
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,592
You solved that case
with the tennis champ?

231
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,696
You're famous.

232
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:03,997
Mr. Blanc is not with the
police department

233
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,599
and not officially involved
in the case,

234
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,334
but he's offered to consult.

235
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,669
Now, I happily obliged,
and I can vouch for him.

236
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,571
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

237
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,507
I read your profile in the
New Yorker.

238
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,009
I found it delightful.

239
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:19,179
I just buried my 85-year-old father

240
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,148
who committed suicide.

241
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,550
Why are you here?

242
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:27,222
I'm here at the behest of a client.

243
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:28,991
Who?

244
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,192
I cannot say.

245
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:34,227
But let me assure you this.

246
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:37,631
My presence will be ornamental.

247
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,400
You will find me a respectful,

248
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:43,238
quiet, passive observer

249
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,607
of the truth.

250
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:48,642
Fine.

251
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,143
Are we getting there?

252
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,378
Nearly. Um...

253
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,647
Harlan's nurse,
she was at the party

254
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,615
in a professional capacity?

255
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:56,618
Marta?

256
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:58,552
I guess.

257
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,788
Harlan hired her to be around
to take care

258
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,190
of whatever medical needs
popped up.

259
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:06,228
But really,
she's like part of the family.

260
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,061
Good kid.

261
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:09,697
Been a good friend to Harlan.

262
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,631
Family's from Paraguay.

263
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,703
Linda really likes her work ethic.

264
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:17,973
"Immigrants.
We get the job done."

265
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,442
I...
From Hamilton.

266
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:24,110
Oh, Hamilton.

267
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:25,245
It's so good.
It's so good.

268
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:27,049
I saw it at The Public.
Oh!

269
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,486
May I just, um...

270
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,453
Then I'll recede, but...

271
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,524
As a self-made man myself,

272
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,693
I have to express my admiration

273
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:41,296
for how you followed in your
father's footsteps.

274
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,499
Thank you.
Just marvelous.

275
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,534
You know,
the whole family, too.

276
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,503
And Joni with her thing,

277
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:52,105
and Walt with his publishing empire...

278
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,308
It's...

279
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:55,244
Well...

280
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:59,680
Yes, I mean, Walt,
he's done well

281
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:02,182
with what Dad gave him.

282
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:03,216
Not that it matters.

283
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,286
But really, Dad hands him
a book twice a year

284
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:07,456
and Walt publishes it.

285
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,657
It's just not the same.

286
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:14,862
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising, adaptations,

287
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:17,097
film and television rights,
I mean...

288
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,766
Are you baiting me, Detective?

289
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,302
You know he doesn't.

290
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,571
And if you think I am dumb enough

291
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,574
to be baited into talking
family business,

292
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,143
into shit-talking my baby brother,

293
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,779
in front of a police detective,

294
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,313
and a state trooper...

295
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:35,482
Walt doesn't run shit.

296
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:38,151
Because there are no TV
and film rights.

297
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,855
Harlan never allowed any
adaptations of his books.

298
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:42,255
Hated the idea.

299
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,356
No.

300
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,624
Yeah!

301
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,326
Drives Walt nuts.

302
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:48,428
'Cause that's where
the real money is.

303
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,798
When Walt would get a little
Irish courage in him,

304
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,733
he'd get into it with Harlan.
The window is...

305
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:55,203
Did he "Get Into It" at the party?

306
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,203
Oh, my God!

307
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,371
Come on, Dad!

308
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,173
Wouldn't leave him alone,
the poor guy.

309
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:01,709
Harlan finally had to give
him the hook.

310
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:03,343
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy...

311
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:04,812
I didn't hear what he said,

312
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:07,314
but he must've really
handed him his lunch.

313
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:10,885
'Cause Walt was like a wounded
puppy the rest of the night.

314
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,419
What? Richard said what?

315
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,421
No. Jesus.
We did not get "Into It."

316
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,925
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

317
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,293
Harlan took you aside at the party.

318
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,365
When you returned, you were chastened.

319
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,170
What did Harlan say to you?

320
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,872
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

321
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:33,808
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time,

322
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,575
and I just think this is a window

323
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,344
that's not gonna stay open.

324
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:38,445
We need to take advantage of it

325
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,447
and then you just need
to look at the numbers!

326
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,482
Yeah, Walt, look...
Dad! Dad!

327
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,352
You... You put me in charge
of our books.

328
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:48,254
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

329
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,624
They're not our books, Son.

330
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,760
They're my books.

331
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:55,896
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

332
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:58,431
But you're right, you're right.

333
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:02,469
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

334
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,372
to something that isn't yours
to control.

335
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:06,439
What?

336
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:10,178
No, I've done you a grave disservice.

337
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,813
All these years,

338
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,482
I've kept you from building something

339
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:17,820
of your own that was yours.

340
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:22,422
But you're not going to be running

341
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:24,761
the publishing house anymore.

342
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,628
You're free of it.

343
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:28,630
Whoa...

344
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:31,966
Dad, are you firing me?

345
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,234
No...

346
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:35,772
We'll talk details tomorrow.

347
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,240
My mind's made up.

348
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:40,810
Good boy.

349
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:52,487
We talked. We had a business
discussion about e-books.

350
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,692
Jesus. It was nothing.

351
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,491
You want to talk about an argument,

352
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,393
hell, Ransom had an argument
with him.

353
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,561
Ransom, that's, uh,

354
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,397
Richard and Linda's son?
Mmm.

355
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,369
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid. We love him.

356
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:10,570
But?

357
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,973
But he's always been the black
sheep of the family.

358
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,041
Ah.

359
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,676
And I'm not trying to...

360
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:17,845
I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.

361
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,748
But with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

362
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,450
And Dad, for some unknown reason,

363
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:24,919
always supported him.

364
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:28,290
They have this love-hate bond.
They fight.

365
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,828
But that night, God,
they had a blowout.

366
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:33,694
About what?

367
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:35,528
Are you goddamn insane?

368
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,864
We couldn't make it out really,

369
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,665
but it was huge.

370
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,769
And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.

371
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,004
Usually they like to stoke up drama

372
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,306
in front of the whole family.

373
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,742
Speaking of getting into it...

374
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:53,613
You were at the house early,
to help the caterers set up. Did...

375
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,051
Did you converse with Harlan
at that time?

376
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,519
Well, he was there.
We must have spoke.

377
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,757
In his study?

378
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,925
I don't think so.

379
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,995
You see, I spoke with the
caterer this morning,

380
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,765
she didn't see you helping
her staff.

381
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,466
She did hear Harlan
in a screaming match

382
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,838
with somebody that afternoon
in his study.

383
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,005
Yeah, I don't...

384
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,809
Screaming match?
Mmm-hmm.

385
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,976
No.

386
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,409
Um...

387
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:24,812
But Joni was here, too.

388
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:27,413
Um, she was early,
so it might have been her.

389
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,548
You can maybe ask her.

390
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,718
These were two male voices.

391
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,652
Harlan shouted the phrase...

392
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,857
You tell her or I will!

393
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:36,826
"You tell her"

394
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:39,327
"Or I will!"

395
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,664
Bells ringing?

396
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:53,007
That's none of your business.

397
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,008
You stay out of my marriage.

398
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,144
I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.

399
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,880
I've put all of it
in this letter to her.

400
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,548
Tomorrow, she gets it.

401
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,416
Harlan, I'm warning you.

402
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,952
No, she deserves to know.
You stay out of my marriage.

403
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,054
She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.

404
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,892
The hell I am!
You tell her or I will!

405
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,730
Yes. I know.

406
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,597
Yes.

407
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,466
Uh...

408
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:25,105
Harlan had finally decided to
put his mom in a nursing home

409
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,507
and Linda had always opposed that.

410
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,876
And I wanted to wait
until we got back

411
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,911
to Boston, uh, to tell Linda,

412
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:33,781
so, to avoid a whole scene,

413
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,618
and Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

414
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,753
That was it.

415
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,057
Sorry. Forgot.

416
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:43,924
The house?

417
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:47,460
Uh, early.
Richard said you were there.

418
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,631
I was at the house early.

419
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,801
To see Harlan?

420
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,469
To see Harlan.

421
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,404
Yes.

422
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,907
What were you seeing Harlan about?

423
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,542
It was just a mix-up with the, uh,

424
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:04,611
the payment for Meg's tuition.

425
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm... I'm...

426
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,549
I'm sorry to press,

427
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,686
but what kind of mix-up?

428
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:13,954
Yeah, the school hasn't
got the check yet.

429
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't know why Alan
didn't mail it.

430
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:17,624
Well, Alan didn't mail it

431
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,828
because he caught a discrepancy.

432
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,899
Alan's office has been wiring
tuition directly to the school

433
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,599
as per your request.

434
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,937
But Phyllis's office that
handles your yearly allowance

435
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:33,743
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.

436
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:37,678
You have been double-dipping
Meg's tuition

437
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,013
and stealing from me.

438
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:41,982
$100,000 a year,

439
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,851
for the past four years.

440
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:45,920
Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,

441
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,553
but I swear to God...

442
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,489
So, now I am writing
this tuition check,

443
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,892
but you must know that this
is the last money

444
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:55,162
you or Meg will get from me.

445
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:56,830
Please, you don't understand...

446
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:58,631
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

447
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,535
but it's all for the best.

448
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:03,605
My mind's made up.

449
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:09,076
It was, uh, a money wiring issue

450
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:10,778
with the office at the school.

451
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,881
So I had to ask Harlan to cut
a check for the semester.

452
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,184
Mmm. No big deal.

453
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,184
Well...

454
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:18,886
Why don't we, uh, just take

455
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,087
a little break and we'll resu...

456
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:21,654
Oh, no...

457
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,758
She's gone.

458
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:31,801
Richard!

459
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:34,634
Joni, have you seen Richard?

460
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,170
No, I was, uh,
just done with the, um...

461
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:37,239
Okay, thanks.

462
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:40,009
No.

463
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,477
Damn it. Richard!

464
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,647
Richard?

465
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:17,013
Son of a bitch.

466
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:30,357
See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,

467
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,592
but when the great Benoit Blanc

468
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,094
comes knocking at my door,

469
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:36,130
I expect it's going
to be about something,

470
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,931
if not extraordinary,

471
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,267
then at least interesting.

472
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,235
But... I'm sorry,

473
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:44,670
this is an open-and-shut
case of suicide

474
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:46,206
and, uh, quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point

475
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,941
where I need to know
what we're doing here.

476
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:48,944
The method?

477
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:51,914
Throat slit?

478
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,314
Typical for a suicide?

479
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:56,250
Yes, I mean, that's dramatic.

480
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,252
But look around.

481
00:22:58,254 --> 00:23:00,956
I mean, the guy practically
lives in a Clue board.

482
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,097
Come on, Benny, talk to me,
all right?

483
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:12,766
Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back

484
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,335
for questioning all over again.
I get it.

485
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:16,770
Listen, I've had boots on the ground

486
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:17,905
in this county for a while now.

487
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,173
People are generally
what they seem to be.

488
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,208
You're not gonna find
murderers in this family.

489
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,642
This is a pleasant family

490
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:23,877
with the usual quarrels,

491
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,913
but no possible motives for murder.

492
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:26,982
Where are you going?

493
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,988
Harlan Thrombey's nurse.
Marta...

494
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,723
Cabrera.
Marta Cabrera. Please.

495
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:38,192
Miss Cabrera,
you can just wait inside

496
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:39,862
and we'll be with you in...
Miss Cabrera.

497
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,766
I've been doin' a little pokin'.

498
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:47,667
You were hired on a part-time basis

499
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,303
as a registered nurse, yes?

500
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,972
Uh, yes. I don't work for a VNA.

501
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,740
Harlan hired me directly.

502
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,776
Take a seat, please.

503
00:23:55,778 --> 00:23:58,080
And you're paid a flat rate

504
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:00,948
for how many hours a week?

505
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,182
Um...

506
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:05,187
Well, I started at 15,
and then he...

507
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:07,454
He needed more help.

508
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:09,125
Medical help?

509
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,129
He needed a friend.

510
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:20,167
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

511
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,002
All right, Blanc, I mean, this is...

512
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,171
Yeah, yeah. Marta?
We were just discussing

513
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,373
possible motives in the family.

514
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,909
I suspect that Harlan has
told you

515
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:31,278
much unfiltered truth
about each of 'em.

516
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,715
And a little bird has told me,

517
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:36,886
how shall I put this delicately...

518
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,055
You have a regurgitative reaction

519
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:43,926
to mistruthin'.

520
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,460
Who told you that?

521
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:48,095
Is it true?

522
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:49,131
Uh...

523
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:51,899
Yes.
Oh.

524
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:54,401
It's something I've had since
I was a kid.

525
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:56,770
It's a physical thing that I...

526
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:58,205
Just the thought of lying...

527
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,874
Yeah, it makes me puke.

528
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,242
Really?

529
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:08,317
Is Richard havin' an affair?

530
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:14,288
Why do men instinctively

531
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,860
pull at loose threads
on their parachutes?

532
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:20,095
What?

533
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:28,869
Richard?

534
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:30,005
Mmm-hmm.

535
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:33,108
An affair?
Yeah.

536
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,978
A yes or no will do.

537
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,913
Mmm... No.

538
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,419
Oh, shit!

539
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:46,887
Oh, my God!
Dear Girl, I'm sorry.

540
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,389
I assumed you were speaking figuratively.
Here, have some water.

541
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:51,792
I have Wet-Naps in the car.
All right, here, here.

542
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:53,260
Just take a sip of this.

543
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:54,528
Take that.

544
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,830
That's quite somethin'.
Hmm?

545
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:59,199
Thanks.
But I was obviously right.

546
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,801
Richard is having an affair.

547
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:03,036
His father-in-law found
out and confronted him.

548
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:04,304
"You tell her or I will."

549
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,973
Okay, but even if that were
the case, he...

550
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,241
You all right?

551
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:08,308
Yeah.

552
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,376
Even if that were the case,
I mean,

553
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:11,144
protecting a relationship
as a motive,

554
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:12,879
that's weak sauce.
You know that.

555
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:14,881
Well, then there is Joni.

556
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:16,116
Joni?
Joni?

557
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,517
Lifestyle guru Joni?

558
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,119
No, Harlan was supporting
her and her daughter

559
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,320
and that's the opposite of a motive.

560
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:21,955
And if that support was threatened...

561
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,223
Miss Cabrera, one moment, please.

562
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:24,558
Yes, I just wanna get some Scope.

563
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,826
Miss Cabrera...

564
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:30,432
Was Harlan plannin' on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

565
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:34,937
Oh, Joni.

566
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:37,339
What's up?

567
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:41,908
Oh, my God.

568
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,010
All right, don't answer that

569
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:44,311
if you're gonna puke again, please.

570
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,213
Meg said he paid the school directly.

571
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:47,950
Joni said he sent the money
to her.

572
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,083
Both were true.

573
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:52,052
She was pocketing the double payment.

574
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:53,120
Harlan found out,

575
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:54,588
and cut her off without a cent.

576
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,589
Yes?

577
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:59,192
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

578
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,128
Come on, no,
have you seen her Insta?

579
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,262
She's an influencer.

580
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:04,097
No, allowance as a motive?

581
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,532
Again, more weak sauce.

582
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,334
You're just dumpin' that vat
of weak sauce on me.

583
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,338
Granted. But she lied to me.

584
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:11,505
All three of them did.

585
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:12,508
Three?

586
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:15,375
Walter.

587
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:17,878
Ah. I see where you're
going with this.

588
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,580
Harlan had turned Walter down
before regarding film rights,

589
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:23,183
but that night, somethin'
Harlan said shook him.

590
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,951
Now we look at the pattern.

591
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:26,822
Harlan was cleanin' house.

592
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:28,857
No wonder.

593
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:31,525
Did he plan to fire Walter?

594
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,893
Can I just wait inside?

595
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:33,960
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

596
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:35,162
Yeah, please, just wait inside.

597
00:27:35,164 --> 00:27:36,498
Stay close, all right?

598
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:43,405
You have been very patient, My Friend.

599
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,341
And yes,

600
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:47,174
you are right.

601
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:49,576
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles

602
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:51,311
answer your question...

603
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:54,514
"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"

604
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:56,485
Well, now I will tell you why.

605
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,486
I'm here because this mornin',

606
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:02,191
someone dodged a very
important question.

607
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,426
Who?

608
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,694
Me.

609
00:28:06,696 --> 00:28:09,162
Linda asked who hired me.

610
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:10,599
Well, who hired you?

611
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:14,067
I do not know.

612
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:17,003
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday

613
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,172
with a news clippin'
of Thrombey's death.

614
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:20,542
An envelope?
That worked?

615
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:25,345
An envelope of cash.
Hmm.

616
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:27,682
So somebody suspects foul play

617
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:31,017
and goes through this
Ha Cha Dance of hiring me,

618
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,388
of staying anonymous.

619
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:35,457
It makes no damn sense.

620
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:38,627
Compels me, though.

621
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:42,662
Walk me through everyone's
where abouts

622
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:43,665
at the time of death.

623
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:48,435
We know that the party ended
around 11:30.

624
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:49,369
Good night, Joni.
'Night.

625
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:51,204
Marta took Harlan upstairs

626
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:52,372
to give him his meds.

627
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:56,711
The stairs leading
up to Harlan's bedroom

628
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:59,246
and his attic office creak horribly

629
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:01,248
and Linda is a light sleeper.

630
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,249
So we know every time

631
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:04,284
someone took the stairs that night.

632
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,456
The first was when Joni heard
a ka-thunk

633
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,358
from somewhere above her
in the house.

634
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,169
She's concerned about Harlan,

635
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:24,337
so she goes up to investigate...

636
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:27,607
Waking Linda.

637
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:30,076
Harlan was in his attic office
with Marta.

638
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:31,478
Hi, Joni.
I just... Hi.

639
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,612
He explained that they had just

640
00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:33,547
knocked over the Go board.

641
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:34,916
I just knocked over
the Go board, so...

642
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,284
You know, that game with the
grid and stones?

643
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:38,518
They play it every night.

644
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,754
He was fine. "Go to bed."

645
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,354
Go to bed, Joni.

646
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:42,790
Love you. 'Night.
Love you.

647
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,426
So she did.
Bye.

648
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,660
Ten minutes later,

649
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,595
Linda is awoken a second time...

650
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,132
By Marta leaving.

651
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:54,067
Walt, I'm leaving.

652
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:56,670
Walt was smokin' a cigar
on the porch with his son.

653
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,640
He saw her leave and drive off.

654
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:01,141
Noted the time.

655
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:02,409
Midnight.

656
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:09,884
Fifteen minutes later,

657
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:12,652
Linda is awoken for the third
and final time...

658
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:17,624
By someone coming down the stairs.

659
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:20,227
Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.

660
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:21,762
Dad, go back to bed.

661
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,766
Which Walt tried to discourage.

662
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:25,900
Based on this,

663
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,702
the medical examiner
determined the time of death

664
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:30,705
to be between 12:15 and 2.00 a.m.

665
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,506
As Walt was finishing his cigar

666
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:34,608
at about 12:30, Meg came home.

667
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,343
She went straight to bed.

668
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:39,246
Walt and Jacob turned in
shortly after that.

669
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:43,083
And sometime later that night,

670
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,119
it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,

671
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,322
Meg woke up because the dogs
were barking outside.

672
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:52,359
She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.

673
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:54,261
That's it. All right?

674
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:56,329
Now, everyone's stories matched,

675
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,066
every moment accounted for.

676
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:01,101
And there is no other staircase

677
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:02,302
up to Harlan's room?

678
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:04,204
None. Just the creaky one.

679
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:05,205
Interesting.

680
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,308
So, uh, we know that
Ransom didn't do it

681
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,609
because he wasn't there.

682
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,177
Marta couldn't have.

683
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,847
Harlan was still alive
when she left.

684
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:14,481
Yeah.
Meg...

685
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:16,216
Meg came home during the window

686
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,284
of the time of death, right?
Now look, look, it was a...

687
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:19,319
Except it was a suicide, all right?

688
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,421
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

689
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,223
We saw from the blood splat patterns

690
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,624
that they were uninterrupted,

691
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:26,660
meaning, it's almost
impossible for anyone

692
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:29,496
to have been around him
at the time.

693
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:30,798
He's the one who cut his
own throat, all right?

694
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,365
I don't know why we keep goin'
over this.

695
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,769
Physical evidence can tell a
clear story

696
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,405
with a forked tongue.

697
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,039
What?

698
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,473
And as we can see
from this mornin',

699
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,242
everyone can lie.

700
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:45,312
Well,

701
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:46,681
almost everyone.

702
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,786
Miss Cabrera, um...

703
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:53,553
We kept you waiting all afternoon,

704
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:56,791
because I wanted to hear
from you last.

705
00:31:56,793 --> 00:32:01,494
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,

706
00:32:01,496 --> 00:32:05,167
and your piece of it
is at its very center.

707
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,670
So, please take your time.

708
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:14,877
You took Mr. Thrombey
upstairs at 11:30

709
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,845
and left at midnight.

710
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:19,646
Think very carefully

711
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:23,818
and with as much detail as possible.

712
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,723
Tell us what happened
in that half hour?

713
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:33,660
Up, up, up, I got it.
Yeah, you got it?

714
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,262
Up, up, up, I got it.
Up, up, up, I got it.

715
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:37,597
Up, up, up, I got it.
Okay, that's...

716
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,499
Up, up, up, I got it.
Hey, Harlan...

717
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,901
Up, up, up, I got it.
Let's...

718
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:42,235
Up, up, up, I got it.

719
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:44,237
Okay.
No second thoughts.

720
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,873
No. No, no, no, no.

721
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,574
Get up here!
I had a glass of champagne.

722
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:48,943
Harlan, listen to me.
We are...

723
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:50,745
It's late. I had...
You've only had one glass.

724
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:52,379
Exactly. A glass of champagne.
I don't...

725
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:54,782
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

726
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,817
Can you just take your goddamn
medicine and go to bed?

727
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:59,252
If you're gonna put that
vile shit in me,

728
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:00,420
you have to earn it.

729
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:02,222
On my birthday.

730
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:03,623
Oh, God.
Eighty-fifth birthday.

731
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,526
Fine. Jesus!
I'm so old.

732
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,696
I'm so old.
You really love drama, huh?

733
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:09,897
Oh, Marta.

734
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:11,799
Okay, let's do this.
Nine-by-nine.

735
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:12,933
Right.
You ready?

736
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:14,601
I'll whip your ass.
Are you sure?

737
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:15,903
Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:17,205
How dare you.

739
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:21,376
I know how this is gonna end.

740
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,377
What is that?

741
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,479
Why can't I beat you at this game?

742
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,682
Because I'm not playing to
beat you.

743
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:29,315
I'm playing to build
a beautiful pattern.

744
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:30,718
That's elder abuse.

745
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,419
I'm gonna call the AARP.

746
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:34,021
Don't make me get the belt, Abuelo.

747
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,657
It's basically over.

748
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:38,895
My only hope is that
an earthquake will strike.

749
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:41,563
But what are the chances?

750
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:43,630
Uh-oh.

751
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:46,499
Hello?

752
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:48,002
Hello? Hello?

753
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:49,571
Hello? Get under a door frame!

754
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:51,339
Yes!

755
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:58,346
Such a bad loser you are!
Meds, then bed.

756
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:00,315
I'm done with you.

757
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:02,719
That's fair.

758
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:07,387
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar

759
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:08,555
out there on the porch.

760
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:10,525
Dead and nasty things.

761
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,626
How was tonight?

762
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:15,865
Tonight was, uh, good.

763
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:17,898
Oh, yeah?

764
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
I know you weren't looking
forward to it.

765
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:21,436
No. But I did it.

766
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,506
I cut the line on
all four of 'em.

767
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:26,843
Yeah.

768
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:28,809
Wasn't easy.

769
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:30,376
Mmm.

770
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:31,914
This goddamn fortune.

771
00:34:34,016 --> 00:34:35,548
You know, sometimes I think

772
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,584
that everything I've given my family,

773
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:39,954
I've done maybe

774
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:43,391
without knowing, or maybe
to keep them beneath me.

775
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,927
I certainly should have...

776
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:50,064
I don't know, encouraged Walt

777
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,534
to write his own stories,
not just be

778
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,568
a caretaker of mine.

779
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,705
Like you said I should.

780
00:34:57,707 --> 00:35:00,540
And then be a father
and not just a provider

781
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:03,343
for Joni, like you also said.

782
00:35:03,345 --> 00:35:05,946
And I could have been kinder
to Linda and Ransom...

783
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:09,083
Jesus! Ransom.

784
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:14,289
Oh, there's so much of me
in that kid.

785
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,993
Confident. Stupid.

786
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,795
I don't know, protected.

787
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:25,300
Playing life like a game,
without consequence.

788
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,437
Until you can't tell the difference

789
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:31,974
between a stage prop

790
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:34,844
and a real knife.

791
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:37,646
You know, I don't fear death.

792
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,547
But, oh, God,

793
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:43,984
I'd like to fix some
of this before I go.

794
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,088
Close the book with a flourish.

795
00:35:49,158 --> 00:35:51,725
I guess we'll see. Hmm?

796
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:52,962
I guess we will.

797
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,067
Hey.

798
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:01,369
You had a long day.

799
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,605
You wanna do drugs?

800
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,672
You mean the good stuff?

801
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:07,107
Yeah?

802
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,011
Oh, come on, send me to la-la land.

803
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,580
Just a tiny bit, okay?

804
00:36:13,582 --> 00:36:16,784
Why did I wait till my mid-age
to become a Morphine user?

805
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:18,651
What a Schmuck.

806
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:20,921
What a Nudnik.
This...

807
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:22,725
This stuff is the best.

808
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:29,431
Oh, my God.

809
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:32,001
Is there a problem?

810
00:36:34,704 --> 00:36:37,073
This is what I just gave you
100 milligrams of.

811
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:40,741
I messed up.

812
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:43,813
You gave me 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

813
00:36:46,082 --> 00:36:50,184
Excuse me, what is the good
stuff's dosage supposed to be?

814
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:52,518
Let's not call it that
right now, okay?

815
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,620
Three milligrams.

816
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:54,790
Oh, that's much less.

817
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,124
So what happens?

818
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm gonna give you an
emergency shot of Naloxone,

819
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:01,561
so you don't die in 10 minutes.

820
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:02,798
Oh, well, no pressure.

821
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:06,100
You know, this is an interesting

822
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:08,736
and efficient method of murder.

823
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:10,771
I need to write this down.

824
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:14,507
So, if someone switched
the meds on purpose,

825
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:15,978
I'd be dead in 10 minutes.

826
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:18,879
Like stone-cold dead?
Yes.

827
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:20,480
You'll feel symptoms in five.

828
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:23,083
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

829
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:26,687
Yes. That big dose injected,
within 10, your...

830
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:28,923
Your brain...

831
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,724
Yes, 10 minutes.

832
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,126
From the moment of injection?

833
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:34,161
It's eight-ish now.

834
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:36,897
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance

835
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:38,564
when he first felt the symptoms

836
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:41,969
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do,

837
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:45,940
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive

838
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:48,608
and it'd be too late.

839
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,148
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

840
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:54,647
Marta?

841
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:59,286
Do you have the Naxostuff?
Yes, I'm gonna find it.

842
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:01,654
I have it because
it comes with the kit,

843
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,491
so it should be here.
It has to be.

844
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:04,994
It's like...

845
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,904
It's not here, Harlan.

846
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:18,939
I don't know why it's not here.

847
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:20,608
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

848
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,712
To call an ambulance.

849
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:37,659
What are you doing?

850
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:40,730
What are you doing?

851
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:44,765
Marta, listen to me.

852
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:45,833
Harlan, I need to call the ambulance.

853
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:46,934
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!

854
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:48,035
They need to get here.
There's no time!

855
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:49,103
You have to...
You have to listen!

856
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:50,603
I'm calling the family!

857
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:56,276
What are you doing?

858
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,145
Are you nuts?
Don't make a noise.

859
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,780
Harlan, we have to call the ambulance.
Marta, listen to me!

860
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:00,848
We don't have time!

861
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,049
What's going on?
Listen to me!

862
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,018
Now, if what you said is true,
I'm gone.

863
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,152
There's no saving me.

864
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:06,220
No, no.

865
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:07,653
We have six minutes.

866
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:08,889
No, I can't...
Wait, no.

867
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,724
We have got to get you
out of this!

868
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,094
Think of your mom.

869
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:13,761
My mom?

870
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:17,031
Marta, get behind me,
get behind me.

871
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:18,167
Don't make a noise.

872
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:20,169
Harlan?

873
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,236
Marta?

874
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:23,871
Everything all right?

875
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:26,373
Oh, hi, Joni.
I thought I... Hi.

876
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,375
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

877
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:30,310
No, no.
We're fine. We're fine.

878
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:34,281
Well, I just knocked over this Go board.
Sorry about that.

879
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:36,316
Everyone's all right?
Yeah, fine.

880
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,819
No, no.
Go to bed, Joni.

881
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:40,387
Okay.

882
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:42,890
Maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the family...

883
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,258
Tomorrow's fine.

884
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,196
Goodnight. Love you. 'Night.
Love you. Bye.

885
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:51,734
Come on.

886
00:39:53,102 --> 00:39:54,270
Pay attention, now.

887
00:39:55,037 --> 00:39:56,737
Your mom

888
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,671
is still undocumented.

889
00:39:58,673 --> 00:40:00,107
And if this is your fault,

890
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,810
she'll be found out
and at best deported

891
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:04,878
and your family will be broken.

892
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,981
We're not gonna let that happen,
are we, huh?

893
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:10,984
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

894
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:13,122
Will you do this, Marta? Hmm?

895
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:15,590
This last thing

896
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:17,424
for me?

897
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:18,626
For your family?

898
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,499
What do you want me to do?

899
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:28,402
Go downstairs as noisily as
you can

900
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:30,037
and then say goodbye loudly.

901
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,105
Walt, I'm leaving.

902
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,706
Call attention to the time...

903
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,007
God, it's midnight already.

904
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:35,077
If you can.

905
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:38,178
Drive out the gate.

906
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,147
Then to avoid the security cameras,

907
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:43,185
pull off the road before
the carved elephant.

908
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:46,253
Wait.
Was it before or after?

909
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:48,021
After the carved elephant.

910
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:49,823
No, he said before.
Was it?

911
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,825
Beafterfore the carved elephant.

912
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:52,928
Oh, shit.

913
00:40:56,365 --> 00:41:00,934
Park, and come back on foot
up to the house.

914
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:04,738
Take the side yard pass
through the little gate.

915
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,107
The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.

916
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,844
You've got to get up
to the third floor

917
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,045
without being seen.

918
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:14,448
And the only way is to climb
the side trellis

919
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,451
and come in through
the trick hall window.

920
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:18,852
You gotta be kidding me.

921
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,921
I am not. Do it.

922
00:41:29,365 --> 00:41:32,499
And for God's sake,
don't make any noise!

923
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:45,779
Once you're inside,
now this is the tricky part...

924
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:47,214
This is the tricky part?

925
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:50,450
Get my robe and cap from my bedroom

926
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:52,019
and put them on.

927
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,053
Harlan...

928
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,155
This is crazy.
I don't think I can do that.

929
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:56,957
No, we need to make this so airtight

930
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:57,891
that the average cop

931
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,427
will entirely dismiss you
as a suspect.

932
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:02,831
It sounds crazy, but it'll work.

933
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,206
Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you

934
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,873
through the glazed window.

935
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,977
Dad? Go back to bed.

936
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:17,945
You were seen leaving.

937
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:20,948
The security cameras
show you driving off.

938
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,149
And 20 minutes later,

939
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:25,152
I'm seen alive and well by my son.

940
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:26,186
You see,

941
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:28,822
you've gone from suspect
number one

942
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:30,490
to an impossibility.

943
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:32,392
Leave the way you came

944
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:35,231
and don't be seen.

945
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:47,109
Ransom?

946
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:50,879
Are you back again already?

947
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,083
Drive home.

948
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:58,185
And sometime in the next few days

949
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:00,320
the police will question you.

950
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:03,090
No. No, no, no. No!

951
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,025
I can't lie!

952
00:43:05,027 --> 00:43:07,027
You know I can't lie!
I'll puke!

953
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:09,863
Well, then don't lie.
Tell fragments of the truth.

954
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:11,298
In this exact order.

955
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,009
I took him upstairs.

956
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:23,345
We played our nightly game of Go.

957
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,581
At some point,
he knocked the board over

958
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:30,786
and Joni came up to check on us.

959
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,554
Um...

960
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,058
I gave him pain medication.

961
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:39,528
He pulled his shoulder last week.

962
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,128
Um...

963
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,465
And I left him in his study.

964
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,465
At midnight

965
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:46,869
I said goodbye to Walt,

966
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:50,003
went home.

967
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,174
What kind of medication
did you give him?

968
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:57,311
Since his injury,
I've been giving him

969
00:43:57,313 --> 00:44:00,480
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

970
00:44:00,482 --> 00:44:02,883
It's a non-narcotic analgesic.

971
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:04,618
And to help him sleep,

972
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,220
three milligrams of Morphine.

973
00:44:07,222 --> 00:44:09,089
And the family was aware of this?

974
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:10,424
Yes, of course.

975
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:12,592
Did you notice anything strange

976
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:14,296
or off about his demeanor?

977
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,201
No.

978
00:44:23,072 --> 00:44:25,140
Well, that sounds about right.

979
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:28,344
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

980
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,196
Hey, sis, people are
gonna start getting here

981
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:50,497
for the memorial pretty soon.

982
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:51,500
Are you...

983
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:56,203
Are you all right?

984
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:58,507
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

985
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,177
This all feels like one.

986
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,647
Like something he'd write,
not do.

987
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:09,518
I keep waiting for the big reveal.

988
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,653
Where it'll make sense.

989
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:15,224
Wouldn't that be nice?

990
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:17,493
Oh, Walt.

991
00:45:20,662 --> 00:45:22,498
I don't think he killed himself.

992
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:25,298
I don't. I really don't.

993
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,967
There's this Hallmark movie

994
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,269
called Deadly by Surprise
with Danica McKellar.

995
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,705
And in it, she plays this wife

996
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:33,140
who's getting poisoned by her husband,

997
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:34,742
but he's doing it little by little,

998
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:35,710
so she doesn't know it

999
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:38,445
and she goes crazy,
and she kills herself.

1000
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,313
And my cousin, who's a receptionist

1001
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:42,082
at the medical examiner's office,

1002
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:44,117
she says that stuff totally happens.

1003
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,652
It's not even 3% as crazy

1004
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,320
as the stuff she's seen
come through there.

1005
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:48,424
So, I'm just like...

1006
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:51,591
Oh, God, yeah!

1007
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:53,761
I mean, don't like him
because you love him.

1008
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:56,630
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

1009
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,032
But maybe an asshole
is what we needed.

1010
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,600
Oh, my God, yeah,

1011
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:02,335
an asshole is what Germany needed

1012
00:46:02,337 --> 00:46:04,404
in 1930-whatever.
Here we go.

1013
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:06,373
Come on, Joni, those two
things don't even conflate.

1014
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,074
There is the problem...
Oh, Jesus.

1015
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:09,209
You do not care about
anybody's feelings...

1016
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:11,712
I'm gonna disappear until
the politics talk is done.

1017
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:14,114
You, my friend...
You want some champers?

1018
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:16,016
I can't.
I'm technically working.

1019
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:17,752
Why don't you take off
your red cap, Richard,

1020
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:18,786
and look around you?

1021
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:21,254
The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.

1022
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,289
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1023
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:25,592
We are losing our way of life
and our culture.

1024
00:46:25,594 --> 00:46:26,626
That's right.

1025
00:46:26,628 --> 00:46:28,328
There are millions of Mexicans coming.

1026
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,730
Oh, God, really?
Don't make this a race thing.

1027
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:31,331
You always make this a race thing.

1028
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,700
Yeah, this is not about race.
I would say the same thing

1029
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:34,134
if they were European immigrants.

1030
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:36,102
Oh, yeah?
So, if the Swiss were, like,

1031
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:38,138
clogging in the streets...
No. No, no, we allow them in

1032
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,373
and they think they own what's ours.

1033
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,576
They're putting children in cages!

1034
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,744
I mean, these are camps!
Yes.

1035
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:45,111
Come on, Joni,

1036
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:46,580
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

1037
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:48,515
but the parents have some
blame here.

1038
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:51,251
Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?

1039
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:53,821
Isn't that what America is...
For breaking the law!

1040
00:46:53,823 --> 00:46:54,755
My God.

1041
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:55,622
And you're gonna hate hearing this,

1042
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:58,325
but it's true, America is for Americans.

1043
00:46:58,327 --> 00:46:59,559
Don't point at me.

1044
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:00,728
Where's Marta?
Is she still here?

1045
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,262
Oh, God, don't.
Marta!

1046
00:47:02,264 --> 00:47:03,563
Come on over.
No, Richard.

1047
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:04,832
Come on over, Marta.
Please, come over.

1048
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,099
You're shitting me.

1049
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:07,467
Marta,

1050
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,438
your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

1051
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,841
I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.

1052
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:15,210
She did it the right way.

1053
00:47:15,812 --> 00:47:17,277
You work hard,

1054
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:20,080
and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.

1055
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:22,482
Just like Dad and like all
the rest of us.

1056
00:47:22,484 --> 00:47:24,417
And I'll bet you agree with
me, right?

1057
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:26,687
Oh, just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

1058
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:29,289
It's okay! I just wanna
hear what she has to say!

1059
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,423
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

1060
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:31,759
Oh, Sweetheart,
don't feel pressure to answer.

1061
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,393
This is just a...
Look...

1062
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:34,494
Please don't.
If you wanna

1063
00:47:34,496 --> 00:47:36,263
become an American,

1064
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,699
there are legal ways to do it.

1065
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:40,233
But if you break the law,

1066
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,669
it doesn't matter
how good your heart is,

1067
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:45,505
you gotta face the consequences!

1068
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:47,140
Are you goddamn insane?

1069
00:47:47,142 --> 00:47:49,344
It's done.
Hey! I'm warning you.

1070
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:56,383
That's when I ask her,
I'm like,

1071
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:57,551
"Tonya, what is wrong with people?"

1072
00:47:57,553 --> 00:47:59,252
Literally.

1073
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,621
Oh, my God!
Marta, what?

1074
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:03,123
Marta?

1075
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,257
What's the matter?

1076
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:06,459
Whoa, whoa.
Hey. Breathe.

1077
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:09,462
Oh, my gosh.
Marta, are you okay?

1078
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,701
Hey, Fran, do you still
have your stash?

1079
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:18,672
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

1080
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:21,308
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

1081
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:22,677
Thanks, Fran.

1082
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,578
Hey. Hey.
I'm sorry.

1083
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,680
No, just... No, stop...
I'm sorry.

1084
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:27,180
I'm just very, very sorry.

1085
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:28,783
Stop saying you're sorry. Jesus!

1086
00:48:28,785 --> 00:48:30,918
I hate this.
Oh, God, my heart won't stop...

1087
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,185
I can't...

1088
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:35,324
It's just everything...
No, thank you.

1089
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

1090
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:43,298
Who's gonna open a clock?

1091
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:46,901
Do you want dinner, Nana?

1092
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:49,235
Dinner? To eat?

1093
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:51,237
To eat?
Walt?

1094
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:52,707
Nana?
Walt, Walt, she's fine.

1095
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,811
She ate the entire
salmon spread already.

1096
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:59,446
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

1097
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,348
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

1098
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,550
Yes. Yes, a very good time,
right now.

1099
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:04,885
Oh, okay.

1100
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:06,823
All right. Calm down.

1101
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:10,791
Marta,

1102
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,395
we've been talking it over
and, uh...

1103
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,631
Have you been smoking grass?
No.

1104
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:19,599
Mmm-hmm.
Come on.

1105
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:21,368
Marta, we've been talking it over,

1106
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,804
and, uh, the whole family,

1107
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,708
we'd like to take care of you.

1108
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:28,510
What does that mean?

1109
00:49:29,712 --> 00:49:31,746
We all think that you deserve something.

1110
00:49:31,748 --> 00:49:34,347
Financially, we'd like to
help you out.

1111
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,318
You were never anything
but good to Dad

1112
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,154
and because of that we...

1113
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:41,390
You can count on us.

1114
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:43,693
Hmm?
Yeah.

1115
00:49:45,862 --> 00:49:48,395
I thought you should've been
at the funeral,

1116
00:49:48,397 --> 00:49:50,365
by the way, I was out voted.

1117
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,344
Detective.

1118
00:50:03,746 --> 00:50:04,747
You're still here?

1119
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,482
Mmm.

1120
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,253
Did you know Harlan?

1121
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:14,521
He knew my father,

1122
00:50:14,523 --> 00:50:16,591
who was a police detective
years ago.

1123
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:18,726
Oh.

1124
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:20,662
My father respected Harlan.

1125
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:23,329
That says quite a lot.

1126
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:24,666
Is that why you're here?

1127
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:27,802
Here now, here?

1128
00:50:27,804 --> 00:50:29,904
No.

1129
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:32,240
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

1130
00:50:37,612 --> 00:50:40,615
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

1131
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:43,616
I know it.

1132
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:45,654
I believe you know it, too.

1133
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:48,791
So you're gonna keep digging?

1134
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:53,493
Harlan's detectives, they dig.

1135
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:55,696
They riffle and root.

1136
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:56,933
Truffle pigs.

1137
00:50:58,735 --> 00:51:02,705
I anticipate the terminus
of Gravity's Rainbow.

1138
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:04,707
Gravity's Rainbow?

1139
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,639
It's a novel.

1140
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:08,475
Yeah, I know.

1141
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:10,845
I haven't read it though.
Neither have I.

1142
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:11,912
Nobody has.

1143
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:13,381
But I like the title.

1144
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:16,516
It describes the path of a projectile

1145
00:51:16,518 --> 00:51:18,919
determined by natural law.

1146
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:21,454
Et voila, my method.

1147
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:22,790
I observe the facts

1148
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:25,625
without biases of the head or heart.

1149
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,627
I determine the arc's path,

1150
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:30,363
stroll leisurely to its terminus

1151
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:32,902
and the truth falls at my feet.

1152
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,773
The medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide,

1153
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:41,811
but Elliott agreed to keep it
pending for 48 hours.

1154
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:43,543
Tomorrow morning,

1155
00:51:43,545 --> 00:51:45,378
I search the grounds and the house,

1156
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,515
begin my investigation.

1157
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:49,750
I want you to be by my side
for it.

1158
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:51,351
What?
My Confidante.

1159
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:52,452
My eyes and ears.

1160
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:54,387
Hey. Wait, wait, Detective.
Why me?

1161
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:56,859
I trust your kind heart.

1162
00:51:58,761 --> 00:51:59,760
Also, you're the only one

1163
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:01,864
who had nothing to gain
from Harlan's death.

1164
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:04,599
So how about it, Watson?

1165
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:06,834
Hey, Detective?

1166
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:09,038
If you want my insight
into the family...

1167
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:11,874
None of them are murderers.

1168
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:13,808
That's my insight.

1169
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,042
And yet,

1170
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:18,112
be it cruel or comforting,

1171
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:21,751
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

1172
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:24,386
That's what it does.

1173
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:26,856
Always?

1174
00:52:27,857 --> 00:52:29,091
Tomorrow at 8:00.

1175
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:01,654
I know I've missed something.

1176
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:02,823
There's gonna be something I missed.

1177
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:04,859
Harlan.
But I know you can do this.

1178
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:05,926
No, I can't.

1179
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:07,493
Without losing your soul,

1180
00:53:07,495 --> 00:53:08,762
you have to do what you have
to do...

1181
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:10,164
No.
To beat this and win.

1182
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,598
Harlan, I can't.

1183
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,602
You can. And you have to.
No.

1184
00:53:14,603 --> 00:53:15,637
For me.

1185
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:18,373
Right now!

1186
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:39,095
Harlan, I have to get you help.

1187
00:53:40,528 --> 00:53:41,931
You do as I say

1188
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:45,533
and everything will be just fine.

1189
00:53:45,868 --> 00:53:47,768
No. No.

1190
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,905
I promise.

1191
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:50,971
But...

1192
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:03,077
Fifty years ago,
I worked this estate.

1193
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,046
You know, security back then
was such that

1194
00:55:06,048 --> 00:55:09,683
you had to make the rounds
with a 94

1195
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:12,618
and keep your ears open.

1196
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:17,024
Now you've got all this modern technology.

1197
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:19,259
Now, that's the video there.

1198
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:22,062
I saved the tape from that night.

1199
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:25,699
Normally, I erase 'em
with a magnetic degausser,

1200
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,836
but in this case, I thought
I'd just save it, you know?

1201
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:30,603
For security.

1202
00:55:30,605 --> 00:55:33,075
Now, uh, that's a live feed there.

1203
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:36,777
To avoid the security cameras,

1204
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:39,579
pull off the road after the
carved elephant.

1205
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:41,715
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

1206
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,649
Well, of course you can.

1207
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:45,886
I recorded it SSLP.

1208
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:47,788
There's eight hours in that tape.

1209
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,925
9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

1210
00:55:59,601 --> 00:56:01,667
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

1211
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:03,971
You think we could
scan forward on that?

1212
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,339
Are we all gonna die in seven days?

1213
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:06,740
How can we scan forward?

1214
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,243
Oh, yeah,
just hold the play button down

1215
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:12,647
and press FF until you hear
it grind.

1216
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:20,721
All right.
Should be coming up now

1217
00:56:20,723 --> 00:56:22,158
to the time when the party ended.

1218
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:27,061
What happened?

1219
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:29,662
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

1220
00:56:29,664 --> 00:56:31,799
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

1221
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:33,901
You think your guys can
digitize this

1222
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:35,335
so we could scan it properly?

1223
00:56:35,337 --> 00:56:36,705
Yeah, I think we can do that.

1224
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:38,874
I got it.

1225
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:42,342
You know, all these statues

1226
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:43,410
that you see around here?

1227
00:56:43,412 --> 00:56:44,945
They're all straight out
of the series,

1228
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:46,880
The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.

1229
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:48,882
Pretty cool.
Awesome.

1230
00:56:48,884 --> 00:56:50,284
Yeah.

1231
00:56:50,286 --> 00:56:52,719
Benny, it's beautiful out here,

1232
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:54,654
but do you really think
someone broke into the house

1233
00:56:54,656 --> 00:56:56,323
and murdered Harlan?
Is that why we're out here?

1234
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:58,192
Oh, it is unlikely,

1235
00:56:58,194 --> 00:57:00,894
but if they did,
there will be traces.

1236
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:03,065
Uh, I can hang on to that.
Yeah.

1237
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:13,907
Hey, Wagner, you got any luck on...

1238
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,910
Uh, what's-his-name?
Ransom?

1239
00:57:16,912 --> 00:57:18,781
Yeah.
No.

1240
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:21,448
Did get an address though.

1241
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,320
Yeah?
10 Kenoak Street.

1242
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:27,221
Ken... Kenoak?

1243
00:57:27,223 --> 00:57:28,791
Uh-huh.
Kenoak.

1244
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:32,061
It's a pleasant thing to say,
isn't it?

1245
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:33,927
Kenoak.

1246
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:36,396
I awoke amid Kenoak.

1247
00:57:36,398 --> 00:57:38,232
That's funny. Ken-oh-kia.

1248
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:39,933
All these leaves and mud,

1249
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:42,436
they're really gonna do
a number on my boots, Man.

1250
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:45,772
Mud. Did it rain the past week?

1251
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:47,207
No, stay there!
What?

1252
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,342
Whoa!

1253
00:57:48,344 --> 00:57:49,476
Okay.

1254
00:57:49,478 --> 00:57:51,411
We got footprints here, so, uh...

1255
00:57:51,413 --> 00:57:52,882
Oh.
I wanna, um...

1256
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:54,982
Marta...

1257
00:57:54,984 --> 00:57:56,316
Stop.
What?

1258
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:57,484
Um...
What?

1259
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:58,952
Marta, stay there.

1260
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:01,121
What?
No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.

1261
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:02,489
No! No!
I couldn't hear. If you...

1262
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:03,757
Did you call me?
All right.

1263
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:04,825
All right.
Excuse me.

1264
00:58:04,827 --> 00:58:05,792
All right.
Come here.

1265
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:07,327
Wagner, we're gonna
need to call the boys,

1266
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:08,395
have 'em come down here,

1267
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:09,263
take a look at all these tracks.

1268
00:58:09,265 --> 00:58:11,098
Get it taped off.
Stay on that side.

1269
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,299
I'm sorry.
Watch out. Watch out.

1270
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:13,869
Okay.

1271
00:58:14,503 --> 00:58:15,971
Hey! Yeah!

1272
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:18,338
Hussie? Hussie, hey.

1273
00:58:19,808 --> 00:58:22,442
Best judge of character is a dog.

1274
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:24,411
Good boy.
I've found that to be true.

1275
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,219
Yes!

1276
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:32,419
My puppies!

1277
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:33,487
Yes.
Yeah, well,

1278
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:36,924
they've got plans to read
the will at around 10:00,

1279
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:38,794
so, the whole family
will be here soon.

1280
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,896
I've never been to a will reading.

1281
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,298
Oh, well...

1282
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,067
You think it'd be like a game show,

1283
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:49,236
but think of a community
theater production

1284
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:50,940
of a tax return.

1285
00:58:52,474 --> 00:58:54,408
So, what are we looking for?

1286
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,409
Oh, you know,

1287
00:58:55,411 --> 00:58:58,879
anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

1288
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:01,014
You'll know it when you see it.

1289
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:02,284
Oh, my God.

1290
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:05,154
Sweet beans!

1291
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:10,359
Well...

1292
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,962
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1293
00:59:21,971 --> 00:59:23,839
You think you could
handle the study?

1294
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:36,149
Where's your medical bag?

1295
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:38,318
I don't know.
I left it here.

1296
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,020
I always leave it here
with Harlan at night.

1297
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:41,455
They must have taken
it in as evidence.

1298
00:59:41,457 --> 00:59:43,056
I'll look into that.

1299
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:44,191
Mmm.

1300
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:49,965
Shit.

1301
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:55,202
How'd the Go board get knocked over?

1302
00:59:55,204 --> 00:59:56,905
We were just goofing around.

1303
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,842
What are you thinking?

1304
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:16,825
No! No, no, no!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1305
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,259
Oh, let me guess.

1306
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:21,330
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1307
01:00:22,097 --> 01:00:23,132
Stop. Stop.

1308
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:26,433
Hugh Drysdale?

1309
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:29,336
Ransom. Call me Ransom,
it's my middle name.

1310
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:30,939
Only the help calls me Hugh.

1311
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:32,973
Okay.

1312
01:00:32,975 --> 01:00:34,541
Uh, this is Trooper Wagner.

1313
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:36,576
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

1314
01:00:36,578 --> 01:00:38,280
We just wanna ask a few questions.

1315
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:43,385
Excuse me?

1316
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,952
Sir?

1317
01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:47,421
We're officers of the law!

1318
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:49,489
You gonna run me in?
I don't feel like talking.

1319
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:51,124
I'm distraught.

1320
01:00:51,126 --> 01:00:53,460
Hey, Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

1321
01:00:53,462 --> 01:00:54,961
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

1322
01:00:54,963 --> 01:00:56,031
Mr. Drysdale.

1323
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:58,867
CSI KFC?

1324
01:01:03,906 --> 01:01:05,305
Hey, Frannie,

1325
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:06,973
how about a glass of cold milk?

1326
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:08,342
Hey, Asshole.

1327
01:01:08,344 --> 01:01:10,043
Not her name, not her job.

1328
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:13,380
Hey, Meg.
How's the SJW degree coming?

1329
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:16,185
Trust fund prick.
All right, Guys.

1330
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:17,951
Hey.

1331
01:01:17,953 --> 01:01:20,153
Hey. Everyone...

1332
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:22,422
I'm just gonna be in the other room,
setting up.

1333
01:01:22,424 --> 01:01:23,926
Be ready in 10 minutes.

1334
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:31,932
Funny, Ransom,
you skipped the funeral,

1335
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:33,569
but you're early for the will reading.

1336
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:37,637
Okay, people grieve in
different ways.

1337
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:38,638
Let's not...

1338
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,340
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

1339
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:41,641
Why are you even bothering?

1340
01:01:41,643 --> 01:01:43,276
That's what I'm asking myself.

1341
01:01:43,278 --> 01:01:44,945
What's that supposed to mean?

1342
01:01:44,947 --> 01:01:47,047
He knows what it's supposed
to mean.

1343
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:48,450
Wait... Walt, what?

1344
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:53,422
Jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party.

1345
01:01:55,157 --> 01:01:57,157
Oh, that's where you were all night?

1346
01:01:57,159 --> 01:01:58,458
What the hell were you doing

1347
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,727
in the bathroom all night?

1348
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,595
Nothing.
Swatting Syrian Refugees?

1349
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:02,662
No, I was not.

1350
01:02:02,664 --> 01:02:03,964
Alt-right Troll.

1351
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:05,031
Liberal Snowflake.

1352
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:06,701
I don't know what
any of that means.

1353
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,468
It means your son's a little creep.

1354
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,536
Oh!

1355
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:11,138
My son's a creep?

1356
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,439
Guys, just...

1357
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:14,040
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

1358
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:15,475
Yeah, he was in the bathroom.

1359
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:18,280
Joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

1360
01:02:19,348 --> 01:02:21,081
You know what, Richard?

1361
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,149
You wanna go?

1362
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:23,751
You bet, Skippy, let's go.

1363
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:25,185
You wanna go?
Come on!

1364
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:26,553
You better watch out, Man.

1365
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:28,155
Walt, stop it right now!
Son of a bitch!

1366
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:29,222
Stop it! Just stop!
Stop it!

1367
01:02:29,224 --> 01:02:30,257
Let go!
Let go, Richard!

1368
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:32,125
I have been waiting
for this my whole life!

1369
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:34,327
Stop it, right now!
Donna, I can handle myself!

1370
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:35,662
Stop it!
I can handle it.

1371
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:37,063
Oh, my God.

1372
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:39,366
We gotta do this more often.

1373
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:40,369
Hey!

1374
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,169
Jacob.

1375
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:44,037
We know where this is going.

1376
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:46,139
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

1377
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:47,708
where he had the fight with Ransom.

1378
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,342
Now, you heard something.

1379
01:02:49,344 --> 01:02:50,479
Spill it.

1380
01:02:52,514 --> 01:02:54,448
I just heard two things.

1381
01:02:57,787 --> 01:02:58,987
My Will.

1382
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:00,355
"My Will."

1383
01:03:01,223 --> 01:03:03,625
And then there was more yelling.

1384
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,662
And then I heard Ransom say...

1385
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:09,131
"I'm warning you."

1386
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:14,702
Ransom...

1387
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,603
What's that mean?

1388
01:03:16,605 --> 01:03:19,105
I think it means our father
finally came to his senses

1389
01:03:19,107 --> 01:03:22,476
and cut this worthless
little brat out of his will.

1390
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:25,078
So I guess you're gonna have
to sell the Beemer

1391
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,080
and give your notice
at the country club,

1392
01:03:27,082 --> 01:03:29,382
and kick whatever fashion
drug you're on.

1393
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:30,617
Because if you think

1394
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:32,619
that after all the bridges
you've burned,

1395
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:33,653
after all the shit you said,

1396
01:03:33,655 --> 01:03:36,423
after everything that you put
this family through

1397
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:37,657
for the last 10 years,

1398
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:40,093
that any of us are gonna
support you

1399
01:03:40,095 --> 01:03:42,195
that any of us are gonna give you,

1400
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,164
like Dad liked to say,

1401
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:46,466
"A single red dime..."

1402
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:47,768
you're nuts!

1403
01:03:49,338 --> 01:03:50,439
Wow.

1404
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:53,342
Son...

1405
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:55,843
Father.

1406
01:03:55,845 --> 01:03:57,845
Did Harlan tell you

1407
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,648
he was gonna cut you
out of the will?

1408
01:04:01,517 --> 01:04:02,551
Yep.

1409
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:07,822
Well, then he's done

1410
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:10,158
what none of us were
strong enough to do.

1411
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:14,731
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

1412
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:18,598
This might be the best thing

1413
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,333
that could ever happen to you.

1414
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:22,803
Thank you.
My Mother, Ladies and Gentlemen.

1415
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:25,505
Look, this is not gonna be
easy for you,

1416
01:04:25,507 --> 01:04:27,107
but it'll be good.

1417
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:28,778
Nothing good is ever easy.

1418
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:30,711
Up your ass, Joni.

1419
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:32,880
You've had your teeth in this
family's tit for a long time.

1420
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:35,181
"Up your ass"?
Oh, very nice.

1421
01:04:35,183 --> 01:04:37,284
Matter of fact, eat shit.
Oh, my God, Ransom.

1422
01:04:37,286 --> 01:04:38,351
What?
How's that?

1423
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:39,653
Please do not use that word

1424
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:41,154
in front of my son.
In fact, eat shit. Eat shit.

1425
01:04:41,156 --> 01:04:42,322
If I wasn't practicing...

1426
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:43,290
Eat shit.
You entitled prick!

1427
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,892
I would slap that smug smile
right off...

1428
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:47,360
Definitely eat shit.
Of your goddamn face!

1429
01:04:47,362 --> 01:04:48,796
Eat shit.
You can all eat shit.

1430
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,402
I'm not eating one iota of shit!

1431
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:58,405
What was that about will
readings being boring?

1432
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:00,507
The exception that proves the rule.

1433
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:04,179
Asshole.

1434
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,581
"I'm warning you."

1435
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,784
Ransom said, "I'm warning you."

1436
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:11,451
Well, you heard Ransom in there.

1437
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:13,620
That's the kind of thing he says.

1438
01:05:13,622 --> 01:05:15,290
You want this?
You want this?

1439
01:05:19,862 --> 01:05:21,698
What do we have here?

1440
01:05:27,569 --> 01:05:31,271
This looks like a relatively
fresh break.

1441
01:05:31,273 --> 01:05:32,674
Yep. Right there.

1442
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:35,241
Wait a minute.

1443
01:05:35,243 --> 01:05:37,346
Well, that doesn't make sense.

1444
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:39,914
Where's that window?

1445
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:42,315
How about some more cookies, Hugh?

1446
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,219
You want some more cookies?
That's great. That's great.

1447
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:46,721
Hey, maybe Harlan left you

1448
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:49,625
a cold glass of milk in his will.
Asshole.

1449
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,629
Show me.
But stay off the carpet.

1450
01:06:08,543 --> 01:06:10,443
It's the trick window

1451
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:12,646
from A Kill For All Seasons.

1452
01:06:12,648 --> 01:06:14,349
Trooper, here, will you?
Take this.

1453
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:26,393
Hmm.

1454
01:06:26,395 --> 01:06:29,629
Traces of dried mud.

1455
01:06:29,631 --> 01:06:32,601
I suspect they go the length
of the hallway.

1456
01:06:33,635 --> 01:06:34,735
Footprints?

1457
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:36,636
No, just traces.

1458
01:06:36,638 --> 01:06:39,506
Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,

1459
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:42,743
this could have happened
at any time, right?

1460
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:44,781
No, that would not explain this.

1461
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:47,782
Analyze that mud.

1462
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:49,482
It will match these traces.

1463
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:50,450
Take this to Jamie.

1464
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:51,551
And you will find similar samples

1465
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:54,423
leading up the trellis on the
outside of the house.

1466
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,523
On the night of the party,

1467
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:59,526
somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps,

1468
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:01,261
went to a great deal of trouble

1469
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:02,965
to break into Harlan
Thrombey's rooms.

1470
01:07:04,332 --> 01:07:06,803
The game is afoot, eh, Watson?

1471
01:07:17,646 --> 01:07:20,781
Well, thank you all for
getting together like this.

1472
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:23,017
It isn't legally necessary,

1473
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:24,517
but I thought because
you're all in town,

1474
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:26,319
and some of you are leaving soon...

1475
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:27,387
Excuse me.

1476
01:07:27,389 --> 01:07:29,690
Uh, I'm sorry.

1477
01:07:29,692 --> 01:07:32,760
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to gently request

1478
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:34,294
that you all stay in town

1479
01:07:34,296 --> 01:07:36,731
until the investigation is completed.

1480
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:38,631
Yeah, well, he's gently requesting,

1481
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:40,366
but I'm gonna have
to make that an order.

1482
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:42,069
No one move until we
figure this all out.

1483
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:43,336
What?

1484
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:44,537
Can we ask why?

1485
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:46,006
Has something changed?
No.

1486
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:48,075
No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?

1487
01:07:48,077 --> 01:07:49,810
Mr. Stevens...

1488
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:51,544
You may continue.

1489
01:07:51,546 --> 01:07:52,815
Right. Well...

1490
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:54,882
The other reason I thought

1491
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:57,317
this gathering would be, uh, beneficial

1492
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:00,855
is because Harlan altered his will

1493
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:02,489
a week before he died.

1494
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:03,858
He sealed it.

1495
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,459
He asked me not to submit it
to the courts

1496
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,895
for probate until after his death.

1497
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:10,831
So, if anyone is confused
about anything,

1498
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,399
we're all together, we can talk.

1499
01:08:13,401 --> 01:08:15,568
Although I don't imagine
any of it

1500
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:17,470
is going to be that complicated.

1501
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:19,539
Uh, Harlan's assets included...

1502
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:20,607
Um...

1503
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:21,976
The house.
The house,

1504
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:23,643
which he owned out right.

1505
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:24,712
Um...

1506
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:25,913
$60 million.

1507
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:28,716
Yes. $60 million in various
cash accounts

1508
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:30,084
and investments.

1509
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:31,687
And of course,

1510
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:33,721
the real asset,

1511
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:36,389
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,

1512
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:37,557
his publishing company.

1513
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:41,128
He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes

1514
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,832
and he wanted that read first.

1515
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,668
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni...

1516
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,571
"Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1517
01:08:51,573 --> 01:08:53,874
"No pleasure was taken in the exclusion.

1518
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:55,676
"And its purpose was not to sow

1519
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,377
"Greater discord in the family,

1520
01:08:57,379 --> 01:08:59,046
"Quite the opposite.

1521
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:01,682
"Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness,

1522
01:09:01,684 --> 01:09:03,083
"But do accept it,

1523
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:05,021
"It's for the best. Dad."

1524
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:18,699
Um...

1525
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:22,435
Wow. Well, yeah,
not too complex at all.

1526
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:23,503
This will be quick.

1527
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:28,075
"I, Harlan Thrombey,
being of sound mind and body"

1528
01:09:28,077 --> 01:09:31,111
and yada-yada-yada...

1529
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,781
"I hereby direct that all my assets,

1530
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:35,515
"Both liquid and otherwise...

1531
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:38,988
"I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

1532
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:43,724
"My entire ownership of
Blood Like Wine publishing,

1533
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:46,593
"I leave in its entirety
to Marta Cabrera,

1534
01:09:46,595 --> 01:09:48,661
"The copyright of its
catalogue likewise

1535
01:09:48,663 --> 01:09:51,499
"I leave in its entirety
to Marta Cabrera."

1536
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:56,739
What?

1537
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,008
Uh...

1538
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,577
What?
No.

1539
01:10:03,612 --> 01:10:05,813
That's not... That's... No.
No.

1540
01:10:05,815 --> 01:10:06,881
That can't be.
No.

1541
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:07,982
Can I see that please, Alan?

1542
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:09,449
Yeah. It's right.
Please.

1543
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:10,751
This can't be legal.

1544
01:10:10,753 --> 01:10:12,186
It's right.

1545
01:10:12,188 --> 01:10:13,888
You know, he was...
Oh, my God.

1546
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,055
Aren't there Safeguards...

1547
01:10:15,057 --> 01:10:16,456
Alan, there's a mistake.

1548
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:17,825
I don't know what to say.

1549
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:19,126
We're his family, so...

1550
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:20,593
It's not possible.

1551
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:22,662
Are there Safeguards against this?

1552
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:25,465
Right mind.
Something...

1553
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:26,767
You know...
Alan, listen...

1554
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:27,968
He was on medication.
In his final days,

1555
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,602
he was on a great deal of medication.

1556
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:30,905
Morphine?
All right, Morphine.

1557
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:32,206
I mean, I don't know.
This is confusing.

1558
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,041
She seems like family...
Alan, you can take...

1559
01:10:34,043 --> 01:10:35,709
But she's not our family.
This piece of paper

1560
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:38,779
and shove it right up your ass,
and get out!

1561
01:10:38,781 --> 01:10:40,247
And, you cops, too, out.

1562
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:41,782
Linda?
Out! Right now.

1563
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:44,151
Hey, Linda?
No, Richard, we need to talk.

1564
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:46,887
We need to fight this thing.
We're not going anywhere.

1565
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:49,023
I said get out!

1566
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:51,624
We are the Thrombeys,
God damn it!

1567
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,595
This is still our house!

1568
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:00,834
Hmm?

1569
01:11:00,836 --> 01:11:02,703
Oh, sorry.

1570
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,039
"Likewise the house at 2
Deerborn Drive

1571
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,674
"And all belongings therein,

1572
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:09,143
"I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1573
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:13,113
Oh, you little bitch!

1574
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:15,849
You little bitch!
Linda?

1575
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:16,984
Did you know about this?

1576
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:18,152
Were you in on this
from the beginning?

1577
01:11:18,154 --> 01:11:19,153
This is unbelievable!
Easy.

1578
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:20,220
No, no, no! I just wanna know.
What were you...

1579
01:11:20,222 --> 01:11:23,556
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

1580
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:25,125
"Boinking"?
No, no, no.

1581
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:27,194
I think everybody just needs
to cool their jets.

1582
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:29,797
You had sex with my grandpa,
you dirty anchor baby!

1583
01:11:29,799 --> 01:11:30,965
Now hold your horses.

1584
01:11:30,967 --> 01:11:32,733
And in the meantime, I'd maybe run.

1585
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:34,168
Wait, wait, wait, Marta?

1586
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,703
Now, would you please...

1587
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:37,037
Ladies and Gentlemen, please.
Marta, talk to us.

1588
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,872
Marta?

1589
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:39,974
Wait a minute.

1590
01:11:39,976 --> 01:11:41,742
I totally understand how you
must be feeling right now.

1591
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,110
You cannot leave!
You can talk to me.

1592
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:45,746
I don't know what to say.
I don't know.

1593
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:47,681
Calm down. Calm down.
Marta, please...

1594
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,316
Marta, listen, Darling...

1595
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:52,853
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

1596
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,956
Guys, I'm also confused.
I need to think!

1597
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,259
Marta! Are you listening?

1598
01:11:58,027 --> 01:11:59,592
I can't catch up!

1599
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,262
I understand. I understand.
Richard! Open the door!

1600
01:12:02,264 --> 01:12:04,198
Open up that door!

1601
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,833
You are scaring her!
I can't open the damn door!

1602
01:12:05,835 --> 01:12:07,768
Marta, go. Marta, go.

1603
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,770
Marta, you have to understand.

1604
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:11,571
He is our father!

1605
01:12:11,573 --> 01:12:12,973
Marta, listen to me.

1606
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:14,875
Marta, don't listen to them.
I'm here.

1607
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:16,677
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1608
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,813
So DM me on Instagram, okay?

1609
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:21,083
I wanna talk to you.

1610
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:27,653
Ransom!

1611
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:29,089
What the hell's going on?

1612
01:12:29,091 --> 01:12:30,324
I think this could be the best thing

1613
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:31,861
to happen to all of you!

1614
01:12:33,963 --> 01:12:35,563
What does he mean by that?

1615
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:38,799
Richard, why didn't you stop her?

1616
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:40,034
What am I supposed to do?

1617
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:41,669
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1618
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:54,250
Okay, seriously, though,
what the hell?

1619
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:01,121
Hey.
I'll take an extra bowl.

1620
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:02,389
Sure.

1621
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:10,663
You look like you're gonna
pass out.

1622
01:13:10,665 --> 01:13:11,832
Have you eaten anything today?

1623
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:12,835
Eat.

1624
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:18,338
This is a nightmare.

1625
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,975
Mmm-hmm.

1626
01:13:21,043 --> 01:13:22,111
So why?

1627
01:13:23,813 --> 01:13:25,848
Why?
Why?

1628
01:13:26,982 --> 01:13:31,085
Hey. This is everything.

1629
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:33,120
There's gotta be a bigger
reason why, and you know it.

1630
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:34,188
Well, how about it had to do more

1631
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,691
with you guys than with me?

1632
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,827
Yeah.

1633
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,831
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1634
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:48,702
Did he tell you anything?

1635
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:50,304
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

1636
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:51,371
That's because he wanted you

1637
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,107
to build something from the
ground up like your mom.

1638
01:13:53,109 --> 01:13:54,208
"To build something from the
ground up."

1639
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,110
Yeah, my mother built her
business from the ground up

1640
01:13:56,112 --> 01:13:58,779
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1641
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,715
My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.

1642
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:03,050
He lives in fear.

1643
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:05,185
And I know that's what
my grandfather was trying

1644
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:06,720
to protect me from by doing this

1645
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:08,255
and I know I shouldn't say
this out loud,

1646
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:09,758
but when he told me, I...

1647
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:12,895
Jesus.

1648
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:14,730
I coulda killed him.

1649
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:20,200
After I left the party though,
I was driving.

1650
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:23,072
Nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this, um...

1651
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:26,742
Clarity.

1652
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:28,876
Like, from here on out,

1653
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:30,679
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

1654
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:32,214
And that felt...

1655
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:35,217
Good.

1656
01:14:36,886 --> 01:14:38,087
The old bastard.

1657
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:44,258
Marta, I know three things.

1658
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,325
One...

1659
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,029
I know he didn't commit suicide.

1660
01:14:49,398 --> 01:14:51,734
What makes you think that?
I don't think it.

1661
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,467
I know it.

1662
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:55,002
Because I knew my granddad.

1663
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:57,237
Maybe you and I were the only
two who knew him,

1664
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,708
so you're not gonna bullshit
me on this because, two...

1665
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:03,043
I know lying makes you puke.

1666
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:06,313
'Cause of that mafia game
last Fourth of July.

1667
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:08,184
And three...

1668
01:15:09,818 --> 01:15:10,684
I know you just ate

1669
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:12,922
a full plate of baked beans
and sausage.

1670
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:16,959
So...

1671
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:20,396
Look me in the eye

1672
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,933
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather.

1673
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:29,071
You asshole.
Marta,

1674
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:32,007
tell me everything.

1675
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:37,544
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

1676
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:38,845
No.

1677
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:40,347
I don't know how many times

1678
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:43,417
I can repeat the same two
pieces of information.

1679
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:46,787
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1680
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,388
and we all confirmed that he was...

1681
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,990
Would a sound mind do this?

1682
01:15:49,992 --> 01:15:51,225
How... Sound, how?

1683
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:53,527
The very action speaks to unsoundness.

1684
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:54,997
Not legally. No.

1685
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:57,297
You not liking what he did

1686
01:15:57,299 --> 01:15:59,833
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

1687
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:02,236
What about undue influence?

1688
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:04,972
Yeah! Undue influence,
how about that? Huh?

1689
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:06,206
Did you just Google that?

1690
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,508
Look, if Marta was
manipulating Dad somehow

1691
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:10,244
and if we found out...
If somehow, she had gotten...

1692
01:16:10,246 --> 01:16:11,445
That somehow she was...
Her hooks into him...

1693
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:14,314
You need a strong case for that.

1694
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:17,117
"Your Honor,
she endeared herself to him

1695
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,353
"Through hard work and good humor."

1696
01:16:19,355 --> 01:16:21,221
That won't cut the salami.

1697
01:16:21,223 --> 01:16:22,925
What about the slayer rule?

1698
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:25,826
I did just google that.

1699
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:28,195
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1700
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:30,130
Well, what the hell
is the slayer rule?

1701
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:31,465
Well, it's if someone is convicted

1702
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:32,866
of killing the person,

1703
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:34,268
they don't get their inheritance.

1704
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,335
Not even convicted.

1705
01:16:35,337 --> 01:16:36,503
Even if they're held responsible

1706
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:37,906
for their death in Civil Court.

1707
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:39,475
Like O.J.?

1708
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:42,609
Yes, like O.J.

1709
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:45,814
But Harlan committed suicide.

1710
01:16:54,556 --> 01:16:56,390
Detective Blanc?

1711
01:16:56,392 --> 01:16:58,392
You said the investigation is ongoing.

1712
01:16:58,394 --> 01:16:59,926
You made a point of that.

1713
01:16:59,928 --> 01:17:01,228
Do you suspect foul play?

1714
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,233
Mr. Blanc, if you please...

1715
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:08,235
There is much that remains unclear,

1716
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:10,003
but yes,

1717
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,106
I suspect foul play.

1718
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,409
Marta?

1719
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:18,314
I have eliminated no suspects.

1720
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:21,448
You're full of shit.

1721
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,517
I don't trust this guy
in the tweed suit.

1722
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,854
And, Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

1723
01:17:26,455 --> 01:17:27,521
Thank you.

1724
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:29,222
There's only one answer to this.

1725
01:17:29,224 --> 01:17:30,657
She has to renounce the inheritance.

1726
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,292
She knows it's what she
should do.

1727
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:33,360
That's exactly what she...
It's the right thing to do.

1728
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,594
Right?
No way...

1729
01:17:34,596 --> 01:17:36,229
It's the moral thing.

1730
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:37,931
Mom.
She'll do it.

1731
01:17:37,933 --> 01:17:39,499
If Granddad wanted to give
Marta everything,

1732
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:40,634
then that's what he wanted.

1733
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:42,035
No.

1734
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:44,271
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1735
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,639
He wanted us taken care of.

1736
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:47,876
He wanted you to have an education.

1737
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:49,677
Meg,

1738
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,179
you think I can pay for your school?

1739
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:03,691
I know.

1740
01:18:03,693 --> 01:18:05,125
Just saying it, it sounds insane,

1741
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:06,360
but it's all true.

1742
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:09,162
And I think Blanc's been
on to me from the start.

1743
01:18:09,164 --> 01:18:11,367
I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom,

1744
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:13,235
my sister?

1745
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:14,570
We...

1746
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:18,407
You gonna say something?

1747
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:21,676
I always thought I was the
only one

1748
01:18:21,678 --> 01:18:23,078
that could beat him at Go.

1749
01:18:24,213 --> 01:18:26,546
Always thought that meant something.

1750
01:18:26,548 --> 01:18:28,548
Um, yeah, I know you did.

1751
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,250
That night at the party,

1752
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:32,285
my last conversation with him...

1753
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,353
My last argument,

1754
01:18:33,355 --> 01:18:36,123
that's what he told me about you.

1755
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:39,094
That you beat him at Go more
than I do, and I thought...

1756
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:43,098
What a strange thing to tell me.

1757
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,535
Think I get it now.

1758
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:50,906
Maybe it did mean something.

1759
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,412
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

1760
01:18:58,414 --> 01:18:59,747
You're not gonna go to jail.

1761
01:18:59,749 --> 01:19:02,582
That detective is not
gonna catch you.

1762
01:19:02,584 --> 01:19:04,086
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

1763
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:06,553
This is what Granddad wanted
for you.

1764
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:08,388
I mean, think about what he
did to go through with this.

1765
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:11,726
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1766
01:19:11,728 --> 01:19:13,527
And he wanted it for you.

1767
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:14,997
You've come this far.

1768
01:19:15,765 --> 01:19:18,064
Let me help you go all the way.

1769
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:19,666
What's going on?
This isn't you.

1770
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:21,535
You could just turn me in
right now

1771
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:23,470
and still get your cut
of the inheritance.

1772
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:25,172
Why?

1773
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:26,642
Because fuck my family.

1774
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:30,343
I can help you get away with this.

1775
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:32,312
And then,

1776
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:34,383
you're gonna give me my cut
of the inheritance.

1777
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:39,252
Happy ending. Everybody wins.
You, me...

1778
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:40,353
Harlan.

1779
01:19:40,355 --> 01:19:41,356
Yeah.

1780
01:19:42,692 --> 01:19:43,992
Deal?

1781
01:19:56,138 --> 01:19:57,237
Meg.

1782
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:58,240
Marta...

1783
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:00,607
That was nuts.

1784
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:01,742
I know.

1785
01:20:01,744 --> 01:20:03,111
Are you okay?

1786
01:20:04,546 --> 01:20:06,681
Yeah. Are you?

1787
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:08,250
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I...

1788
01:20:09,686 --> 01:20:12,118
Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...

1789
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,222
I wanted to...

1790
01:20:15,792 --> 01:20:18,695
I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.

1791
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:22,128
And, uh...

1792
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:25,367
I guess, I wanted to ask,
what are you gonna do?

1793
01:20:28,403 --> 01:20:29,737
What do you mean?

1794
01:20:29,739 --> 01:20:30,705
Well, the...

1795
01:20:30,707 --> 01:20:33,242
You know, with the will,
what are you gonna do?

1796
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,713
What do you think I should do?

1797
01:20:38,715 --> 01:20:43,285
You should do whatever you
think is right.

1798
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:44,787
Mmm-hmm.

1799
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,222
Look, I...

1800
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:51,193
I think you should
give it back to us.

1801
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:55,662
Granddad always took care of us.

1802
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:57,397
You know, we're his family.

1803
01:20:57,399 --> 01:20:59,266
And I know he was like family
to you,

1804
01:20:59,268 --> 01:21:00,803
but we're his actual family.

1805
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:02,335
Yeah.

1806
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:04,237
And... Look, Marta,

1807
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,741
you know this isn't fair.

1808
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:08,341
We've always been good to you

1809
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:11,411
and you're like family,
and we'll take care of you,

1810
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:13,382
but you have to make things right.

1811
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:15,250
You know what's right.

1812
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:17,419
Marta...

1813
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,856
Mom's broke.

1814
01:21:21,858 --> 01:21:24,424
And she says I'm gonna
have to drop out of school.

1815
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,094
No. No, no, Meg.

1816
01:21:27,496 --> 01:21:29,496
Listen, I won't let that happen.

1817
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:31,832
What ever money you need,
I'll give it to you.

1818
01:21:31,834 --> 01:21:33,066
I'm here for you.

1819
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:34,835
And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you,

1820
01:21:34,837 --> 01:21:35,838
I promise that.

1821
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:37,404
Okay?

1822
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:38,839
Thanks.

1823
01:21:38,841 --> 01:21:40,677
And once I...

1824
01:21:59,528 --> 01:22:01,595
Okay then.

1825
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:04,433
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

1826
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:08,903
Yes, he found mud upstairs.

1827
01:22:08,905 --> 01:22:10,771
Where I broke in through the window.

1828
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:11,839
Shit.

1829
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:13,108
Identifiable prints?

1830
01:22:13,609 --> 01:22:14,675
No.

1831
01:22:14,677 --> 01:22:16,178
Good. Okay.

1832
01:22:16,913 --> 01:22:18,746
Good. Hey...

1833
01:22:18,748 --> 01:22:20,380
You lay low for a couple days,

1834
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:21,916
wait for this investigation
to blow over,

1835
01:22:21,918 --> 01:22:23,017
and it will.

1836
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:25,385
'Cause no matter how good
this Blanc guy thinks he is,

1837
01:22:25,387 --> 01:22:26,555
he's got nothin'.

1838
01:22:27,222 --> 01:22:29,857
Hey, relax.

1839
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:32,659
Marta, get your ass up!

1840
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:33,560
What the hell is happening?

1841
01:22:33,562 --> 01:22:35,295
There's a guy here,
and a bunch of stuff.

1842
01:22:35,297 --> 01:22:36,799
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

1843
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,533
Maybe, Alice.
I don't know.

1844
01:22:40,535 --> 01:22:41,635
I don't even know what that means,

1845
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:42,703
but you better get your ass
up, okay?

1846
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:46,539
We don't know much about Marta Cabrera,

1847
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,308
or her exact relationship...
Oh, my God...

1848
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,744
With Harlan Thrombey...
Marta, what is all this?

1849
01:22:49,746 --> 01:22:52,278
Beyond being his home nurse.
What did you do?

1850
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,380
Is that here?

1851
01:22:53,382 --> 01:22:54,648
Oh, yeah, it is.

1852
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,350
Wait, so is that true?

1853
01:22:57,352 --> 01:22:58,353
Are we rich?

1854
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:01,321
This is a story so compelling...

1855
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:02,389
Oh, my God.

1856
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:04,359
You would think he had
written the story himself.

1857
01:23:17,006 --> 01:23:18,941
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1858
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,249
Why is grief the providence
of youth?

1859
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:29,852
I don't know.

1860
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:36,693
But I'd imagine that age
deepens all feelings.

1861
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,729
Including grief.

1862
01:23:42,597 --> 01:23:47,235
This was a long walk
to offering condolences

1863
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,604
for the loss of your son.

1864
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:53,573
And asking you,
if it isn't presumptuous of me,

1865
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:57,845
not to think too harshly
of your family,

1866
01:23:57,847 --> 01:24:02,551
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1867
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,621
They're young, aren't they?

1868
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:14,997
One thing I assume of age

1869
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,798
is weariness.

1870
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,068
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1871
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,503
Tired of what I do.

1872
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:26,539
Following arcs like lobbed rocks,

1873
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,711
the inevitability of truth.

1874
01:24:31,748 --> 01:24:33,783
But the complexity and the gray

1875
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,651
lie not in the truth

1876
01:24:38,054 --> 01:24:41,389
but what you do with the truth
once you have it.

1877
01:24:48,831 --> 01:24:51,801
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1878
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:56,503
I think you're very perceptive

1879
01:24:56,505 --> 01:24:59,740
and very capable of telling
me what you saw

1880
01:24:59,742 --> 01:25:01,778
the night of your son's party.

1881
01:25:10,019 --> 01:25:11,821
But I'll happily wait.

1882
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:13,990
I'm in no rush.

1883
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:16,623
In fact,

1884
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,726
I find it quiet pleasant

1885
01:25:18,728 --> 01:25:20,395
sitting here with you.

1886
01:25:28,637 --> 01:25:29,804
Lawyers were here.

1887
01:25:29,806 --> 01:25:31,404
Very big lawyers, it looked like.

1888
01:25:31,406 --> 01:25:33,540
They left all this stuff
and business cards.

1889
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:34,909
And there was a pile of other stuff

1890
01:25:34,911 --> 01:25:36,811
when I got home.

1891
01:25:36,813 --> 01:25:38,611
I don't like any of this, Marta.

1892
01:25:39,481 --> 01:25:41,015
I don't like it either.

1893
01:25:41,017 --> 01:25:43,017
I'm slipping out the back.

1894
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:45,587
I'll be back later.
Please don't talk to anyone.

1895
01:25:52,161 --> 01:25:53,361
Walt?

1896
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,730
Yeah, I came, uh...

1897
01:25:56,732 --> 01:25:58,032
Hey, how you doin'?

1898
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:01,969
Walt, I want you to know

1899
01:26:01,971 --> 01:26:03,536
that I didn't know
about any of this.

1900
01:26:03,538 --> 01:26:04,872
We know you didn't.
This is...

1901
01:26:04,874 --> 01:26:06,674
We know you didn't.

1902
01:26:06,676 --> 01:26:09,677
Yeah, we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday.

1903
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,379
Understandable.
Yeah.

1904
01:26:12,849 --> 01:26:14,815
I haven't even looked at all
this, yet.

1905
01:26:14,817 --> 01:26:17,584
It must just be local lawyers
and accountants

1906
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:19,987
who saw the news and wanna
get a jump on it.

1907
01:26:19,989 --> 01:26:22,357
Yeah.
I'd be careful of all of it.

1908
01:26:24,526 --> 01:26:28,698
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1909
01:26:31,968 --> 01:26:34,402
This is what Harlan wanted.

1910
01:26:36,172 --> 01:26:38,072
Yeah, but...

1911
01:26:38,074 --> 01:26:40,810
Harlan put you in a very hard
position here. I mean,

1912
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:42,712
it was unfair of him.

1913
01:26:43,746 --> 01:26:45,445
I mean, you see

1914
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:48,581
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up

1915
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:51,153
and we know, with your mother...

1916
01:26:52,654 --> 01:26:53,754
My mother?

1917
01:26:53,756 --> 01:26:54,757
Yeah.

1918
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:02,730
What did Meg tell you?

1919
01:27:02,732 --> 01:27:04,399
Oh, this isn't about...

1920
01:27:06,135 --> 01:27:07,567
You're missing the point.

1921
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:09,636
We don't wanna attack you
with this,

1922
01:27:09,638 --> 01:27:10,971
but, Marta, if your mother

1923
01:27:10,973 --> 01:27:13,606
came into the country illegally,

1924
01:27:13,608 --> 01:27:14,808
criminally.

1925
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,744
And you've come into this inheritance,

1926
01:27:16,746 --> 01:27:18,578
with all the scrutiny that entails,

1927
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,981
I'd be afraid that could come
to light.

1928
01:27:20,983 --> 01:27:23,050
And that's what we wanna
avoid here.

1929
01:27:23,052 --> 01:27:24,153
We can protect you

1930
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:26,486
from that happening,

1931
01:27:26,488 --> 01:27:28,488
or if it happens.

1932
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:32,927
So you're saying that
even if it came to light,

1933
01:27:32,929 --> 01:27:35,696
with your family's resources,
you could help me fix it?

1934
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:36,997
Yeah.

1935
01:27:36,999 --> 01:27:39,133
Yeah, with the right lawyers,
you know?

1936
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:40,600
Not these local guys,

1937
01:27:40,602 --> 01:27:43,170
but New York lawyers, DC lawyers,

1938
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,638
with enough resources
put toward it, yes.

1939
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,643
Not that that ever even
needs to come up,

1940
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:50,545
but, yes.

1941
01:27:51,981 --> 01:27:53,182
Okay, good.

1942
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:56,085
Okay?

1943
01:27:57,053 --> 01:28:01,121
Because Harlan gave me
all your resources.

1944
01:28:01,123 --> 01:28:02,790
So that means with my resources,

1945
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:04,524
I'll be able to fix it.

1946
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:06,592
So I guess I will find the
right lawyers.

1947
01:28:06,594 --> 01:28:07,830
Uh, Marta, that's...

1948
01:28:10,299 --> 01:28:12,101
You better be sure that's

1949
01:28:13,535 --> 01:28:14,737
what you want.

1950
01:28:52,842 --> 01:28:54,708
I don't know...
What's this?

1951
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,210
It's my medical bag tag.

1952
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:58,979
They have my medical bag
for some reason.

1953
01:28:58,981 --> 01:29:01,248
Okay, but this is a photocopy
of just the header

1954
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:04,184
of a Blood Toxicology Report
on Harlan.

1955
01:29:04,186 --> 01:29:06,920
Marta, this is gonna show
the Morphine overdose.

1956
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:10,893
So I'm screwed?

1957
01:29:12,995 --> 01:29:14,762
How do you know all this stuff?

1958
01:29:14,764 --> 01:29:16,932
I was Harlan's research
assistant for a summer.

1959
01:29:18,067 --> 01:29:20,100
But what kind of blackmail
scheme is this?

1960
01:29:20,102 --> 01:29:21,601
I mean, the actual evidence

1961
01:29:21,603 --> 01:29:23,669
is sitting up the street,
at the crime lab.

1962
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:25,875
There's no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1963
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:29,912
What's the point
in sending you this?

1964
01:29:40,222 --> 01:29:41,355
It could be a half hour.

1965
01:29:41,357 --> 01:29:42,956
It could be an hour.
It depends.

1966
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:44,126
We wanna make sure...

1967
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:52,933
So, it could take a while.

1968
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:54,234
What's the cheese?
But I'll let you know.

1969
01:29:54,236 --> 01:29:55,803
Oh, hey.
Yeah.

1970
01:29:55,805 --> 01:29:57,237
Thank you, Chief.
No problem.

1971
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,172
5:00 a.m.

1972
01:29:58,174 --> 01:30:00,407
Security systems here are all triggered.

1973
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:02,309
Now, this thing went up really quick,

1974
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:04,211
so that means blood stores, records,

1975
01:30:04,213 --> 01:30:06,413
anything of that nature,
it's all gone.

1976
01:30:06,415 --> 01:30:08,082
There were no employees here,

1977
01:30:08,084 --> 01:30:10,284
so, thank God for that.
Mmm-hmm.

1978
01:30:10,286 --> 01:30:12,154
What about security cameras?

1979
01:30:12,755 --> 01:30:13,756
Oh, yeah.

1980
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:17,891
Speaking of security,

1981
01:30:17,893 --> 01:30:19,359
the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1982
01:30:19,361 --> 01:30:21,663
was all scrambled for some reason.

1983
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:23,864
Yeah.

1984
01:30:23,866 --> 01:30:26,666
What's still pending from the autopsy?

1985
01:30:26,668 --> 01:30:28,137
Just a report on the blood work.

1986
01:30:29,872 --> 01:30:30,973
Blood work?

1987
01:30:35,978 --> 01:30:37,346
Holy shit.

1988
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,218
This is insane.

1989
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:46,353
I mean, who would blow up
a whole real building

1990
01:30:46,355 --> 01:30:47,754
just to blackmail me?

1991
01:30:47,756 --> 01:30:48,956
Marta, this means the blackmailer

1992
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:50,190
has the only paper copy

1993
01:30:50,192 --> 01:30:51,959
of the thing that can prove
your guilt.

1994
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:53,393
You didn't get any other instructions?

1995
01:30:53,395 --> 01:30:55,129
No phone call?
No email? Nothing?

1996
01:30:55,131 --> 01:30:57,097
No.

1997
01:30:57,099 --> 01:30:59,068
Well, I haven't checked my email.

1998
01:31:04,306 --> 01:31:06,006
There is one.

1999
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:09,378
Yeah, that's it.
"1209, Columbus Road. 10 a.m."

2000
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:16,884
You know what this means, right?

2001
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:18,418
If you destroy that copy,

2002
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:19,989
you're totally in the clear.

2003
01:31:20,756 --> 01:31:21,924
Oh, no.

2004
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:24,960
Marta, did you hear me?

2005
01:31:27,329 --> 01:31:28,330
Yeah.

2006
01:31:36,438 --> 01:31:37,838
Elliott!

2007
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,008
We gotta go!
We gotta go!

2008
01:31:41,944 --> 01:31:44,144
Okay, Baby Driver.
Oh, God.

2009
01:31:44,146 --> 01:31:45,479
You regret helping me yet?

2010
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:47,147
I regret not taking the Beemer.

2011
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:50,918
Oh, shit.

2012
01:32:04,433 --> 01:32:05,499
Vehicles in pursuit

2013
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:06,466
on Washington Street.
No force.

2014
01:32:06,468 --> 01:32:08,068
Make sure you say "No Force."
No force.

2015
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,136
We got a possible murder suspect.

2016
01:32:09,138 --> 01:32:10,306
I said that. I said that.

2017
01:32:12,308 --> 01:32:14,341
Go. Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

2018
01:32:14,343 --> 01:32:16,045
I am literally flooring it!

2019
01:32:27,122 --> 01:32:28,956
This is going well.
I'm pulling over. I'm...

2020
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:30,023
If you miss your chance

2021
01:32:30,025 --> 01:32:31,427
to get this Tox Report,
it's all over.

2022
01:32:32,127 --> 01:32:33,329
Oh, my God.

2023
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:38,198
Whoa!
Whoa!

2024
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,566
Why... Why are we stopping?

2025
01:32:39,568 --> 01:32:41,937
Why are you stopping in the
middle of the road?

2026
01:32:54,984 --> 01:32:55,985
Hold on.

2027
01:33:19,975 --> 01:33:22,476
Oh, my God, I'm just pure
adrenaline right now.

2028
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:24,378
I feel like I swallowed bees.

2029
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,245
Okay...

2030
01:33:25,247 --> 01:33:27,047
So where is it?
What's the address?

2031
01:33:27,049 --> 01:33:28,482
1209, Columbus Road.

2032
01:33:28,484 --> 01:33:30,384
Okay. I mean, whatever they want,

2033
01:33:30,386 --> 01:33:31,852
I'll say yes...
Anything.

2034
01:33:31,854 --> 01:33:33,220
You know,
just to get that report back.

2035
01:33:33,222 --> 01:33:35,389
Get it back and destroy it.
Destroy it.

2036
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:36,959
Holy shit, Ransom.

2037
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:39,228
Hey, thank you.

2038
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:41,830
I couldn't do this without you.

2039
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:46,935
Oh, my God.

2040
01:33:48,404 --> 01:33:49,405
Get out.

2041
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:54,308
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

2042
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:55,642
Put your hands down.

2043
01:33:55,644 --> 01:33:58,312
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey, Greatnana.

2044
01:33:58,314 --> 01:34:00,147
Night of the party, she saw someone

2045
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:02,883
climbing the trellis
to the third floor.

2046
01:34:02,885 --> 01:34:05,319
Mr. Drysdale, come on.
Let's go.

2047
01:34:05,321 --> 01:34:07,254
Pat him down, check him out.

2048
01:34:07,256 --> 01:34:09,056
What's going on?

2049
01:34:09,058 --> 01:34:10,957
"Ransom came back," she said.

2050
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:12,192
Hands on the vehicle.

2051
01:34:12,194 --> 01:34:13,427
I don't know what he came
back to do,

2052
01:34:13,429 --> 01:34:14,594
but we'll find out.

2053
01:34:14,596 --> 01:34:16,930
You got anything sharp?

2054
01:34:16,932 --> 01:34:18,899
Watch your head. Thank you.

2055
01:34:18,901 --> 01:34:19,866
Hey, you don't need to thank him.

2056
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:23,072
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

2057
01:34:24,606 --> 01:34:25,908
Yes.

2058
01:34:33,349 --> 01:34:34,981
Blanc, coming with us?

2059
01:34:34,983 --> 01:34:37,250
I'll drive with Marta.

2060
01:34:37,252 --> 01:34:38,952
Let's go to the police station.

2061
01:34:38,954 --> 01:34:42,356
I want a full run down on
everything he said to you.

2062
01:34:42,358 --> 01:34:44,093
I'll catch you up on where
we're at.

2063
01:34:51,133 --> 01:34:53,902
Strange case from the start.

2064
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:58,107
A case with a hole in the middle.

2065
01:35:00,109 --> 01:35:01,310
A donut.

2066
01:35:02,344 --> 01:35:04,978
I'm just talking through my
process here,

2067
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,314
let me know if this is boring.

2068
01:35:07,316 --> 01:35:09,449
I feel the noose tightening.

2069
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:12,054
The family is truly desperate.

2070
01:35:12,588 --> 01:35:14,189
Desperate motives,

2071
01:35:15,057 --> 01:35:17,190
the mystery of who hired me,

2072
01:35:17,192 --> 01:35:18,994
the impossibility of the crime,

2073
01:35:20,062 --> 01:35:21,430
and yet...

2074
01:35:22,364 --> 01:35:24,264
A donut.

2075
01:35:24,266 --> 01:35:26,967
One central piece

2076
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:30,070
and if it reveals itself,
the fog would lift,

2077
01:35:30,072 --> 01:35:34,274
the arc would resolve,
the Slinky become unkinked.

2078
01:35:34,276 --> 01:35:36,276
Do you mind if I stop for a second?

2079
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:37,745
I need to pick something up.

2080
01:35:37,747 --> 01:35:39,181
It'll be very quick.

2081
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:41,650
Sure.

2082
01:35:55,264 --> 01:35:56,596
It'll be just a few minutes.

2083
01:35:56,598 --> 01:35:58,000
Watch the, uh,

2084
01:35:58,634 --> 01:35:59,635
door.

2085
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:23,225
Hello?

2086
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:49,084
Listen, I don't know what you want...

2087
01:36:51,653 --> 01:36:53,653
Whatever it is,
we can work it out.

2088
01:36:53,655 --> 01:36:56,389
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

2089
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,260
And I'm leaving with that report.

2090
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:04,032
Hello?

2091
01:37:29,224 --> 01:37:30,225
Fran?

2092
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:42,669
No, no, no, no! Fran?

2093
01:37:42,671 --> 01:37:44,872
Oh, my God, Fran.

2094
01:37:44,874 --> 01:37:46,640
Can you hear me?

2095
01:37:46,642 --> 01:37:48,843
Fran, give me a sign
if you can hear me.

2096
01:37:48,845 --> 01:37:51,278
You...
Yes, it's me. It's Marta.

2097
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,280
You called me here,
you sent me an email,

2098
01:37:53,282 --> 01:37:55,415
that's why I'm here.
Did you take something?

2099
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:57,718
I'm gonna call an ambulance now,
you're gonna be okay.

2100
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,886
You're gonna be fine, okay?

2101
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:00,320
Stay with me.
Copy...

2102
01:38:00,322 --> 01:38:01,724
What?
Copy...

2103
01:38:02,825 --> 01:38:04,157
Stashed...

2104
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,427
What? What are you saying?

2105
01:38:06,662 --> 01:38:08,863
You did this.

2106
01:38:08,865 --> 01:38:11,197
Won't get away with this.

2107
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,367
Jesus, stop it!

2108
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:36,592
911, what's your emergency?

2109
01:38:37,827 --> 01:38:42,662
♪ The thought of you stays bright

2110
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:48,805
♪ Sometimes I stand in the
middle of the floor

2111
01:38:50,439 --> 01:38:54,309
♪ Not going left

2112
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:56,610
♪ Not going...

2113
01:38:56,612 --> 01:38:58,445
Oh, Lord.

2114
01:38:59,949 --> 01:39:02,618
All right, my friend,
thank you for the update.

2115
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:04,819
No need for that.

2116
01:39:04,821 --> 01:39:06,653
I'll bring her in once we get word

2117
01:39:06,655 --> 01:39:08,388
that the housekeeper is stable.

2118
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:09,625
It's still touch and go.

2119
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:11,293
All right.

2120
01:39:12,695 --> 01:39:13,828
Listen, this is over.

2121
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,464
People are getting hurt.

2122
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:19,399
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

2123
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:23,205
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

2124
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:24,504
Good.

2125
01:39:24,506 --> 01:39:26,774
Wait, I hope he didn't cover
for me.

2126
01:39:26,776 --> 01:39:28,441
Did he tell you the real truth

2127
01:39:28,443 --> 01:39:30,477
about me switching the...
Yeah.

2128
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:31,846
And the disguise bit?
Yes.

2129
01:39:31,848 --> 01:39:33,480
And the whole blackmail and...

2130
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:34,782
Mmm-hmm.

2131
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,250
But why did Fran take my Morphine?

2132
01:39:37,252 --> 01:39:39,552
I mean, obviously she had
swiped the bag from the house,

2133
01:39:39,554 --> 01:39:41,588
but she didn't seem like
a user to me,

2134
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:43,891
unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.

2135
01:39:43,893 --> 01:39:45,826
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

2136
01:39:45,828 --> 01:39:47,728
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,

2137
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:48,796
I feel like I owe that to them.

2138
01:39:48,798 --> 01:39:50,530
I don't think that's a good idea.

2139
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:52,634
No, I have to do it.
I need to do it.

2140
01:39:54,603 --> 01:39:56,003
I gave the doctors my number,

2141
01:39:56,005 --> 01:39:57,805
so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.

2142
01:39:57,807 --> 01:39:58,773
All right.

2143
01:39:58,775 --> 01:40:00,708
I'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house,

2144
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:02,810
along with a police escort.

2145
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:05,012
For the arrest after.

2146
01:40:05,014 --> 01:40:07,549
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

2147
01:40:08,785 --> 01:40:10,720
I don't want any more surprises.

2148
01:40:26,535 --> 01:40:28,035
Fran said it was stashed,

2149
01:40:28,037 --> 01:40:29,504
the copy, and then she said,

2150
01:40:30,672 --> 01:40:32,907
"You did this.
You won't get away with it,"

2151
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:35,610
and I called the ambulance.

2152
01:40:36,378 --> 01:40:37,479
That's it.

2153
01:40:38,681 --> 01:40:39,682
All right.

2154
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:44,286
You ready?

2155
01:40:48,925 --> 01:40:50,323
Oh!

2156
01:40:50,325 --> 01:40:51,759
Okay.

2157
01:40:51,761 --> 01:40:53,794
Well, has she come to her senses?

2158
01:40:53,796 --> 01:40:55,428
Well, she's standing right
there, Richard,

2159
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:56,496
she can speak for herself.

2160
01:40:56,498 --> 01:40:57,564
Is the rest of the family here?

2161
01:40:57,566 --> 01:40:58,631
In the living room.

2162
01:40:58,633 --> 01:40:59,666
I think that it would be better

2163
01:40:59,668 --> 01:41:01,971
if we were to gather again
and get this over with.

2164
01:41:07,642 --> 01:41:09,011
Hey.
Hey.

2165
01:41:11,413 --> 01:41:13,379
I'm so sorry I told
them about your mom.

2166
01:41:13,381 --> 01:41:15,816
Meg, it's okay.

2167
01:41:15,818 --> 01:41:17,450
I'm sorry. No...
I was scared. I just...

2168
01:41:17,452 --> 01:41:18,551
I didn't wanna tell them.

2169
01:41:18,553 --> 01:41:19,621
I get it.

2170
01:41:20,056 --> 01:41:21,289
Trust me,

2171
01:41:22,058 --> 01:41:24,326
I understand.
It's all right.

2172
01:41:24,894 --> 01:41:26,428
I'm sorry.

2173
01:41:29,631 --> 01:41:32,465
God, I am so raiding
Fran's stash after this.

2174
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:35,602
I still think this is a bad idea,

2175
01:41:35,604 --> 01:41:37,740
but the family is assembled.

2176
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:42,879
I know where the Tox Report is.

2177
01:41:50,552 --> 01:41:52,287
She basically told me where
it was.

2178
01:41:54,724 --> 01:41:56,625
Anyways, this will tie
everything up.

2179
01:41:58,861 --> 01:42:00,495
And I just handed it to you.

2180
01:42:01,964 --> 01:42:04,499
God, you're not much of a detective,
are you?

2181
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:06,668
Well, to be fair,

2182
01:42:08,537 --> 01:42:10,873
you make a pretty lousy murderer.

2183
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:14,643
Perhaps we deserve each other.

2184
01:42:26,823 --> 01:42:28,523
You've always been good to me.

2185
01:42:30,492 --> 01:42:32,659
And what I'm about to say
isn't gonna be easy

2186
01:42:32,661 --> 01:42:34,728
and you're gonna be upset.

2187
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,864
But I thought after what
you've gone through

2188
01:42:36,866 --> 01:42:37,934
the last few days,

2189
01:42:39,101 --> 01:42:41,634
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

2190
01:42:41,636 --> 01:42:42,772
Hmm.

2191
01:42:44,606 --> 01:42:45,875
I...
Excuse me!

2192
01:42:50,179 --> 01:42:53,446
You have not been good to her.

2193
01:42:53,448 --> 01:42:55,615
You have all treated her like shit,

2194
01:42:55,617 --> 01:42:58,052
to steal back a fortune that
you lost,

2195
01:42:58,054 --> 01:42:59,787
and she deserves.

2196
01:42:59,789 --> 01:43:02,790
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast!

2197
01:43:02,792 --> 01:43:04,758
Knives out, beaks bloody!

2198
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,727
Well...

2199
01:43:06,729 --> 01:43:10,097
You're not getting bailed out,
not this time.

2200
01:43:10,099 --> 01:43:13,000
Ms. Cabrera has decided, definitively,

2201
01:43:13,002 --> 01:43:14,902
not to renounce the inheritance.

2202
01:43:14,904 --> 01:43:16,737
What?
What?

2203
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:19,740
Furthermore, it will be my
professional recommendation

2204
01:43:19,742 --> 01:43:22,176
to the local authorities
that the manner of death

2205
01:43:22,178 --> 01:43:26,180
in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide!

2206
01:43:26,182 --> 01:43:27,848
And the case is closed.
Blanc?

2207
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:28,916
What?

2208
01:43:28,918 --> 01:43:30,718
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

2209
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,121
What's going on?
Just tell me...

2210
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:36,757
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

2211
01:43:36,759 --> 01:43:37,992
No.

2212
01:43:37,994 --> 01:43:38,959
Is anybody else confused?

2213
01:43:38,961 --> 01:43:41,429
Not what I was expecting
to hear at all.

2214
01:43:43,966 --> 01:43:45,565
Are you gonna tell me what the
hell is going on?

2215
01:43:45,567 --> 01:43:46,800
Yes. Yes.

2216
01:43:46,802 --> 01:43:48,668
I just wanna come clean, okay?

2217
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:49,970
It's over.
Almost.

2218
01:43:49,972 --> 01:43:51,471
Blanc, what are we doing?

2219
01:43:51,473 --> 01:43:53,841
What's going on?
I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

2220
01:43:53,843 --> 01:43:55,575
Keep the family out of this room,

2221
01:43:55,577 --> 01:43:56,977
and get 'em out of the house
if you can.

2222
01:43:56,979 --> 01:43:59,113
But stand by with your
additional officer.

2223
01:43:59,115 --> 01:44:00,147
Get the family out?

2224
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:02,082
Yes, but not all of them.
Would you...

2225
01:44:02,084 --> 01:44:03,183
Thank you.

2226
01:44:03,185 --> 01:44:04,118
Blanc...
Yes, Sir.

2227
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,986
Come on, come on,
what's all this drama?

2228
01:44:05,988 --> 01:44:07,821
Indulge me.
Blanc,

2229
01:44:07,823 --> 01:44:09,690
I told Ransom, Ransom told you,

2230
01:44:09,692 --> 01:44:11,225
and I'm telling you now,

2231
01:44:11,227 --> 01:44:14,194
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

2232
01:44:14,196 --> 01:44:16,864
Yes, you did, yes, he did,
yes, you are.

2233
01:44:16,866 --> 01:44:20,067
But... But, I spoke in the car
about the hole

2234
01:44:20,069 --> 01:44:22,202
at the center of this donut.

2235
01:44:22,204 --> 01:44:24,939
And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night

2236
01:44:24,941 --> 01:44:28,142
seems at first glance to fill
that hole perfectly.

2237
01:44:28,144 --> 01:44:31,544
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

2238
01:44:31,546 --> 01:44:34,148
But we must look a little closer.

2239
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:37,184
And when we do,
we see the donut hole

2240
01:44:37,186 --> 01:44:39,585
has a hole in its center.

2241
01:44:39,587 --> 01:44:41,755
It is not a donut hole,

2242
01:44:41,757 --> 01:44:44,725
but a smaller donut with its
own hole

2243
01:44:44,727 --> 01:44:47,695
and our donut is not whole at all!

2244
01:44:47,697 --> 01:44:49,863
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you...

2245
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:52,068
Why was I hired?

2246
01:44:52,868 --> 01:44:54,600
Why would someone hire me?

2247
01:44:54,602 --> 01:44:56,003
Someone fishing for a crime

2248
01:44:56,005 --> 01:44:57,304
to reverse the will, Blanc.
Come on.

2249
01:44:57,306 --> 01:44:59,807
But I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

2250
01:44:59,809 --> 01:45:01,108
So, yes,

2251
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:04,244
the person must have known
the contents of the will.

2252
01:45:04,246 --> 01:45:05,346
But one step further,

2253
01:45:05,348 --> 01:45:08,749
that same person must have
known a crime was committed,

2254
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:10,684
and further...

2255
01:45:10,686 --> 01:45:15,723
If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

2256
01:45:15,725 --> 01:45:18,792
they must have known that
Marta was responsible.

2257
01:45:18,794 --> 01:45:21,161
An intriguing combination of factors.

2258
01:45:21,163 --> 01:45:22,963
Someone who knew what Marta did

2259
01:45:22,965 --> 01:45:24,630
wanted to expose it

2260
01:45:24,632 --> 01:45:26,666
but could not reveal how they knew.

2261
01:45:26,668 --> 01:45:28,035
Fran!

2262
01:45:28,037 --> 01:45:30,871
She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.

2263
01:45:30,873 --> 01:45:32,206
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,

2264
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,675
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed.

2265
01:45:34,677 --> 01:45:36,210
What if someone in the family
had observed

2266
01:45:36,212 --> 01:45:37,311
Marta doing something suspicious?

2267
01:45:37,313 --> 01:45:40,716
But they would have had
no reason not to speak up.

2268
01:45:42,351 --> 01:45:46,353
The answer is not so simple.

2269
01:45:46,355 --> 01:45:50,924
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

2270
01:45:50,926 --> 01:45:53,963
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

2271
01:45:56,032 --> 01:45:58,768
Marta it will not be easy for
you to hear.

2272
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:01,935
But there is at least

2273
01:46:01,937 --> 01:46:04,972
one truly guilty party
behind it all,

2274
01:46:04,974 --> 01:46:08,142
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

2275
01:46:08,144 --> 01:46:11,814
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

2276
01:46:14,649 --> 01:46:15,883
Trooper Wagner.

2277
01:46:15,885 --> 01:46:17,319
Trooper Wagner?

2278
01:46:18,653 --> 01:46:19,654
No.

2279
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,024
Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

2280
01:46:24,026 --> 01:46:25,692
I figured it was up.
I'm sorry.

2281
01:46:25,694 --> 01:46:28,062
Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

2282
01:46:28,064 --> 01:46:30,663
Not exactly everything though.

2283
01:46:30,665 --> 01:46:32,966
Is this about what Great Nana
told you?

2284
01:46:32,968 --> 01:46:35,936
She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.

2285
01:46:35,938 --> 01:46:37,004
We'll get to that.

2286
01:46:37,006 --> 01:46:39,039
In the meanwhile,

2287
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:41,842
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

2288
01:46:41,844 --> 01:46:45,647
you might tell us all
why you hired me.

2289
01:46:48,951 --> 01:46:51,018
Why I hired you?

2290
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,220
You're right, let's back it up...

2291
01:46:53,222 --> 01:46:54,855
To the night of the party.

2292
01:46:54,857 --> 01:46:57,324
Your argument with Harlan.

2293
01:46:57,326 --> 01:46:58,926
What were the over heard words

2294
01:46:58,928 --> 01:47:02,029
by the Nazi child masturbating
in the bathroom?

2295
01:47:02,031 --> 01:47:05,699
"My Will," and "I'm warning you."

2296
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:08,135
You and Harlan were drama mamas,

2297
01:47:08,137 --> 01:47:11,171
you shared a love of twisting
the knife into one another.

2298
01:47:11,173 --> 01:47:12,773
You see, I don't believe

2299
01:47:12,775 --> 01:47:14,274
he would have slipped it in halfway,

2300
01:47:14,276 --> 01:47:15,277
no, no, no.

2301
01:47:16,112 --> 01:47:17,911
I submit

2302
01:47:17,913 --> 01:47:20,414
Harlan told you everything.

2303
01:47:20,416 --> 01:47:21,882
You can't be serious!

2304
01:47:21,884 --> 01:47:25,285
Not a red dime or word of my work

2305
01:47:25,287 --> 01:47:27,823
to a single one of them, you included.

2306
01:47:28,157 --> 01:47:29,690
Marta,

2307
01:47:29,692 --> 01:47:31,091
remind me what Ransom said

2308
01:47:31,093 --> 01:47:34,228
his conversation with Harlan
ended with?

2309
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:36,830
Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

2310
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,732
And I asked myself,

2311
01:47:38,734 --> 01:47:39,900
"Marta?

2312
01:47:39,902 --> 01:47:41,935
"Why would the topic of the will

2313
01:47:41,937 --> 01:47:44,340
"Have steered around to Marta?"

2314
01:47:45,474 --> 01:47:48,876
There is one obvious explanation...

2315
01:47:48,878 --> 01:47:49,910
You can't be that crazy.

2316
01:47:49,912 --> 01:47:51,912
You're not just gonna
throw away your fortune.

2317
01:47:51,914 --> 01:47:53,947
No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2318
01:47:53,949 --> 01:47:55,249
All of it.

2319
01:47:56,352 --> 01:47:57,784
Your Brazilian nurse?

2320
01:47:57,786 --> 01:47:59,119
Are you goddamn insane?

2321
01:47:59,121 --> 01:48:02,222
I'm sane for the first time
in my life,

2322
01:48:02,224 --> 01:48:03,290
and I've done it.
Harlan, if you think

2323
01:48:03,292 --> 01:48:04,224
I'm gonna let this happen,

2324
01:48:04,226 --> 01:48:05,125
if you think I'm gonna
stand here and...

2325
01:48:05,127 --> 01:48:07,261
I've made the change
to my will. It's done.

2326
01:48:07,263 --> 01:48:08,264
I'm warning you!

2327
01:48:09,498 --> 01:48:11,333
That's some heavy-duty conjecture.

2328
01:48:11,967 --> 01:48:13,400
Granted.

2329
01:48:13,402 --> 01:48:17,271
But it is the only way what
comes next makes sense.

2330
01:48:17,273 --> 01:48:20,142
So you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

2331
01:48:21,477 --> 01:48:23,177
You tell Marta later...

2332
01:48:23,179 --> 01:48:25,848
What was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

2333
01:48:26,215 --> 01:48:27,948
Clarity.

2334
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:30,819
That he had to make do for
himself from here on out.

2335
01:48:31,153 --> 01:48:32,219
Exactly.

2336
01:48:35,157 --> 01:48:38,125
Marta. The will. Harlan.

2337
01:48:38,127 --> 01:48:39,826
"Do for yourself."

2338
01:48:39,828 --> 01:48:41,764
"You won't get away with this."

2339
01:48:42,298 --> 01:48:44,300
And a plan forms.

2340
01:48:52,975 --> 01:48:54,274
You return,

2341
01:48:54,276 --> 01:48:57,344
careful to avoid the gate's
security camera range.

2342
01:48:57,346 --> 01:48:59,913
Then on foot up towards the house,

2343
01:48:59,915 --> 01:49:01,848
you sneak in up the trellis,

2344
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:04,251
so as not to be seen by the
rest of the family

2345
01:49:04,253 --> 01:49:07,089
who are still having
their party downstairs.

2346
01:49:08,524 --> 01:49:12,559
What you need to do
will take moments.

2347
01:49:12,561 --> 01:49:17,097
But it is essential that you
are alone and undetected.

2348
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:19,800
You knew what medications
Harlan took.

2349
01:49:19,802 --> 01:49:22,504
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.

2350
01:49:23,472 --> 01:49:24,473
And you knew

2351
01:49:25,507 --> 01:49:29,276
if Marta was responsible
for his death,

2352
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:32,145
even unintentionally,

2353
01:49:32,147 --> 01:49:35,182
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will

2354
01:49:35,184 --> 01:49:38,318
and you would get your share back.

2355
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,120
You used the syringes in the kit

2356
01:49:40,122 --> 01:49:43,125
to switch the liquids in the
two medication vials.

2357
01:49:44,126 --> 01:49:45,427
And as a final precaution...

2358
01:49:47,429 --> 01:49:49,365
you took the Naloxone,

2359
01:49:50,165 --> 01:49:53,267
the life saving antidote.

2360
01:49:53,269 --> 01:49:55,602
No. No, no, no, that's impossible.

2361
01:49:55,604 --> 01:49:57,404
That is the truth.

2362
01:49:57,406 --> 01:50:00,007
Hand me that vial of Morphine,
I'll show you.

2363
01:50:00,009 --> 01:50:03,010
If he did that,
if the meds were switched,

2364
01:50:03,012 --> 01:50:05,347
then when I got them mixed up, I...

2365
01:50:06,982 --> 01:50:09,084
I accidentally switched them back,

2366
01:50:10,419 --> 01:50:11,618
so I gave Harlan...

2367
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:13,022
The correct doses.

2368
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:14,957
Yes.

2369
01:50:17,393 --> 01:50:18,927
But not accidentally.

2370
01:50:20,462 --> 01:50:23,532
I taped over the label
of these two vials.

2371
01:50:24,867 --> 01:50:27,503
The vials themselves are identical.

2372
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,906
How'd you know this was the Morphine?

2373
01:50:32,908 --> 01:50:34,308
I just knew.

2374
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:36,276
You knew because there is the slightest,

2375
01:50:36,278 --> 01:50:37,377
almost imperceptible differences

2376
01:50:37,379 --> 01:50:40,015
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

2377
01:50:42,084 --> 01:50:45,354
You knew because you've
done it a hundred times.

2378
01:50:46,955 --> 01:50:49,222
You gave him the correct medication

2379
01:50:49,224 --> 01:50:51,593
because you are a good nurse.

2380
01:50:53,028 --> 01:50:54,261
Then Harlan was...

2381
01:50:54,263 --> 01:50:56,265
I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.

2382
01:50:57,633 --> 01:50:59,835
Harlan was perfectly fine.
Oh, my God.

2383
01:51:00,936 --> 01:51:03,203
His blood was normal.

2384
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:07,007
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide,

2385
01:51:07,009 --> 01:51:08,575
and you are guilty

2386
01:51:08,577 --> 01:51:10,577
of nothing but some damage
to the trellis

2387
01:51:10,579 --> 01:51:13,080
and a few amateur theatrics.

2388
01:51:13,082 --> 01:51:15,515
In fact,
if Harlan had listened to you

2389
01:51:15,517 --> 01:51:17,386
and called the ambulance,

2390
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:20,456
he would be alive today.

2391
01:51:24,493 --> 01:51:25,559
Damn!

2392
01:51:25,561 --> 01:51:27,129
A twisted web

2393
01:51:28,464 --> 01:51:30,630
and we are not finished
untangling it.

2394
01:51:30,632 --> 01:51:32,466
Not yet.

2395
01:51:32,468 --> 01:51:34,634
Marta, when Great Nana
spotted you

2396
01:51:34,636 --> 01:51:36,505
climbing down the trellis,
she said...

2397
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:41,709
Ransom?
Are you back again already?

2398
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:44,644
"Are you back again already?"

2399
01:51:44,646 --> 01:51:46,115
'Cause earlier that night...

2400
01:51:49,251 --> 01:51:51,620
Ransom, you're back?

2401
01:51:53,155 --> 01:51:55,288
Come on, Marta.

2402
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,591
This is stoopid with two o's.

2403
01:51:57,593 --> 01:51:59,059
You don't have a shred of evidence,

2404
01:51:59,061 --> 01:52:00,660
you're just spinning a fairy tale.

2405
01:52:00,662 --> 01:52:02,362
Not a shred, no.

2406
01:52:02,364 --> 01:52:05,465
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta mixing up the vials,

2407
01:52:05,467 --> 01:52:06,633
so it's your word...

2408
01:52:06,635 --> 01:52:08,036
You have her confession!

2409
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,141
All right, yeah.

2410
01:52:13,008 --> 01:52:14,408
Yeah, we do have that.

2411
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:15,475
With your permission,

2412
01:52:15,477 --> 01:52:17,244
I'd like to spin a little further.

2413
01:52:17,246 --> 01:52:18,679
Much later that night,

2414
01:52:18,681 --> 01:52:20,681
you'd have to come back
to the house...

2415
01:52:20,683 --> 01:52:23,049
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.

2416
01:52:23,051 --> 01:52:26,219
However, this time the dogs
were outside.

2417
01:52:28,657 --> 01:52:30,991
They barked, waking Meg.

2418
01:52:30,993 --> 01:52:32,159
No matter.

2419
01:52:32,161 --> 01:52:34,127
You'll get the vials tomorrow.

2420
01:52:34,129 --> 01:52:35,763
But tomorrow brings news...

2421
01:52:35,765 --> 01:52:38,598
Not of a medical error
and a guilty nurse,

2422
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:41,003
but of a slit throat and a suicide.

2423
01:52:45,742 --> 01:52:48,375
Now the circumstances are perfect

2424
01:52:48,377 --> 01:52:51,044
for the anonymous hirin' of me.

2425
01:52:51,046 --> 01:52:53,480
You know a crime has been
committed by Miss Cabrera,

2426
01:52:53,482 --> 01:52:55,248
you need her to be caught for it.

2427
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,720
You cannot reveal how you know.

2428
01:52:59,521 --> 01:53:00,755
Enter...

2429
01:53:00,757 --> 01:53:02,456
Benoit Blanc.

2430
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,024
Benny, look...

2431
01:53:04,026 --> 01:53:05,158
I hear what you're saying,
but this...

2432
01:53:06,128 --> 01:53:08,328
The body is discovered early
the next morning.

2433
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:09,362
The police,

2434
01:53:09,364 --> 01:53:11,031
the medical examiner, the family,

2435
01:53:11,033 --> 01:53:13,200
everyone swarms in

2436
01:53:13,202 --> 01:53:15,068
and there is no possible way

2437
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:16,670
you can get to Marta's medical bag

2438
01:53:16,672 --> 01:53:18,138
to retrieve the vials.

2439
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,606
You must wait for your moment,

2440
01:53:19,608 --> 01:53:21,508
when the investigation is over

2441
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:24,745
and you know the house will
be empty.

2442
01:53:24,747 --> 01:53:27,080
And that is why

2443
01:53:27,082 --> 01:53:28,484
you missed the funeral.

2444
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:31,418
There is no one home to wonder

2445
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:33,555
why you're going into Harlan's study.

2446
01:53:34,691 --> 01:53:36,556
Or so you think.

2447
01:53:39,561 --> 01:53:41,094
Poor Fran.

2448
01:53:41,096 --> 01:53:42,295
She witnessed you tampering

2449
01:53:42,297 --> 01:53:45,131
with Harlan's medication
in the medical bag.

2450
01:53:45,133 --> 01:53:48,769
She did not know what you
were doing.

2451
01:53:48,771 --> 01:53:51,404
But she knew you were up to
no good.

2452
01:53:51,406 --> 01:53:53,406
So her mind begins to turn.

2453
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:55,208
Oh, God.

2454
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:57,143
That Hallmark movie she told
me about,

2455
01:53:57,145 --> 01:53:58,478
with Danica McKellar...

2456
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,680
Deadly by Surprise.

2457
01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:01,281
That's what she was talking about.

2458
01:54:01,283 --> 01:54:02,484
She loved Harlan.

2459
01:54:03,185 --> 01:54:04,852
She hates Ransom.

2460
01:54:04,854 --> 01:54:07,320
So the poor girl decides
to test her theory,

2461
01:54:07,322 --> 01:54:09,155
and make this asshole pay.

2462
01:54:09,157 --> 01:54:12,192
She gets a copy of the
Toxicology Report.

2463
01:54:12,194 --> 01:54:15,595
Now, I will be honest,
I have no idea how.

2464
01:54:15,597 --> 01:54:17,197
'Cause she has a cousin.

2465
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:18,699
She told me, she has a cousin

2466
01:54:18,701 --> 01:54:21,368
who works as a receptionist
at the examiner's office.

2467
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:22,636
Well, voila!

2468
01:54:22,638 --> 01:54:25,605
The numbers,
they mean nothing to her,

2469
01:54:25,607 --> 01:54:29,409
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat

2470
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:32,414
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

2471
01:54:33,415 --> 01:54:35,115
So why did she send it to me?

2472
01:54:35,117 --> 01:54:36,650
She didn't.

2473
01:54:36,652 --> 01:54:38,420
She sent it to Ransom.

2474
01:54:43,559 --> 01:54:45,793
And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,

2475
01:54:45,795 --> 01:54:47,362
what is his reaction?

2476
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:49,162
Elation.

2477
01:54:49,164 --> 01:54:51,766
He still thinks Marta
has given Harlan

2478
01:54:51,768 --> 01:54:52,833
the tampered drugs.

2479
01:54:52,835 --> 01:54:55,803
A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.

2480
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:58,238
He goes to the will reading
in high spirits,

2481
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:01,141
ready to see the family
tear itself apart,

2482
01:55:01,143 --> 01:55:03,310
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone

2483
01:55:03,312 --> 01:55:06,114
when the Tox Report comes to light.

2484
01:55:07,316 --> 01:55:08,716
And then...

2485
01:55:09,786 --> 01:55:12,252
Marta's confession.

2486
01:55:12,254 --> 01:55:14,822
And everything turns on its head.

2487
01:55:14,824 --> 01:55:19,192
He now realizes that Marta
has committed no crime

2488
01:55:19,194 --> 01:55:23,263
and the Tox Report will prove
her innocence.

2489
01:55:23,265 --> 01:55:25,200
The changed will is gonna stand.

2490
01:55:25,601 --> 01:55:27,434
He has lost.

2491
01:55:29,237 --> 01:55:30,305
Unless...

2492
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:33,173
Unless you decide...

2493
01:55:33,175 --> 01:55:34,407
You're not gonna give up the money.

2494
01:55:34,409 --> 01:55:36,443
You're not gonna give up the money.

2495
01:55:36,445 --> 01:55:37,577
You've come this far.

2496
01:55:37,579 --> 01:55:39,181
You've come this far.

2497
01:55:39,849 --> 01:55:41,851
Just one step further,

2498
01:55:42,517 --> 01:55:45,352
just one last act.

2499
01:55:45,354 --> 01:55:47,556
In for a penny, in for a pound.

2500
01:55:50,225 --> 01:55:52,160
You decide you are in.

2501
01:55:56,899 --> 01:55:58,365
Step one...

2502
01:55:59,468 --> 01:56:02,471
Destroy all evidence of
Marta's innocence.

2503
01:56:08,845 --> 01:56:10,310
Step two,

2504
01:56:10,312 --> 01:56:12,612
send her the anonymous email

2505
01:56:12,614 --> 01:56:15,217
with a late morning
rendezvous time...

2506
01:56:18,587 --> 01:56:21,657
And deliver her the blackmail note.

2507
01:56:24,259 --> 01:56:25,993
Step three,

2508
01:56:25,995 --> 01:56:28,563
keep your appointment with Fran.

2509
01:56:30,265 --> 01:56:32,298
Oh, I knew it.

2510
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:34,969
I knew you were a no-good
son of a bitch.

2511
01:56:34,971 --> 01:56:37,470
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

2512
01:56:37,472 --> 01:56:39,272
Yes, Fran, you were right.

2513
01:56:39,274 --> 01:56:41,574
I knew you were guilty as shit.

2514
01:56:41,576 --> 01:56:43,911
And now you're gonna pay for it!

2515
01:56:43,913 --> 01:56:45,545
Don't you come near me.

2516
01:56:45,547 --> 01:56:48,248
Don't come near me!
I'm warning you!

2517
01:56:57,559 --> 01:56:59,960
See, now, now the board is set.

2518
01:56:59,962 --> 01:57:01,829
Marta will get the blackmail note.

2519
01:57:01,831 --> 01:57:03,864
You'll put the pieces
together for her.

2520
01:57:03,866 --> 01:57:05,800
You'll guide her to the rendezvous.

2521
01:57:05,802 --> 01:57:07,968
You'll make the anonymous call
to the police,

2522
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:09,070
they will catch her there

2523
01:57:09,072 --> 01:57:11,038
with the body and the burned evidence.

2524
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,974
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran

2525
01:57:13,976 --> 01:57:15,444
and Harlan.

2526
01:57:16,378 --> 01:57:17,510
She said...

2527
01:57:17,512 --> 01:57:18,815
You did this.

2528
01:57:20,315 --> 01:57:21,816
She didn't say...

2529
01:57:21,818 --> 01:57:22,819
"You did this."

2530
01:57:24,286 --> 01:57:26,286
She wasn't talking about me,
she said...

2531
01:57:26,288 --> 01:57:28,521
Hugh did this.

2532
01:57:28,523 --> 01:57:30,423
"Hugh did this."

2533
01:57:30,425 --> 01:57:32,695
'Cause you made the help
call you Hugh.

2534
01:57:33,963 --> 01:57:35,397
'Cause you're an asshole.

2535
01:57:36,766 --> 01:57:38,866
And it would have worked

2536
01:57:38,868 --> 01:57:41,334
if we hadn't have brought you
in for questioning

2537
01:57:41,336 --> 01:57:44,071
so you could not make
your anonymous call.

2538
01:57:44,073 --> 01:57:45,572
And if Fran had not stashed

2539
01:57:45,574 --> 01:57:48,075
a safety copy of the Tox Report.

2540
01:57:48,077 --> 01:57:52,314
And if Marta had not
out played you once again.

2541
01:57:53,315 --> 01:57:54,884
By having a kind heart.

2542
01:57:57,352 --> 01:57:59,787
By saving Fran's life

2543
01:57:59,789 --> 01:58:01,956
though it meant her losing
the inheritance

2544
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,090
and going to jail.

2545
01:58:03,092 --> 01:58:06,093
She didn't play your game.

2546
01:58:06,095 --> 01:58:07,864
She saved Fran's life.

2547
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:12,334
Fran's alive?

2548
01:58:13,035 --> 01:58:14,634
Oh, yes.

2549
01:58:14,636 --> 01:58:16,369
Fran...

2550
01:58:16,371 --> 01:58:19,940
Who will confirm this very story

2551
01:58:19,942 --> 01:58:21,309
or something close to it.

2552
01:58:22,511 --> 01:58:25,647
And send you, Hugh,

2553
01:58:26,348 --> 01:58:27,349
to jail.

2554
01:58:31,888 --> 01:58:32,889
Yes?

2555
01:58:36,726 --> 01:58:38,360
Doctor, that's great news.

2556
01:58:39,394 --> 01:58:40,963
We'll be there soon.
Thank you.

2557
01:58:45,735 --> 01:58:46,736
She's okay.

2558
01:58:47,602 --> 01:58:49,602
She's ready to talk.

2559
01:58:49,604 --> 01:58:51,437
Trooper Wagner, if you could, uh,

2560
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:52,773
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

2561
01:58:52,775 --> 01:58:55,776
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself,

2562
01:58:55,778 --> 01:58:57,678
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

2563
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:58,981
All right.
Up, come on.

2564
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:07,420
I'm gonna say this just to you.

2565
01:59:07,422 --> 01:59:08,756
No cameras, no courtroom,

2566
01:59:08,758 --> 01:59:10,492
just you, 'cause you know it's true.

2567
01:59:11,459 --> 01:59:13,426
We allowed you into our home.

2568
01:59:13,428 --> 01:59:14,862
We let you watch our granddad,

2569
01:59:14,864 --> 01:59:16,629
we welcomed you into our family.

2570
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:18,933
And now you think you can
steal it from us?

2571
01:59:18,935 --> 01:59:22,069
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home,

2572
01:59:22,071 --> 01:59:23,838
our birthright,

2573
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,740
our ancestral family home?

2574
01:59:28,744 --> 01:59:30,177
That is hooey.

2575
01:59:30,179 --> 01:59:32,179
Harlan, he bought this place
in the '80s

2576
01:59:32,181 --> 01:59:34,181
from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.

2577
01:59:34,183 --> 01:59:36,050
Oh, shut up, Blanc!
Shut up!

2578
01:59:36,052 --> 01:59:40,122
Shut up with that Kentucky
Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl!

2579
01:59:41,190 --> 01:59:43,456
Yeah, I killed Fran.
But I guess I didn't.

2580
01:59:43,458 --> 01:59:45,025
So what do you have on me?

2581
01:59:45,027 --> 01:59:46,894
Nothing.
What, attempted murder?

2582
01:59:46,896 --> 01:59:49,596
I get arson for the building,
and a few other charges.

2583
01:59:49,598 --> 01:59:51,765
With a good lawyer, which I have,

2584
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:53,000
I'll be out in no time.

2585
01:59:53,002 --> 01:59:54,902
And then you'll see
just how much hell

2586
01:59:54,904 --> 01:59:56,569
I can wreak on your life,

2587
01:59:56,571 --> 01:59:59,407
you vicious little bitch.

2588
02:00:06,682 --> 02:00:08,148
What the shit!

2589
02:00:09,218 --> 02:00:10,951
That means she's lying!

2590
02:00:10,953 --> 02:00:12,518
Yeah, man, we know.

2591
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,521
That's right.

2592
02:00:14,456 --> 02:00:15,457
Fran's dead.

2593
02:00:19,762 --> 02:00:21,931
And you just confessed to her murder.

2594
02:00:34,643 --> 02:00:35,644
Well...

2595
02:00:36,913 --> 02:00:37,947
In for a penny...

2596
02:01:22,725 --> 02:01:23,726
Shit.

2597
02:02:57,019 --> 02:02:58,020
Linda!

2598
02:02:58,354 --> 02:02:59,453
Linda!

2599
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:02,024
We've gotta get the attorneys
on the phone right now!

2600
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:03,793
We...

2601
02:03:09,965 --> 02:03:11,098
Can I ask

2602
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,100
when did you know I had
something to do

2603
02:03:13,102 --> 02:03:14,835
with Harlan's death?

2604
02:03:14,837 --> 02:03:16,837
Oh, from the first moment

2605
02:03:16,839 --> 02:03:18,307
you set foot in front of me.

2606
02:03:23,645 --> 02:03:24,577
Oh, shit.

2607
02:03:24,579 --> 02:03:26,680
I want you to remember something

2608
02:03:26,682 --> 02:03:27,917
that's very important.

2609
02:03:29,085 --> 02:03:30,284
You won,

2610
02:03:30,286 --> 02:03:33,155
not by playing the game
Harlan's way,

2611
02:03:33,956 --> 02:03:35,024
but yours.

2612
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:38,761
You're a good person.

2613
02:03:40,963 --> 02:03:42,298
This family.

2614
02:03:48,771 --> 02:03:50,940
I should help them. Right?

2615
02:03:51,807 --> 02:03:54,176
Well, I have my opinion,

2616
02:03:55,811 --> 02:03:58,080
but I have a feeling you'll
follow your heart.
