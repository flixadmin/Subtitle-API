1
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,965
<i>They want us to believe
Vought superheroes are the answer.</i>

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,341
<i>What else do they lie about?</i>

3
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:08,635
- A-Train, you're out.
- Out of what?

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:09,635
The Seven.

5
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:12,222
I ended the relationship
when I met you.

6
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:14,892
Stop fucking lying to me.

7
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,143
And you love her?

8
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:21,857
We shouldn't feel so calm or safe.
So, what are we gonna do?

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,234
<i>Cross our fingers
that Homelander's gonna save us?</i>

10
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:26,612
- I'm the face of The Seven.
- I'm just trying to help.

11
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,531
- Ain't you supposed to be a hero?
- I am a hero.

12
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:30,908
That's Liberty.

13
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,244
William Butcher?

14
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,787
I found Becca.

15
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,456
I'm gonna get you out of here.

16
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,917
- I'm not leaving.
- Becca, you and me, we could disappear.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,085
- I have a son.
- He's a fucking Supe freak.

18
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:04,483
Ruby.

19
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:14,868
Ruby.

20
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:22,209
Here. I'm here.

21
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:34,596
Looks like you saved me, Red.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,515
No, you saved us.

23
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,976
If you hadn't broken
into the DHS mainframe...

24
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:43,897
True, I am a hell of a hacker,
but I'm no hero.

25
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,984
You are a hero, in lots of ways.

26
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,277
What do you mean?

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,448
You're not afraid to live your life.

28
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,368
To be who you really are.

29
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,328
Me, I'm...

30
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:03,125
I'm afraid to show the world who I am.

31
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,209
Yeah?

32
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,628
So who are you, Maeve?

33
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:08,839
I'm a lot like you.

34
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:12,341
I'm gay.

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,849
We have to keep moving.

36
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,517
Come on.

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,519
And cut!

38
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:23,812
Brilliant.

39
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,356
Yes, that was absolutely brilliant.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,816
Gang, let's check that.

41
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:31,361
And, ladies and gents,
it is a wrap for today.

42
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:32,821
Good job, people.

43
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,197
That was so great.

44
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,742
Let's hit it hard in the a.m. Thank you.

45
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,201
That's a wrap, people.

46
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,622
Hey, Marty, play that back, please.

47
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,168
- You enjoying this?
- Yeah.

48
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,546
This new Joss rewrite really sings, huh?

49
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:55,093
- When are you gonna stop torturing me?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

50
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,724
If I promise to never see her again,

51
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,060
will you stop?

52
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,356
But, Maeve, you're in love.

53
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,107
It's beautiful.

54
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,651
Elena's good for you.
I won't let you throw that away.

55
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:14,279
Not now, not ever.

56
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:16,990
I mean, that would be cruel.

57
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:18,533
- Come on.
- Can I have a word, sir?

58
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,202
Oh, look at this.

59
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:23,914
Look at these strong female lesbians. Hm?

60
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,457
I'm inspired.

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,666
- You inspired?
- Oh, yeah.

62
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,002
- Girls get it on.
- "Done." Girls get it done.

63
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:31,880
- They sure do, Ashley.
- In private. It's urgent.

64
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:43,934
Ooh.

65
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:51,899
Terrific.

66
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,370
Oh.

67
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,127
Oh.

68
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:17,384
Pfft. They're all starving,
but one of them's got a cell phone?

69
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:21,138
I wish you had cleared this with me
before you went over there.

70
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,349
Jesus Christ.
I don't have to clear shit with you.

71
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,393
I saw a chance for an easy win,
and I took it.

72
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,437
- How many views?
- They posted last night.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,064
We scrubbed it 17 minutes later,
but that's forever.

74
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:33,942
And there's been some blowback.

75
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,025
Blowback?

76
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:40,323
All right. Fine, fine, fine.

77
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,534
So, what, uh, I'm down a point?

78
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,202
A point and a half? Two?

79
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:47,622
- No, nine and a half.
- Nine and a half?

80
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:49,832
Nine?

81
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,209
Nine and a half?

82
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,177
<i>Homelander kills! Homelander kills!</i>

83
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,431
What, they're fucking protesting... me?

84
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:08,393
- Oh, my God. They're protesting me.
- They've been at the Tower all afternoon.

85
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:10,770
Why didn't you fucking say something?

86
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:12,355
Goddamn it.

87
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,651
Don't these ingrates realise
I killed that asshole for them?

88
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:19,112
What do they think "Saving America" means?

89
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:21,698
PR is drafting a response as we speak.

90
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:26,286
- Acknowledgement, apology, action.
- No, no, no. Apology? No.

91
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:30,040
You schedule a press conference,
and I'll clean it up myself.

92
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,374
Well, Mr. Edgar...

93
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,671
and Legal would like
your official position

94
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:38,965
to be "no comment" at this time.

95
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,468
Please, no press,

96
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:45,680
until the Crisis Team
has an actionable strategy, okay?

97
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,351
Bad day?

98
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,358
Hey, I'm with you.
Fuck these maxi pad-wearing ingrate hicks.

99
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,901
But there's a way to handle it.

100
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,153
I do not need your fucking help.

101
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:03,448
Sure, you seem
to be doing so well on your own.

102
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,952
Well, I'm here when you want me.

103
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:12,285
Hello, hello. Hughie?

104
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,662
<i>Hey, hey. Hi, Hi.</i>

105
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,122
Sorry, thought I was
getting your voicemail.

106
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:19,959
- That why you called five times?
<i>- No, I thought you should know.</i>

107
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:22,671
Liberty, that Supe
that Raynor was looking into?

108
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,924
Turns out it's Stormfront.
Vought changed her name.

109
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,385
They're moving her around
like a Catholic priest.

110
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,387
- Right.
<i>- Um...</i>

111
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,973
<i>She probably murdered Raynor.
Annie's trying to figure out why.</i>

112
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:36,059
But, you know, who the fuck knows?

113
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:40,021
Well, as long as Starlight's on the job,
we're sorted then, yeah?

114
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:42,648
I'm not...

115
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,442
I'm not mad, you know.

116
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,111
<i>What do you mean?</i>

117
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,738
I just want you to know that, um...

118
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:52,075
Yes, you are leaving us
holding the bag on this shitshow.

119
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:55,328
<i>But I want you to know that I get it.
It's, uh, Becca.</i>

120
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:58,331
I'd do the same thing. I'm not mad.

121
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,583
Well,

122
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,587
wouldn't matter if you were.

123
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:05,714
<i>How is she?</i>

124
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:07,465
Lovelier than the day I met her.

125
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,053
Where are you?

126
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,471
<i>Heading off-grid.</i>

127
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:16,224
Argentina, maybe. Early retirement.

128
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:18,810
Butcher?

129
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:19,893
<i>Yeah, what?</i>

130
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:24,691
Could've said goodbye.

131
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,779
I know we been through some shit together.

132
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,034
You were...

133
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,165
You were always like my canary, I suppose.

134
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,667
<i>Thank you.</i>

135
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,086
- Goodbye, Hughie.
<i>- Your canary...?</i>

136
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,670
Hello?

137
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:59,684
<i>On your feet, soldier.</i>

138
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,858
<i>Take me home to Lallybroch.</i>

139
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,276
What are you watching?

140
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:11,905
A show called <i>Eat My Dick.</i>

141
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:12,988
Okay.

142
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,701
Have you seen Frenchie or Kimiko?

143
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:19,329
No, no. Not for a while. Why?

144
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,412
Fuck.

145
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,584
Uh, I just got off the phone with Butcher.
I think something might be wrong.

146
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,836
Like, really, really wrong.

147
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,005
What makes you think that?

148
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:31,049
He was nice.

149
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:32,842
And...

150
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,639
called me his canary.

151
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,729
Tell me everything he said.

152
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:00,787
Agent Pearson, sir.

153
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,879
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Agent Cruz, I thought we lost you.

154
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:11,756
Got by with a little help from a friend.

155
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,300
So? Good news or bad?

156
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,764
I'd say that's good news.

157
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:23,309
- And now the CG mutants approach.
- And there's the bad news.

158
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,645
There's no way we can restore the grid

159
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,189
if we don't get
that flash drive to the Tower.

160
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:31,109
- How will you get through all of them?
- Don't worry.

161
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:34,195
Girls get it done.

162
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:38,199
And cut on rehearsal.
No one move. No one move.

163
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:41,369
Starlight, I'm not touching,
but can you take a step?

164
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,037
Keep going, closer. Can you mark her?

165
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:45,081
Closer to Stormfront. Mark her, please.

166
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,709
And let's just pretend
like you like her, okay?

167
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,337
Okay, if I have to.

168
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,506
Okay. Okay, good stuff.
Let's try one for that. Good.

169
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,966
We should've shot that.

170
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:56,885
Clearly you like me.

171
00:11:56,968 --> 00:12:00,221
You've been eye-fucking me
like a lovesick stangirl all day.

172
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:01,305
Why is that?

173
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:04,475
I don't know.
I think that you're a good actor.

174
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,062
I just feel
like a frigging fembot up there.

175
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:09,605
You know...

176
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:13,526
Everybody, can we stand by to roll?

177
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,112
Let's try to make our day. How about that?

178
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,196
Thank you.

179
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,573
<i>Extra. Extra.</i>

180
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:21,367
<i>And turning now to superhero news:</i>

181
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,454
<i>Former Seven member The Deep

182
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,873
<i>when he married Cassandra Schwartz,</i>

183
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:30,376
<i>an anthropology professor at Vassar,

184
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,376
<i>The couple asked...</i>

185
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,129
Banana saltwater taffy.

186
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,132
- God bless. Ron can't live without it.
- Ha.

187
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,556
- Billy?
- Hello, Judy.

188
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,556
Who's this?

189
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,101
It's my nephew.

190
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,358
For Christ's sake, Billy,
you gotta ring your mum.

191
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:54,943
Where's my boy?

192
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:58,112
Your mum and dad are flying over.

193
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,448
Your mum's worried to death about you.

194
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,910
No. You tell them, no.

195
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:06,704
It'd be a waste
of a perfectly good plane ticket.

196
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:10,750
Your father's quite ill.
Cancer's spreading fast.

197
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,753
Yeah, well, not fast enough.
I ain't seeing him.

198
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:14,963
Now where's me boy?

199
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,512
Oi, Terror.

200
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,349
You little rascal, eh?

201
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:29,268
Look at you, little fucker.
You ain't changed a day.

202
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:32,522
How's about you and me
go for a little stroll?

203
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:33,606
Yeah?

204
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,691
Come on.

205
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,045
So this is what it all comes to, eh?

206
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,675
Metamucil and wringing our dicks out
for a few drops of piss.

207
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:08,057
I used to think that you, me,
and Becca would grow old together.

208
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,351
Bloody stupid.

209
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:11,936
Turns out she...

210
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:21,612
What the fuck was any of it for?

211
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,706
Yes, there he is.

212
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,751
There's my guy,
looking spectacular, as always.

213
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:35,834
- How we doing?
- Good.

214
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:36,878
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,464
You ready
for this big fucking scene today?

216
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:42,341
That's basically
what I wanted to talk to you about.

217
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,052
- Great.
- I did a bit of a rewrite.

218
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:45,678
I want you to take a look.

219
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,474
Wow.

220
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,685
What a lot of work.

221
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:57,440
Yeah, I just felt
like the dialogue was a little off.

222
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,651
You know, A-Train would
never say any of this shit.

223
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:01,651
Right.

224
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,908
And you definitely just don't need
that giant expo dump at the end.

225
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,786
Your big farewell speech?

226
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:15,291
Honestly, I think it's better
if we just leave it open-ended.

227
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,459
- Okay.
- Know what I mean?

228
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:20,338
We can just play it in looks
and just not a whole bunch of words.

229
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,840
- Right.
- Maybe make it more of a question.

230
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:25,301
- Is A-Train really leaving The Seven?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,346
- We don't know. We don't know.
- We don't know.

232
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Yeah.

233
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,851
I think we'll go ahead
and do the scene as scripted.

234
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,687
Thank you for putting thought into it.
You got a lot of heart.

235
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,773
Take that heart, put it in the scene.

236
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,191
All right, good stuff.

237
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,485
I'm not doing it.

238
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,364
I'm not doing this shitty scene.

239
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:48,615
Well...

240
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,122
that is way above my pay grade.

241
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,084
Bring that up with Ashley.

242
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,128
Right? Right.

243
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:04,090
Oh, by the way,
I got the crew a Vietnamese crêpe truck.

244
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:09,470
They make a gluten-free <i>bánh xèo.</i>
It is fantastic. You're gonna be great.

245
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:12,306
- Where are we going?
- They need to see you in Wardrobe.

246
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:17,645
<i>Deep, you look so happy.
I hardly recognise you.</i>

247
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,272
<i>Katie, I'm in love. You know?</i>

248
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:23,401
<i>To an extraordinary woman
I'm now blessed to call my wife.</i>

249
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,111
<i>That's really nice.</i>

250
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:29,490
<i>Well, let's address
the elephant in the room, shall we?</i>

251
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:33,995
<i>You know, I'm glad you asked,
because, uh, yeah, you know,</i>

252
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,789
<i>Kevin here has
had some issues in the past.</i>

253
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:38,666
<i>But people grow.</i>

254
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,003
<i>If you could see
the letters that he writes me,</i>

255
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,797
<i>you would know
what a beautiful soul he has.</i>

256
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:48,176
<i>Thank you. She's only saying that
because I make her breakfast in bed.</i>

257
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:49,677
<i>- Oh, stop.
- French toast.</i>

258
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:56,934
<i>So you are both members
of the Church of the Collective.</i>

259
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,270
It's not realistic.

260
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,981
Alexander Hamilton
wasn't no Puerto Rican.

261
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,816
That's the point.

262
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,819
It's a metaphor for the immigrant
experience in America.

263
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,654
But he was a white guy.

264
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,534
You know what's really good?

265
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:17,371
Can we help you?

266
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,338
She's just a girl.

267
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:27,632
Show her a picture of kittens
or some shit.

268
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,053
How about I show her
my motherfucking dick?

269
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,645
Bitch ain't right in the head.

270
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,023
Fuck!

271
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,235
Holy shit!

272
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,036
Stop, please.

273
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:37,410
Oi, Billy, you should've told me
you were bringing company.

274
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:42,248
Oi, who's this one remind you of?
Isn't he the spitting of Lenny?

275
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,335
No.

276
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,423
Thought you were retiring.

277
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:51,674
Argentina, right?

278
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,259
I am.

279
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,723
What are you doing here?

280
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:01,684
Well, Hughie heard a dog toy on the phone.

281
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,312
I know you keep Terror
at your aunt's, so...

282
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:05,854
Brilliant as ever.

283
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,315
Time to go.

284
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:10,818
- Come help us with Stormfront.
- Came all this way for that?

285
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,738
No, we came because we're worried.

286
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,531
Your cunt sense tingling, is it?

287
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,951
Well, don't you worry. I'm sorted.

288
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,661
Where's Becca, man?

289
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,245
Becca?

290
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,664
What's he talking about?

291
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,127
Waiting for me at the Hampton Inn, so...

292
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,255
Lots of thanks. Time to piss off.

293
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,424
We're not going anywhere.

294
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:37,469
Right.

295
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,476
Just so you know,
that's Terror's girlfriend.

296
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
What?

297
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,145
His fuck pig.

298
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,342
Black Noir is here.

299
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,595
What?

300
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,306
It wasn't us. We were cautious.

301
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,934
We swapped cars, no toll roads...

302
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,352
It's not you.

303
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:29,897
It's me.
He must've tracked me from Becca's.

304
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,274
Billy, what's this all about?

305
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,359
It's complicated.

306
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:36,570
Becca's not with me.

307
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,490
You couldn't get her out?

308
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:44,954
She didn't want out.

309
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:49,792
I'll explain everything.

310
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,253
But right now we're in a bit of trouble.

311
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,505
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

312
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,674
Okay, maybe...

313
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,136
Maybe we can make a run for it,
just get to the car.

314
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,430
Nah, he moves faster than a car.

315
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,226
But if he wants to kill us,

316
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,938
he'll have to do it with an audience.

317
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,071
This is the fire department.

318
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:22,783
A natural gas leak has been reported.
Everyone, out of your homes.

319
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,744
I repeat, a gas leak has been reported.

320
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,456
- Nice one, M.M.
- Out of your homes, please.

321
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,499
Let's hope they stay a while.

322
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,586
Ma'am, do you have any nails,
ball bearings, electrical wiring?

323
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:37,047
Pressurised aerosol products?
I need a can about this big.

324
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,382
Really appreciate it.

325
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:43,387
Team Britney, 2007.

326
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,600
- Remember the meltdown?
- Oh, mm, yeah, that...

327
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,268
But, you know...

328
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,353
You're a firecracker.

329
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:52,563
Mom?

330
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:54,982
Annie.

331
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,860
Oh, you look so pretty.

332
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:02,114
What... What are you doing here?

333
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm in town.
I've been texting you for days.

334
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:07,453
I wasn't trying to ambush you, I promise.

335
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,539
Did you get any of the Vietnamese crêpes?
Because they're dope.

336
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,541
No, no, no. I'm good, thanks.

337
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,298
Your mom was telling me about

338
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,218
the hero pageants you used to do.

339
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,636
Lucky.

340
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,846
My mom would never let me.

341
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,057
Adele did not go in
for that sort of thing.

342
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,519
I had to do all my speeches
to a brush in the mirror.

343
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,479
I like this one.

344
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,940
Mom, this isn't a great time.

345
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,149
I know you're busy,

346
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,902
but you don't have to entertain me,
I promise.

347
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,947
I wanted to see you, sweetheart. I...

348
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,073
I miss you.

349
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,118
Uh...

350
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:56,544
I think that this is something
that we need to discuss in private.

351
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,046
- Donna, can I tell her?
- Tell me what?

352
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,383
Look, your mom is so sorry
about the Compound V.

353
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,801
And she understands

354
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:07,429
that keeping that a secret
really hurt your relationship.

355
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,891
And I used you as a trophy
to make myself feel important.

356
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,268
I know that now.

357
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,396
Why are you talking to a stranger
about our relationship?

358
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,648
She's not a stranger. She's your teammate.

359
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,155
Annie, look, the whole world
knows about Compound V.

360
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,784
I mean, lots of parents did what I did.

361
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,035
I...

362
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,497
I'm hoping that you'll...

363
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,332
That you'll forgive me.

364
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,542
Please, forgive me.

365
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:41,672
This is not the time
or the place for this.

366
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,341
Look, everyone is upset about Compound V.

367
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:47,845
I mean, someone was so upset,
they leaked it to the press.

368
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:51,890
Can you imagine how angry
that person is, whoever they are?

369
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,812
I'll let you two hash it out,

370
00:23:56,895 --> 00:24:02,484
but I just think, if it was me,
I'd be grateful to have a mom like Donna.

371
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,994
Honey, please.

372
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,707
I need to get back to set.

373
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,211
Do you need someone
to drive you back to your hotel?

374
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,214
No, I'll get a cab.

375
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,970
Okay, now, Queen Maeve. A goddess.

376
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,723
But our Empress of the Otherworld
struggles inside.

377
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,476
Questions of identity
rock her to her core.

378
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,353
- Until she meets...
- Elena.

379
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:39,229
The connection is immediate,
all-consuming.

380
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:41,649
A sweet Sapphic love blossoms,

381
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:45,235
raising Maeve's consciousness
and revealing her own inner truth.

382
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,655
She's gay, and it's okay.

383
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:48,739
- It's...
- Powerful.

384
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,200
She's more than just a superhero now.

385
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,785
She is a symbol.

386
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:54,244
Representation matters.

387
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,872
She's hashtag "Brave Maeve."

388
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,417
We're recommending
a multipronged image makeover.

389
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:03,671
- First guest spots on <i>Queer Eye.</i>
- Then an exclusive It Gets Better PSA.

390
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,005
Kimberly Peirce might direct.

391
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:07,132
Grand Marshalls at New York
and Chicago Pride,

392
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,010
because you are two proud lesbians.

393
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,303
You know Maeve is bi, right?

394
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:14,098
I just feel like
lesbian is an easier sell.

395
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,599
A bit more cut-and-dry.

396
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:16,767
Now, for Elena...

397
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,310
- Me?
- You're gonna love it.

398
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:19,687
Why am I a part of this shit?

399
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,356
We are going with a polished,
tailored look.

400
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,776
That looks like menswear.

401
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,404
Pew Research shows that
two feminine women in a relationship

402
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:29,822
sends a problematic message.

403
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,532
This isn't <i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

404
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,826
Americans are more
accepting of gays

405
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,370
when they're in a clear-cut
gender role relationship,

406
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,788
like Ellen and Portia.

407
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,957
Okay, let's get one thing straight.

408
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,877
I have no interest
in being in a public relationship.

409
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,379
You will be compensated.

410
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,964
I am not for sale.

411
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,344
Really? You're not gonna say anything?

412
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,774
I'll fix this.

413
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:06,858
Yeah.

414
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:08,526
Elena.

415
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,279
Elena, wait.

416
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,741
If they want a lesbian Ken doll,

417
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,617
they can find someone else.

418
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,998
I'm gonna cash in my vacation days
and go stay with my sister.

419
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,168
- No, you can't do that.
- Why? I'm not under contract.

420
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,880
This is Homelander, okay?

421
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,716
And he's fucking with me.
If you go out there...

422
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,220
Elena, there is nowhere you can go
that he won't find you.

423
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,681
Please, stay.

424
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:41,435
I can't protect you if you leave.

425
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:44,855
But what are we gonna do?

426
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,818
We're gonna take that motherfucker down.

427
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,363
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

428
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,539
Okay.

429
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,460
Is this right?

430
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,631
Just like <i>Home Alone,</i>
except way less delightful.

431
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,134
Butcher?

432
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,221
No.

433
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,390
It ain't right.

434
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,145
What's going on?

435
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,606
That ninja cunt's here for me, isn't he?

436
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,567
But you can't go out there.
He'll kill you.

437
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,072
So...

438
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,367
So that's it?

439
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,410
Expecting a happy ending, were we?

440
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,872
Well, I'm sorry, Hughie.

441
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,875
It ain't that kind of massage parlour.

442
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,962
Now, I can keep him busy
for a little while, yeah?

443
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,881
Give you lot a chance to leg it.

444
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:55,926
I'm knackered.

445
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,681
I could use a little lie down.

446
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,643
Fuck you.

447
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:09,274
Am I supposed to be impressed
by this blaze-of-glory jerk-off?

448
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:10,815
Guess not.

449
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,027
You don't think I thought
about cashing it in after Robin?

450
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,611
Because I do.

451
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:18,948
Still.

452
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:21,742
A lot.

453
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,456
But I don't.

454
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,882
And the thing that kills me
is that your wife is alive.

455
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,677
She just doesn't want you, that's all.

456
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:42,306
Say that again.

457
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,392
So you don't have shit.
Welcome to the fucking club.

458
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,688
I mean, come on,
what do any of us have besides...?

459
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:58,363
Who the fuck asked you to come here, eh?

460
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,241
I don't need your help.

461
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,536
Jesus, you're fucking pathetic.

462
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,998
You're so scared of being alone, Hughie.

463
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,376
First you latch on to Robin,
then Starlight, and now me.

464
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,755
Well, you know what, son?
I ain't interested.

465
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,265
Look, just get out of the fucking way.

466
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,773
Don't make me move you.

467
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,358
You can move him.

468
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,070
Good luck with me.

469
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:22,614
She wanted the job.

470
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,116
You have her doing hits?

471
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,868
The Albanians have her doing hits.

472
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,079
I'm just a girl getting 10 percent.

473
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,916
I'm sorry, pumpkin.

474
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,668
But I told you,

475
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,169
she's no kitten.

476
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:40,132
She can make her own choices.

477
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:43,592
Why?

478
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,975
How is this stopping Stormfront?

479
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,353
I know you blame yourself
for your brother.

480
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:55,856
I know the rage you feel.

481
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:59,192
But this, this is not the way.

482
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,030
This is poison for your soul. I know.

483
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,953
Come with me, <i>mon coeur.</i>

484
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:17,252
I got my own baby brother killed!

485
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:22,007
He was the only thing
that mattered to me!

486
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,302
Stop trying to help me!

487
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,637
I don't want your help!

488
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:31,641
I don't understand what you're saying,
because you won't teach me.

489
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,190
Fuck this.

490
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,026
Fuck you.

491
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:46,990
Go be a monster.

492
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:02,255
<i>Remember when you were young
and the world was full of possibilities?</i>

493
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,218
<i>Before all the mistakes,
heartbreaks, and disappointments?</i>

494
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,304
<i>What if you could go back
to the way things were?</i>

495
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:14,142
I used to be angry, insecure, and unsure.

496
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,895
But thanks
to the Church of the Collective,

497
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:19,356
I now know the kind of man I want to be.

498
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:22,692
The kind of man
who calls out injustice when he sees it.

499
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:23,902
- Stop.
- Come on.

500
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:24,985
Hey, dude.

501
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:26,530
That's not cool.

502
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,243
The kind of man
who stands up for what's right.

503
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,370
Come on, guys. Knock it off.

504
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,874
The kind of man
who sees the potential in all of us.

505
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,961
So join us
at the Church of the Collective.

506
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,880
And be the person
you were always meant to be.

507
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:54,558
That's a bunch of bullshit.

508
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:58,019
Didn't used to be.
Church used to mean something.

509
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,104
Are you a member?

510
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:03,066
- I was, long time ago.
- Hm.

511
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,860
That place used to be pure.

512
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:10,115
And then they just started
letting all kinds of people in, you know?

513
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:13,409
I don't know.

514
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,664
So why don't you tell me?

515
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,374
Well, I think you do know.

516
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,460
Some people are quality,
and others are...

517
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,297
garbage.

518
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,092
Oh, by the way,

519
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,219
I heard they're retiring you.

520
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,639
So unfair.

521
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:40,520
You have a problem?

522
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,606
Of course not. Why would you say that?

523
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,153
Can I have a word, please?

524
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,658
Adam tells me
you don't want to do the scene.

525
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,286
I can't be a part
of something I don't believe in.

526
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,705
I know it's not easy losing your job.

527
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,291
When I got fired,
I Tindered my way through Barcelona.

528
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:05,170
Everyone in that city ate my paella.
Fucked a guy with elephantiasis.

529
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,006
But I got through it, and so will you.

530
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,551
Yeah, but I'm still making it happen.
My A-Trainers sell how many pairs a year?

531
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:12,719
Look on the bright side.

532
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,846
You served four years longer
than Mr. Marathon.

533
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,349
- Now, that is something, okay?
- But...

534
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,141
Please.

535
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:23,021
Let me just talk to Homelander.

536
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,232
We both know that's not a good idea.

537
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,442
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,654
I'm not saying the lines.

539
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,739
Okay, this can go one of two ways.

540
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:36,743
One, you leave The Seven with your dignity
and your severance package intact.

541
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:40,080
Or two, you get fired
for breaching your morality clause

542
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,581
by shooting up Compound V

543
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:45,043
and giving yourself a heart attack
in the fucking process.

544
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:46,836
It's your choice.

545
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:02,185
You know, the truth is,
I've been running my whole life.

546
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,022
I think it's time
that I stay put for a while.

547
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,234
It's time I went home.

548
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,988
I know this is the Dawn of the Seven.

549
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,575
But it's sunset on A-Train.

550
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,831
- It's been a good run.
- Cut!

551
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,585
Hey, dude, that was awesome.

552
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:30,797
Awesome? A-dog, that was fucking gold.

553
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,591
Buddy, look, I'm ready to move on.

554
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,802
But how do you feel?
Want another one? Let me know.

555
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,763
No, go ahead and move on.

556
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,181
All right, check it. Moving on.

557
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,768
- Tiffany, we need you over at Mocap.
- I'm heading there now.

558
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:49,441
Yes, it's true,
Vought has all the money and the power.

559
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:53,403
- And we have, no offence, jack shit.
- We love you, Victoria!

560
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,906
But after Homelander's war crime,

561
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,911
how can I stay quiet
and still look my daughter in the eyes?

562
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,497
I can't. I know you can't.

563
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:08,752
And guess what.
The House Judiciary can't, either.

564
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:14,466
Finally, we are going to hold hearings
on Vought and Compound V.

565
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:16,509
Yes. Yeah.

566
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,640
Hey, everyone.

567
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,354
May I?

568
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,066
Thank you.

569
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,528
Congresswoman Neuman, everybody.

570
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:36,780
Isn't she great?

571
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:40,575
Did you love that "Walk Like an Egyptian"
dance she did online?

572
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,410
So fun.

573
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,953
<i>I loved it.</i>

574
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:47,374
<i>- But fun isn't what we're here for, is it?</i>
- No, no, no...

575
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,335
<i>Let me just start by saying
how pleased I am to see you all here.</i>

576
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:53,254
Everyone get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

577
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,589
Fuck you. Get out.

578
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,591
<i>...all your voices to be heard.</i>

579
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:59,219
I know that some of you are a little upset

580
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:02,389
by that video online
of me stopping the terrorist.

581
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:06,768
And I just want you to know
that I understand.

582
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,229
I'm upset too.

583
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,689
I mean, come on, guys.

584
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:15,026
Nobody wants innocent people to get hurt.
Of course not.

585
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,197
But sadly,

586
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,991
well, the bad guys,

587
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:25,245
they don't think like us.

588
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,540
And so,

589
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,460
sometimes,
well, these things just happen.

590
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,380
This happened before?

591
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,924
- How many times?
- Well, no. Hold on, guys.

592
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:42,804
My point is,
we all have the same goals, don't we?

593
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,348
<i>- To keep our country safe.</i>
- No.

594
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,184
<i>So American lives
are the only ones worth protecting?</i>

595
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,602
Of course not.

596
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:53,356
But if you've served
with our amazing soldiers like I have,

597
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,277
you would know
that freedom comes at a price.

598
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,945
You don't speak for us.

599
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,698
- Yeah, you don't speak for us.
- You don't speak for us.

600
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:04,868
You don't speak for us.

601
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:08,413
Oh, all right.
Everyone, just calm down. Calm down.

602
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,832
Let's not let your hearts
get in the way of your heads.

603
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:13,877
<i>- You don't speak for us.</i>
- Everyone just relax.

604
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,045
<i>- You don't speak for us.</i>
- Calm down.

605
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,505
<i>You don't speak for us.</i>

606
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,758
<i>You don't speak for us.
You don't speak for us.</i>

607
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,844
<i>- You don't speak for us.</i>
- Fuck Homelander.

608
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,304
<i>You don't speak for us.</i>

609
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:47,076
<i>You don't speak for us.
You don't speak for us.</i>

610
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,661
<i>You don't speak for us...</i>

611
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,873
All right. You guys are the real heroes.

612
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,541
God bless you.

613
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,335
Love you, guys.

614
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:58,630
<i>You don't speak for us.
You don't speak for us.</i>

615
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,018
- You guys are all good.
- Oh, thank you.

616
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,036
It's time.

617
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,080
Right, lads. To the taffy room.

618
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,753
This is bullocks.

619
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,355
This is the taffy room?

620
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,527
Affordable alternative
to privatised health care.

621
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:07,531
She's a dealer.

622
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:16,457
<i>All right.
Everybody, just calm down. Calm down.</i>

623
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,209
<i>Let's not let your hearts...</i>

624
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,089
<i>You guys, you're the real heroes.</i>

625
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,634
You fuck.

626
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,264
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

627
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,698
No one ever said the job was easy.

628
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:53,161
Look, he's just a kid, 17 years old.
You don't gotta look at him in the face.

629
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:56,581
<i>Look, no one's ever
achieved anything without sacrifice.</i>

630
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:59,626
The kid's a hero. Think of it like that.

631
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,170
Right, a hero.

632
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:17,184
Come in.

633
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:33,326
Where do you get all these?

634
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:36,245
This is just the first batch.
I'll have Logan punch up the fear.

635
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:39,791
- Logan?
- My meme queen.

636
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,959
- Huh.
- So...

637
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,796
When you see it
on your uncle's Facebook page,

638
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,506
then you know it's working.

639
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:48,508
Hm.

640
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,213
Um...

641
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:29,340
Can I ask you something?

642
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:32,969
I suppose I got the time.

643
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:35,846
Who's Lenny?

644
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:37,391
You said I look like him.

645
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:41,310
Billy wouldn't want me to say.

646
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:44,689
Fuck Billy.

647
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:46,899
Lenny's his little brother.

648
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,071
Butcher has a brother?

649
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:53,613
Yeah.

650
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,534
Skinny, nervous little bugger.

651
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:57,617
Like you.

652
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:02,414
Fourth grade.

653
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:07,795
Little wanker named Dorian Savory
breaks Lenny's nose.

654
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,839
Well, Billy goes to work on him.

655
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:14,177
Was bringing the seesaw down
on Dorian's noggin, wham, wham.

656
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,636
Probably gonna top him.

657
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,766
Kids, teachers, trying to drag Billy away,
but no, no good.

658
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:21,976
Not gonna happen. Dorian's a goner.

659
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:25,605
Then Lenny steps in,

660
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,232
face all bleeding,

661
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:29,984
and leads Billy away,

662
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,819
easy, quiet as a lamb.

663
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,281
That was Lenny.

664
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:39,243
He had a way of making Billy not be...

665
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:43,539
well, you know, Billy.

666
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:51,422
I think Billy needs someone like that,
you know?

667
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:03,392
Where's Lenny now?

668
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:06,103
Oh, God rest his soul.

669
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,480
What happened?

670
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,158
Whoa, shh, shh.

671
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:04,120
Easy, Terror. Easy, easy.

672
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,590
Come here. Come on, everybody, out.

673
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,306
Out the side door.

674
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:25,432
Move.

675
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:33,900
- Butcher?
- Get them out of here.

676
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,403
Butcher, wait, wait, wait.
What are you...?

677
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:40,114
Butcher? Butcher?

678
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:42,408
Butcher, what are you doing?

679
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,201
Butcher, you don't...

680
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:46,662
Don't do this.

681
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:47,746
Butcher.

682
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,000
All right, you fucker.

683
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:53,878
Where are you?

684
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,227
So you want to take me on, do you?

685
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,147
Think you got the bollocks?

686
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:17,568
Well, come on, then, cunt.

687
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,869
What the fuck are you doing? Get out.

688
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,123
Oi, gimp cunt.

689
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:34,377
Over here, gimp cunt.
I'm the one you want. Come here.

690
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:14,542
You kill him,

691
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:18,087
and you can kiss
your fucking career goodbye.

692
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,138
I got photos
of Vought's dirty little secret,

693
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:29,348
my wife's son,

694
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,143
Homelander's son.

695
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:37,815
Now, you lay
one fucking finger on any of us,

696
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:41,277
and those photos go out of the cloud,

697
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,612
and into Ronan Farrow's inbox.

698
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,949
And then the whole world will know

699
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:51,328
that Homelander is nothing
but a filthy fucking rapist,

700
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:56,459
and Vought has been hiding
his little laser-eyed bastard.

701
00:47:57,084 --> 00:48:01,172
Now, you cunts went to a lot of trouble
to keep that a secret.

702
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:04,383
I reckon you might
want to keep it that way.

703
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:25,112
<i>Mr. Butcher.</i>

704
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,158
<i>Oh, hello, cunt.</i>

705
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:32,578
How can I be sure you actually
have the proof of which you speak?

706
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:33,871
<i>You can't.</i>

707
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,581
<i>Roll the dice, cunt.</i>

708
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:40,461
<i>I reckon he'd be more popular
than Meghan and Harry's little sprog.</i>

709
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:43,005
Here's my first and final offer.

710
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:45,758
That information
never sees the light of day,

711
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,927
and I'll call off Black Noir.

712
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:48,927
<i>All right.</i>

713
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:50,346
You got yourself a deal.

714
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:52,515
Want to shake on it?

715
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:54,308
<i>Put Noir on.</i>

716
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,938
Oi, missus wants a word.

717
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:10,157
Jesus Christ, Billy.

718
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:13,828
M.M., you all right?

719
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:14,912
I'm okay.

720
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,960
Do you really
have those pictures?

721
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,710
Of course I do.

722
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,310
They said there'd be food.

723
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:40,396
Well, this is food for your soul.

724
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:43,565
Go with love.

725
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,025
Hi.

726
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,028
Maeve. Oh, my God. Hi.

727
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:49,446
- What brought you here?
- Oh.

728
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:50,989
Wait, are you...?

729
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,410
- You want to check this out?
- Fuck, no.

730
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,412
Listen, uh, we should talk.

731
00:49:56,495 --> 00:49:57,495
Yeah.

732
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:01,709
If any of these Moonies
are gonna help you get back in The Seven,

733
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,252
and that's a big "if"...

734
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:07,548
then you're gonna need a woman
to tell everyone

735
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:10,092
that you're not a complete piece of shit.

736
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:13,512
I can be that person for you.

737
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:16,182
- You think I'm a piece of shit?
- Fuck, yeah.

738
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,559
The point is, I can help you.

739
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,811
If you help me.

740
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:24,356
Yeah, I've got Stormfront. Flying in.

741
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,039
Why are you in my trailer?

742
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:26,168
You know, you had no right
to talk to my mother about personal shit.

743
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:28,504
What were you trying to prove?

744
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:30,798
Okay, sorry. Just trying to help.

745
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:35,511
She didn't just lie to me
about Compound V, okay?

746
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:38,847
She lied to me about everything.

747
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:42,851
So don't try and broker
some kind of peace between us,

748
00:51:42,935 --> 00:51:45,229
because I don't want it.

749
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:48,440
Wow, that...

750
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:57,157
I mean, that is a performance.

751
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,242
Oh, my God.

752
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:00,911
Look, I'm, like, tearing up.

753
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:03,914
You don't suck, Starlight.

754
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:06,750
You are Tilda fucking Swinton.

755
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:10,504
I know you leaked it.

756
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,299
I have no idea what you're talking about.

757
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:17,511
Not as good. Magic's gone.
Lightning really doesn't strike twice.

758
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:20,597
Whatever. You know what?
I need to get to set, so...

759
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:22,766
That hack-a-limb, Gecko.

760
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,769
Yeah, he stole the V, and then you,

761
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:28,731
you leaked it to MSNBC.

762
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:31,150
What do you think
Vought's gonna feel when I tell them?

763
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:37,489
Well, how do you think the world will feel

764
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:40,659
when I tell them
that you used to be Liberty?

765
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:47,333
Wow, you are a special
kind of poison flower, huh?

766
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,084
Going against your own people?

767
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,338
You mean fucking white people?

768
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:53,589
Starlight.

769
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:55,132
Superheroes.

770
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:56,674
Don't be racist.

771
00:52:59,011 --> 00:53:00,429
Oh, my.

772
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:01,764
Oh, yes.

773
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:03,807
That is adorable.

774
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:08,270
I do like you. You got spunk.

775
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,732
- You're gonna be a big help to me.
- What the hell does that mean?

776
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:14,859
Come in.

777
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:23,327
Hello, you two.

778
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:28,582
Not interrupting, am I?

779
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:33,212
No, just between us girls,
right, Starlight?

780
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:35,338
Yeah.

781
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:37,257
Yeah, that's right.

782
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,345
- See you around.
- Mm-hm.

783
00:53:44,515 --> 00:53:47,768
- Can't wait to shoot our scene together.
- Yeah, me too.

784
00:53:53,649 --> 00:53:55,067
What was that all about?

785
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,404
You girls friendly?

786
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,156
No, just running lines. What's up?

787
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:04,952
Uh, me.

788
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:06,869
Five points.

789
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:08,580
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

790
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:17,548
Yeah, people are, uh, checking boxes
like "patriotic" and "unwavering."

791
00:54:24,263 --> 00:54:25,263
I owe you.

792
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:29,518
Well, what are you
ever gonna do to repay me?

793
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:40,237
Well, here we are.

794
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:43,407
I'm sorry.

795
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:48,078
I almost threw in the towel,
like a bleeding twat.

796
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,623
We're harder than that, ain't we?

797
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:55,711
I will get your mom back.

798
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:01,341
I swear to God, I'll get your mom back.

799
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:03,218
Just take a little bit longer.

800
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,555
You hang in there, all right?
