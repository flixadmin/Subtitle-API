1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,961
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:02,963 --> 00:00:06,015
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

3
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:08,817
Leonard. I must be losing my mind.

4
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:11,020
The reason why Snart and I got on so well

5
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,488
was we trusted one another.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,239
We were friends.

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,909
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

8
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:18,777
The spear could alter reality itself.

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,112
We broke it into four separate pieces.

10
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:21,997
Mr. Hunter took one...

11
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,199
And took the rest of you to
three different time periods,

12
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,617
which means the last piece unaccounted for

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,119
must be with your grandfather.

14
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,954
Waverider crew, we are now the proud owners

15
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:31,123
of the last fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

16
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,459
Back in 1942, you have a
destiny waiting for you.

17
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,177
Ask Ray what happens
to your village, ask him

18
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,346
what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter,

19
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:40,766
and tell me you'll choose
history over your own family.

20
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:43,802
Watch out, lads!

21
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,304
- _
- Incoming!

22
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:51,977
Coming through! Coming through!

23
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:57,199
According to this map, Jesus'
blood is somewhere over there.

24
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:59,034
The spear is sensing the blood.

25
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:01,787
We won't last five minutes out there.

26
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,489
It's not too late to use it.

27
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,968
_

28
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,337
It's hard to imagine that,
when joined with their siblings,

29
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,506
they're as powerful as God.

30
00:01:20,508 --> 00:01:23,642
But right now, that's just
a useless piece of wood.

31
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,144
It's not useless.

32
00:01:25,146 --> 00:01:27,479
I know ten different ways
to kill somebody with this.

33
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,265
Not to mention,

34
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,601
it's great for scratching in
those hard-to-reach places.

35
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,520
Please don't tell me you
used the Spear of Destiny

36
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:35,854
as a back scratcher.

37
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:38,323
Who said anything about my back?

38
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,359
Well, as Mr. Rory has demonstrated,

39
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,610
in the wrong hands,

40
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,695
this divine artifact can be

41
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:45,914
- put to truly horrific use.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,784
Which is why I called this meeting,

43
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:52,871
to figure out how to keep
it out the Legion's hands.

44
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:55,290
Where's Nate?

45
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:59,545
Nathaniel said he wasn't
feeling up to socializing.

46
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,380
He said he'll go along
with whatever we decide.

47
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:03,182
What is there to decide?

48
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,768
We find the Legion, and we steal
back their pieces of the spear.

49
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,104
There's no need to find the Legion.

50
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:11,023
I know where they've been operating out of.

51
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,525
Why keep it a secret?
Let's just go get them.

52
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:15,477
The reason why you've been
unable to locate Mr. Thawne

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,479
and his partners all this
time is because they've

54
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:20,399
- been operating outside of it.
- You lost me.

55
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,067
- Yeah, me too.
- Three.

56
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,237
What's the one place that
exists outside of time?

57
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,372
- No way.
- Yes way.

58
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:32,578
We must return to the Vanishing Point.

59
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,007
We're in position. Ray?

60
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,308
- Ready.
- Mick?

61
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,427
- Yeah.
- Standby.

62
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,646
Here.

63
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,347
The pieces of the spear call to each other.

64
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,433
We will be able to use
these to locate the pieces

65
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,068
in the Legion's possession.

66
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,270
That's why we're separating into two teams.

67
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:01,406
Mr. Jackson, shall we?

68
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,192
Are you sure bringing
out pieces of the spear

69
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:05,277
was a good idea? If this goes wrong...

70
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,529
Then the Legion has the entire spear.

71
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:09,114
So we have to be careful.

72
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,787
On my way for Legion-watching.

73
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,372
20 seconds.

74
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:23,045
Well, I thought I'd seen
the last of this place.

75
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,130
Let's not make it a habit.

76
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:32,604
Well, I appear to be getting considerable

77
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:34,640
vibrational energy from this.

78
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:45,067
My old friend, please, forgive me.

79
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,618
Oof!

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,538
Mick. Mick!

81
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,908
Are you okay?

82
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,827
Am I okay?

83
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,799
Why wouldn't I be okay?

84
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,168
I miss him too.

85
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,974
He blew himself up. For what?

86
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,727
So the rest of us could live.

87
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,562
Idiot.

88
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,681
Mick, we gotta go.

89
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,566
Look, this is a heist.

90
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:19,351
We have to steal the
other pieces of the spear

91
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:22,271
and get out of here.

92
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,156
You think this is what Snart wants?

93
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:28,694
You waiting around so
that you can get caught?

94
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:31,113
Probably not.

95
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,791
Hold on a sec.

96
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,927
That looks like something
you might hide something in.

97
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,299
Yes, it does.

98
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,851
Jax and I may have found the
other pieces of the spear.

99
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,636
Standby.

100
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:56,855
Copy that.

101
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,442
And I've got eyes on Thawne.

102
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:07,733
He doesn't know we're here.

103
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:15,157
Your try, Mr. Jackson.

104
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:18,043
Oh.

105
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:19,578
What's your favorite candy?

106
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Jelly beans. Why?

107
00:05:36,313 --> 00:05:37,929
A little transmutation trick me and Grey

108
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,648
have been working on.

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,109
Both delicious and impressive, Mr. Jackson.

110
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,277
We have the rest of the spear.

111
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,528
Get back to the ship.

112
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,448
We better hurry. He's on to us.

113
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,916
- On my way.
- Everyone, get the hell

114
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:59,918
- out of here.
- This can't be happening.

115
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,120
They're not smart enough
for this to be happening.

116
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:03,789
- You get it?
- Indeed.

117
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,624
Gideon, get us out of here.

118
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:21,139
No!

119
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,724
Piece of cake.

120
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,192
Whoa, you thought that was easy?

121
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:26,528
No, I want a piece of cake and a beer.

122
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,531
Later, where's the spear?

123
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:35,737
There we go.

124
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,290
What is that?

125
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:39,908
That's power.

126
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,793
The pieces of the spear
are calling to each other.

127
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:44,329
They long to be whole.

128
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:49,801
Yep, that just happened.

129
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:51,002
Well, that's remarkable.

130
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:52,671
The spear must be composed of some kind

131
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,073
of magnetized compound which
acts as its own sealant.

132
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,808
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

133
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,260
Don't touch it.

134
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,429
Now that the spear is
whole, it will try and lure

135
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,097
each of us to use it.

136
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:07,269
It will draw on our weaknesses,
our desires, our regrets.

137
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:10,439
It will promise each of us
that we can remake the world

138
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:13,024
just as we want it.

139
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,943
Well, what's wrong with that?

140
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:16,695
What? Oh, come on.

141
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:17,946
You're all thinking it.

142
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:20,532
Absolute power corrupts, Mr. Rory.

143
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:22,167
Even when used with the best intentions,

144
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,870
which is why I'd attempted to destroy it.

145
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:27,038
Well, maybe you didn't try hard enough.

146
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,541
No, no, no, no, no!

147
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:30,959
Not on the ship, bro!

148
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:34,045
You said destroy, so I destroyed.

149
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,298
It's not destroyed. It's not even charred.

150
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,966
Any harm brought upon
the spear is temporary.

151
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,634
It will always heal itself.

152
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:41,720
That's why you had to
keep the pieces separated.

153
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:45,023
Yes, accomplished with much
effort and numerous explosives.

154
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,224
Wait a sec.

155
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:48,727
There's something written on it.

156
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,229
That's odd.

157
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:52,898
That wasn't there before.

158
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,066
It must have been revealed by the flames.

159
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:57,652
Hmm, see, I did help.

160
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:02,874
"Natum de sanguine, perditus a sanguine."

161
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:05,076
Anyone know Latin?

162
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:10,582
"Natum de sanguine, perditus a sanguine."

163
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,001
Yes, but what does that mean?

164
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:15,587
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

165
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,139
And what does that mean?

166
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:19,007
- It...
- Look, we finally

167
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,475
have the spear.

168
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:22,093
We just need to figure
out what to do with it.

169
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,229
We need to determine a way to protect it.

170
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,231
You don't.

171
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,649
You destroy it.

172
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:29,434
Yes, well, I've tried that, Dr. Heywood.

173
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:30,819
It is impervious to destruction.

174
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:33,605
No, it's not.

175
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:36,942
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

176
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,994
Pretend we're not historians.

177
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,079
"Born of blood" because the blood of Christ

178
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,330
gave the spear power.

179
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:45,283
"Undone by blood" because
the blood of Christ

180
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,085
is the only thing that can destroy it.

181
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,287
Now you're talking.

182
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:51,339
Gideon, plot a course for the Crucifixion.

183
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:53,291
- Yes, Cap...
- Don't you dare, Gideon.

184
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:56,294
Look, throughout history,
there are certain moments

185
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:59,097
whose integrity are crucial.

186
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,799
The birth, life, and death of Jesus Christ

187
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,300
are all such moments.

188
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,970
Any interference, no matter
how miniscule, could have

189
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:07,439
disastrous consequences
for the time stream.

190
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,025
We cannot go there. Ever.

191
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,310
Look, I understand that,
but if this is the only way

192
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,478
to destroy the spear...

193
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,980
It's not.

194
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,733
It's not the only way.

195
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,620
Now, I'm not a historian,
but I can't imagine

196
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,905
it's possible to obtain the blood of Christ

197
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:25,657
without Christ.

198
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,994
Actually, it is.

199
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,749
I did a year abroad at Oxford
while working on my Masters,

200
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:38,336
and in between dating this
girl, Wendy, I remember reading

201
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:41,473
this unpublished paper
by this classics scholar

202
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:43,008
from early 20th century.

203
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,561
Now, this scholar had
this far-fetched theory

204
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,897
about Sir Gawain, that the knight returned

205
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,900
from the Crusades not with the Holy Grail,

206
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:55,403
but with something far more valuable.

207
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,489
- The blood of Christ.
- Exactly.

208
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:00,492
Now, the paper went on to
theorize that Gawain had

209
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,777
a vial of this precious substance on him

210
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,779
up to his death and was buried with it

211
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,532
somewhere in the North of France.

212
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,417
Just somewhere in the North of France?

213
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,752
That's a big area.

214
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,671
I know, but if anyone, and I mean anyone,

215
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:15,123
knows where to start looking,

216
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,209
it's this guy.

217
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,428
"The Burden of the Purest Heart:

218
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,934
Sir Gawain's Secret
Treasure," written by...

219
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:30,855
- John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
- You're kidding.

220
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:33,558
The guy who wrote "The Hobbit"
and "The Lord of the Rings."

221
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,311
John Tolkien was in the
North of France in 1916

222
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:38,313
during the Battle of the
Somme as a Second Lieutenant

223
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:40,065
in World War I.

224
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:43,568
Well, looks like we're going back to war.

225
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,620
Temper, temper.

226
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:53,322
Don't test me, Damien!

227
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:54,990
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

228
00:10:54,992 --> 00:10:58,243
You sent me and Malcolm off
to find the Kalabros Manuscript

229
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,712
while the Legends managed to abscond

230
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:01,497
with the Spear of Destiny.

231
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,248
I should have that zombie Speedster

232
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,168
you're so afraid of eat your brain.

233
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,836
No.

234
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:11,390
No, this is actually
a positive development.

235
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:13,258
Or maybe he already has.

236
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,978
With the entire spear in
the Legends' possession,

237
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,347
we no longer have to keep
going after it piecemeal.

238
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,766
Yeah, I'm a glass half-full kind of guy...

239
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,684
The legendary idiots
won't be able to use it.

240
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,520
They'll either try to
hide it or destroy it,

241
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:29,024
and when they do, we'll be there, waiting.

242
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:31,076
- No.
- Excuse me?

243
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:32,694
Not just us.

244
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,913
I'm not sure if you're
keeping score, Eobard,

245
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,281
but we're losing.

246
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:39,701
So it's time to change the game.

247
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:49,128
All right, we gotta be careful.

248
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,380
The Battle of the Somme was
one of the bloodiest conflicts

249
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:52,681
in human history.

250
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,216
Sounds terrible. I'm in.

251
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:55,801
We're all in.

252
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:57,469
It's not gonna be easy
finding Tolkien in this mess.

253
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:59,221
According to military records,

254
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:01,640
Second Lieutenant Tolkien
contracted trench fever

255
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:03,942
and was transferred to a
first aid outpost to await

256
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,444
transportation back to Britain.

257
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:08,063
Perfect. Amaya, take the Backstreet Boys,

258
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:10,232
intercept Tolkien, find out what he knows,

259
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:11,366
send him on his way.

260
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,734
So what'd you want us to do?

261
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:14,486
Guard the spear.

262
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:16,572
Somebody has to be with
the spear at all times.

263
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,740
Indeed, now that the spear
has been reconstituted,

264
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:20,742
the stakes have never been greater.

265
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:24,246
Which is why I should stay on the ship too.

266
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,548
You okay?

267
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,250
I'm fine.

268
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,919
All right, in that case, go with the guys.

269
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,672
They could use the adult supervision.

270
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:45,984
We're at the outpost. God, it's a madhouse.

271
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,152
Fan out to cover more ground.

272
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:49,521
Stay on the coms and be careful.

273
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:51,406
Yeah, Gideon said Tolkien was ill.

274
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,742
We should search amongst the injured.

275
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:57,946
Mr. Rory, Ms. Jiwe, you go look in triage.

276
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:00,749
Let me guess. We get the fun part?

277
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,751
I've always wanted to visit the Somme.

278
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:06,622
Just without, you know,
all the warfare going on.

279
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:09,925
Amaya, any sign of Tolkien?

280
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,045
I... I don't know.

281
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,797
There's so much suffering.

282
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,350
So many injured.

283
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:27,309
Miss, please, help me.

284
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:33,115
Just try to stay still.

285
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:35,033
Let me see what we're dealing with.

286
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:37,286
Nurse, change these bandages, will you?

287
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,740
I don't want to die alone.

288
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,242
You won't.

289
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,082
Here.

290
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,755
Hey, those are for them.

291
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,169
My, my, my, how the mighty have fallen.

292
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:29,788
You said that the last time you appeared.

293
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,341
Huh, you pick a hell of a time to show up.

294
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:33,959
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

295
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:36,044
Yeah, in the middle of
being a good little doggie

296
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:39,715
to those insufferable wannabes.

297
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,017
Stay on mission, now.

298
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,885
Gotta find this hobbit guy.

299
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:46,104
J.R.R. Tolkien, why?

300
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,389
Hoping for an autograph?

301
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,057
I don't even know who that guy is.

302
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,143
All I know is I gotta find
this hobbit guy who knows

303
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,478
the guy who's buried with Jesus' blood.

304
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,732
Then we can destroy the Spear of Destiny.

305
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:59,901
Mick, Mick, Mick, when have
we ever destroyed anything

306
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:03,038
we've ever stolen, let
alone the most valuable score

307
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,039
in the universe?

308
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,291
What have they done to you?

309
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,078
How the hell are we supposed
to find anyone in here?

310
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,580
- What?
- I said, how the hell

311
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:13,048
are we sup...

312
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,167
On your feet, you
lazy good-for-nothings,

313
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,336
or I'll have you shot!

314
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,338
Did you hear me, Lieutenant?

315
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,557
- Yes, sir.
- On your feet with your weapon,

316
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,260
you fool of a Tolkien! On your feet!

317
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:28,313
Tolkien, Lieutenant Tolkien?

318
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,565
Yes, yes, that's me.

319
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:34,102
He's very ill. He's gotta come with us.

320
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:36,488
Nonsense, I... I'm perfectly fine.

321
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,490
- Whoa.
- Oh.

322
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,575
This man is burning with a fever.

323
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:41,910
We're taking him out of here now!

324
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:43,578
Well, get him to the field hospital.

325
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:47,366
Come on, you trench rats!

326
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,785
The boys have a date
with your bitter steel!

327
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:51,920
We have him, but he's
in no condition to talk.

328
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:53,872
All right, get him to the extraction point.

329
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,957
- We'll meet you there.
- Mr. Rory?

330
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,676
Steal us an ambulance, will you?

331
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:58,927
On it.

332
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,462
What happened to the man who never

333
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:02,964
took orders from anyone?

334
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,966
I respected the hell out of that guy.

335
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,636
Now you're just their trained pet.

336
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:09,137
Sit, Mick. Fetch, Mick.

337
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,440
Good boy, Mick. Woof!

338
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,642
I'm no one's... pet.

339
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:15,644
Sure you are.

340
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,612
They may act all friendly to you,

341
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:19,481
but they'll never trust you, never.

342
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,116
When the chips are
down, they'll look at you

343
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:26,121
the same way they always have: as a thug.

344
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,825
But you and me? We're partners.

345
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:33,578
At least, we were, and could be again.

346
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,881
Take the Spear of Destiny,
Mick. Use it for yourself.

347
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:37,666
- Use it for us.
- There is no us.

348
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:39,418
- You're dead.
- I don't have to be, Mick.

349
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,587
With the spear, it'd be
so easy to bring me back.

350
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,007
You're in my head. You're a...

351
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,976
you're an illumination.

352
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:51,313
- A hallucination.
- That's it.

353
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:57,602
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

354
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:09,700
I must be hallucinating.

355
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,223
Actually, we took the liberty of curing

356
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,738
your typhoid fever, Lieutenant Tolkien.

357
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,119
You.

358
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,249
I knew you weren't volunteers.

359
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,335
Your accent alone was horrendous.

360
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:20,970
I'll have you know I played Bert

361
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,422
in my middle school production
of "Mary Poppins," thank you.

362
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:26,008
Who are you, then? German?

363
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,843
Ottoman? And where on God's Earth

364
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,178
have you brought me?

365
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,980
Somewhere the less
talked about, the better,

366
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,648
- for your sake.
- But we're on your side,

367
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,933
and we need your help.

368
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,851
In your paper, "The Burden
of the Purest Heart,"

369
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,654
you described the final
resting place of Sir Gawain.

370
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,990
I never actually published
that paper... how did you...?

371
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,691
It's hard to explain,
but we need to know where

372
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:44,160
the knight is buried.

373
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,861
You abducted me from the
middle of a battlefield

374
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:47,496
to ask about an old myth?

375
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,031
There is a war on, you fools!

376
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,083
And I imagine that the
view from the trenches

377
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:52,952
is pretty bleak.

378
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,587
It looks to me like the end of the world.

379
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:56,539
But it's not. Believe me,

380
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,341
this darkness will pass.

381
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:02,011
You speak as someone who's seen the future.

382
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,213
Haven't all students of history?

383
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,514
Those who suffer heal.

384
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:07,516
Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.

385
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,719
And our towers grow a
little taller every time.

386
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,555
I should like to believe you.

387
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:15,858
Tell me, why do you
seek the grave of Gawain?

388
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,028
Eh... it's a long story.

389
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,396
I enjoy long stories.

390
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,831
Yeah, he does.

391
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,400
In short, my fellow travelers and I...

392
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:25,868
Fellowship, if you will.

393
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,654
We're on a journey to destroy an object.

394
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:32,441
One which would bring the
bearer unimaginable power.

395
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:34,994
Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?

396
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:39,164
I came across numerous obscure
references to it in my studies.

397
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,883
Of course, such a divine artifact

398
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:41,917
could never actually exist.

399
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,385
But it does.

400
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:46,639
And we need your help to end its threat.

401
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:48,974
I left all my research at Oxford.

402
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:52,228
To help you, I would need a vast library.

403
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,180
Well, lucky for you, we brought one.

404
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,192
How'd it go out there?

405
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,614
Amaya?

406
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:16,001
It was worse than any nightmare.

407
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:23,292
You've seen this before.

408
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:26,762
In World War II, it's definitely
a situation where the sequel

409
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,764
was worse than the original.

410
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,716
What changed?

411
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:35,220
I had Gideon show me the historical record.

412
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:38,107
My future.

413
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,609
How much did you see?

414
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:44,229
My village burned to the ground.

415
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:46,282
My daughter turned into a refugee.

416
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:50,619
And her daughter turned into an orphan.

417
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:56,292
Seeing the battlefield today,
it just made it so real.

418
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,577
I'm so sorry.

419
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:06,969
But, if it helps, from
what my sister told me,

420
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:10,172
despite all the pain and
suffering your granddaughter

421
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:11,674
will endure...

422
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:17,563
She turns out to be a
pretty remarkable person.

423
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:18,764
A hero.

424
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:36,365
Don't even think about it!

425
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,585
That is not a scratcher of any variety.

426
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:41,036
What happened to your face?

427
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,038
I saw Snart again.

428
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,874
More likely, you took a
nasty blow on the battlefield.

429
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,711
Perhaps you're suffering
some minor brain damage or,

430
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,713
at least, more brain damage.

431
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,431
Snart did this!

432
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,633
I believe you.

433
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,352
- You do?
- Of course not.

434
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,520
I just don't want you to hurt me.

435
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:00,389
But, given our trip to the Vanishing Point,

436
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:03,726
it would make sense that
he'd be in your thoughts.

437
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:07,062
Mick, let him go.

438
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,647
You're going to church.

439
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,232
I'm not the religious type.

440
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,234
Tolkien's located Gawain's burial place.

441
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,069
It's in a cathedral in Amiens.

442
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,371
If it's still there.

443
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,706
The war's already passed through.

444
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,991
Are you sure you're up for this?

445
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,626
Yes.

446
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:26,081
Snart, he... he's in my head, right?

447
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,390
The Church of Amiens.

448
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:37,009
Built in the 1600s, for centuries,

449
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:39,178
it was a shelter, a refuge.

450
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,064
Now just a place for
marauding armies to squat.

451
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,816
Look closely, but be careful.

452
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:45,567
Returning knights of
the Crusades were known

453
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,320
to hide their relics so only
the worthy could find them.

454
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:52,608
They set traps for those
who aren't so worthy.

455
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,942
Aw, they're so close,

456
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:56,111
finishing each others' dire warnings.

457
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:58,664
- Ha.
- Think I found something.

458
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,369
It's gotta be worth a fortune.

459
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:06,422
- Gold.
- Yeah, don't bite the relics.

460
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,957
- Give me that.
- And don't steal the relics.

461
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,260
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

462
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,128
the inscription's written in...

463
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,133
Proto-Celtic.

464
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:22,354
It says, "Follow the outlier,
then push further still."

465
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:24,223
But what is the outlier?

466
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:33,398
Three rubies, one emerald.

467
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,317
I think I found our outlier.

468
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,236
"Then push further still."

469
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,242
This structure's been
damaged from all the fighting.

470
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:54,169
Sir Gawain, I presume.

471
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:57,389
Hey, look, on his
shield, it's an engraving.

472
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:01,810
Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.

473
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:06,849
Mr. Snart?

474
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:10,235
Wait, you can see him?

475
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:11,770
You're supposed to be dead.

476
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:14,106
Yeah, they told me all about how I get soft

477
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,693
and die for you losers.
I didn't believe them.

478
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,161
Believe who?

479
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:22,030
Well, if that's not an entrance line,

480
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,032
I don't know what is.

481
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,335
What is going on here?

482
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,704
The Legion must have traveled back in time

483
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:32,374
and picked up Mr. Snart
before he joined the Legends.

484
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,209
He told us all about
your plan on how you're

485
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,044
going to destroy the spear.

486
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,880
Thanks for the tip, Mick.

487
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:41,183
I didn't think he was real.

488
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:43,802
No, no, no, no. No need to defend yourself.

489
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:45,437
Actually, there is.

490
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,522
Angriff!

491
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:49,358
Get behind me!

492
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:53,395
What is this madness?

493
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:55,948
Aah!

494
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,399
What are you?

495
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,118
Aah!

496
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,909
What are you doing? We gotta go!

497
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:08,660
Not without the engraving!

498
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:19,254
You actually care about these losers.

499
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:21,807
Mick, come on, let's go!

500
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,143
Because I guarantee they
don't care about you, Mick.

501
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:29,902
So Snart's alive.

502
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,545
And he's working with the Legion.

503
00:24:31,547 --> 00:24:33,522
Well, it's not just the Legion,

504
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:34,740
is it, Mick?

505
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,325
You got something to say to me?

506
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,611
You told him about our
plan to destroy the spear.

507
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,746
Well, I thought I was seeing things.

508
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:43,165
Whether Mr. Snart was
a hallucination or not,

509
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,952
the fact that you told him
about our plan speaks volumes.

510
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,920
Volumes of what, Professor?

511
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,923
I think what Martin is trying
to say is that he's worried

512
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,458
that, if it came down to a decision

513
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,793
between Leonard and us...

514
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,962
You would choose Snart in a heartbeat.

515
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,180
Yeah, I would. He's a friend,

516
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:01,133
and you guys ain't exactly
being friendly right now.

517
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,852
Can you blame us?

518
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:05,972
We're concerned that your
blunder with Mr. Snart

519
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:07,940
confirms that you haven't truly given up

520
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:11,477
your roots as a... thug.

521
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,946
Oh.

522
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,149
That what you think, Captain?

523
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:19,402
Mick, we just need you to be careful.

524
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:20,569
Why?

525
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:26,375
Oh, I see.

526
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:30,079
In your eyes, I'm always
gonna be a... criminal.

527
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:36,302
This is fascinating.

528
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:40,306
Apparently the spear will glow
in the presence of divine blood.

529
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,008
Yeah, and it also revealed
the message when Mick

530
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,175
lit it on fire.

531
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,927
A secret only fire can tell.

532
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:46,846
How marvelous.

533
00:25:46,848 --> 00:25:48,481
So, unless you wanna wander all over France

534
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:50,316
waiting for this thing
to light up, I suggest

535
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:51,651
we figure out this map.

536
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:56,989
You okay?

537
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,024
I'm afraid I suffer from what is known

538
00:25:58,026 --> 00:26:00,776
in the trenches as "shell shock,"

539
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,246
although some would prefer
to call it "common cowardice."

540
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:06,832
Said the guy who dodged
bullets to get a grave rubbing.

541
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,367
Give me a break.

542
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:13,039
Proof I belong in a
library, and not on a...

543
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,208
battlefield.

544
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,045
I know where we have to
go to destroy the spear.

545
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:21,380
Where?

546
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,883
The middle of hell on Earth.

547
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:36,979
You hear them too, huh?

548
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,699
I'm sorry?

549
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:41,817
The voices.

550
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:44,236
What's the spear saying to you?

551
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,956
It's not the spear. It's my mother.

552
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:49,241
Her voice, at least.

553
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:52,661
She's begging me to help our people.

554
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:56,916
To keep our family and our legacy safe.

555
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:59,668
She wants me to change my destiny.

556
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,390
Maybe the spear can do that for her.

557
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:06,258
The chance to rewrite reality.

558
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,261
Who wouldn't be tempted?

559
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:11,263
What do you hear?

560
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,267
My parents.

561
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,403
What are they saying?

562
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:21,023
"Don't play with fire, Mick."

563
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:24,276
Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.

564
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:28,655
So, it looks like our historians

565
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:30,407
have made a discovery.

566
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:32,493
According to this map, the blood of Christ

567
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:35,129
is hidden right smack in
the middle of no-man's land.

568
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,247
Great, right at the center
of the bloodiest battle

569
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,966
in human history.

570
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,834
Even if we were to make it
through the terrain unscathed,

571
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,137
there's still the issue of
the blood's precise location.

572
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,721
That's the good news.

573
00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:48,091
Just as the spear acted as
a diving rod for its pieces,

574
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,677
it glows when it's close to Jesus' blood.

575
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,931
But one cannot simply walk
into the middle of a war zone.

576
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,316
What if we convinced both
sides to stop fighting

577
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,018
long enough for us to get in there?

578
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,021
That'll never work.

579
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:02,856
But there is another way.

580
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,858
We can rewrite reality.

581
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,360
Eliminate the threat of the Legion

582
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:07,911
once and for all time.

583
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:08,946
No, we can't.

584
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,364
This is just a tool.

585
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,949
In the right hands, in our hands,

586
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,618
- we can use it for good.
- But the spear has more power

587
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,703
than any of us could possibly wield.

588
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:21,208
I know a thing or two about
wielding mystical artifacts.

589
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,676
I can control it.

590
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,178
Look, a totem is one thing,

591
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,631
but that... that is more powerful

592
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:30,050
than anything any of us have seen.

593
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:31,602
She said she can handle it.

594
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,387
Mick, not now.

595
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,356
Amaya, look, you don't know
what the spear can do to you.

596
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:39,443
Having the ability to
rewrite your own reality...

597
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:42,029
it's too much temptation for anyone.

598
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:45,649
That's why we have to do this the hard way.

599
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:51,205
All right, hard way it is.

600
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,407
I'm in.

601
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:56,460
Yeah, I'm down.

602
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:58,412
It's the right thing to do.

603
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,418
Obviously, I've been outvoted.

604
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,754
I will help you in whatever way I can.

605
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:11,091
But I think you're making a huge mistake.

606
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,222
Incoming!

607
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,640
Aah!

608
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:23,645
Coming through! Coming through!

609
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:27,166
According to this map, Jesus' blood

610
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,817
is somewhere over there.

611
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,736
The spear is sensing the blood.

612
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:33,489
We won't last five minutes out there.

613
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:35,407
It's not too late to use it.

614
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:38,794
Loser.

615
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:46,835
Commander, we may request
a moment of your time.

616
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:48,170
We are in the midst of battle.

617
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:51,390
There are no moments... Lieutenant Tolkien.

618
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,559
I was told you were
suffering from trench fever,

619
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,145
and you better be, or else
I report you as a deserter.

620
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:59,014
Captain Hunter, Royal Army Medical Corps.

621
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:02,434
Now, I can assure you that
this man is no deserter.

622
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,319
As such, we have an urgent entreaty.

623
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,737
We need you to contact German command

624
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:06,855
and request a ceasefire.

625
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:08,440
How dare you waste my time?

626
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:09,691
We're on the verge of taking Guillemont.

627
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,109
Guillemont can wait.

628
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,361
There is a greater battle at hand,

629
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:14,446
one that concerns all of humanity.

630
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,031
Both sides must lay down their arms,

631
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,867
or all shall be lost.

632
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:23,172
Sir, latest casualty report.

633
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:25,207
2,300 dead.

634
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:29,178
Nearly 8,000 wounded.

635
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,347
All has already been lost.

636
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:36,552
Mm.

637
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:41,223
Perhaps our friends on the Germans' side

638
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:43,859
are having more luck.

639
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,696
You wish for me to order our artillery

640
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:49,481
to stop shelling the enemy?

641
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:51,533
Just long enough for
us to rescue the wounded

642
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:52,818
from the battlefield.

643
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,570
And so the British can rescue theirs.

644
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:01,243
I will order our batteries to stop firing

645
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:04,713
when they stop firing on us.

646
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:07,549
It seems neither side
wants to give up the fight.

647
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:09,718
We don't have time, not
with the Legion on our tails.

648
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,669
We have to push forward.

649
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:12,554
Advance, soldiers!

650
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:15,591
Up the ladders, over the top, let's go!

651
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:19,094
The British are advancing.

652
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,396
Now's our best chance to move.

653
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,265
It's all on us now.

654
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,984
Watch each others' backs, and
we'll make it to the ship alive.

655
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,769
Understood?

656
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:50,792
Oh!

657
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:57,215
We're getting closer!

658
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:02,854
What is it with me and Nazis?

659
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:04,389
Wrong World War, Mick!

660
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:05,974
These are Huns, not Nazis!

661
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:08,527
I don't care what you wanna call them,

662
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,696
just take them out, now!

663
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:12,147
I'm on it.

664
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:30,165
_

665
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,169
We must be almost on top of it.

666
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:35,754
That way.

667
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,973
Sir, you need to understand
that this is one problem

668
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,975
that cannot be solved with violence.

669
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,595
Okay, maybe a spot of violence.

670
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,931
Well, if he's not gonna give
the order for the ceasefire,

671
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,316
we'll have to.

672
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:48,900
What frequency are we on?

673
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:50,936
Um, three megahertz.

674
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:53,405
Jax, set the Waverider
to receive the signal

675
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:57,526
and hijack all communication
on the battlefield.

676
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,361
Copy that, pumping the volume.

677
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:06,785
Attention all combatants.

678
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:09,705
May I have your attention, please?

679
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:14,426
There are casualties on the battlefield.

680
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:20,215
Brave men on both sides
who are in urgent need

681
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:22,718
of medical attention.

682
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,104
I know that the divisions
between us run deep,

683
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:29,558
that they may very well be insurmountable.

684
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,944
But I implore both of our armies

685
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:36,148
for this one moment

686
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,985
to come together as allies
and honor a ceasefire

687
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,820
so that the injured may be removed

688
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:44,489
from the field of battle.

689
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:49,795
There may come a day
when our courage fails us,

690
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:52,547
when we forsake our friendships

691
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:55,333
and break the bonds of fellowship,

692
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:59,421
but today is not that day.

693
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:02,591
And perhaps in showing our humanity...

694
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:07,846
We might just save it.

695
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,697
It worked.

696
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,617
I can't believe they fell for it.

697
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,368
Let's keep moving.

698
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,290
That's gotta be it.

699
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:59,064
Tolkien was right.

700
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,565
The legend's real.

701
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,783
It's the blood of...

702
00:35:01,785 --> 00:35:04,986
Christ, you are so predictable.

703
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:07,489
Though, I have to admit,
negotiating a ceasefire

704
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:10,075
in the middle of a World
War? Pretty impressive.

705
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:12,828
Maybe they'd like to hear our peace terms.

706
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,579
It's quite simple, really.

707
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:18,049
Hand over the spear, or we kill you.

708
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:26,097
Sorry, Captain,

709
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,775
but you've reached the end of your quest.

710
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:31,161
You're right. I'm gonna end this now.

711
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:35,115
Mick, give me the spear.

712
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:36,116
Mick.

713
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:37,240
What are you doing?

714
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:39,786
Hey, man, we're your friends.

715
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,121
I don't have friends.

716
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:44,791
But he does have partners.

717
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:48,178
So what do you say, partner?

718
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,680
Mick, you're better than this.

719
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,432
No, actually, you're not.

720
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:55,802
They may pretend to believe in
you as long as they can use you,

721
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,937
but they'll just as soon let you die,

722
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,606
same as they did me.

723
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,975
He's messing with your head, man.

724
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:03,443
Ever since I've been on that ship,

725
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:04,978
you people have been trying to change me.

726
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,113
That's not true, Mick.

727
00:36:07,115 --> 00:36:08,648
But guess what?

728
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,785
There are things about
me I wanna change too.

729
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,372
Steel up, Nate. Stop him.

730
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,490
He does, you and animal chick die,

731
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,075
but we still keep the spear.

732
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:22,495
And we're gonna make
all kinds of fun changes.

733
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:24,047
You bastard.

734
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,133
Come with me.

735
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:30,420
The spear can help us
fix your messed up future

736
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,505
and my past.

737
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,926
Never.

738
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,678
If you think we're gonna
let you walk out of here

739
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,979
- with the spear...
- You're right.

740
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,481
You know, we could use a distraction.

741
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:45,852
I hereby declare that
the armistice is over.

742
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:51,524
Get down!

743
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,415
Oh, that's just great.

744
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,083
Now we're all gonna die.

745
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:04,754
Mick, have I ever pulled a
heist without a getaway plan?

746
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,013
I wish things could've
been different, Sara.

747
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,884
Get down!

748
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:19,552
Jax, we need an extraction.

749
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,554
Go!

750
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:23,139
Copy that, I'm in bound.

751
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:32,949
Aah!

752
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,622
Ah.

753
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,310
Okay, opening the cargo bay doors.

754
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:04,931
Let's go!

755
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,435
Amaya!

756
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:13,656
Mick's gone. It's over.

757
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:25,952
We never should have set
foot on that battlefield.

758
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:28,037
We didn't have a choice.

759
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,622
That's not true.

760
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:32,342
There was a choice, and
you made the wrong one,

761
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,211
and now the Spear of Destiny,
the most powerful weapon

762
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,931
in all of history, is
in the hands of not one,

763
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,632
but four psychopaths.

764
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:42,635
- Don't forget Mr. Rory.
- That's right.

765
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:45,555
We trusted him, and he screwed us over.

766
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,191
Did we trust him?

767
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:51,277
I mean, admit it, we never really did,

768
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:52,862
and he picked up on it.

769
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:57,617
Yeah, apparently Mr.
Rory's not entirely stupid.

770
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,986
We lied to him.

771
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:00,987
Not Mick, Tolkien.

772
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,990
We told him there was hope.

773
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:07,327
That humanity will light its way, but...

774
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:11,164
we just ended up dumping
him back in the trenches.

775
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,249
We had to restore time.

776
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,918
Although I suppose it
doesn't really much matter

777
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,970
now that reality itself is threatened.

778
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:22,559
Maybe not.

779
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,847
Last time I checked, there
was not an on/off button

780
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,184
on the spear.

781
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:35,188
What if... what if they
don't know how to use it?

782
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,356
Oh.

783
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,909
I have to say, well done.

784
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,111
I've heard of your
skills as a thief before,

785
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,498
but this has taken it to a whole new level.

786
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,335
Truly masterful, getting one
of them to steal it for us.

787
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,287
He was never really one of them.

788
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,790
Were you, Mick?

789
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,209
I thought you said the
spear belonged to us.

790
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:58,344
There's plenty of power to go around.

791
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:00,463
Thanks for waiting for me.

792
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,548
Seems like I missed a few things.

793
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,633
You found the Kalabros.

794
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,885
The word of God himself.

795
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:08,888
It's like the owner's manual
for the Spear of Destiny.

796
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,640
It wasn't easy to find.

797
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,475
Now what?

798
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,147
Grab hold.

799
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,743
"B'khi-eel.
