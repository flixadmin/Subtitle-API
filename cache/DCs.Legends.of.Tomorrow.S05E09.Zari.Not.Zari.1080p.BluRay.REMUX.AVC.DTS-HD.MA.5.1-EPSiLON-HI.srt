Clotho.

Who the bloody hell is a Clotho?

26
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,029
The lead singer of your band.

Don't hurt me.

My sister should know by now
she can't outrun fate.

Wait.

35
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,364
Are we screaming because this is weird,
or because it's awesome?

36
00:02:58,388 --> 00:02:59,388
[pants] This is...

37
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:01,558
a nightmare.

38
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:03,810
How did I even get in your room?

41
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,940
I tried to wake you,

42
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,943
but you assaulted my mainframe,
repeating, "snooze."

43
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,196
All right, let's just be cool
about this, okay?

44
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,947
I still have my pajamas on,

45
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,591
- which means we didn't...
- Oh, my God.

46
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:18,657
Like, take it easy.

47
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,077
You slept-walked into my room,

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,287
which means something
must have brought you in here,

49
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:24,915
and let's not forget,
in another timeline, you and I...

50
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,726
Wait, don't start with
the "dream girl" crap.

51
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,378
I'm still trying to process
how I spent the last five hours on...

52
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,297
What is this, 200-thread count?

53
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,381
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:34,632
I gotta go.

55
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,139
- [gasps]
- You're up early.

56
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:42,682
Um, what are you doing?

57
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,853
Looks like somebody was playing
Operation with Gideon's mainframe.

58
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:48,897
Or maybe it was something.

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,666
You think they have raccoons
in the temporal zone?

60
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,401
[Gideon] Actually, Mr. Tarazi, it was...

61
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:53,484
Snooze, Gidget!

62
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,027
Hey.

63
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,530
You left this in my bedroom.

64
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,657
- Oh, wow!
- Well, looky, looky.

65
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:00,927
- We didn't hook up.
- We did not hook up.

66
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,012
It doesn't have to be a walk of shame
if you enjoyed it.

67
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:05,580
But if you're walking at all,
you didn't enjoy it enough.

68
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,082
Gross, Charlie.
[sighs]

69
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,418
Hey, B, me and Z did not do, you know...

70
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:10,877
- No.
- ...the nasty.

71
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,379
This is a judgment-free zone.

72
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:15,090
I'm not one to shame the sexual activity
of two consenting adults.

73
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,425
Shame's a good thing.

74
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,468
Keeps you from hooking up
with someone and...

75
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,304
ending up the parent
of a 16-year-old daughter.

76
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:24,891
Oh, ooh! Well...

77
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:27,602
what naughty business
have I stumbled across, then?

78
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:28,770
Uh, nothing, we...

79
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,858
We like, um,
hanging out in the hallways now...

80
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:33,941
Goodbye.

81
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,402
[chuckles]

82
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,155
Well, then, Charlie,

83
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:40,532
we, uh, have some business
to attend to, love.

84
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,826
We do, but first... whiskey.

85
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,244
All right, then.

86
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,705
[Gideon] A stiff drink
may indeed be in order.

87
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,583
I have some rather
unfortunate news for you, Charlie.

88
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:55,005
[rock song plays through headphones]

89
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,139
[Agent Sharpe] Charlie...

90
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,143
We came as soon as we heard.

91
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,022
Look, the Prognosticator's scanning
the timeline for Encore activity.

92
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:13,584
Trust me, we're going to figure out
who's responsible for this.

93
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,859
This wasn't the work of an Encore.

94
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,070
This was my sister. Atropos.

95
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,405
How can you tell?

96
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,951
"The victim was burned from the inside."

97
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:28,079
She's a god. That's her signature move.

98
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,957
Well, I'm, uh, sorry about your friends,
Charlie, but, uh,

99
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,502
your sister just fired
one hell of a warning shot.

100
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:34,585
Now we need to get back out there

101
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:36,338
and find that Loom piece
before she does.

102
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,006
Will you just piss off, John?

103
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,135
Hey, Charlie...

104
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,763
Look, I'm sorry, I've...
I've lost friends, too.

105
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,948
I know what you're going through.

106
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,766
Look, I respect your condolences,

107
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,185
but you don't have a bloody clue
what I'm going through.

108
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,107
[sighs] Well, she's right.

109
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:58,794
We're putting the hunt
for the Loom on hold.

110
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,278
And it's probably for the best.

111
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,531
With Ray gone,
we're still trying to find our feet.

112
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:03,925
It gives us time to make a game plan.

113
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,408
But we do have a game plan.

114
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:06,910
We need to get the next piece.

115
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,495
Look, John, if you want to help,

116
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,456
then look into what we're up against.
She's a god.

117
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:14,751
I don't want to take the team
into a situation we can't get out of.

118
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,545
Yeah, yeah, all right. All right.

119
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,838
I overstepped the mark, didn't I?
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,968
I am sorry, Charlie, but...

121
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:26,638

Any luck?

Clotho has taken on

Oh, this is too good to be true.

Elaborate.

My protege, Astra,

133
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:37,417
happens to know of a time-traveler
who's looking for our Loom.

134
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,004
One of his companions is a woman
who goes by "Charlie."

135
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,380
A time-traveler.

136
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,633
That's how Clotho has eluded me.

137
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:48,303
Fortunately, I can track
John Constantine.

138

Find John Constantine,
and you'll find our sister.

143
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,507
And when you do,
make it a hell of a family reunion.

144

[Sara] Gideon, the next time
John steals the Jumpship,

145
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,597
a little heads-up would be nice.

146
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:35,517
[Gideon] Thanks to Ms. Tarazi,
I'm still stuck on snooze mode.

147
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,953
Is your sister just looking for you,
or is she looking for the Loom?

148
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:38,977
Both, I reckon.

149
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,397
[sighs] We have to go after him.

That bastard is the reason I'm mortal,
I don't owe him squat.

He's going after the ring.

00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,614
You're the only one
who knows where he's headed.

154
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,321
Look, we'll be in and out.

155
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,365
Okay, fine.

156
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,576
The sooner we get going, the sooner
I can get back to drinking in peace.

00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,713
- Hmm.
- Maybe I should stay, huh?

161
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,632
Are you volunteering for Rory duty?

162
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:10,135
Ava Sharpe,
you are a better woman than I.

163
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,699
- Okay, babe, catch you on the flip side.
- [portal opens]

164
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:15,723
Stay safe.

165
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,770
[portal closes]

166
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,148
The ring's that way.

167
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,984
He couldn't have gotten too far.
Let's gear up in the Jumpship.

168
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,699
Kid's not into bears, huh?

169
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,369
She ripped its head off.

170
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,746
Yeah, I see that.

171
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,164
Well, like father, like daughter.

172
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,393
I mean, hey, you should be proud.
At least she's tough like you.

173
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,918
She said I ruined her life.

174
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,298
Now I gotta portal back
to that stupid reunion party

175
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,342
and stop myself from sleeping with Ali.

176
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

177
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,238
There are so many reasons
why that's a bad idea.

178
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,263
- Don't care.
- Stop!

179
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,766
You can't just erase
your daughter's existence, Mick.

180
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,059
There... There has to be another option.

181
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,518
What?

182
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,147
What if we go back through
the last 15 years

183
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,483
and we... And we place you
into all of her key memories?

184
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,359
Like a highlight reel?

185
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:10,570
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of
what Rip did with me,

186
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:14,073
programmed me with a bunch of memories
that added up to be a childhood.

187
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,909
It wasn't perfect,
but I turned out okay.

188
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:16,910
She's not a clone.

189
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:19,079
Ouch. Yeah, she's not a...
[grunts]

190
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,498
But she is programmable, in a sense.

191
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,707
Won't work.

192
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,707
Why?

193
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,085
I spent the first ten years
of her life in prison.

194
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,087
Right.

195
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:32,967
I have an idea.

196
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,553
[Sara sighs]

197
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,432
You sure hid this one well.

198
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,936
Didn't think I'd ever
be coming back here, did I?

199
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:45,980
Huh.

200
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,817
That's cool! It looks like
<i>Supernatural's</i> filming here.

201
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,943
Super-what?

202
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,445
You've never seen it?

203
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,366
It's this show about these
two hot brothers who fight demons.

204
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,369
I wonder if
the Winchester brothers are here.

205
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,788
- Seriously?
- Dean is my hall pass.

206
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,919
I bet you used to wild out
back in the day.

207
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,505
There was no drinking on the job.

208
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,191
It's kind of the occupational hazard

209
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:14,259
of having the fate of humanity
in your hands.

210
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,388
So you guys literally
used to weave fate?

211
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,892
I mean, it's not like it is
in the storybooks, but... yeah.

212
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,853
I spun up the threads of each life.

213
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:28,773
Old Lachesis, she measured out
how long each life got to be.

214
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,567
And then Atropos, she...

215
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,362
- So she killed...
- Everyone.

216
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:38,157
[sighs] And she bloody loved it.

217
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,289
[cat meows]

218
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,296
[meowing]

219
00:11:58,803 --> 00:11:59,803
Hello?

220
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,639
Greetings, sibling o' mine.

221
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,351
Meow?

222
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,187
You okay, Z?

223
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,898
Is this about the Nate thing?

224
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,834
I hope not, because then
I'm going to be wondering why

225
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:14,193
you just said "meow,"
and I definitely don't want to know.

226
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:15,695
I think I may be losing it.

227
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,408
And not like when I saw Tupac's hologram
at the 2044 Grammys...

228
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,245
but, like, mentally losing it.
Something is wrong with me.

229
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,331
Hey, hey! Deep breaths.

230
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,295
- [gasps]
- [exhales]

231
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,973
This is like a form of therapy
where you get to beat up your problems.

232
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,801
- [groans]
- Trust me.

233
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:40,595
[video game resumes]

234
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,027
Whoa. Did you just beat me?

235
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,948
Behrad, I don't know how
to play video games.

236
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,325
But it's like I'm being haunted
by someone who does.

237
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,952
Someone who dresses like a teenage boy

238
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:08,081
and makes me do awful things
like eat donuts and cuddle with Nate.

239
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,500
- [chimes]
- [both] Whoa.

240
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,505
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

241
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,636
Well, what have we got here?

242
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,812
Oh, what the bloody hell is that?

243
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:31,895
It's a prop.

244
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,792
Now, what did I tell you
about Loom patrol?

245
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,461
Yeah, well, we're out here, aren't we?
So let's just find the damn thing.

246
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,445
Oh, yeah, have you scanned
the woods for activity?

247
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,906
Huh? You have a plan
if Atropos shows up?

248
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,702
Well, I, uh, clipped Charlie's
shapeshifter wings, so no offense, love,

249
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,065
I think I can handle her sister.

250
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,038
Have you not heard anything
Charlie said?

251
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,748
'Cause it's not going to be that easy.

252
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:51,748
[Atropos] <i>Clotho!</i>

253
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,310
[Sara] As long as you're crashing
on my ship,

254
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,377
you're my responsibility,

255
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,380
and I say we are going back
to figure out a secure way to do this.

256
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,775
Yeah, well, that Loom is your ticket
to stopping the Encores.

257
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,799
I'm helping you out.

[Atropos] <i>You can't hide
from your family.</i>

Guys!

260
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,183
The Jumpship.

- [high-pitched ringing]
- [groans]

262
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,857
[Atropos] <i>I'm coming for you, Clotho.</i>

263
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,067
My sister...
[gasping]

264
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:20,528
She's here.

265
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,493
Ava, we need backup.

266
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,037
Ava!

267
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:31,456
Damn it. With the Jumpship gone,
the comms are down.

268
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:32,999
What, so we're stuck here?

269
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,460
The team will come
looking for us eventually.

270
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,880
And we need these
more than Sam and Dean.

271
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,882
You've walked us
right into a bloody death trap.

272
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,592
And that was my only option, all right?

273
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,361
If she gets a hand
on one piece of the Loom,

274
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,238
then she can get the next,
and then she's that much closer

275
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,555
to controlling us all.

276
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,992
And I'd bet my bottom dollar
she's out there now looking for it,

277
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,696
not standing around having a row
in the middle of the bloody forest.

278
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,103
Damn it, John.

279
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,482
The stupid thing's that way.

280
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,777
By building Heyworld,
we changed the future,

281
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,154
which caused a bifurcation
in the timeline

282
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,323
radiating from that one moment.

283
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,575
Think of it
as a historical traffic accident,

284
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,659
and you're the dent.

285
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,387
Yeah, I'm not thinking of myself
as a dent.

286
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,664
Okay, so what you think of as a haunting

287
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,500
is a temporal echo.

288
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,920
She is the you before... well, you.

289
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:22,048
Okay, let's just get something straight,
there is only one Zari Tarazi.

290
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,050
I filed a trademark.

291
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,301
Do you know what this means?

292
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,384
You were a Legend.

293
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:30,011
From what you said about the hacking,
you were probably our computer expert.

294
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,100
And the Air Totem responded to you.

295
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:33,851
You two probably shared it.

296
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,520
[both gasp] Wonder Twins!

297
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:38,481
And we probably had
a really super cute couple name,

298
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,918
just off the top of my head,
probably something like "SteelHacker."

299
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:44,445
[Behrad] The three of us probably
hung out all the time, getting stoned.

300
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,697
- [Nate] Oh, man.
- Playing ring-toss with donuts.

301
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,616
She probably helped you save the world.

302
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,159
- More than once.
- Yeah.

303
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:51,452
She sounds pretty cool, huh?

304
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,453
Yeah.

305
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:54,996
Yeah, she does.

306
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,876
We got to move faster.
She could be anywhere.

307
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,921
[Atropos] <i>Clotho, you can't escape.</i>

308
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,509
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

309
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,885
We need to keep moving, love.

<i>or your friends will die.</i>

[twig snaps]

314

Charlie?

315
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,122
- Uh-oh. Mick?
- What?

316
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,207
I think Ali was discharged
from the hospital early

317
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,001
because a taxi cab
just pulled up outside.

318
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,336
- Wait, this was supposed to be a...
- Yeah.

319
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,379
...surprise.

320
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,774
Is that what they're gonna say
at Iron Heights

321
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,425
when they find your empty cell?

322
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:49,528
What the hell are you doing here, Mick?

323
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,804
Oh, uh, hi, I'm Ava Sharpe.

324
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,598
I'm Mr. Rory's CO.

325
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,393
Yeah, I arranged for some visitation
in exchange for some information.

326
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,811
- Really?
- Yeah.

327
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:01,814
Mr. Rory's helped us bring in some
of history's most dangerous criminals.

328
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:02,814
What? I...

329
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,651
Okay, well, visiting hours are over.
Me and my baby are tired.

330
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:06,861
Right.

331
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:08,863
Wow.

332
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:11,156
Ah.

333
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:13,075
From the Victorian England time...

334
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,702
"Collection." Collection...

335
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,912
at... At Pottery Barn.

336
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:20,249
I don't know much about Victorian
England, but it's really beautiful.

337
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,336
I bet she is, too.

338
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,551
Mick, meet your daughter.

339
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:36,515
[grunts softly]

340
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,017
Lita.

341
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:40,787
Hey, how about we all get together

342
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,147
so that Lita can remember this moment
with her dad forever.

343
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,440
Yeah? Let's take a picture.

344
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:49,028
[Agent Sharpe] Aw, Mickey!

345
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,325
[grunts softly]

346
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,660
Smiles.

347
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,549
Wait a minute.
Did you break into my house?

348
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,108
[Mick] "Garima lifted the king's..."

349
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,965
"...decapitated head." [laughs]

350
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,676
Dumb bastard. [laughs]

351
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,759
You like that?

352
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,346
Daddy?

353
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,681
Ah.

354
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:19,141
Do you believe in the Tooth Fairy?

355
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,227
Yes!

356
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,148
Whoa!

357
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,989
Say, "cheese."

358
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:47,877
[grunts]

359
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,756
- [smoke alarm beeps]
- [grunts]

360
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,343
Say, "cheese."

361
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,018
Kirk, we can get you new pants.

362
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,437
- How's that for a highlight reel?
- [chuckles]

363
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,855
Pretty good.

364
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,656
Hello, Clotho.

365
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,452
Look at you.

366
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:22,204
Alone, after destroying our family.

367
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,790
Look, I didn't do it to hurt you,
all right?

368
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,752
We took care of you,
and you took everything we had.

369
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,962
People deserve to be free.

370
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,065
And what have they done
with this freedom you gave them?

371
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,257
They got women the vote.

372
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:34,633
They invented punk rock.

373
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,469
Introduced mass genocide,

374
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,096
nuclear bombs, pollution,

375
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,890
systematic incarceration.

376
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,476
- No. I didn't...
- And after all you did to help them,

377
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,977
how did they thank you?

378
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,103
[groans]

379
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,272
By locking you in prison.

380
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,611
We would never let anyone
hurt you like that, little sister.

381
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:58,908
Now, lead me to our Loom.

382
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:03,120
And perhaps, in time,
we can forgive you.

383
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,046
[Sara yells] Hey!

384
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,257
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

385
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,553
[Sara grunting]

386
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,684
John, I could use a little help!

387
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,353
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm on it. I'm on it.

388
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,605
Let's try, uh...

389
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,606
Hemlock!

390
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,233
All right, all right. Yes.

391
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,318
Toadstool.

392
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:35,902
Got it.

393
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,323
Now all I need is a little bit of...

394
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,035
Blood.

395
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,871
[groans]

396
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,628
[reciting invocation]

397
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:03,639
Go. Grab Charlie,
get the hell out of here. I'll find you.

398
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,726
[Sara] You're gonna be okay. Come on.

399
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,286
- Hey, let's wait for John here.
- John's dead, Sara.

400
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,246
Atropos doesn't let people live.

401
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,248
Come on. We've got to keep going.

402
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,041
- It's okay.
- It's not.

403
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,406
I mean, you saw what happened
back there. I'm one of them.

404
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,904
No matter what I do,
I'm never gonna be able to escape them.

405
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,965
And now I've gone and got John killed.

406
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,633
Hey, look, John always finds a way.

407
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,219
Always finds a way to do what?

408
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,597
[sighs] Oh, thank God.

409
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,890
Yeah. I'd rather not, love.

410
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:50,162
Hey, your sister,
she's a nasty piece of work,

411
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:52,396
but it takes more than
amateur knife tricks to do me in.

412
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,583
Now, let's get the hell out of here,
shall we,

413
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:57,007
before she realizes I'm not
bleeding out on the forest floor.

414
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,714
Who... are you?

415
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:20,788
[Behrad] Talking to donuts now?

416
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,051
LOL.

417
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,846
This, uh, alternate-timeline stuff's
got you really shaken up, huh?

418
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,141
Ever since Mithra came into my life,

419
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,352
I've been the center of attention.

420
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:34,230
It's weird to have to share
the spotlight.

421
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:37,191
Says the older sister
to the younger brother.

422
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,860
Right. Sorry.

423
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,864
Back to me, it's a lot to take in.

424
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,243
I mean, this other Zari sounds so...

425
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,287
smart and substantive,

426
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:54,375
like a cool third-wave
feminist superhero that you and...

427
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,419
Nate seemed to like better than me.

428
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:00,714
First off, Nate is just a sucker
for doomed romances.

429
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,878
Secondly, of course
I don't like her better than you.

430
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,593
You're my favorite Zari of all time.

431
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,554
But...

432
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,931
But?

433
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,475
You said you wanted to leave
your whole Z-Nation life behind,

434
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,352
find out what else you're capable of.

435
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:15,229
This whole situation seems like

436
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,982
a gift-wrapped opportunity
for self-exploration.

437
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,650
"Self-exploration"?

438
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,443
[gasps] I propose...

439
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,904
a totem quest.

440
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:26,865
Go into the totem,
speak to our ancestors.

441
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:30,619
Mmm-hmm.
Uh, how do I "go into the totem"?

442
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:32,329
With a little psychotropic assistance.

443
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,498
Mmm. I knew this would lead to drugs.

444
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:35,874
It's totally safe.

445
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,293
I've done it in the past

446
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,169
when I've been wrestling
with a big problem.

447
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,174
It's no crazier than talking to a donut.

448
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,137
I know that face.

449
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,823
That's the one
where you don't want to admit I'm right.

450
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,223
No, it isn't.

451
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,226
Totem-town, here we come.

452
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:00,399
[scoffs] She played me like a fiddle.

453
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,193
I almost gave her the Loom.

454
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,837
Our family knows all of our weaknesses.

455
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,670
[Charlie] I don't know.
Maybe she's right.

456
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,534
- I belong with them.
- Come on, Charlie.

457
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:13,454
Look, I'm a coward, Sara.
I can't even stand up to my own sister.

458
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,913
Hey, listen to me.

459
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,791
No one is responsible
for the family they're born into.

460
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,836
All that matters
is who they decide to be,

461
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,756
and you've decided to be brave
and big-hearted.

462
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,759
Thanks, boss.

463
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:29,928
But I am what I am.

464
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:41,106
[sighs] She's gonna love it.

465
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:50,616
- Surprise.
- What's this?

466
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,454
Nice. It's a keepsake album,

467
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,291
so I can never forget
all the times that you bailed on me.

468
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,085
Well, I was in prison.

469
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,461
Not since 2015.

470
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,466
You know, I never actually
went to homecoming.

471
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,012
I went back inside to get my purse,
and when I came back out, you were gone.

472
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,307
And I kept telling Kirk to wait because
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

473
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,017
But you had bailed...

474
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,686
like always.

475
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,398
So, keep it.

476
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:25,901
Fine.

477
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,196
Oh, and there's that patented
Mick Rory fade.

478
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,157
You know, good old Dad.
Just run away like you always do, yeah?

479
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,623
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I... [sighs]

480
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,333
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:42,952
Rory, it was a terrible idea,

482
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,712
and I never should have
suggested it, okay?

483
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:49,091
Rory... Listen to me, we can fix this.

484
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,509
- No, we can't.
- Yes, we can.

485
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,678
Look, I made a mistake
and I feel really bad,

486
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,155
but that doesn't give us the right
to keep hurting Lita

487
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,931
any more than we already have. Right?

488
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:58,475
Maybe it's not about the gifts

489
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,104
and the money
and the big birthday parties, you know?

490
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,790
I think it's time
that you go back in there

491
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,792
and do what we should have done
from the beginning.

492
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,234
Go back and kick myself in the...

493
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,069
No! No.

494
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,655
Just go tell her you're sorry.

495
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:14,825
Mmm.

496
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,368
I guess you're right.

497
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,245
No shortcuts.

498
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,673
What happened to this place?

499
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,633
Whoa.

500
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,054
[exclaims]

501
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,767
It's the crew.

502
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,520
Wait. If they're dead,
who's shooting Season 15?

503
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,124
You leave a piece of the Loom of Fate
somewhere long enough,

504
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,108
there's gonna be consequences.

505
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,461
Don't worry about it. I'll nab it.

506
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:50,861
No, John.

507
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,906
Look, this is my mess, all right?
I'll do it.

508
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,256
Look, all I got to do is run over there,

509
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,620
put my hand in that hole,
grab the ring, Bob's your uncle.

510
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,331
All right, well, then let's go
before your sister shows up.

511
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,135
[portal opens]

512
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,099
- Uh, what's going on?
- Shh!

513
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,434
Hey, girl.

514
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,186
Zari just took some Lyoga root.

515
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,522
She needs a little totem trip
to figure out her stuff.

516
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,857
Uh, Gideon, what's the status
with the away team?

517
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,109
[Gideon] The Jumpship is not responding.

518
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,820
Gideon, we talked about this.

519
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:37,032
Unsnooze, you need to tell me about
things before they happen, not after.

520
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,909
Okay, we should help them.

521
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,869
Ooh. Oh.

522
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:42,788
I feel high already.

523
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,581
Is it too late to detox?

524
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:45,749
That's the fun of drugs.

525
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,000
You can't untake them.

526
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,211
- Hmm.
- Besides, this is important.

527
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,463
Everything is going to be fine, sis.

528
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:52,547
Okay.

529
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,551
I surrender. [sighs]

530
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:09,814
Hello?

531
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,276
Ancestors?

532
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,030
Where are all the old people at?

533
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,657
Who you calling old?

534
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:33,922
So, if you're here, does that mean...
<i>Mâmân</i> and <i>Bâbâ</i>... Behrad?

535
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,259
No, B's back on the <i>Waverider.</i>
Who do you think gave me the drugs?

536
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,385
He's alive?

537
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,512
Yeah, of course. <i>Mâmân</i> and <i>Bâbâ,</i> too.

538
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:45,434
Are you okay?

539
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,395
Yeah.

540
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,439
Yeah.

541
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,900
So, why are you even asking me
about Behrad?

542
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,703
I thought this was about me and
the strange visions I've been having.

543
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,738
Wow.

544
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,490
New me came out
shockingly self-absorbed.

545
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,159
Who are you calling the new you?

546
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,994
Who even are you?

547
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,872
Well... you...

548
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:13,921
if the Legends hadn't saved the world,
and you grew up in dystopian Seattle.

549
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,006
Once the timeline crystallized,

550
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,008
you were out in the real world,

551
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,303
and I was thrown in here
with the rest of the totem bearers.

552
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,514
Wait, does that mean Nate was right?

553
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,143
[sighs] Are you a cooler me? Ugh.

554
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,104
We have a lot to talk about.

555
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,113
Hey, do carbs count
if you eat them in a totem?

556
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,240
- Nope.
- Oh.

557
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,425
[sighs] Whoa, whoa.

558
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,263
Whoa.

559
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,891
[snarling]

560
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,441
Thanks.

561
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:19,695
[growls]

562
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:31,999
Okay.

563
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,174
- [squelches]
- Ugh.

564
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:48,932
Yes.

565
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,851
I got it!

566
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,730
Charlie!

567
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,109
Sara, no.

568
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,488
No!

569
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,786
Sara, go!

570
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:14,957
[grunts]

571
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,926
You're bleeding.

572
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,344
You're mortal.

573
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:27,846
- Just like them.
- [groans]

574
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,307
Pathetic.

575
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,517
Ow! [groans]

576
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,186
Apologize...

577
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,354
and we can heal you.

578
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,232
We can restore order to this madness.

579
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,069
I like the madness.

580
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,403
Sara was right.

581
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,032
I'm no Fate...

582
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:48,950
I'm a Legend.

583
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,954
And now she's dead.
Which makes you nothing.

584
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:58,502
Ow! [groaning]

585
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,878
[gasps]

586
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,297
You'll never find the other pieces.

587
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,427
[vehicle approaching]

588
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,521
No.

589
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,275
Once again,
your humans have let you down.

590
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,569
Goodbye, little sister.

591
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,295
So, um...

592
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:45,715
how are, uh, things with Nate?

593
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,008
Mmm.

594
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,927
Um, good, you know...

595
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,138
Yeah, super. Super cool.

596
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,598
Weird to feel jealous of myself.
[chuckles]

597
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,600
Well, don't be too jealous.

598
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,436
Sorry. Are you not together?

599
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,605
He's my brother's best friend,
it would...

600
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,232
It would be weird.

601
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,693
Sorry, he and Behrad are friends?

602
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,820
They have this ridiculous handshake.

603
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,698
It's sweet.

604
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:11,783
Behrad a Legend?

605
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:13,910
I wish I could see that.

606
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,454
You must be disappointed?

607
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,708
Yeah, I was hoping Totem-town
would have a few video games.

608
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,543
No, I mean disappointed in me.

609
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:22,711
Why?

610
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:28,967
I mean, you were a superhero who wielded
a totem and saved the world. Twice.

611
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,470
I'm just a failed Cat-Chat celebrity.

612
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,142
My family's alive.

613
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,771
And you...
You actually seem like a lot of fun.

614
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,066
I'm good with it.

615
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,364
They could be anywhere out here.

616
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:52,490
Sara?

617
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,574
Charlie?

[growls]

620
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:10,842
- [Sara gasps]
- I thought you were dead.

621
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,261
Me too.

622
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,139
My sister, she's...
She's heading for the ship.

623
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:22,187
[ring chiming]

624
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,496
Uh, Ava, we have a problem.

625
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:43,208
<i>There is a very slinky lady
in a red leather pantsuit on the ship.</i>

626
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,043
Which usually I would be into,

627
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,336
but she is giving off a super,

628
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:49,214
"I want to kill you
in the worst possible way" vibe.

629
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:51,091
Oh, my God,
that must be Charlie's sister.

630
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:52,902
Listen, you need to wake up Zari
and get off the ship.

631
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:53,926
Already on it.

632
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,512
[Nate] Ava! Come quick!

633
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,642
[gasps] Oh, my God.

634
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,811
- I think he's dead.
- [Constantine coughing]

635
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,938
Don't count me out so soon, handsome.

[groans] The forest

[whispers] Zari, Zari.

639
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,286
Wake up. Wake up!

640
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,246
Zari, wake up.

[louder] Zari. Zari!

642
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:23,952
[Atropos] Where's the ring?

643
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,752
Hey...

644
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:31,089
Look, since you're Charlie's sister,
can't we just be cool about all this?

645
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,231
You two share blood.

646
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,276
She's your sister.

647
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,028
Yeah.

648
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,696
Pretty.

649
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,532
I'm taking the ring.
Whether she dies is up to you.

650
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,030
[sword unsheathes]

651
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:45,747
You don't belong here.

652
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,007
No more defying fate.

653
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,092
No!

654
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,109
Behrad!

655
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,278
- Is he...
- Get the ship in the air.

656
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,030
- She's still on the ship.
- Just do it!

657
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,546
You're not getting off this ship alive.

658
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,718
You saw my true form and survived.
What are you?

659
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:42,971
Your worst nightmare.

660
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,686
[both grunting]

661
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,879
You can't kill me.

662
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,172
I'm a god.

663
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,340
Yeah? I've faced worse.

664
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,094
Gideon, you'd better be awake, 'cause
I need you to open the doors, now.

665
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:44,282
Fate's a bitch, ain't it?

666
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,368
[screams]

667
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,965
- [Charlie] Not bad.
- [gasps]

668
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,266
Nice.

669
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,527
Come back soon.
Maybe next time bring Behrad.

670
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,737
I'd like that.

671
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:56,688
Oh, my God, guys.
I just had the most amazing experience.

672
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,981
Where's Behrad?

673
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,775
Z, um...

674
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,194
What's going on?

675
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,862
Where is...

676
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:08,700
Oh, my God.

677
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:13,204
Behrad...

678
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:15,456
Behrad...

679
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,877
[gasps] Why?

680
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:23,464
[sobs] Why? How did this happen?

681
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,174
He's dead.

682
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,842
Wait, who's dead?

683
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:08,925
Behrad.

684
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,722
You got us into this mess,
and now he's dead because of you.

685
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:15,600
Can that Loom bring him back?

686
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,060
If we get the last piece, yeah.

687
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,519
Great. Get up, let's go.

688
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:20,605
Hold on a second.
It's not that simple, all right?

689
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:23,900
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

690
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,961
This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.

691
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,403
I can handle dicey!

692
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:32,700
I can handle whatever it takes
to save my brother.

693
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,704
And until you bring him back,

694
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:41,793
I am with you every minute
of every damn day.
