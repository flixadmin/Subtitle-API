1
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:26,778
<i>Vandal Savage.</i>

2
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:30,073
<i>An evil dictator
blessed with immortality.</i>

3
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,493
<i>He has achieved what no one
in human history ever has.</i>

4
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,163
<i>He has conquered the entire planet.</i>

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,138
What's your name, son?

6
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,808
Jonas.

7
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,187
Your mother was brave.

8
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,607
Just as your father was foolish.

9
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,610
Which are you?

10
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,660
So, you take after your mother, huh?

11
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,333
Or not.

12
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:24,711
<i>Caesar.</i>

13
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:26,671
Hitler.

14
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:28,882
Per Degaton.

15
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:31,634
Rank amateurs compared to Savage.

16
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:34,846
His forces have already claimed
the lives of billions.

17
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,849
And if we possess the means
to stop him, and again,

18
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,976
do nothing,

19
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,687
then their blood is on our hands.

20
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,936
<i>As a Time Master of long standing,</i>

21
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,192
you seem to forget our responsibility

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,028
is to protect the timeline, not humanity.

23
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,072
<i>You wish to engage in the very
sort of manipulation of time</i>

24
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:54,532
<i>that we are sworn to prevent.</i>

25
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,202
And yet if we allow humanity
to perish at the hands of evil,

26
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,412
then what universe are we custodians of?

27
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,849
<i>What if, in trying
to save the world from Savage,</i>

28
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:02,874
<i>you make it vulnerable</i>

29
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,526
<i>to another, more terrible, despot?</i>

30
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,045
<i>We are not warriors, Captain Hunter.</i>

31
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:10,548
<i>- We possess no army--</i>
- And I'm not asking for one.

32
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,052
Just a single Timeship

33
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,574
and your permission to change history

34
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,098
before Vandal Savage puts an end to it.

35
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,228
I'm not appealing to you as Time Masters,

36
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,855
but as humans.

37
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,232
Please.

38
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,612
Grant me the authority to change
the timeline just this once.

39
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,258
<i>How did the council meeting go,
Captain Hunter?</i>

40
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,742
Exactly as expected, Gideon.

41
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,111
<i>So we are proceeding?</i>

42
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,245
Indeed.

43
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,771
Prepare the <i>Waverider</i> for takeoff.

44
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,081
Set a course.

45
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,085
United States, Star City, January, 2016.

46
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,546
<i>Ah. The early
second-millennium A.D.</i>

47
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,923
<i>The golden age of gasoline
engines, online pornography,</i>

48
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,571
<i>and those silly little smart phones.</i>

49
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,260
<i>What are we going to retrieve, Captain?</i>

50
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,928
Oh, not what. Who.

51
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,430
I need you to pull up some files, Gideon.

52
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,439
The eight men and women
who will be joining us

53
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,101
on our little crusade.

54
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,272
<i>You usually prefer
to work alone, Captain.</i>

55
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,274
This time, I'll need a team.

56
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,953
<i>First recruit, Dr. Raymond Palmer.</i>

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,997
<i>Also known as the Atom.</i>

58
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:25,790
This feels good.

59
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,625
Being back in the field.

60
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:28,960
Not that this is a field.

61
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,461
Ray, are you up for this?

62
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,068
<i>Uh, too late to turn back now.</i>

63
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,465
Huh. Someone removed
the central processing unit.

64
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,633
<i>Are you sure?</i>

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,469
I designed the computer's CPU,
so yeah, pretty sure.

66
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,436
Well, HIVE would only remove it
if they knew--

67
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:43,433
You had me shrink down and fly
into their secret computer lab.

68
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,685
My night's about to get
a whole lot worse, isn't it?

69
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,105
Oh, you can take them.

70
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:51,316
They have guns, you have a super-suit.

71
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,817
<i>It's time to start growing.</i>

72
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,861
This is gonna get a little rough.

73
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,999
Oh, I am not one of your adversaries.

74
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,338
<i>Next recruit.</i>

75
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>Sara Lance, former member
of the League of Assassins,</i>

76
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,551
<i>also formerly dead.</i>

77
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,078
Miss Lance. Join me for a drink?

78
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,039
I have come quite a long way to meet you.

79
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,752
<i>Firestorm. The merged superform
of one Jefferson Jackson</i>

80
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,253
<i>and Professor Martin Stein.</i>

81
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,400
<i>Caution, Jefferson.</i>

82
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,886
<i>83% of the chemicals
in this factory are combustible.</i>

83
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,013
Yeah. Tell that to Rambo.

84
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,350
<i>I thought I told you to be careful.</i>

85
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,750
What's the use of sharing my intelligence

86
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:15,775
if you won't listen?

87
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,026
Stop bossing me around

88
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,712
like I'm one of your
snot-nosed undergrads.

89
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,446
<i>- Excuse me.</i>
- Who are you?

90
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,410
<i>Kendra Saunders and Carter Hall.</i>

91
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,372
<i>The latest reincarnations
of Hawkman and Hawkgirl.</i>

92
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:30,790
Kendra!

93
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,959
You, my love, almost got us killed.

94
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,252
Thank you.

95
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,580
Your flying is still clumsy,

96
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:36,897
like a bird just out of the nest.

97
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,921
Well, maybe that's because
up until two months ago,

98
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,634
I was a barista, not some
damn winged demi-goddess.

99
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,387
Have you two
considered couples counseling?

100
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,056
I hear it's quite popular in this century.

101
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,577
<i>There seems to be an error,
Captain.</i>

102
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,437
<i>These candidates,
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory,</i>

103
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,790
<i>- are a pair of criminals.
- There's no error, Gideon.</i>

104
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,208
Drop your weapons!

105
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,942
Fry, you little piggies!

106
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,738
A minivan? Really, Snart?

107
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,575
Cops'll never hassle a dad buying diapers

108
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,118
in the middle of the night.

109
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,293
- What the...
- Watch it!

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,178
What a headache.

111
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,637
Stein?

112
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,264
The hell are you doing here?

113
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,516
I'm as ignorant as you for once.

114
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,268
Where are we?

115
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,021
Why don't you ask the dude who
knocked us out and kidnapped us?

116
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,356
British dude with a flashy thing
ring any bells?

117
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,484
The name's Rip Hunter!

118
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,486
I'm from East London. Oh.

119
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,030
And the future.

120
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,199
Nice to meet you, Rip.

121
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,718
Uh, while you were incapacitated,

122
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,535
I may have tampered with your weapons.

123
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,330
<i>I've assembled you all
because I need your help.</i>

124
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,040
The future of the world is in peril

125
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:58,044
because of a man
by the name of Vandal Savage.

126
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,839
That can't be. We destroyed him.

127
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,258
Yeah. The Green Arrow and Flash
helped us do it.

128
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:05,718
And therein lay the problem.

129
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,929
Unless you or Mr. Hall
deliver the death blow,

130
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,389
Savage can be restored
from but a single cell.

131
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,838
The hell are you talking about?

132
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,059
Vandal is immortal.

133
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,186
Kendra and I reincarnate.

134
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,562
Yeah, I've done that.

135
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,940
What the hell does this
Randall guy gotta do with us?

136
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,191
Vandal.

137
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:21,502
In the future, he will employ

138
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,170
the evil he's perfected
over his long life,

139
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,238
and the power he's amassed
throughout history,

140
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,949
to finally conquer the world.

141
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:32,036
<i>I've been tasked with assembling
an elite team to stop him.</i>

142
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,246
How?

143
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,539
To travel through time,

144
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,267
to capture Savage before he grows into

145
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,209
the monster he becomes.

146
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,919
You got the wrong guy.

147
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,713
- "Hero" ain't on my resume.
- Or mine.

148
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:45,216
I know it's difficult
for you to fathom, but where...

149
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,219
When I'm from, the year 2166,

150
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:52,890
you and everyone on this roof
aren't just considered heroes.

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,935
You're legends.

152
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,064
Legends?

153
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,485
I, uh, hate to nitpick, but doesn't
a legend have to be dead?

154
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,947
Yeah. See, uh, that's a deal-breaker
for me, so I'm gonna pass.

155
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,466
It's dangerous for any of you to know

156
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,770
too much about your own futures,

157
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,744
but I am here because
each of you, as individuals,

158
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,247
is destined for greatness.

159
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,666
I could get behind that.

160
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,920
And because if you don't follow me,

161
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:27,008
this is what is in store for
your world, 150 years from now.

162
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,777
I could've chosen any time and any place.

163
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,321
Of all the people who ever lived,

164
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,989
I chose you eight.

165
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:54,535
I certainly hope that you
won't let me and the world down.

166
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:06,547
If your answer is yes, meet me
at this address in 36 hours.

167
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,696
- I had that.
- I know.

168
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,866
And it's fun to watch you kick
and punch and skewer bad guys,

169
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,493
but I need a minute of your time.

170
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,305
I'm sure Captain Hunter will
return me to the moment I left,

171
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,514
but I thought, you know, just in case,

172
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,778
someone should know I was gone.

173
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,041
We went up against Savage.

174
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,751
He does not go down easy.

175
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,354
That's why Hunter's recruited a team.

176
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,338
A team that includes
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory.

177
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,924
So what do you know about Captain Hunter?

178
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,385
He's a Time Master from the 22nd century.

179
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,761
He's a little hard to google.

180
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,015
So you know nothing,
and yet you trust him?

181
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,393
I'm as trusting as you are cynical.

182
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,882
Oh, I'm cynical and it's difficult
for me to trust anyone.

183
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,772
But that has kept me alive.

184
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,859
I died once.

185
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,529
At least the world thought I did.

186
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,698
And you know what happened?

187
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,199
Nothing.

188
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,201
All the money, all the buildings,

189
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,287
all the inventions,

190
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,289
the world didn't care.

191
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,292
My life ultimately didn't matter.

192
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,713
Rip has given me the chance
to help save the world.

193
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,881
I have to take it.

194
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,808
Keep your head on a swivel
while you're at it.

195
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,978
Two hundred and six times.

196
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,397
Savage has killed both of us 206 times--

197
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,734
Yeah, and I'm not too eager
about making it 207.

198
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,068
So, what?

199
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,154
You just gonna run away?

200
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,156
We've tried that before.

201
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,659
Look, I know you don't remember
your past lives yet,

202
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,911
but I remember so much of it.

203
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,123
God, if you only knew
how I loved you and how much...

204
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,836
How much it hurt every time
he took you away from me.

205
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,921
Have you ever stopped to think
that maybe,

206
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,466
just maybe, we can't actually beat him?

207
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,514
But this time,
we wouldn't be facing him alone.

208
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,313
And we almost defeated him
with help before.

209
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,763
Yeah, almost.

210
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,267
Kendra, this is our best chance
to stop him forever.

211
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,664
The woman I've loved for millennia

212
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,273
wouldn't be scared of this.

213
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,861
Look.

214
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,946
Past lives, we'd fight, argue.

215
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,323
A lot.

216
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:41,118
But we'd settle matters as warriors.

217
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,622
What, like I beat you

218
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,958
and you give up this plan
to follow Hunter?

219
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,293
Yeah.

220
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,900
Except you won't be able to beat me.

221
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,005
But you can absolutely try.

222
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,967
Winner gets to decide, little lady.

223
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,645
I remember when you told Mom and Dad

224
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,647
that you wanted to go to sleepaway camp.

225
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,094
This will be a little different.

226
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,025
Time travel.

227
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,296
I can't even believe
we're talking about it

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,321
like it's something real.

229
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,531
I know.

230
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,329
I think you should go.

231
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,417
Laurel...

232
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,709
I died.

233
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,380
I'm still picking up those pieces.

234
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,925
The Lazarus Pit brought me back,

235
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,679
but it left me with this need to take,

236
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,348
to kill.

237
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,892
I'm dangerous.

238
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,355
After you died,
I needed a channel for my grief.

239
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,901
I found it in becoming the Black Canary.

240
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,862
I found it in you.

241
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,782
For me, being the Canary
was never that positive.

242
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,202
Then don't be the Canary.

243
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,073
Do what Oliver's been doing.

244
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,248
Do what this Rip Hunter

245
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,126
is offering you the chance to do and...

246
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,422
Be a hero in the light.

247
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,092
Be the White Canary.

248
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,392
Where did you get this?

249
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,562
I have a resourceful friend named Cisco.

250
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,440
Where's the mask?

251
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,735
You don't need it anymore.

252
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,654
You've lived in the shadows long enough.

253
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,261
I can't believe you're thinking
of hooking up

254
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,453
with the Englishman.

255
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,080
We're thieves, crooks, criminals.

256
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,082
I have no desire to save the world.

257
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,793
Especially 100 years after I'm dead.

258
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,670
He said across time, Mick.

259
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,589
What about the years before?

260
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,175
Before fingerprints
and surveillance cameras

261
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,344
and DNA analysis.

262
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,763
Why did we become criminals?

263
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,766
Because we hate working and we love money.

264
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,936
We could steal the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
straight off da Vinci's easel,

265
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,772
snatch the Hope diamond
before it was discovered.

266
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:19,109
This is everything we got into
thieving for in the first place.

267
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,320
More than everything.

268
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,367
You want me in, I'm in.

269
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,786
But I'm not gonna be anyone's hero.

270
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,292
Jefferson, it's imperative
we remain together

271
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,710
for our powers to work.

272
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,081
<i>In case you haven't noticed,</i>

273
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,940
I'm still getting used to
the whole powers thing,

274
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,483
and now that you're adding
time travel to the mix--

275
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,801
Do you have any idea what
an extraordinary opportunity

276
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,219
we've been given?

277
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:48,055
A chance to get murdered
by an immortal psychopath.

278
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,640
No, thanks.

279
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,352
Look, I'm a 20-year-old
auto mechanic.

280
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,647
The world is better off
without me trying to save it.

281
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,984
I don't understand your decision.

282
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,487
But I respect it.

283
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,241
Perhaps I can persuade Mr. Hunter

284
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,160
that he needs my knowledge as a physicist

285
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,330
and not my abilities as Firestorm.

286
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,667
So I propose we have a toast.

287
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,379
To my grand and solo adventure.

288
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,840
To saving the world.

289
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,883
Knock yourself out.

290
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,847
You took the words right out of my mouth.

291
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,041
<i>Professor!</i>

292
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,044
This is the place.

293
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,962
I think we're being punked.

294
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,423
- Do people still say "punked"?
- No.

295
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:07,384
I see your buddy threw himself
a going-away party.

296
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,720
Yes. I believe he drank something

297
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,555
that didn't quite agree with him.

298
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,308
You don't look too happy to be here.

299
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,393
- Perceptive.
<i>- Well.</i>

300
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,729
I see you've all decided to come.

301
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,398
Well, then we can be on our way.

302
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,400
I ain't footing it anywhere.

303
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,069
A Time Master's sacred charge

304
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,237
is to do no harm to the timeline.

305
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,244
Can you imagine
what a Timeship would look like

306
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,491
in, say, Victorian England?

307
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,078
Holographic indigenous
camouflage projection.

308
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,330
Indeed.

309
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,844
It's called the <i>Waverider.</i>

310
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,597
It's been my ship for over a decade.

311
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,934
Shall we?

312
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,608
Excuse me. Would you mind, um...

313
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:06,777
Thank you.

314
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,126
Whoa.

315
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,033
I bet it uses ionic propulsion.

316
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,131
I doubt that very much, given
that even advanced technology

317
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,883
wouldn't be able to sustain
an ionic reaction.

318
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,254
It's possible if you stabilized
the quantum flux.

319
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,280
Yeah, we actually covered
this before, Professor Stein,

320
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,473
when I was your student many moons ago.

321
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,476
Perhaps you remember my paper
on subspace field mechanics.

322
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,647
- I don't remember you, Mr. Palmer.
- Oh.

323
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,784
Whatever you roofied him with,
I'd like some.

324
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,319
I did not roofie him.

325
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,988
Oh, I ain't judging.

326
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,074
I have never seen
anything like this before.

327
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,325
Neither have I.

328
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,303
And considering I have
4,000 years worth of memories,

329
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,412
that's saying something.

330
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,331
How does a vessel of this size
function without a crew?

331
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,584
I don't need one. I have Gideon.

332
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,918
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

333
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,255
<i>I am Gideon, an interactive
artificial consciousness</i>

334
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,091
<i>programmed to operate
this vessel's critical systems</i>

335
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,010
<i>and aid Captain Hunter in his mission.</i>

336
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,219
"Captain"?

337
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,680
Gideon's been working on
helping me locate Vandal Savage.

338
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,159
I thought you said he's pretty
active in the 22nd century.

339
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,161
Perhaps engaging Savage
at the height of his powers

340
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,186
isn't the best stratagem.

341
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>Indeed.</i>

342
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,331
Unfortunately, Savage has kept
his movements

343
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,440
hidden throughout history.

344
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,193
Not even Gideon can determine
where or when we can find him.

345
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,904
But I have the next best thing.

346
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,031
The man who can.

347
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,617
Professor Aldus Boardman.

348
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,952
Now, Professor Boardman
is the world's leading, well,

349
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,121
<i>only expert on Vandal Savage.</i>

350
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,891
We're going to pay him a little visit.

351
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,542
<i>Course plotted for St. Roch,
New Orleans.</i>

352
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,046
- St. Roch?
<i>- October 17, 1975.</i>

353
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,465
I suggest you all strap yourselves in.

354
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,026
Temporal navigation isn't something

355
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,344
one wants to be standing up for.

356
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,352
Time travel.

357
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,561
Cool.

358
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,372
Some of you may experience
some slight discomfort.

359
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,898
In very rare instances, there will be

360
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,983
some, uh, bleeding from the eyeballs.

361
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm sorry, what?

362
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,782
The human body is used to
time unfolding linearly.

363
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,168
Oh, Jax, I'm so glad you're awake.

364
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,711
I didn't want you to miss this.

365
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,046
Miss what?

366
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,008
What the...

367
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,778
I wouldn't unfasten those if I were you.

368
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,513
Get me off this... Whatever this thing is!

369
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,181
Good luck explaining this.

370
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,683
I did him a favor.

371
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,560
He doesn't look all that grateful.

372
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,145
Just hang on and remain calm.

373
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,109
All of your worlds are about to change.

374
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,786
Whoa.

375
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,246
Seriously.

376
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,415
That was insanity.

377
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,632
Whoa. That is some serious
Darth Vader going on there.

378
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,217
<i>Chronos to Command.</i>

379
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,636
<i>I am closing in
on Captain Hunter's position.</i>

380
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,096
Hey, what you doing there, bro?

381
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,099
<i>I am determining whether you are
integral to the timeline.</i>

382
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,434
Okay.

383
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,269
<i>You are not.</i>

384
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,934
Oh, I should have mentioned it before,

385
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,398
nausea is one of the side effects
of time travel, along with--

386
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,338
<i>Vertigo.</i>

387
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,590
- I can't see.
- And temporary blindness.

388
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,958
It should only last a minute.

389
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,593
After all, that was a mere jaunt.

390
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,113
The further back in time you go,
the worse the side effects.

391
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,281
- Better?
- It's all relative.

392
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,473
Good.

393
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,643
I can't believe you kidnapped me.

394
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,895
Hey. I want to go home.

395
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,731
Good news, then.
2016 will be around in, uh, 41 years.

396
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,941
Now, you three, feel free

397
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,668
to make yourselves comfortable
back here on the ship,

398
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,128
while the rest of you are coming with me

399
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,232
to find Professor Boardman.

400
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,114
You're benching us?

402
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,366
I thought we were a team.

403
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,118
This mission doesn't require
your particular skill-set. Yet.

404
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,746
Meaning, you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

405
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,997
Precisely.

406
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,683
Sure it's a good idea to
leave these two unsupervised

407
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,792
on a time machine?

408
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,126
<i>Hey, haircut.</i>

409
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,128
Deafness wasn't one of the side effects.

410
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,773
We better hurry up. Professor Boardman

411
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,037
will die in less than 24 hours.

412
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,525
What's the point of cutting it so close?

413
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,789
Because if he's destined to die

414
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,762
then he doesn't have a timeline
for us to disrupt

415
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,097
and his impact on the future
will be minimal.

416
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,348
How brilliant.

417
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,683
And depressing.

418
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,101
How does he die?

419
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,020
He's found dead in his
university from unknown causes.

420
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,230
Come on.

421
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,565
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay put.

422
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,985
You'd rather stay with them?

423
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,361
They didn't drug me.

424
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,654
Point taken.

425
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:05,450
This is unbelievable. 1975.

426
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,411
Imagine all the wondrous applications

427
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,870
for this technology.

428
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,331
A chance to witness the
construction of the pyramids,

429
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,000
the end of the dinosaurs.

430
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,002
I've never been to 1975.

431
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,461
It's rather colorful.

432
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,964
So, where can we find Professor Boardman?

433
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,716
In his lecture hall.

434
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,633
<i>Oh, no, we're too late.</i>

435
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,356
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,527
You.

437
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,821
<i>Both of you.</i>

438
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,114
You know who we are?

439
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,409
I've been studying you my whole life.

440
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,829
Ever since, as a child,
I first heard the story

441
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,915
of Chay-Ara High Priestess
of Horus, the Hawk God,

442
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,209
<i>and her lover, Prince Khufu.</i>

443
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,254
I hoped and prayed this day might come.

444
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,841
Well, it looks like
we've come to the right place.

445
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,259
I'm sorry. Who are you?

446
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,053
A fellow historian,

447
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,472
here to discuss another passion of yours.

448
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,474
Vandal Savage.

449
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,852
There's no way of telling your story

450
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,896
without telling his also.

451
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,113
Why does this stupid station
play nothing but re-runs?

452
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,199
Don't even bother trying to explain.

453
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,700
Am I the only one on this ship

454
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,285
who could really use a drink?

455
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,954
I say, we go get weird in the '70s.

456
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,623
Excellent idea.

457
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,500
I got the perfect outfit.

458
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,974
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
was unclear</i>

459
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,129
<i>with his instructions to remain onboard?</i>

460
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,006
- Shut it, metal-mouth.
- Ooh.

461
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,300
You're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

462
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,635
Sorry, kid.

463
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,279
Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?

464
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,180
<i>I said I'd take care of you.</i>

465
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,809
Four thousand years ago,

466
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,561
Vandal Savage was an Egyptian priest,

467
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,814
secretly in love with a priestess.

468
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,690
You.

469
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,361
Or rather, you in your first life.

470
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,532
<i>But you were in love with another.</i>

471
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,784
<i>Prince Khufu.</i>

472
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,830
<i>Savage, or Hath-Set, as he was then known,</i>

473
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,542
<i>learned of the affair and
was consumed with jealous rage.</i>

474
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,710
You believe me yet?

475
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,130
<i>Which drove him to murder you both.</i>

476
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,678
<i>And prayed for the Hawk God, Horus,</i>

477
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,556
<i>to damn the objects of his hate
for all eternity.</i>

478
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,102
But Chay-Ara had a prayer of her own.

479
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,521
That Horus would protect them forever.

480
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,607
But another life was
bound to theirs by accident.

481
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,817
Savage's.

482
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,694
That's why he wants us both dead.

483
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,262
My theory is that the three of you

484
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,781
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

485
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,283
We all share the same power.

486
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,368
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

487
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,495
That's what maintains his immortality.

488
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,955
That's impossible.

489
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,457
Unless the meteorites contained
a mutative element,

490
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,394
like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

491
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,419
But without evidence.

492
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,063
You're asking us to take you at your word.

493
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,088
<i>It's not my word.</i>

494
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,548
It's theirs.

495
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,384
But you still don't remember me, do you?

496
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,346
We knew you in our past lives?

497
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,018
You've told me your entire story,

498
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,895
stretching back through the ages.

499
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:24,065
But when I first knew you,
it was after World War I.

500
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,194
And your names were Joe and Edith.

501
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,196
Edith Boardman.

502
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,532
Wait, we were related?

503
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,661
I don't remember you.

504
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,121
I'm so sorry.

505
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,623
Don't be.

506
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,874
You always warned me,

507
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,251
that if I ran into you in your next life,

508
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,545
you might have forgotten me.

509
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,589
That's us.

510
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,258
At the world's fair.

511
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,432
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

512
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,104
Mother.

513
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,448
How old were you when...

514
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,575
You two were murdered?

515
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,452
Ten.

516
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,122
<i>My whole life, you taught me
to be careful, keep moving</i>

517
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,124
always one step ahead of Savage.

518
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,962
But after tracking you for
4,000 years, he'd gotten good.

519
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,297
He found us in the middle of the night,

520
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,175
at a fleabag motel in North Carolina.

521
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,135
You hid me in the closet,

522
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:38,932
made me promise that no matter
what I heard, I'd stay put.

523
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,768
And I did.

524
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,480
Sorry to interrupt your family time,

525
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,129
but we were hoping you could tell us

526
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,390
a bit more where to locate
Savage's present whereabouts.

527
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,115
He hides in the shadows,

528
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,701
never drawing too much attention.

529
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:02,330
But every lifetime placing
himself near the seat of power,

530
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,708
sowing seeds of destruction.

531
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,669
<i>Who remembers the name of the man</i>

532
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,755
who whispered in the ear
of Gavrilo Princip,

533
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,883
and convinced him to start World War I?

534
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,195
But why? What does he get out of that?

535
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,346
The more the world is focused
on destroying itself,

536
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,516
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

537
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:25,228
With the ultimate goal of
subjugating the entire planet.

538
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,399
He killed your parents,
Professor Boardman.

539
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,903
Something tells me you know
where to locate Vandal Savage.

540
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,907
I have an educated guess.

541
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,707
Ah, dollar beers?

542
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,751
You got to love the '70s.

543
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,837
Who wants to listen to
some Captain & Tennille?

544
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,881
My mother played it.

545
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,257
A lot.

546
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,349
Wow. You guys are really far out.

547
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,517
You wanna dance, Leonard?

548
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,019
You go right ahead.

549
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,562
I'll watch.

550
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,689
Suit yourself.

551
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,408
Can I help you?

552
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,411
How about you join me in the parking lot?

553
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,247
Mmm. Tempting. But you're not my type.

554
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,459
But your lady on the other hand,

555
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,629
<i>she looks just my speed.</i>

556
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,591
Maybe you didn't understand
my request, bitch.

557
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,637
Son of a...

558
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,138
I got this.

559
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,324
Now I could stand for a little help.

560
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,342
I love the '70s.

561
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,223
Gideon? That is your name, right?

562
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,599
<i>How may I help you?</i>

563
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,936
I assume this ship has
an auto-pilot or something?

564
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,305
<i>You assume correctly.</i>

565
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,314
Great. In that case, I'm gonna need you

566
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,442
to take me back to 2016.

567
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,902
See, me being here,
it's all a big mistake.

568
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,238
<i>Captain Hunter told me
you'd try to do this.</i>

569
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,657
<i>And he also told me not to
listen to anything you say.</i>

570
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,118
Whoa. You are a computer!
You have to listen to me!

571
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,006
<i>You seem overwrought, Mr. Jackson.</i>

572
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,305
<i>If you'd like to go to the MedBay,</i>

573
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,969
<i>I'd be happy to prescribe you a sedative.</i>

574
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,000
I do not need another roofie!

575
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,334
Whoa!

576
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,086
What was that?

577
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,375
<i>A thermite grenade.</i>

578
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,304
<i>It seems someone is trying
to breach the hull.</i>

579
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,010
<i>His name is Chronos.</i>

580
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,345
<i>He's a temporal bounty hunter.</i>

581
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,807
<i>The ship is taking heavy fire.</i>

582
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,727
I know! Aren't we supposed to be
invisible or something?

583
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,480
You need to get us out of here, now!

584
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:15,648
A lifetime of research on Vandal Savage

585
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,275
that all points in this direction.

586
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:18,943
This should help you find him.

587
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,779
And the vengeance that
has eluded me all these years.

588
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,865
Jefferson. Something is
happening to Jefferson.

589
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,342
We seem to have a little problem

590
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,702
back at the, uh, vessel.
There's an intruder.

591
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,031
We really must be going now.

592
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,663
Thank you for everything.

593
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,999
Wait. We can't just leave him here.

594
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,667
We have to get back now.

595
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,045
You said he's going to die in 24 hours.

596
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,254
And we can stop it--

597
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,006
Are either of you a Time Master?

598
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,257
I didn't think so.

599
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,718
I've spent years studying the implications

600
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,053
of chronological alteration.

601
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,846
Good for you.

602
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:50,433
But we're not going anywhere
unless our son's coming with us.

603
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,648
Why is Chronos attacking us?

604
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,376
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter is best
suited to answer that query.</i>

605
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,860
Fire photon torpedoes or something!

606
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,713
<i>Only Captain Hunter
is authorized--</i>

607
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:03,905
Where is Captain Hunter?

608
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,573
Dr. Palmer, please tell me...

609
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,492
I didn't leave my exo-suit on the ship?

610
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,077
Okay, but I'd be lying.

611
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,720
Who the hell is this guy?

612
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:38,940
Is that a laser gun?

613
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,760
I gotta get back to the ship
and bond with Jefferson.

614
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:50,785
Cover me!

615
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,120
Cover me, too.

616
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,587
Oh, you crazy old man.

617
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,719
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

618
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,345
Seriously? It's Dr. Palmer.

619
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,098
Get down!

620
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,600
Ah!

621
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:14,976
We need to merge!

622
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,278
We go out for one lousy drink

623
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,448
and you guys somehow manage
to pick a fight with Boba Fett.

624
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,385
- Aldus.
- We'll get you out of here.

625
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,372
<i>Professor Boardman has
sustained severe internal injuries.</i>

626
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,957
Prepare the MedBay
to receive Professor Boardman

627
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,149
and get us out of here.

628
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,318
<i>- Course heading?</i>
- Anywhere but here!

629
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,133
<i>Our cloaking shield
and aft entrance</i>

630
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,008
<i>have been significantly
compromised, Captain.</i>

631
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,669
Yes, I can see that, Gideon.

632
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,171
Station us in the temporal zone
while I work on repairs.

633
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,591
- Temporal zone?
- It's essentially a, uh, time limbo.

634
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,038
We can hide out there for a bit.

635
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,321
Another temporal jump would
risk revealing our position.

636
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,930
A time limbo. Astonishing.

637
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,240
Well, there's something you people

638
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,424
don't know about time travel.

639
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,993
Surprising, isn't it,
considering none of you

640
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,268
have ever time traveled before.

641
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:42,188
Bringing a family member
from the past onto a Timeship.

642
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,482
Breaking out
and carousing around the 1970s.

643
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,611
We've barely begun
and already this is the worst,

644
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,112
unmitigated disaster of my career.

645
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,960
I see why you've got the hots
for that one.

646
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,702
My son is hurt because of you.

647
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:57,453
Who attacked us?

648
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:00,206
That's something of a long story.

649
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,791
Better tell it fast, Rip.

650
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,877
'Cause it doesn't look like
the lady's in a patient mood.

651
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,629
And neither am I.

652
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,048
His name is Chronos.

653
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,135
He works for the Council of Time Masters.

654
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,889
My former employers.

655
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,809
I thought you were a Time Master.

656
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,228
As I've expressed,
time's not a linear thing.

657
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,564
At some point, I was, in fact,
a Time Master.

658
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,483
Will you people please stop hitting me?

659
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,152
Start telling the truth.

660
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,667
I relinquished my position
as a Time Master

661
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,866
when I commandeered the <i>Waverider.</i>

662
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,674
Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.

663
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,370
- You lied to us.
- Of course I lied to you.

664
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,873
I needed your help and you
all barely said yes as it was.

665
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,167
What about the legends part?

666
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,336
You lied about that, too, didn't you?

667
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,049
I chose you all
because 100 years from now,

668
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,094
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

669
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:00,516
I needed your help without
disturbing the history of 2166.

670
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,187
So we're like the opposite of legends.

671
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,025
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't kill you.

672
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,027
Ditto the arsonist.

673
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,755
Because Gideon wouldn't listen
to your commands

674
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,197
and you'd be stuck here forever.

675
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,008
<i>Great. So, we're not
an elite team of heroes</i>

676
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,116
<i>on a sanctioned mission</i>

677
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,406
sent to rid the future
of its most horrific bad guy.

678
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,412
Just a collection of nobodies

679
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,301
who time really doesn't give a damn about.

680
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,875
I didn't lie about the mission itself.

681
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,795
Or the brutality
and ruthlessness of Savage.

682
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,130
Or my need for your help.

683
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,633
<i>I don't imagine you're the kind
of guy who quits his job</i>

684
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,636
and takes on this kind of threat
for altruistic reasons.

685
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,055
So, Rip, why don't you tell us,

686
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,641
what did Vandal Savage do to you?

687
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:47,396
The Time Masters discourage marriage.

688
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,941
They urge against procreation even more.

689
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,152
A Time Master should be free
of any personal entanglements

690
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,404
that might compromise him.

691
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,326
But I fell in love.

692
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,912
And we had a child.

693
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,082
A boy.

694
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,251
Jonas.

695
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,284
Savage killed your family.

696
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,452
He slaughtered my family.

697
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,289
And thousands of other families.

698
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,958
And the body that I swore an oath to serve

699
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,710
turned a blind eye.

700
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,880
<i>They continue to turn a blind eye.</i>

701
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:56,132
I won't.

702
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,551
<i>The last thing that
my child saw in this world</i>

703
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,969
<i>was that monster's face.</i>

704
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,014
You can be damn well sure
that when Savage dies,

705
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,807
the last face he sees will be mine.

706
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,369
<i>I understand, given the circumstances,</i>

707
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,519
<i>if you wish to return home.</i>

708
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,488
We can make a jump
once the repairs are done,

709
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,648
if and when
Professor Boardman stabilizes.

710
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,490
I think we all need a little time

711
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,409
to consider our options.

712
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,174
Just get some rest.

713
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,179
There's something I wanted you to have.

714
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,390
It's around my neck.

715
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,194
It was my mother's.

716
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,030
Yours.

717
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,241
It's beautiful.

718
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,412
I remember it.

719
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,767
Thank you.

720
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,437
Rip wouldn't have allowed me

721
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,082
to bring Aldus onboard if you hadn't--

722
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:36,399
Of course.

723
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,569
Chay-Ara.

724
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,573
Sorry, Kendra.

725
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,576
No. It's okay.

726
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,246
Chay-Ara is fine.

727
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,509
It seems an apology is in order.

728
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,927
<i>What I did was wrong.</i>

729
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,346
I should never have forced you
to come along,

730
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:11,767
but for me, the opportunity
to travel through time,

731
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,604
see the mysteries
of the universe revealed,

732
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,441
notions I've spent my whole life studying.

733
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,689
Please do not geek out
on quantum physics right now.

734
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,779
Mr. Hunter was offering grand adventure.

735
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,149
And at my age, you never know

736
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,992
how many adventures you have left.

737
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,785
Hey.

738
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,954
I saw your 40-yard dash onto the ship

739
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,956
with that Chronos guy shooting at you.

740
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,625
I think you got plenty of adventures left.

741
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,129
Yes. Perhaps you're right.

742
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,798
Back home, as Firestorm.

743
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,303
And what if I don't want
to go home? Yet, I mean.

744
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,971
Why the change of heart?

745
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,141
You ever play football?

746
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,144
Yeah, I didn't think so.

747
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,188
Anyway...

748
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,233
The best feeling I ever got
from being on the field wasn't

749
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,320
when I made a great play,
or we won some game.

750
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,906
It was when one of my teammates
took a tackle for me,

751
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,700
and I knew they were
gonna make sure I was safe,

752
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:11,827
<i>that nobody got to me.</i>

753
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,164
Watching all of you rush back
to this ship,

754
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,667
even those two knuckleheads,
to take on Chronos,

755
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,670
made me feel the same way.

756
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,840
I like being part of a team, man.

757
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,719
Me, too.

758
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:35,351
Watch it!

759
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,685
Sorry.

760
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,521
Sorry.

761
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,693
What's the point of us even
giving this a second thought?

762
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:46,671
<i>Rip has already seen the future,</i>

763
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,031
he knows exactly
what's in store for each of us.

764
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,243
Might as well have stayed dead.

765
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,370
'Cause the world doesn't need any of us.

766
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,539
You're just a lost assassin,

767
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,041
you're just a pair
of good-for-nothing criminals.

768
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,709
I can live with that.

769
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,545
Well, I can't.

770
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:06,465
I can't live with somebody
putting a cap on my destiny.

771
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,219
<i>I've spent my whole life
working to be something greater</i>

772
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,555
by becoming something smaller.

773
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,196
And then some guy comes along
and tells me

774
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:19,270
that being the Atom is as
insignificant as an actual atom.

775
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,231
That's not what he said.

776
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:27,736
Rip said that in his future,
we're nobodies.

777
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,448
But this mission
is about changing the future.

778
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,327
<i>If we have the power to change the world,</i>

779
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:36,888
don't you think we have the power

780
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,247
to change our own fate?

781
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,585
For better or for worse.

782
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:45,421
That's a very good point.

783
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:51,510
What do you think, Gideon?

784
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,596
<i>I calculate
a less than 6% likelihood</i>

785
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,442
<i>that they decide to go on
with the mission.</i>

786
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:56,682
I meant about the repairs.

787
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,743
<i>And there has been another
unfortunate consequence</i>

788
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,852
<i>of Chronos' attack.</i>

789
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:02,271
<i>- Care to hear about it?</i>
- Not really.

790
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,647
He's gone.

791
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:08,110
Our son.

792
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,946
Or our son from a previous life.

793
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,282
It's all too confusing.

794
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,035
I'm very sorry.

795
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,787
Actually, you don't get
the blame for this.

796
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,623
This was my fault.

797
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,601
If I hadn't insisted
on bringing him back here,

798
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,959
he might've died peacefully.

799
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,377
In his sleep, maybe.

800
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,379
Don't torture yourself
with recriminations.

801
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,940
One of the great lessons
of time travel is that

802
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:30,299
many things cannot be changed.

803
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:31,800
Time wants to happen.

804
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:35,137
Chronos, even Vandal,
won't be the only enemy we face.

805
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,973
Very often, it will be time itself.

806
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,393
Whether it wants to happen
or not, we're gonna change time,

807
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:42,645
erase Savage's future

808
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:44,813
and earn our rightful place in history.

809
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,148
Dr. Palmer is correct.

810
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,567
We may not be legends
in your time, Captain,

811
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,320
but we are going to decide our own fates.

812
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,073
<i>I don't give a damn about being a legend,</i>

813
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,909
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

814
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,994
I can get down with that.

815
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,205
And our malcontents?

816
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:02,831
I like killing people.

817
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,668
We're in. For now.

818
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,171
So how do we find this guy?

819
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:12,007
Professor Boardman
had a theory about that.

820
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,343
I've already had Gideon plot a course.

821
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,231
Do you know what this is?

822
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:31,860
An instrument to
make this world a better place.

823
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,197
History teaches us
that the cause of humanity

824
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:38,033
is only advanced through strife.

825
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,912
There is no Renaissance
without the Dark Ages.

826
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:47,042
Man had no interest in splitting
the atom until World War II.

827
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,384
I am just trying to make
this world a better place,

828
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:58,721
one war at a time.

829
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,293
