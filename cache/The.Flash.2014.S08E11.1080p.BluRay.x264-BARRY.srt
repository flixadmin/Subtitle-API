1
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,156
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry. I should...

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,640
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Snow?

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,035
Yes. Thank goodness they finally
sent someone to fix the sink.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,435
It's been leaking for weeks.

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,246
Yeah. I don't know anything
about a sink.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,439
I was hoping that you could fix that.

7
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,816
Oh! Uh, yes, yes, of course.

8
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,693
Have a seat on the bed.

9
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,110
Thank you.

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,821
I'm normally really careful,

11
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,950
but, uh, Dr. Wells has this thing
about deadlines and...

12
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,033
Ah.

13
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,513
I guess I was pushing things a little.

14
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,330
How does it look, doc?

15
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:40,166
Uh... it's not so bad.

16
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,670
Probably just a superficial
second degree burn.

17
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,129
I think you'll be okay.

18
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,091
I know what you mean
about Dr. Wells, though.

19
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,843
But... He's brilliant.

20
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:54,097
So, uh, how did this happen?

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,809
I was fitting a high pressure coil
down in The Pipeline and, uh...

22
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,686
Well, you'd think
that a structural engineer

23
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,272
would know not to touch one
without protection but...

24
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:04,816
- Sorry.
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

25
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,651
It's fine. It's fine. Doesn't even hurt.

26
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,153
I'm fine. Mm, it's fine.

27
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,237
Mm.

28
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:12,800
What do you think? Am I going to live?

29
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,117
I think so.

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,286
So, um...

31
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,705
What's it like in The Pipeline?

32
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,000
I mean, working inside it.

33
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,544
On it? Sorry.

34
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,589
It just... It must be incredible
to wake up every morning

35
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,340
knowing that you're building something

36
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:33,303
that's gonna change the course
of scientific discovery for generations.

37
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,596
Yeah. I'm...

38
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,449
I mean, I guess I never really
thought of it that way. I just...

39
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,100
I just build things.

40
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,311
Ridiculously complicated things,
mind you.

41
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,854
But at the end of the day,

42
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,732
it's kinda like I'm a big kid.

43
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:50,028
Instead of LEGOs,
I'm using concrete and steel.

44
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,823
I used to love those things
when I was a little girl.

45
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:54,991
Yeah, me, too.

46
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,452
I mean, not when I was a little...
little girl.

47
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,329
You're right.

48
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,456
And what we're doing down there, um...

49
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,723
Being a part of it is really incredible.

50
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,211
I guess that makes us all
kind of special.

51
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,633
Well, I think you're good to go.

52
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,427
Good as new, thank you.

53
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,639
- Dr. Snow...
- It's Caitlin.

54
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,643
Caitlin, nice to meet you.

55
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:22,684
I'm Ronnie.

56
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:23,853
Nice to meet you, Ronnie.

57
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,067
Come back anytime.

58
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,888
It's nice to know that
you'll always be there to fix me up.

59
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:35,447
<i>It's nice to know that</i>

60
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,618
<i>you'll always be there
to fix me up.</i>

61
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,621
Ronnie? How's it possible?

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,124
<i>Join me. Help us... Come together.</i>

63
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,210
Together? I don't understand.

64
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:51,214
<i>Not whole without you...
You save us...</i>

65
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,715
How?

66
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,010
<i>Memories in the snow...</i>

67
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,137
Ronnie, wait, please.

68
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,931
Tell me how to save you.

69
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,958
Oh, my God. What did I do?

70
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,459
What happened to my mom?

71
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,128
Iris?

72
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,421
Where's my mom?

73
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:32,754
I don't know.

74
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,341
Just tell me what happened!

75
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,950
Okay, you need to back up right now.

76
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,303
What is wrong with her?

77
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,306
She has a...
It's a condition, okay?

78
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,808
It's really hard to explain.

79
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,645
But basically, when it flares up
like it is right now, she loses time.

80
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,373
It's not her fault.
She can't control what happens next.

81
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,441
No, you're lying to me.
She attacked my mom.

82
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,900
Tinya, I am so sorry.

83
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,193
I'm calling Barry.

84
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:59,615
What the hell?

85
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,954
You need to get out of here.

86
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,038
Now!

87
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,294
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

88
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,177
Colin Smith, Megan Landa,
Veronica Binning.

89
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:23,598
These are potential victims that
Cecile and I got from Kramer's files.

90
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,310
They all were killed in a fire
of undetermined origin

91
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:28,519
in the last six months.

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,898
That's way before the deaths
of Stan Mullen and our other vics.

93
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:32,981
We know.

94
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:36,027
Which is why I reached out to
the families of all of our new victims

95
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,488
to find out
if any of them were dealing with grief.

96
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,366
Now, Megan and Colin
both recently lost a parent,

97
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,703
and Veronica has a sister
who died when they were kids.

98
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,753
Looks like our not-so-friendly fire
has been snacking on people's grief

99
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,333
a lot longer than we thought.

100
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,001
It's been ahead of us all along.

101
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,293
Not anymore.

102
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,296
Now we have a way
to stop it from killing.

103
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,174
Yeah, I finished encoding
the Cold Fusion Sphere

104
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,511
with Frost and Dr. Tannhauser's
cryokinetic RNA signatures.

105
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,221
Next time there's a barometric anomaly,

106
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,266
we can bring it out into the field and,
you know, use it to capture this thing.

107
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,685
I just wish we knew
where it was going to pop up next.

108
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:13,022
There's got to be something we're still
missing that links all the victims.

109
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:17,276
- We find that connection...
- We can figure out what this fire wants.

110
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,693
It wants me.

111
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,365
And I know that because I just saw it.

112
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,115
But why?

113
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,785
What does it want with you?

114
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,204
Parker?

115
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,324
Wait, you know her?

116
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,209
Yeah, she's my yoga instructor.

117
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,086
You recognize anyone else?

118
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,503
Um...

119
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,047
These two.

120
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,218
They were at O'Shaughnessy's the night
Frost and I went on our double date,

121
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,679
and I recognize them as well.

122
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,099
Oh, we were all at
a biochem conference together.

123
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,102
We were panelists
on an applied sciences lecture.

124
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,605
It's been looking for me
this whole time.

125
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:58,526
That still doesn't explain
why the fire's coming after you.

126
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,780
Because the fire is Ronnie.

127
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,824
And he wants me to save him.

128
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:18,129
I know how this sounds,
but it spoke to me.

129
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:22,174
It was confused and jumbled,
but it was him.

130
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:23,592
It was Ronnie.

131
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,094
Caitlin, this fire...

132
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:28,055
You know,
it can get inside people's heads,

133
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,392
show you people you've lost,
like it did with Chester's dad.

134
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,980
Are you sure it didn't just
want you to think it was Ronnie?

135
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,690
I wasn't sure at first,

136
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:42,445
but that's why I downloaded the data
from when the fire was in the MCCU.

137
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,531
This is cold fusion radiation.

138
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,326
But these readings
are 10 to the negative 28th watts.

139
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,912
That's Hawking radiation.

140
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,457
You can only pick up rads like that
from inside a Singularity.

141
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,876
Ronnie died in a Singularity.

142
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,047
On our wedding day.

143
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,648
The only way to close it was to merge
the inner and outer horizons.

144
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:10,598
Right. Ronnie and Professor Stein
came together, made Firestorm

145
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,934
and separated in that thing.

146
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,690
Ronnie... Professor...

147
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,610
No!

148
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,782
Only Ronnie didn't make it.

149
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,869
Right. But matter cannot be created
or destroyed, only changed.

150
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:34,497
So, maybe Ronnie is still alive.

151
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,750
I mean, maybe the pressure
from when the horizons merged

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,003
broke down his biological matter
into pure thermodynamic energy.

153
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,506
And that could account for
the radiation,

154
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,109
but it still doesn't explain
why the fire's been killing people.

155
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,385
Why it tortured Chester.

156
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,638
And if Ronnie knew what he was doing,
he would hate it.

157
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,349
Which is why I don't think
he's in control.

158
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:57,478
When Ronnie died,
his brain was flooded with ACTH.

159
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,982
It's the hormone the human brain creates
when it experiences grief.

160
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,318
So maybe when he was reborn
as a sentient fire,

161
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,695
that same process gave him

162
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,947
an overwhelming attraction
to the same hormone.

163
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:13,911
So he's been eating people's grief
because of some primal urge?

164
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,664
I think he needs it to survive,
which is why he's been trying

165
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,266
to reconnect with me so I can help him.

166
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,542
Did he say anything else?

167
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,127
Uh, a few words.

168
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,795
"Joining, togetherness."

169
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,464
I think he was trying to get me
to remember something.

170
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,842
The Quantum Splicer?

171
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,554
It's what made him Firestorm
in the first place.

172
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:35,099
I think if we can use it
to make Ronnie human again,

173
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,934
his mind will regain control.

174
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,477
And the killings will stop.

175
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,190
Even if you are right about this,

176
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,443
the Splicer needs two people to work,

177
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,445
and we can't ask anybody to volunteer.

178
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,528
It's too dangerous.

179
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,949
Yeah, but we wouldn't need
another person

180
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,284
if we used one
of Eva McCulloch's R-CEM chips.

181
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,203
Because if we fuse
one of Eva's chips to the Splicer,

182
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,974
it will do all the heavy lifting
by duplicating Ronnie's cells

183
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,708
and coalescing another body form,
right?

184
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,116
Like it did with Caity and me.

185
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,211
Okay, but raising the dead?

186
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,130
That's intense, even for us.

187
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,174
It turned out okay for Lazarus, right?

188
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,926
And if Chester and Caitlin both think
it might work...

189
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,303
It makes sense.

190
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,389
Ronnie is just trying to help us
help him come home.

191
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,141
All we have to do is listen.

192
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,726
What are we waiting for?

193
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,394
I'll get the Quantum Splicer.

194
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,646
I'll grab an R-CEM chip from Starchives.

195
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,362
Hey.

196
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,784
Things are moving pretty fast.

197
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,846
Not for Ronnie, who knows how long
he's been trapped like that?

198
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,998
All I'm saying is,
let's not jump to conclusions

199
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,642
about everything that's been happening.

200
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,668
You know, maybe we just slow down.

201
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,921
Make sure we're doing the right thing.

202
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,257
Saving my husband is the right thing.

203
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:55,221
Okay, if you want,
we can check the radiation data.

204
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,389
It's not the science I'm worried about.

205
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,768
This fire can manipulate people.
If it wants you to use the Splicer...

206
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,021
If I don't, Ronnie will be
burning like that forever.

207
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,815
And I can't let that happen.

208
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,692
Look,
I know what you're thinking.

209
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,820
That I mourned his death for so long

210
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,988
that I would do anything
to get him back.

211
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,408
But Ronnie is alive.

212
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,327
I... I can feel it. It's him.

213
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,329
And he wants us to help him.

214
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:25,203
I'm going to take this to Chester, so he
can get started on the modifications.

215
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,504
What is it?

216
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:30,922
Marcus.

217
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:36,095
He has no idea what happened
and he deserves to know.

218
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,013
What are you gonna tell him?

219
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,473
The truth.

220
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,792
So you're saying that
for the last eight years

221
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,277
you've been working with The Flash

222
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,530
and now your dead husband's
come back to life?

223
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,156
Yeah.

224
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,369
Yeah, yeah, that's kind of
out of my, uh, wheelhouse.

225
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,706
I know. And I just want to make sure
you're staying safe.

226
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:09,295
Ronnie has been unconsciously
hurting the people around me.

227
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,922
And you think I'm next on the list.

228
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,717
I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this...

229
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,763
but for your safety, I think,

230
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,019
we should stop seeing each other
just until I get Ronnie back.

231
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:26,978
And then what happens?

232
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,900
- The killings will stop.
- No, no, I meant what happens with us.

233
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:36,113
Marcus, my last few relationships
have not been exactly healthy.

234
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,160
That's why I'd given up on finding
a meaningful connection with someone

235
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,995
until I met you,

236
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,999
and you showed me that
when I go all in with us...

237
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,710
Look, Caitlin, please.

238
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,337
I'm not an idiot.

239
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,754
There is no more us.

240
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,549
And I've been broken up with before.

241
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,177
It's just never due to resurrection.

242
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,054
Yeah, that's a... That's a new one.

243
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:09,021
But it's your decision, I guess,
and I'll respect that.

244
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,606
I'm so sorry.

245
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,944
Yeah, me, too.

246
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:18,947
Um...

247
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:23,827
You know, there's this quote from Plato
that's always stuck with me.

248
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,748
He said that plants grow
their roots towards the earth.

249
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,043
But people, we're heavenly plants,

250
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,296
meaning that our roots,
they grow upward.

251
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,756
Towards our heart.

252
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,388
But those roots, they need to be
cared for, tended, like any plant.

253
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,517
Or your heart will break,

254
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,978
before it even has a chance to grow.

255
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,856
Goodbye, Caitlin.

256
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,487
Yeah, bye.

257
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,647
What are you doing down here?

258
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,131
I'm making sure your RNA
is integrated into the Sphere.

259
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,758
It's still the only way
to stop the flames.

260
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,344
Not anymore. We save Ronnie,

261
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,388
we can chuck that Time Sphere
in the trash.

262
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,535
Come on. I thought you were
all about "trusting your team" now.

263
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,227
I am. Caitlin's...

264
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,522
Just so excited
about getting Ronnie back,

265
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,692
it feels like she's ignoring
all the warning signs.

266
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,904
Frost, if this was really Ronnie,

267
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,157
why is he coming back now?

268
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,453
- Seven years after he died.
- I don't know.

269
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,787
Neither do I.

270
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,169
- This just all feels...
- Too good to be true?

271
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,089
You're checking on the Sphere.

272
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,133
You're worried about her, too.

273
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,570
Maybe, but I can't start
fighting with her again.

274
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,179
I mean, not after yesterday.

275
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,805
She helped Mom and me.

276
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,641
Got to have her back now.

277
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,436
So what? We just let her
go through with this?

278
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,438
What if it was Iris?

279
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:19,068
And there was some dangerous experiment
that would cure her time sickness?

280
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,944
You'd risk everything to save her.

281
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:26,492
So even if this fails, we at least
owe her the chance to try.

282
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,917
<i>Yo, it's me
Your boy Chester P</i>

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,102
<i>Ready to rock your world with knowledge</i>

284
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,505
<i>100% for free, free, free, free...</i>

285
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,757
You should sell merch, you know?

286
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,969
Like shirts that say,
"What up, Party People!"

287
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,053
Like all the way around.

288
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,736
All the way around? Yeah, that was good.
I'm gonna steal that idea.

289
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,184
Wow. You really are
blowing up the Internet.

290
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,561
Oh, just wait
till my next episode, girl.

291
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,067
Hold on. You're not sharing the specs
for this online, are you?

292
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,279
Uh, yeah, live broadcast. You know.

293
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,701
But then someone
could actually build it on their own.

294
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,787
Yeah, that's the point.

295
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,457
Allegra, did you know that WookieLover77

296
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,669
built an entire fleet of drones
based on my last AI algorithm?

297
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,714
And now those same drones
are delivering supplies to folks

298
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,883
who need them in impoverished countries.

299
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,220
That's what the whole
Chester P. community is all about.

300
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:33,350
Shout out to WookieLover77,
saving the world one drone at a time.

301
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,602
And that's great.

302
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,398
But the Splicer isn't a drone.

303
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,152
And putting technology like this
out there, it could be dangerous.

304
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,279
What if it lands in the wrong hands?

305
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm pretty sure supervillains
have better things to do

306
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,492
than watch my broadcast.

307
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,454
No. Worse things, I guess.

308
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,791
You still might want to check yourself,
depending on the science.

309
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,171
But that goes against the whole purpose
of scientific discovery.

310
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,514
What good is knowledge
if you don't share it?

311
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,719
Allegra, having access to
a breakthrough like this

312
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,442
could help one of my viewers
better understand the laws of physics,

313
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,725
which could lead to who knows
what kind of innovation

314
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,544
and make the world a better place.

315
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,771
Hell, if someone could see this,
and be inspired enough

316
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:23,817
to land a breakthrough in the cosmology
of our body's atoms

317
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,653
or maybe even discover the... the...
the true nature

318
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,948
of what human consciousness
really is or, you know...

319
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,702
Or how to resurrect the dead.

320
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,797
Chuck, all I'm saying
is maybe all knowledge

321
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,967
shouldn't always be
so readily available.

322
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,178
'Cause you think most people are bad.

323
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,512
No.

324
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:56,808
Because I know most people aren't you.

325
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:03,315
And maybe they shouldn't be able
to resurrect the past on a whim.

326
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:09,238
Last year, I watched Esperanza
die in my arms.

327
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,745
Death shouldn't be
some kind of science experiment.

328
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,332
It's a part of life, and it's finite.

329
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,087
It's what my <i>abuelita</i> used to call
<i>noche más negra...</i>

330
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,631
The blackest night.

331
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,218
Yeah.

332
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,557
I'll keep this one offline.

333
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,561
But, hey, think about that merch.

334
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,857
- I'll take a small.
- I got you.

335
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:47,817
Okay.

336
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:15,012
<i>Where is she? Where is she?</i>

337
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,437
<i>Where is she?</i>

338
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,614
<i>Where is Caitlin?</i>

339
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,783
<i>Must be free.</i>

340
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:41,121
<i>Pain... Set me free...</i>

341
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,042
<i>Help... Free me!</i>

342
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,547
Cecile. Hey.

343
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,466
What happened?

344
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,804
The fire...

345
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,311
- It spoke to me.
- It's here?

346
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:05,979
No.

347
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,648
No.

348
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:09,899
But...

349
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,322
Wherever it is,
it... it connected with my mind.

350
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,242
Barry, the pain.

351
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,330
- The pain, there was so much of it.
- And Ronnie?

352
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:25,874
Did you feel him, too?

353
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,921
Yeah, I could sense his anguish.

354
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,217
It felt like he was begging me.

355
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,553
- To do what?
- To set him free.

356
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,517
Barry, I don't think that Ronnie
wants to be brought back.

357
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,978
I think that he wants to die.

358
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,732
It's impossible.

359
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,946
Look, I know how hard
this must be to hear, but,

360
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,241
I'm almost positive about what I felt.

361
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,120
Caitlin, Ronnie doesn't want
to be brought back.

362
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,205
He asked me to save him.

363
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,000
Maybe that's why
Ronnie went after Cecile.

364
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,795
He knew he could communicate through her
to tell us the truth.

365
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,672
He's not here for Cecile.

366
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,965
He's been looking for me.

367
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:16,925
From what I can tell,

368
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,096
Ronnie is in agony

369
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,265
inside that fire.

370
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,101
It's like it's eating him alive.

371
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,603
It's torturing his mind.

372
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,524
Caitlin. It's like Ronnie is in hell.

373
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,446
And I truly believe
that he came to us for help.

374
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,034
- It's so that we can end his suffering.
- And we will.

375
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,164
It's why we're modifying
the Quantum Splicer to help him,

376
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,833
because I know that's what
he would want.

377
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,251
What if Cecile's right?

378
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,210
She's the only one

379
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,298
that's been able to form
a true connection to the fire.

380
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,259
I'm connected to it
because I'm its wife.

381
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,052
Why can't you understand that?

382
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,305
I mean, if anyone knows what it wants,
it would be me.

383
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,764
You're right.

384
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:12,397
You were. You are the most
important thing in Ronnie's life.

385
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,235
Caitlin, maybe it's time
that you consider how he feels.

386
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,239
Barry, you knew Ronnie.

387
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:25,702
He was a part of this team and you knew
he'd do anything to get back to me.

388
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,580
We have a way to help him.

389
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,957
Why are you so against this?

390
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,960
Because when I had
a chance like this once,

391
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,547
when I went back,
to save my mom from Thawne,

392
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,384
I did it because I was trying
to recreate a perfect past,

393
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,052
but it was a lie.

394
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,180
And it all came crashing down in the end

395
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,432
because I refused to see
the warning signs,

396
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,035
because I didn't listen to my friends,

397
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,059
or my family.

398
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,356
We can't resurrect the past.

399
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:56,942
It's too dangerous.

400
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,110
This is not another Flashpoint.

401
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,862
We are not creating another timeline.

402
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,573
We are saving my husband
from a nightmare.

403
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,493
Then maybe it's time to help him let go.

404
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,891
I thought family was supposed to have
your back, no matter what.

405
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:16,086
Even when they think
you're making the wrong choice.

406
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,424
God knows, we've all fallen in line for
you and Iris on more than one occasion.

407
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:22,843
Caitlin, please.

408
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,388
If you won't help me,
I'll save him on my own.

409
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,778
Oh, yeah, that's my kinda breakfast.

410
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:42,862
Good. You're awake.

411
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,531
Barely. I haven't been up this early

412
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,075
since Cisco made me wait in line
for the new <i>Call of Duty.</i>

413
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,618
Are we going somewhere?

414
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,705
I thought I'd surprise you
for our anniversary.

415
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,708
Okay. It's too early for this. Spill it.

416
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,791
Okay.

417
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:59,296
I thought we could use a weekend away.
Maybe, get outside of the city.

418
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,797
Go visit Mapleville...

419
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,133
- Oh, okay, I remember that place...
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,027
...where we had our first weekend
away together.

421
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,472
Which is why I booked us a room at the
same bed and breakfast for a few nights.

422
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,268
Oh, yes! You remember that, uh,
seafood joint on the corner?

423
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,312
- We have to go back there.
- I do, and we will.

424
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,147
Just as soon as you get ready.

425
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,708
Come on, we got to get on the road.

426
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,568
It's a five-hour drive and I wanna
be there in time to check in,

427
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,403
check out the glass-blowing exhibit.

428
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,947
Hold on. When exactly
did you have time to plan all this?

429
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,700
I know. We've been so busy
with the particle accelerator,

430
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,911
but I thought it was important
to celebrate us,

431
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,180
and the fact that we've been together
a whole year.

432
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,665
A year. Yeah,
it's been pretty great year.

433
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,667
- You think?
- I do.

434
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,671
We're like two atoms sharing
a strong covalent bond.

435
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,733
Ooh, I love it
when you talk science to me.

436
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,510
Hmm.

437
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,239
- Okay, now go. Get ready.
- Okay, I'm going.

438
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,349
I'm going. I'm going.
I'm going. I love you, Cait.

439
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,237
Thank God you're okay.

440
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:15,789
Where's Tinya?

441
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,499
Well, I told her to stay away.

442
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,668
Your time sickness is going ballistic.

443
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,516
I figured it'd be better
to keep her safe.

444
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,546
Yeah, thank you.

445
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,051
Look, Sue, what happened
to Tinya's mom...

446
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:29,927
I didn't mean to.

447
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,054
I know, Iris.

448
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,140
And I know that Deon has
told you to stay put

449
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,907
until he can figure out how to help you.

450
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,561
But you are getting worse by the hour.

451
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,510
I really think that we should
get you to S.T.A.R. Labs...

452
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,693
No. Don't. It might happen to you, too.

453
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,779
Oh, so now you're worried
about hurting people.

454
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,366
Tinya, look, I am so sorry
about what happened to your mom.

455
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,996
Okay, I need to get her home,
back to Central City.

456
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,204
Oh, it's too late.

457
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:58,914
Now walk away.

458
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,793
- Tinya.
- Shut up!

459
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,878
Tinya, you don't want to do this.

460
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,799
Yeah, I do.

461
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,267
What did you do to her?

462
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,917
Exactly what I'll do to you
if you ever try to find me again.

463
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,445
Wait, so Ronnie said he doesn't
want to be brought back.

464
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,072
He just wants to be released

465
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,199
from whatever prison
he's been in all this time.

466
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,328
But if we don't save Ronnie,
the fire will keep killing people.

467
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,163
No, it won't.

468
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,125
We're not gonna let
the fire kill anyone else.

469
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,459
We are going to stop it.

470
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,669
The only way we can.

471
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,465
You're going to use
the Cold Fusion Sphere to trap it.

472
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,634
And end Ronnie's pain once and for all.

473
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:04,814
I wish things were different, but
we've got to do this for Ronnie's sake.

474
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,276
And we're sure
this is what Ronnie wants?

475
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:13,989
Yeah.

476
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,992
I mean, it would explain
why he's come back.

477
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,245
And why he was so desperate
to connect with Caitlin.

478
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,666
And helping Ronnie move on
would keep the city safe.

479
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,337
What about that Quantum Splicer-thingy?

480
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,339
Can't you at least try that?

481
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,216
The Quantum Splicer works

482
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,259
by bombarding the user's atoms
with energy

483
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,638
to create fission, but it requires
the participant to be willing.

484
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:41,810
If Ronnie rejects the Splicer, his
atomic structures would become unstable,

485
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,521
resulting in endothermic explosion.

486
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:45,939
He's not gonna try.

487
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,985
All Ronnie wants now is to be at peace.

488
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,990
Okay. If this is what we're doing,
then what's the plan?

489
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,368
We'd use the Cold Fusion Sphere,
just like before,

490
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,371
only this time,
without putting anyone in danger.

491
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,183
And then, once it's trapped inside...

492
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,958
We just need to remove
the oxidizing agents,

493
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,169
and it's bye-bye flames, for good.

494
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,255
I know how this sounds.

495
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,509
But it feels like it's what
the Ronnie we knew wants.

496
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:16,970
We have to honor that.

497
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,684
Okay, um, I'm gonna talk to Caitlin.

498
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,853
- She needs to know what...
- No. I'll do it.

499
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,437
She should hear it from me.

500
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,202
Go, go, go!

501
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,744
Come on! Go, go, go!

502
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,251
No. No. No. Cait, come on,
we almost got it.

503
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,003
Ugh! You said that 20 minutes ago.

504
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,297
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

505
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,066
We missed our check-in
for the bed and breakfast.

506
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,926
We are stranded in the middle of nowhere
with no cell service.

507
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,637
- Okay.
- So much for a romantic weekend away.

508
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,890
I had big plans, you know.

509
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,809
Plans that did not
involve us getting pneumonia.

510
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,287
Well, I had big plans, too, all right.

511
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,562
Yeah, well, not like my plans.

512
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,480
Mine were once-in-a-generation,

513
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,691
tell-your-grandkids,
get-down-on-one-knee kinda plans.

514
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:12,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

515
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:14,944
You were gonna propose?

516
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:22,327
Yes. Because I love you so much,
Ronnie Raymond, it freaks me out.

517
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,705
But everything is ruined now.

518
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,249
No, no, no, no. It's not ruined. Okay?

519
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,936
I know you wanted to go
to that bed and breakfast

520
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,214
where we first fell in love,
but maybe we need to stop

521
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,592
trying to recreate the past,
and focus on the future.

522
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,512
Okay? Because when I look at you,
I see forever.

523
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,890
And I want forever to start right now.

524
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,224
Me, too.

525
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,770
- In that case...
- Hold on.

526
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,731
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Ronnie Raymond...

527
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,781
I told you I had big plans.

528
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Great minds.

529
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,535
- My answer is yes, by the way.
- So is mine.

530
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,546
We need to talk.

531
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,593
Barry wants to use the Fusion Sphere
to help Ronnie die,

532
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,761
and the team's on board.

533
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,763
I'm not surprised,
after everything he said.

534
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,401
I just never thought
you'd go along with it.

535
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,937
I'm really worried, Caity.

536
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,647
Then why won't you help me?

537
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,691
Not about Ronnie, about you.

538
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:39,696
Look, when Ronnie died,
you and me weren't even "you and me."

539
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,781
I was still in your subconscious.

540
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:47,078
But even then, I could feel your pain
the moment you realized he was gone.

541
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,372
And that night, when you went to bed,

542
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,165
and every night after that.

543
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,584
But as bad as that was,

544
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:58,673
watching you pull away from everyone
who loves you was even worse.

545
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:00,550
And it's happening again.

546
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,969
I'm sorry you felt all that pain.

547
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,056
But did you feel anything else?

548
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,518
I remember how happy you were
before he died.

549
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,858
- Which is why I got this.
- What about Barry?

550
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:22,905
Sure, Barry's family, but you're blood.
And I will always have your back.

551
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,430
But you got to promise me something,
all right?

552
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:35,251
You will never shut yourself off from me
or the rest of the team. All right?

553
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,336
I promise.

554
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,756
And Frost, thank you.

555
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,592
You got it. Now let's go find Ronnie.

556
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,428
Okay, great. How do we do that?

557
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,514
We'll search this whole damn city
to find him.

558
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:52,143
Day or night, rain or snow or whatever.
We're going to find him.

559
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:53,935
That's it.

560
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,856
Rain or snow, memories in the snow.

561
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,711
That's what he was trying to tell me.

562
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,188
What are you talking about?

563
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,278
I know where to find Ronnie.

564
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:12,830
Kids swore they heard
a voice calling them.

565
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:17,377
They looked under their bed
and they saw nothing.

566
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,630
They looked out the window...

567
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,423
and saw nothing.

568
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:26,677
So they went to sleep,

569
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:28,888
thinking they were safe.

570
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,936
But the children? They never looked...

571
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,354
Up!

572
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,160
Someone there?

573
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,956
Probably just the wind.

574
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,523
Barometric scans just picked up
an anomaly at Piedmont State Park.

575
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,525
And a half a dozen heat signatures.

576
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,110
We need to move. Chester?

577
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:25,235
The Sphere is ready.

578
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,239
Once the fire's trapped,
this de-oxygenator node will activate

579
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,082
- and the flames will be snuffed out.
- Okay.

580
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,826
- Where's Frost?
- I don't know.

581
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,243
We gotta go.

582
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,537
Hang on.

583
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,171
Everyone head for the park entrance.

584
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,190
Keep going towards the brightest light
you see.

585
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,894
The rest of my team
will get you to safety.

586
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,012
Allegra, Cecile,
six civilians are heading your way.

587
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,322
<i>We'll keep an eye out.</i>

588
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,866
<i>And I'll keep lighting the way.</i>

589
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,977
<i>Hunger... Feed...</i>

590
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,188
I'm sorry, Ronnie.

591
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:03,316
<i>No!</i>

592
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:14,035
The Sphere's heating up. I'm not sure
how much longer I can hold this.

593
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,494
You're almost there.

594
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,122
Okay. Barometric readings
are at 60 percent.

595
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:19,623
Fifty percent.

596
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,083
Forty percent.

597
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,836
Frack. Looks like there's
more civilians incoming,

598
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,172
and they're moving really,
really fast.

599
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,567
What did you do?

600
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,236
Exactly what we had to.

601
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,114
You just destroyed our best shot
at stopping this thing.

602
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,043
It's not a thing, it's my husband.

603
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,003
You're gonna get yourself killed.

604
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,589
It's her decision, let her.

605
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,481
- Caitlin, whatever happens...
- Ronnie!

606
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,238
We promised each other
we'd spend our futures together.

607
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,285
I'm keeping that promise.

608
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:16,948
It's you.

609
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,659
It's really you.

610
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,997
Cait, you did it, you saved me.

611
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,050
You're okay. You're okay.

612
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:36,802
We're both okay now.

613
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,624
Ronnie's still recovering from
the massive energy surge to his system,

614
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,793
- but he's stable.
- Oh, thank God.

615
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,087
There's still an occasional irregularity

616
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,451
in his amygdala function
that I haven't quite figured out,

617
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:15,883
but it should improve
when he gets his strength back.

618
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,343
He's been through a lot.

619
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,226
I... I guess it would be weird
if he didn't have some kind of reaction.

620
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,516
We're all just glad
that he's back, Caitlin.

621
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,141
Joe's right.

622
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,894
We're all so happy for you, honey.

623
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,145
Thank you.

624
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,022
I've got more good news, y'all.

625
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,401
So, I've had satellites running
barometric scans all night.

626
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:38,030
There's been zero sign
of our angry inferno anywhere.

627
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,282
Not one flicker.

628
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,327
Caity was right.
Now that Ronnie's human again,

629
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,912
no more grief-eating monster.

630
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,499
Caitlin, I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

631
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,876
I was wrong the whole time.

632
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,355
It's okay. You were just trying to do
what you thought was right.

633
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,256
We all lose faith sometimes.

634
00:36:56,006 --> 00:37:00,928
But the point is, we've brought
one of our family members back here.

635
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,974
Yeah, that sounds great to me.
And I can't wait to get to know him.

636
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:08,894
I actually think the two of you
are really going to get along.

637
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,146
And you, too, Chester.

638
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,423
What makes you say that?

639
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,609
I mean, I probably shouldn't be
saying this,

640
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,362
because it was a long time ago,

641
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:22,324
but he mentioned that maybe once,
he, you know...

642
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,827
No, seriously?

643
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,413
What? What?

644
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,625
- Ronnie played <i>D&D</i> in college.
- Once or twice.

645
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,171
Oh, snap. We're gonna help him
get his game on, girl.

646
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,465
Once... once he is better
and all that, of course.

647
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,884
Whatever happened to chess or checkers?

648
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,178
- Dominoes.
- Now, that's a good game right there.

649
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,219
Okay, Grandpa.

650
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,014
Uh, Caitlin.

651
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,561
For what it's worth, I'm so sorry.

652
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:56,484
I don't know, my powers, they've just,
they've never been so off before.

653
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,153
I just wish I knew why
I got it so wrong.

654
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:00,487
That's okay.

655
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,239
All that matters is that Ronnie's home.

656
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,323
Yeah.

657
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,950
<i>Hi. I'm not here right now.
Leave a message.</i>

658
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,505
Voicemail again.

659
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,301
Barry. It's Sue.

660
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,437
Hi, uh...
they told me you were here.

661
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,106
Where's Iris?

662
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,442
I don't know.

663
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,655
I just know that she's missing.

664
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:49,495
Her mom just vanished.
And then Iris, too.

665
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,122
Barry, I'm so sorry...

666
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,458
Barry? Barry!

667
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:55,709
Did you hear what I said?

668
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,545
Iris is gone.

669
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,720
Another spike.
Ronnie, we need to check your...

670
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:09,848
Ronnie?

671
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,397
Caitlin.

672
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,734
Caitlin.

673
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,404
Ronnie?

674
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,203
Ronnie?

675
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,373
Ronnie?

676
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,835
Did you hear that voice?

677
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:21,836
I did.

678
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,466
Because that voice was mine.

679
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:31,430
I called you here to show you
that I feel stronger than ever now.

680
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,682
Thanks to this.

681
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,938
I knew you'd understand
what I wanted, Cait,

682
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:42,775
and that you'd build
exactly what I needed.

683
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,487
Something's wrong.

684
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,657
We need to get you back to the Med Lab.

685
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:54,161
No. I'm not going anywhere.

686
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:55,745
Not yet.

687
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,912
Ronnie, you're scaring me.

688
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:04,964
That's probably because I am not Ronnie.

689
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,675
Where's my husband?

690
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,050
He's dead.

691
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,178
Your friends were right.

692
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:15,224
Ronnie Raymond sacrificed himself
to the storm in the Singularity.

693
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:20,312
Gave his life to its power,
his future to ensure its demise.

694
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:25,818
But in that uncontrollable,
irreversible chaos,

695
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,238
his death gave me life.

696
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,366
Now I am something greater,

697
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,869
something beyond death.

698
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,012
I am Deathstorm.
