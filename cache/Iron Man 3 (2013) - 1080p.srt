1
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:09,281
TONY: A famous man once said,

2
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,121
"We create our own demons."

3
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,661
Who said that?
What does that even mean?

4
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:17,621
Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,331
So, now, he was famous

6
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,921
and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.

7
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:23,631
I don't, uh...

8
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,841
I'm going to start again.

9
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,511
Let's track this from the beginning.

10
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,391
Yo listen up here's a story

11
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:39,811
About a little guy that
lives in a blue world

12
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,651
And all day and all night
and everything he sees

13
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:48,031
Is just blue like him
inside and outside

14
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:51,281
Blue is his house
with a blue little window

15
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,861
And a blue Corvette

16
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:56,411
And everything is blue
for him and himself

17
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:58,331
And everybody around

18
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,871
'Cause he ain't got nobody...

19
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:07,881
Half hour till the ball drops.

20
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,211
-Hey, do you wanna...
-Tony Stark?

21
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:11,551
-Great speech, man!
-HAPPY: I got you, pal.

22
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:12,681
I gave a speech? How was it?

23
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,681
-Edifying.
-Unintelligible.

24
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,761
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

25
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:16,851
It's my favorite kind.
A winning combo.

26
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,811
-Where are we going?
-Uh, to town, on each other.

27
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:19,931
Probably back in your room

28
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,141
because I also want to
see your research.

29
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,231
Okay, you can see my research,

30
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:24,271
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

31
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,561
Mr. Stark.

32
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,611
Ho Yinsen.

33
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:27,691
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:28,781
Come here.

35
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:32,111
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.

36
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,651
-Oh, this guy. Hey.
-Mr. Stark.

37
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:35,621
You're a heart doctor.

38
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:38,081
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...

39
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,791
-Bye.
-Perhaps another time?

40
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,501
TONY: It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.

41
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,381
-The old days.
-KlLLlAN: Mr. Stark!

42
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,841
TONY: I never thought they
would come back to bite me.

43
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,931
Why would they?

44
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,721
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!

45
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:59,391
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

46
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,641
-My work?
-Who isn't? He means me.

47
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,271
Well, of course, but, Ms. Hansen,

48
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:06,771
my organization's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

49
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:07,941
TONY: Yeah, we're full.

50
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,401
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

51
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:11,651
What floor you going to, pal?

52
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,241
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

53
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,401
The ground floor, actually,

54
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,491
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

55
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,411
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

56
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,081
-Uh...
-She'll take both.

57
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,411
One to throw away and one to not call.

58
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:28,171
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AlM," for short. Do you get it?

59
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:30,751
-I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
-Aw!

60
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:33,421
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

61
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:35,171
Thank you, I'll call you.

62
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,141
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

63
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,471
-Yeah?
-I'll ditch these clowns.

64
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,271
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

65
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,891
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

66
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:46,061
You know what I'm talking about?

67
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,141
I'll see you up there.

68
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,601
TONY: Damn betcha.

69
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,361
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

70
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,731
Well, it was.

71
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,531
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

72
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:55,611
-that governs repair...
-TONY: Wow.

73
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,031
MAYA: ...and chemically recode it.

74
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,531
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

75
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,701
BOTH: ...operating system...

76
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,161
-...of a living organism.
-Exactly.

77
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,581
-Yes.
-Wow.

78
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:04,661
Is that...
Can you...

79
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,251
-What?
-Can you not touch my plant?

80
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,041
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

81
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,131
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

82
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,251
-Happy...
-Hmm. That's cute...

83
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,801
Leave her ficus alone.

84
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:14,921
Because...
And, no, seriously, don't.

85
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,011
TONY: And you're starting with plants.

86
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:17,131
MAYA: For now, yeah.
TONY: Huh.

87
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,471
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

88
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,181
-Well, it's...
-BOTH: Human application.

89
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,471
Exactly, exactly.

90
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:25,601
-Dendritic revitalization.
-It's revolutionary.

91
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:27,061
-Disease prevention...
-Change the world.

92
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,601
...even limb regrowth.

93
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,481
You're the most gifted woman
l've ever met.

94
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:32,821
Wow.

95
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:35,481
-In Switzerland.
-Hmm. That's better.

96
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:37,571
-Aw, you're seeing things.
-This week.

97
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,701
You almost
bought it, didn't you?

98
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:52,341
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

99
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,711
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

100
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,881
-The what?
-HAPPY: Down!

101
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,341
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

102
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:58,971
-We're good.
-Stay down.

103
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:01,181
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.

104
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,431
What the hell was that?

105
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,811
-What was that?
-MAYA: It's a glitch in my work. It's...

106
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,481
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

107
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:09,691
HAPPY: It's not Y2K.

108
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,521
Hey! Happy New Year!

109
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:12,861
-HAPPY: Happy New Year.
-MAYA: Happy New Year.

110
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,321
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

111
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,441
-HAPPY: You good?
-Yeah.

112
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:16,481
-HAPPY: I'll be right outside.
-Okay, cool.

113
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,921
TONY: So, why am I telling you this?

114
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,801
Because I had just created demons

115
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,391
and I didn't even know it.

116
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,771
Yeah, those were good times.

117
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:52,481
Then I moved on.

118
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,231
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.

119
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,031
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

120
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,781
These days, I'm a changed man.

121
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,951
JARVIS: Forty-six.

122
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,781
TONY: I'm different now.

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,031
I'm... Well...

124
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,531
JARVIS: Forty-seven.
TONY: You know who I am.

125
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,621
Ow!

126
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,621
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...

127
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,121
No. Forty-eight.

128
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,171
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

129
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,251
As you wish, sir.

130
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,421
l've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.

131
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,091
Which I will.

132
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,681
All right, let's do this.

133
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:26,721
DUM-E.

134
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:27,811
Hi, DUM-E.

135
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:30,271
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

136
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:32,231
Hey. Hey!

137
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,731
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

138
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,111
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

139
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:41,111
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?

140
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,031
Focus up, ladies.

141
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,951
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

142
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,411
I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival

143
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,461
of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.

144
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:54,501
Start tight and then go wide.

145
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,041
Stamp date and time.

146
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:59,211
Mark 42. Autonomous
prehensile propulsion suit test.

147
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,131
Initialize sequence.

148
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,511
Jarvis, drop my needle.

149
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,271
Dashing through the snow

150
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,481
in a one horse open sleigh

151
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,071
O'er the fields we go

152
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,651
Laughing all the way

153
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,701
Bells on bob tails ring

154
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:30,991
Crap.

155
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,411
Oh, what fun it is to sing

156
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:35,961
A sleighing song tonight

157
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,341
Jingle bells, jingle bells

158
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,841
Jingle all the way

159
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:43,381
Oh, what fun it is to ride

160
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,301
In a one horse open sleigh

161
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:50,811
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

162
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,691
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

163
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:01,821
Slow it down just a...

164
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,191
...little bit.

165
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,541
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

166
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:25,631
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

167
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,271
I'm the best.

168
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,861
As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.

169
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,821
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.

170
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,911
I didn't think it could get any worse.

171
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,291
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.

172
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,621
That's when he happened.

173
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,551
THE MANDARIN: Some people
call me a terrorist.

174
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,221
I consider myself a teacher.

175
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,771
America.

176
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,071
Ready for another lesson?

177
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:30,361
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited

178
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:33,701
until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.

179
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:38,081
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind

180
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,461
and claim their land.

181
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,421
39 hours ago,

182
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,381
the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.

183
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,721
I... I... I did that.

184
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,131
A quaint military church

185
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,681
filled with wives and children,
of course.

186
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,731
The soldiers were out on maneuvers.

187
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:04,061
The braves were away.

188
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,611
President Ellis.

189
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,071
You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.

190
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,861
And now you've missed me again.

191
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,831
You know who I am.

192
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:20,001
You don't know where I am.

193
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:24,001
And you'll never see me coming.

194
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:28,631
PAT KlERNAN: Now that
we seem to be back,

195
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,211
let's recap some
of the frightening developments...

196
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:32,171
American airwaves were hijacked...

197
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,841
The nation remains on high alert.

198
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:36,551
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.

199
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:40,021
ELLIS: Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event

200
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,231
is a newly minted resource.

201
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,561
I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.

202
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:47,771
The American people
will soon know him

203
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,531
as the Iron Patriot.

204
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,491
And how is President Ellis responding?

205
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,741
By taking the guy
they call War Machine

206
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:56,451
and giving him a paint job.

207
00:09:56,621 --> 00:10:00,201
The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.

208
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:04,161
Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."

209
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,171
You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.

210
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,341
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

211
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:11,131
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

212
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,631
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.

213
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,131
All right?
This sends a better message.

214
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,561
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

215
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,061
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

216
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,691
It's classified information, Tony.

217
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,281
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

218
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,571
-Nine.
-The public only knows about three.

219
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,741
But here's the thing,
nobody can lD a device.

220
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:37,951
There's no bomb casings.

221
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,331
You know I can help.
Just ask.

222
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,121
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

223
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:43,911
I got bomb disposal.

224
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:45,581
It catches explosions in mid-air.

225
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,171
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

226
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:49,921
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

227
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,421
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

228
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,761
You're going to come at me like that?

229
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,471
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...

230
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:57,181
...tator.

231
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:58,761
Do you mind signing my drawing?

232
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,011
If Richard doesn't mind.

233
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,221
Are you all right with this, Dick?

234
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,891
RHODEY:
Yeah. Fine with me.

235
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,351
-TONY: What's your name?
-Erin.

236
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,441
I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.

237
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,111
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

238
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:16,031
After New York, aliens... Come on.

239
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,781
They need to look strong.

240
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,031
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

241
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:22,911
-It's not superhero business.
-No, it's not, quite frankly.

242
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,541
-I get it.
-It's American business.

243
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,461
That's why I said I got it.

244
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,621
Are you okay?

245
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,291
I broke the crayon.

246
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:32,131
ERIN:
Are you okay, Mr. Stark?

247
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:34,051
Take it easy. Tony.

248
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,221
How did you
get out of the wormhole?

249
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:38,971
Wait a minute. Tony!

250
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,051
TONY: What did you say?
RHODEY: Tony.

251
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,761
Sorry.

252
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:44,311
I'm just
checking on the suit.

253
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,481
Okay.

254
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,151
Check the heart.

255
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,651
ls it the brain?

256
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:55,651
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.

257
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,571
Okay, so I was poisoned?

258
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:02,991
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.

259
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,621
Me?

260
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,791
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

261
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,961
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split.

262
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:14,291
HAPPY: Badge.

263
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,711
Badge.

264
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,221
Come on, badge.

265
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,141
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

266
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,511
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

267
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,681
-This is an asset that we can put to use.
-Uh-huh.

268
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:30,811
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

269
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:32,481
-Thank you.
-What I'm saying is that

270
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,651
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

271
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,071
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

272
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,611
-What?
-Excuse me, Bambi,

273
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:40,991
-you should be wearing...
-Did you just say that?

274
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,661
-Security? Yes?
-Happy? Okay.

275
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:45,451
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?

276
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,201
-It is the perfect position for you.
-Thank you.

277
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,871
-However...
-I do appreciate it.

278
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,871
-...since you've taken the post...
-You don't have to thank me.

279
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,461
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

280
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,631
Thank you.

281
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,251
It's not a compliment.

282
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,591
It's not...
It is a compliment.

283
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,221
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

284
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,511
-I... Yes.
-SECRETARY: Excuse me.

285
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,551
Ms. Potts, your 4:00 is here.

286
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,051
-Thank you.
-Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

287
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,931
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

288
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,391
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

289
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,851
How so?

290
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:13,351
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

291
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:14,561
so it's a little awkward.

292
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,481
I don't like the sound of that.

293
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:22,491
Pepper.

294
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,451
Killian?

295
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,281
You look great.

296
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,991
You look really great.

297
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,331
God, you look great.

298
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,621
I... I... I...

299
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,461
What on earth have you been doing?

300
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,921
Nothing fancy.

301
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,291
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

302
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,341
And please, call me Aldrich.

303
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,591
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

304
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:44,131
-Happy, it's okay. We're good.
-Yes.

305
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,761
-Are you sure? Okay.
-Yes. Stand down.

306
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:48,561
-I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
-Thank you.

307
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:51,851
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

308
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,571
Hey, guy.

309
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,241
Merry Christmas.

310
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,121
KlLLlAN: After years dodging
the President's ban

311
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,581
on "immoral" biotech research,

312
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:15,001
my think tank

313
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:19,131
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

314
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:24,091
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

315
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:26,341
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

316
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,141
Regard the human brain.

317
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,521
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.

318
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,571
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

319
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,531
But if I do that...

320
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:49,161
That's the brain.

321
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,661
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

322
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,081
Wow, that's amazing.

323
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,831
Thanks, it's mine.

324
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,161
What?

325
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:58,131
This. You're inside my head.

326
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:00,291
It's a...
It's a live feed.

327
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,211
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

328
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:05,011
Come on.

329
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:09,011
Now, pinch my arm.

330
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:12,181
I can take it. Pinch me.

331
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,601
What is that?

332
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:18,021
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain center.

333
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:21,611
But this is what I wanted to show you.

334
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:28,361
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential

335
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:31,371
and it goes here.

336
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,661
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

337
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,541
is that our mind,

338
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,121
our entire DNA, in fact,

339
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,131
is destined to be upgraded.

340
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,381
Wow.

341
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,171
Oh, wait...

342
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,051
Uh...

343
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:51,431
Hello?

344
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,391
-TONY: Is this Forehead of Security?
-What?

345
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:55,221
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

346
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,601
I'm working.
l've got something going on, here.

347
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:57,811
What, harassing interns?

348
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,191
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened

349
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,271
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

350
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,311
They would laugh in my face.

351
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:04,781
I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.

352
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:06,691
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.

353
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,571
What's going on? Fill me in.

354
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:09,861
-For real?
-Yeah.

355
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,531
All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.

356
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:13,241
-Rich guy. Handsome.
-Right.

357
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:15,741
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.

358
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:16,831
-Oh, yeah, you're the best.
-Yeah.

359
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:18,251
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.

360
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,871
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...

361
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,211
Where were we in '99?

362
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,591
-The science conference?
-Um...

363
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,211
-Switzerland.
-Right, right, exactly.

364
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:27,801
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

365
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,381
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

366
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,091
At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.

367
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:34,351
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

368
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:36,181
-His what?
-Big brain.

369
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,681
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.

370
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,891
Hold on. See?

371
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:41,481
Look at what? You, watching them?

372
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,561
Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.

373
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,481
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

374
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,321
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

375
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:49,611
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

376
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,451
Don't talk to me like that anymore.
You're not my boss.

377
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:53,951
All right?
I don't work for you.

378
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,661
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.

379
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:57,791
He's shifty.

380
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:58,871
-Relax.
-Seriously?

381
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,461
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

382
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,871
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

383
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,631
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

384
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,461
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

385
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,961
and you're just ignoring her.

386
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,131
-A giant brain?
-Yeah.

387
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,551
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

388
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,181
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

389
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:13,801
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

390
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,641
I miss you, Happy.

391
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,811
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

392
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:19,141
Now you're off with the super-friends.

393
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,431
I don't know
what's going on with you anymore.

394
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:21,561
-The world's getting weird.
-Hey!

395
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,641
I hate to cut you off.

396
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:23,731
-Do you have your Taser on you?
-Why?

397
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,021
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

398
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,191
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

399
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:29,571
Yeah, nice.

400
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:34,491
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

401
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,621
and recode its DNA.

402
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,701
-That would be incredible.
-Hmm.

403
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:42,501
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponizable.

404
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:46,251
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

405
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:48,001
Tony, Tony.

406
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:53,801
You know, I invited Tony to join AlM
13 years ago.

407
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:54,931
He turned me down.

408
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:59,471
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne

409
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,811
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony anymore

410
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:04,851
and who has slightly less of an ego.

411
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:08,941
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

412
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,401
As much as l'd like to help you.

413
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:17,031
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

414
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,831
But then,
as my father used to say,

415
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,661
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

416
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,211
-That's very deep.
-Hmm.

417
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,711
And I have no idea
what it means.

418
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,041
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

419
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,711
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

420
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:42,471
Happy.

421
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,641
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

422
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,481
Yes, I just, um...

423
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:52,981
God, I forgot my other things, so...

424
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:55,201
I'm just gonna...

425
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:23,931
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

426
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,391
What the...
What is that?

427
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,981
You're wearing this in the house now?

428
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,651
What is that, like, Mark 15?

429
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,441
TONY: Uh, yeah.

430
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,531
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

431
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:36,821
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

432
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:38,611
TONY:
Just breaking it in.

433
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,531
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag

434
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:41,831
at first, so...

435
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:44,081
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

436
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,501
Yes, I did. I...

437
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:48,081
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

438
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,211
Is it gonna fit through the door?

439
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:51,631
TONY: Well, actually,
it's a good question.

440
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:54,251
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

441
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:55,801
-Okay.
-So, uh...

442
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:57,551
Tense? Good day? Huh?

443
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,301
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

444
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:03,971
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

445
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:05,181
Did I like it?

446
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,021
-Nailed it, right?
-Wow.

447
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,901
I appreciate the thought very much.

448
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:14,571
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

449
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,441
Huh...

450
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:19,361
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

451
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,491
You want to just kiss it on the...

452
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,331
-The facial slit?
-Uh-huh.

453
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,411
Well, why don't l
run down to the garage

454
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,081
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?

455
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,831
Crowbar, yeah.

456
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,251
Oh! Except there's been
a radiation leak.

457
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:34,251
-PEPPER: I'll take my chances.
-That's risky.

458
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:35,751
At least, let me get you

459
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:37,461
like, a hazmat suit
you can...

460
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,931
A Geiger counter or something like that.

461
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,141
Busted.

462
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:46,811
-This is a new level of lame.
-Sorry.

463
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,351
You ate without me already?
On date night?

464
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,441
-He was just...
-You mean you.

465
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,191
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were just hosting you...

466
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,191
-...while I finished up a little work.
-Uh-huh.

467
00:20:57,361 --> 00:20:58,571
And yes, I had a quick bite.

468
00:20:58,651 --> 00:20:59,611
I didn't know if you were coming home

469
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:01,451
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

470
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:06,581
-What?
-What?

471
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:09,251
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

472
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:10,331
Happy was concerned.

473
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,541
-No, you're spying on me.
-I wasn't.

474
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:12,751
-I'm going to bed.
-Hold on.

475
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,291
Come on. Pep?

476
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:16,381
Hey, I admit it.

477
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,511
My fault. Sorry.

478
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:22,721
I'm a piping hot mess.

479
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:27,891
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

480
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,481
Nothing's been the same
since New York.

481
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:35,021
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.

482
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,691
You experience things

483
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,401
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

484
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:44,661
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

485
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,121
The only reason I haven't cracked up

486
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:48,161
is probably because you moved in.

487
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:49,661
Which is great.

488
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,291
I love you. I'm lucky.

489
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:54,331
But honey, I can't sleep.

490
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,751
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

491
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:00,591
I tinker. I...

492
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,511
Threat is imminent.

493
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:07,221
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

494
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:09,011
That's you.

495
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,351
And my suits, they're, uh...

496
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,431
Machines.

497
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:14,271
They're part of me.

498
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,521
A distraction.

499
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,691
Maybe.

500
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,381
I'm gonna take a shower.

501
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:40,171
Okay.

502
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:43,631
And you're gonna join me.

503
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,761
Better.

504
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,531
Tony.

505
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,661
Tony. Tony.

506
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,081
To...

507
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,331
Power down!

508
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:26,341
TONY: I must have called it in my sleep.

509
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,721
That's not supposed to happen.

510
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:33,221
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

511
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:38,101
Can we just... Just let me...

512
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:40,611
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

513
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,821
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

514
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:45,191
Tinker with that.

515
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:12,851
Can you regulate?

516
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:13,971
Yes, I can regulate.

517
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,181
-You sure about that?
-Yes.

518
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,151
It's a decent batch.

519
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,571
-Don't say I never did nothing for you.
-Thank you.

520
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:35,161
I mean, for understanding.

521
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:44,751
HAPPY: I'm sorry, buddy.

522
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,151
What are you doing, buddy?

523
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:03,561
You out by yourself?
A little date night?

524
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:04,731
Seeing your favorite chick flick, maybe?

525
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,031
Yeah, a little movie
called The Party's Over,

526
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:08,991
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

527
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:10,071
Here's the ticket.

528
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,451
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

529
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:39,971
TAGGART: Savin!

530
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,141
Help!

531
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:44,021
Help me!

532
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:12,191
THE MANDARIN: True story
about fortune cookies.

533
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,611
They look Chinese.

534
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:16,571
They sound Chinese.

535
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:20,781
But they're actually
an American invention.

536
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:25,661
Which is why they're hollow,
full of lies

537
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,921
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

538
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:33,761
My disciples just destroyed
another cheap American knockoff.

539
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:37,131
The Chinese Theatre.

540
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:39,721
Mr. President,

541
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:42,101
I know this must be getting frustrating.

542
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:47,521
But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.

543
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:49,731
And don't worry,

544
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:51,611
the big one is coming.

545
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:53,071
Your graduation.

546
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:08,871
-Hi.
-Oh!

547
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,831
Do you mind leaving that on?

548
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,711
Sure.

549
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:23,141
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.

550
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:26,851
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

551
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:31,561
One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.

552
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:32,861
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

553
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:36,071
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

554
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,191
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

555
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,821
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

556
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,531
His reaction
to the latest attack.

557
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:42,781
Mr. Stark, hi there.

558
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:47,541
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

559
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,751
Anything else you can tell us?

560
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,831
MALE REPORTER: Hey, Mr. Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

561
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:54,671
I'm just saying.

562
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,801
Is that what you want?

563
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:03,681
Here's a little holiday greeting

564
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:06,181
l've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

565
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,641
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

566
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:12,401
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

567
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:15,521
I know you're a coward.
So l've decided

568
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,861
that you just died, pal.

569
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,071
I'm gonna come get the body.

570
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,911
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

571
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:26,201
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

572
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:30,121
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

573
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:33,711
10880 Malibu Point.

574
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,961
90265.

575
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,881
I'll leave the door unlocked.

576
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:38,961
That's what you wanted, right?

577
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:44,051
Bill me.

578
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:51,481
JARVIS: l've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,

579
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:55,771
drawn from
S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.

580
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,401
Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.

581
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:04,361
Okay. What have we got here?

582
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:08,781
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "advisor to the king."

583
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:12,161
South American insurgency tactics.

584
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:14,711
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

585
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:19,131
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theater. Close.

586
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:22,801
The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.

587
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:26,511
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporized instantly.

588
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:29,261
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

589
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,351
No, sir.

590
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:33,391
Talk to me, Happy.

591
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:54,041
When is a bomb not a bomb?

592
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,761
Any military victims?

593
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:09,101
Not according to public record, sir.

594
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:11,311
Bring up the thermogenic
signatures again.

595
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:13,101
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

596
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,891
The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.

597
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:17,061
Accessing satellites

598
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:21,021
and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.

599
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:24,151
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

600
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,201
Nope.

601
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:38,751
That. Are you sure
that's not one of his?

602
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,291
It predates any known Mandarin attack.

603
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:44,211
The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.

604
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,131
Bring her around.

605
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:49,221
The heat signature
is remarkably similar.

606
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,351
3,000 degree Celsius.

607
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,221
That's two military guys.

608
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:57,181
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

609
00:31:57,691 --> 00:32:00,191
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

610
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,281
Are we still at ding-dong?

611
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:09,781
We're supposed to be on total...

612
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:10,991
...security lockdown.

613
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:12,831
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

614
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:15,621
There's only so much I can do, sir,

615
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:19,621
when you give the world's press
your home address.

616
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:30,891
Right there is fine.

617
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:36,601
You're not the Mandarin.

618
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:38,771
Are you? Are you?

619
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:41,941
You don't remember.

620
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,151
Why am I not surprised?

621
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,481
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

622
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:47,031
JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.

623
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:48,401
That's right.

624
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:51,411
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.

625
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,491
It's urgent.

626
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:58,791
Normally, l'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

627
00:32:58,871 --> 00:32:59,911
It's...

628
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:02,751
-With her.
-PEPPER: Tony?

629
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,381
-Is somebody there?
-Yeah,

630
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,301
-it's Maya Hansen.
-Ah...

631
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,421
Old botanist pal

632
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:11,881
that I used to know, barely.

633
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,681
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

634
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:14,851
waiting in the car that l've never met.

635
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:15,931
He's 13.

636
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,811
No, I need your help.

637
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:19,481
But, what for? Why now?

638
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,811
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

639
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:23,941
I'll be fine.

640
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,361
PEPPER: I'm sorry,
with Happy in the hospital,

641
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,481
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

642
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:29,441
-We weren't.
-And old girlfriends.

643
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,281
-She's not, really.
-No, not really. I...

644
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:34,531
-It was just one night.
-TONY: Yep.

645
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,331
That's how you did it, isn't it?

646
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,741
-It was a great night.
-PEPPER: Yep. Well, you know.

647
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:40,751
-You saved yourself a world of pain.
-What?

648
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:42,421
-MAYA: I'm sure.
-Trust me. We're going out of town.

649
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:43,501
Okay. We've been through this.

650
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:44,631
-Nope.
-Yep!

651
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:46,631
-The man says no.
-Immediately and indefinitely.

652
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:48,251
-TONY: Honey...
-Great idea. Let's go.

653
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:50,971
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

654
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:52,551
This is how normal people behave.

655
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,801
TONY: I can't protect you out there.

656
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,721
Is... is that normal?

657
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,971
-Sadly, that is very normal.
-Yes, this is normal!

658
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,681
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

659
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:02,101
Calm down.

660
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,061
-I got this for you.
-I'm aware of that.

661
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,481
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

662
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:06,861
I don't like it.

663
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:07,941
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

664
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:09,231
-We are leaving the house.
-MAYA: Guys?

665
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,401
That's not even up for discussion.

666
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:12,701
-Can we, um...
-I said no. What?

667
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:13,991
Do we need to worry about that?

668
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,501
I got you.

669
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:06,751
I got you first.

670
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,171
Like I said, we can't stay here.

671
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:16,881
Oh!

672
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,551
Move! I'm right behind you.

673
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:21,561
PEPPER: Oh!

674
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:24,771
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

675
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:27,561
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

676
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,691
Go!

677
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:53,801
Oh, my God. Tony!

678
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:10,941
JARVIS: Sir, Ms. Potts
is clear of the structure.

679
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,391
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

680
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,521
Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.

681
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:02,621
That's one.

682
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:07,121
Sir, the suit is not combat ready.

683
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,221
That's two.

684
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,021
Oh.

685
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,091
Tony!

686
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,621
Sir, take a deep breath.

687
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:32,181
Flight power restored.

688
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,661
JARVIS: Sir?

689
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:50,451
Sir!

690
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:53,581
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

691
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:56,621
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

692
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:57,711
Oh...

693
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,341
Oh!

694
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:37,661
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

695
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:41,461
We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.

696
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,961
Why?

697
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,711
Jarvis. Not my idea.

698
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:48,511
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

699
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,011
I gotta get Pepper.
I gotta...

700
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,851
I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.

701
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:53,971
Who asked you?

702
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:55,971
-Open the suit.
-I...

703
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:57,271
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

704
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,351
Open it, J.

705
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:06,531
That's brisk.

706
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:16,331
Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a...

707
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:19,331
I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.

708
00:41:19,621 --> 00:41:21,001
Jarvis.

709
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:24,591
Jarvis?

710
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:29,261
Don't leave me, buddy.

711
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,571
FEMALE SYNTH VOlCE:
Stark secure server

712
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:54,621
now transferring
to all known receivers.

713
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:56,031
TONY: Pepper, it's me.

714
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:59,411
l've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.

715
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:02,371
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

716
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:06,211
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.

717
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,381
Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.

718
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,471
Done. Sorry.

719
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,551
And I'm sorry in advance

720
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:16,601
because I can't come home yet.

721
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,811
I need to find this guy.

722
00:42:19,891 --> 00:42:22,731
You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.

723
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:26,151
I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.

724
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:51,671
Let's get you comfy.

725
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:56,391
You happy now?

726
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:07,771
Freeze!

727
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:11,361
Don't move.

728
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:13,361
You got me.

729
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:16,611
Nice potato gun.

730
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:18,281
Barrel's a little long.

731
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:22,291
Between that and the wide gauge
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

732
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:27,711
And now you're out of ammo.

733
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:30,251
What's that thing on your chest?

734
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:33,461
It's an electromagnet.

735
00:43:33,551 --> 00:43:35,131
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

736
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:37,051
What does it power?

737
00:43:46,061 --> 00:43:47,981
Oh, my God.

738
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:50,271
That...

739
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:54,691
That's...
Is that Iron Man?

740
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:56,321
Technically, I am.

741
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,071
Technically, you're dead.

742
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:02,121
TONY: Valid point.

743
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:03,581
What happened to him?

744
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:05,081
Life.

745
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:07,751
I built him. I take care of him.

746
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:10,751
I'll fix him.

747
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:11,881
Like a mechanic?

748
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:13,421
Yeah.

749
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:15,011
Hmm.

750
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:17,841
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

751
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:19,011
It's "Iron Patriot" now.

752
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:20,261
That's way cooler.

753
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,681
No, it's not.

754
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:25,811
Anyways, I would have added in,
um, the retro...

755
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:28,481
-Retro-reflective panels?
-To make him stealth mode.

756
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:30,481
-You want a stealth mode?
-Cool, right?

757
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:31,861
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

758
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:34,021
-Not a good idea.
-Oops.

759
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:36,441
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

760
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,071
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.

761
00:44:38,201 --> 00:44:39,201
Sorry.

762
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,781
Are you?

763
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:44,581
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

764
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:46,371
So, uh, who's home?

765
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:50,831
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

766
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:54,961
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.

767
00:44:55,511 --> 00:44:56,591
Hmm.

768
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:58,921
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

769
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:00,011
Here's what I need.

770
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:03,551
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

771
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:06,061
the pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

772
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:09,521
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

773
00:45:09,771 --> 00:45:11,731
What's in it for me?

774
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:14,561
-Salvation. What's his name?
-Who?

775
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:18,071
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

776
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,651
How'd you know that?

777
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:21,991
I got just the thing.

778
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:27,291
This is a piñata for a cricket.

779
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:28,661
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

780
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,421
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

781
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:33,581
it discourages bullying.

782
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:38,001
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

783
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,511
Deal? What do you say?

784
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,431
-Deal.
-Deal?

785
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:43,891
What's your name?

786
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:46,511
Harley. And you're...

787
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:47,971
The mechanic.

788
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:50,271
Tony.

789
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:54,231
You know what keeps
going through my head?

790
00:45:54,311 --> 00:45:55,901
"Where's my sandwich?"

791
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:06,201
Where is Tony Stark?

792
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:36,101
FEMALE SYNTH VOlCE:
Stark secure server.

793
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:38,271
Retinal scan verified.

794
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:39,481
TONY: Pepper, it's me.

795
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:42,491
l've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.

796
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:45,611
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

797
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:48,071
That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.

798
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:51,831
PEPPER: Why were you
at the house tonight?

799
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:55,421
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

800
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:02,211
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

801
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:04,971
So, if you still want to talk about it

802
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:08,141
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.

803
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:12,311
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

804
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:14,601
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

805
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:17,441
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

806
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:19,861
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

807
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,651
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

808
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:26,071
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

809
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:28,911
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

810
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:34,501
SAVIN: Well, we took the house down,
sir. But there's no sign of a body.

811
00:47:34,581 --> 00:47:35,621
-Mmm-hmm. I see.
-No Stark.

812
00:47:36,081 --> 00:47:38,331
I have to go.

813
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:40,671
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

814
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,341
Well, you know how he gets.

815
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:46,931
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

816
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:54,561
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

817
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,941
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

818
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:09,661
GUARD: Report in.

819
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:12,701
Path is clear.

820
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:19,171
The master is traveling.

821
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:37,061
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

822
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:41,351
TONY: The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

823
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:43,861
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

824
00:48:43,941 --> 00:48:45,651
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

825
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:46,821
-HARLEY: Yeah?
-...I was kind of hoping

826
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:49,241
for something a little more
adult than that.

827
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:52,951
HARLEY: She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

828
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,451
When can we talk about New York?

829
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,411
TONY: Maybe never.
Relax about it.

830
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,041
HARLEY: What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

831
00:48:58,121 --> 00:49:00,251
TONY: I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

832
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:07,881
What's the official story here?
What happened?

833
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:12,511
HARLEY: I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.

834
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:16,011
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

835
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:20,351
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

836
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,101
Then he blew himself up, right here.

837
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:31,201
-Six people died, right?
-Yeah.

838
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:33,031
-Including Chad Davis.
-Yeah, yeah.

839
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:42,581
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

840
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:44,921
Think about it.

841
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:47,591
Six dead. Only five shadows.

842
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:49,171
Yeah.

843
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:52,091
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

844
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,551
Except the bomb guy.

845
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:59,521
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

846
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:01,021
That's why there's only five.

847
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:04,061
-Do you buy that?
-It's what everyone says.

848
00:50:07,611 --> 00:50:09,821
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

849
00:50:09,901 --> 00:50:12,361
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

850
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:18,081
That giant wormhole in,
um, in New York.

851
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,581
Does it remind you?

852
00:50:20,661 --> 00:50:22,711
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

853
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:24,751
Are they coming back? The aliens?

854
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:26,131
Maybe. Can you stop?

855
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:30,001
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

856
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:31,881
Does this subject make you edgy?

857
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:34,221
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

858
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:36,141
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

859
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:38,641
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

860
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:40,521
-Do you have medication?
-No.

861
00:50:40,681 --> 00:50:42,021
-Do you need to be on it?
-Probably.

862
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:43,561
-Do you have PTSD?
-I don't think so.

863
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,151
Are you going completely mental?

864
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:47,481
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

865
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:49,481
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

866
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:52,111
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

867
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,531
Ah, man, you did it,
didn't you? You happy now?

868
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:57,661
What did I say?

869
00:50:58,201 --> 00:50:59,411
Hey! Wait up!

870
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,081
Wait, wait.

871
00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:09,001
What the hell was that?

872
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:15,181
Your fault.
You spazzed me out.

873
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,221
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

874
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:20,511
The guy who died.

875
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,731
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs. Davis, where is she?

876
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:24,851
Where she always is.

877
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:27,561
See? Now, you're being helpful.

878
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:32,691
Uh...

879
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,031
Sorry.

880
00:51:34,151 --> 00:51:35,611
Lady?

881
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:38,531
Is this, uh...

882
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:40,581
Thank you.

883
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:45,711
Nice haircut. It suits you.

884
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:47,251
Nice watch.

885
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:48,961
Yeah. A limited edition.

886
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:51,541
Oh, I don't doubt it.

887
00:51:52,591 --> 00:51:53,841
Well, have a good evening.

888
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:07,561
MAN: Excuse me.

889
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:18,911
TONY: Mrs. Davis?

890
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:20,661
Mind if I join you?

891
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:22,531
Free country.

892
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,491
Sure is.

893
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:30,631
All right.

894
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,591
Where would you like to start?

895
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:37,131
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

896
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,681
I want to know
what you think happened.

897
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:45,771
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

898
00:52:46,771 --> 00:52:50,521
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

899
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:54,481
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

900
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:55,781
Supposed to meet someone here?

901
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:56,901
Yeah.

902
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,171
Mrs. Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

903
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:15,131
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

904
00:53:16,841 --> 00:53:17,961
Someone used him.

905
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:20,301
What?

906
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:22,891
As a weapon.

907
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:30,391
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

908
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:32,311
BRANDT: Actually, I am.

909
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:36,901
SHERlFF: Hey, hey, hey!

910
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:39,651
What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

911
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:41,741
It's called an arrest.

912
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:43,871
Sheriff, is it?

913
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:45,831
Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

914
00:53:45,911 --> 00:53:47,951
Homeland Security. We good here?

915
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,871
No, we're not "good."

916
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:51,461
I need a little more information
than that.

917
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:53,921
BRANDT: Well, I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

918
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:55,341
SHERlFF: Yeah?
Well, why don't you

919
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:57,461
get on the horn
to Nashville and, uh, upgrade me?

920
00:53:57,761 --> 00:54:01,341
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way,

921
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,181
but, uh, the fun way is always good.

922
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:06,051
Deputy, get this woman out of...

923
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:22,111
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

924
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:37,881
-Crazy, huh?
-Yep.

925
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:40,421
Watch this.

926
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:49,371
You walked right into this one.
l've dated hotter chicks than you.

927
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:52,791
That's all you got?

928
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,711
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

929
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:59,171
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

930
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:01,981
HARLEY: Let me go!
SAVIN: Help me!

931
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:07,361
Anyway.

932
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,611
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

933
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:12,661
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

934
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:13,951
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

935
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:15,951
"I want my goddamn file."

936
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:17,411
It's not your fault, kid.

937
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:21,921
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

938
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:29,591
TONY: You like that, Westworld?

939
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:31,431
That's the thing about smart guys,

940
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:34,011
we always cover our ass.

941
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,191
Ah!

942
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:00,121
HARLEY: You're welcome.

943
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:02,791
For what? Did I miss something?

944
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:04,831
Me, saving your life.

945
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:08,051
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

946
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:10,881
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

947
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:14,261
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

948
00:58:14,341 --> 00:58:16,141
Unlike you?

949
00:58:17,721 --> 00:58:19,601
Admit it, you need me.

950
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,231
We're connected.

951
00:58:21,441 --> 00:58:23,351
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

952
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,861
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

953
00:58:25,941 --> 00:58:27,191
and stay connected to the telephone

954
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:28,981
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

955
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:32,201
Can you feel that? We're done here.

956
00:58:32,281 --> 00:58:33,531
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

957
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:35,321
Bye, kid.

958
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:43,411
I'm sorry, kid.

959
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,121
You did good.

960
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,091
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

961
00:58:50,211 --> 00:58:51,211
Yeah.

962
00:58:52,761 --> 00:58:54,051
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

963
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:55,761
I'm cold.

964
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:58,301
I can tell.
You know how I can tell?

965
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:01,311
Because we're connected.

966
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:07,231
It was worth a shot.

967
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,991
SALESWOMAN: You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.

968
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:23,451
It goes with any decor...

969
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:27,671
-What happened to picture?
-WOMAN 1 : Go to override.

970
00:59:29,171 --> 00:59:31,751
-How is this happening again?
-MAN 1 : Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

971
00:59:31,841 --> 00:59:32,841
WOMAN 2: I'm trying.
There's nothing I can...

972
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:33,921
MAN 2: Well, where is
the feed coming from?

973
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,091
MAN 3: I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...

974
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,301
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

975
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:39,721
WOMAN 2: It's not just our station.

976
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:40,891
What about a backup manual?

977
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,021
AlDE: We have an unauthorized
broadcast cutting through...

978
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,061
Mr. Vice President,
I think you should see this.

979
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:50,521
RODRlGUEZ:
Oh, God, not again.

980
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:52,361
Is the President getting this?

981
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:05,201
Mr. President.

982
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:07,461
Only two lessons remain.

983
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,591
And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.

984
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:14,421
Meet Thomas Richards.

985
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:17,681
Good strong name.
Good strong job.

986
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:22,261
Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

987
01:00:26,141 --> 01:00:28,561
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

988
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,061
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

989
01:00:32,731 --> 01:00:35,651
live on your television in 30 seconds.

990
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:36,861
THOMAS: No!

991
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:40,321
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

992
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,531
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

993
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,371
America,

994
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:48,581
if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,

995
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:50,371
Tom lives.

996
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:51,461
Go!

997
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,051
How did he hack my phone?

998
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:57,091
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

999
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:58,421
I have to make this call.

1000
01:00:58,591 --> 01:00:59,881
l'd strongly advise against that.

1001
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:02,601
This is the right thing to do.

1002
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:31,581
THE MANDARIN: There's just
one lesson left, President Ellis.

1003
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:33,541
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

1004
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:34,631
Because nothing,

1005
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:37,171
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

1006
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:39,221
can save you.

1007
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:43,681
I'll see you soon.

1008
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:49,141
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

1009
01:01:49,231 --> 01:01:50,941
MILITARY AIDE:
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

1010
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:52,851
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

1011
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,061
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

1012
01:01:54,151 --> 01:01:56,321
-Right now.
-Yes, sir.

1013
01:02:09,251 --> 01:02:12,161
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.

1014
01:02:26,601 --> 01:02:28,221
RHODEY: Don't move!

1015
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:33,271
Uh...

1016
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:35,521
Hang on a second.

1017
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:37,401
Hello?

1018
01:02:37,571 --> 01:02:39,231
You ever have a chick straddling you
and you look up

1019
01:02:39,321 --> 01:02:43,151
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

1020
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:44,741
Yeah, l've had that.
Who is this?

1021
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:45,781
TONY: It's me, pal.

1022
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:47,951
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

1023
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,041
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

1024
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:51,501
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

1025
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:52,581
What are you doing?

1026
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:55,791
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AlM, right?

1027
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:56,881
Yeah.

1028
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:00,841
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.

1029
01:03:01,131 --> 01:03:03,171
It's the same as
it's always been, "WarMachine68."

1030
01:03:03,341 --> 01:03:04,301
And password, please.

1031
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,431
Well, look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

1032
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:08,851
It's not the '80s,
nobody says "hack" anymore.

1033
01:03:08,931 --> 01:03:09,931
Give me your login.

1034
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:13,981
"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an "X," all caps.

1035
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:18,691
Yeah, okay.

1036
01:03:18,981 --> 01:03:22,031
That is so much better
than "Iron Patriot."

1037
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:31,741
EMCEE:
Very nice. Very nice.

1038
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:34,501
I have one question for you.

1039
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:37,121
What would you like
for Christmas this year?

1040
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,251
Well, David...

1041
01:03:42,511 --> 01:03:47,131
Do not erase a program from my DVR
unless you are 100% sure...

1042
01:03:52,101 --> 01:03:53,391
EMCEE: One more time!
Ms. Elk Ridge, everybody!

1043
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:54,481
All right.

1044
01:03:56,561 --> 01:03:59,231
CAMERAMAN: Because you
erase my shows!

1045
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:05,111
TONY:
That ain't gonna cut it.

1046
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,241
CAMERAMAN:
We talked about this.

1047
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:10,821
Excuse me, sir.
I don't know who...

1048
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:12,621
Shh.

1049
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:15,961
Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

1050
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:19,081
-Tony Stark is in my van.
-Shh. Keep it down.

1051
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,711
-Tony Stark is in my van!
-No, he's not.

1052
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:21,841
I knew you were still alive!

1053
01:04:22,461 --> 01:04:23,591
Come on in. Close the door.

1054
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:29,761
Oh, wow.
Can I just say, sir...

1055
01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:30,971
Yep.

1056
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:32,931
I am your biggest fan.

1057
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:34,971
Okay. First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

1058
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,311
No, no, no. Just us.

1059
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:37,481
Great. What's your name?

1060
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:39,141
-Gary.
-Gary.

1061
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:42,271
-Oh, wow.
-Right there is fine.

1062
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:43,571
-Okay.
-Okay?

1063
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:44,781
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1064
01:04:45,191 --> 01:04:47,191
-Oh, good. Can I just say?
-What do you want? Yeah.

1065
01:04:47,991 --> 01:04:50,701
I don't know if you can tell,

1066
01:04:50,781 --> 01:04:52,911
but I have, like, patterned
my whole look after you.

1067
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,371
-My hair's a little...
-It's fine.

1068
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:56,001
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

1069
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:57,871
Right.

1070
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:02,001
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

1071
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:03,461
Boom!

1072
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:06,671
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1073
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:09,471
-I'm sorry. Is that me?
-Yeah. It's... I mean...

1074
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:14,311
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

1075
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:17,851
-So it's a little bit...
-Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1076
01:05:17,931 --> 01:05:21,851
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

1077
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:23,861
I got an issue.
I'm chasing bad guys.

1078
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:26,651
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

1079
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:27,861
I don't have enough juice.

1080
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:30,281
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

1081
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:32,571
Recalibrate the ISDNs.

1082
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:34,701
Pump it up by about 40%.

1083
01:05:35,161 --> 01:05:36,291
-Got it.
-All right? It's a mission.

1084
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:37,371
Yeah.

1085
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:39,461
Tony needs Gary.

1086
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,711
And Gary needs Tony.

1087
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,121
-Be quiet about it. Go.
-Yeah.

1088
01:06:05,481 --> 01:06:09,191
KlLLlAN: What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?

1089
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:12,151
Well, uh, I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.

1090
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:16,491
KlLLlAN: Will you please state
your name for the camera?

1091
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:17,831
Ellen Brandt.

1092
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:22,251
Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.

1093
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:23,751
Addiction will not be tolerated.

1094
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:26,791
And those who cannot regulate
will be cut from the program.

1095
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:31,011
Once misfits, cripples...

1096
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:34,761
You are the next iteration
of human evolution.

1097
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:40,931
Everybody, before we start...

1098
01:06:41,181 --> 01:06:44,231
I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter

1099
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:48,441
as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.

1100
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:50,191
Today is your glory.

1101
01:06:50,281 --> 01:06:51,361
Let's begin.

1102
01:07:02,661 --> 01:07:03,961
We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!

1103
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:05,211
Get her out!
Get them out of here!

1104
01:07:12,471 --> 01:07:15,301
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

1105
01:07:17,261 --> 01:07:20,011
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

1106
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:22,311
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1107
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:24,731
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1108
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,561
Got you, pal.

1109
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:31,651
MAYA: What happened?

1110
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:34,321
MAYA: Fun fact.

1111
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:37,531
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1112
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:42,041
the idealistic Wernher von Braun

1113
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,331
dreamed of space travel.

1114
01:07:45,621 --> 01:07:47,461
He stargazed.

1115
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:51,301
Do you know what he said when
the first V-2 hit London?

1116
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:55,761
"The rocket performed perfectly.

1117
01:07:57,681 --> 01:08:00,351
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1118
01:08:01,221 --> 01:08:06,021
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

1119
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:11,651
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

1120
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:14,991
And you look up,

1121
01:08:16,951 --> 01:08:19,321
you're a long way from shore.

1122
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:22,411
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

1123
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,581
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

1124
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:29,211
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

1125
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:31,841
That's exactly what we used to do.

1126
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:34,131
So, don't judge yourself.

1127
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:37,631
Thank you, Pepper.

1128
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:40,641
I really appreciate that.

1129
01:08:48,311 --> 01:08:50,601
-Hi, good evening. Come on in.
-WALTER: Good evening.

1130
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:53,771
Maya, run!

1131
01:08:56,281 --> 01:08:57,611
Hi, Pepper.

1132
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:01,411
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

1133
01:09:01,831 --> 01:09:02,831
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1134
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:05,201
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

1135
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:08,661
Oh, I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark when he threatened us?

1136
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:10,621
l've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1137
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:14,711
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1138
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:17,761
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

1139
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:21,391
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

1140
01:09:26,221 --> 01:09:27,931
This is support team Blue-Zero.

1141
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:30,691
Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

1142
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:31,811
Copy.

1143
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:41,111
Nobody move.

1144
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:47,291
Oh. Support Blue-Zero,

1145
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:49,291
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

1146
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:50,961
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1147
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:53,461
I think you messed up again.

1148
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:56,381
Yes, you're free, uh,
if you weren't before.

1149
01:09:56,671 --> 01:09:57,711
It's... Of course.

1150
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:58,801
Yes, ma'am.

1151
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:00,011
Iron Patriot on the job.

1152
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,171
Happy to help.

1153
01:10:01,381 --> 01:10:02,471
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1154
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:03,841
It's my pleasure.

1155
01:10:11,981 --> 01:10:14,231
Savin?
l've acquired the Patriot armor.

1156
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:15,561
RHODEY: if you want this suit,

1157
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:17,981
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

1158
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:19,781
That's the plan, Colonel.

1159
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:23,951
TONY: Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

1160
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:27,331
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

1161
01:10:27,661 --> 01:10:29,241
-How much have you had?
-Two or three bowls.

1162
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:32,331
-Can you still see straight?
-Sort of.

1163
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:33,501
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

1164
01:10:34,421 --> 01:10:35,421
Jarvis, how are we?

1165
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:37,751
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,

1166
01:10:37,841 --> 01:10:40,881
and then at the end of the sentence
I say the wrong cranberry.

1167
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:42,261
And, sir, you were right.

1168
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:45,011
Once I factored in
available AlM downlink facilities

1169
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:47,511
I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

1170
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:49,931
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa,

1171
01:10:50,021 --> 01:10:51,981
Iran, Pakistan, Syria?
Where is it?

1172
01:10:52,191 --> 01:10:53,481
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

1173
01:10:53,941 --> 01:10:56,441
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

1174
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:57,901
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1175
01:10:57,981 --> 01:10:59,401
but not right now.

1176
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:00,481
Harley, where is he really?

1177
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:02,071
Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.

1178
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:06,241
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.

1179
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:09,281
Okay, first things first, I need the armor.
Where are we at with it?

1180
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:10,791
Uh, it's not charging.

1181
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:21,341
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.

1182
01:11:21,551 --> 01:11:23,841
It may not succeed
in revitalizing the Mark 42.

1183
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:25,881
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

1184
01:11:25,971 --> 01:11:29,811
It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna...
I don't wanna...

1185
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:31,851
Oh, God, not again.

1186
01:11:32,061 --> 01:11:33,641
HARLEY: Tony?

1187
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:37,601
Are you having another attack?

1188
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:38,981
I didn't even mention New York.

1189
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:42,531
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

1190
01:11:42,941 --> 01:11:44,401
Okay, um, uh...

1191
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:47,701
God, what am I gonna do?

1192
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:51,331
Just breathe.
Really, just breathe.

1193
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:54,251
You're a mechanic, right?

1194
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:55,791
Right.

1195
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,961
You said so.

1196
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:00,421
Yes, I did.

1197
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:03,421
Why don't you just build something?

1198
01:12:15,441 --> 01:12:16,481
Okay.

1199
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:18,521
Thanks, kid.

1200
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:07,301
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

1201
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:08,711
My fault again.

1202
01:14:08,801 --> 01:14:11,551
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

1203
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:12,991
Well.

1204
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:16,821
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1205
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:20,411
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1206
01:15:20,491 --> 01:15:21,791
-That's me.
-Ah!

1207
01:15:22,371 --> 01:15:23,411
Nessie.

1208
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:28,591
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

1209
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,171
There's some guy over here.

1210
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:33,471
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

1211
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:34,761
Hey!

1212
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:37,891
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1213
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:39,511
Don't move.

1214
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,721
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

1215
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:42,811
Although the guns are all fake

1216
01:15:42,891 --> 01:15:44,731
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1217
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:47,061
-What?
-Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1218
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:50,321
TONY: Heard enough.

1219
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:52,481
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

1220
01:15:52,651 --> 01:15:53,691
Where?

1221
01:15:53,781 --> 01:15:55,951
Where's the Mandarin?
Where is he?

1222
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,991
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.

1223
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:00,661
-He's here, but he's not here.
-What do you mean?

1224
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:02,831
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

1225
01:16:03,081 --> 01:16:04,661
-It is.
-It's complicated.

1226
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:06,081
Uncomplicate it.
Ladies, out.

1227
01:16:06,171 --> 01:16:07,211
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

1228
01:16:10,461 --> 01:16:11,671
Sit.

1229
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,801
WOMAN 1 : Ew!
WOMAN 2: Oh, Jesus.

1230
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:23,971
My name is Trevor.
Trevor Slattery.

1231
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:25,101
TONY: What are you?

1232
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:27,811
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?

1233
01:16:28,101 --> 01:16:30,981
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

1234
01:16:31,071 --> 01:16:33,861
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.

1235
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:36,741
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

1236
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:40,781
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.

1237
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:43,241
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1238
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:51,381
Well, l, um, had a little
problem with, um, substances.

1239
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:55,711
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

1240
01:16:55,801 --> 01:16:58,091
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

1241
01:16:58,261 --> 01:16:59,721
-Next?
-Then,

1242
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:02,681
they approached me
about the role,

1243
01:17:02,761 --> 01:17:04,181
and they knew about the drugs.

1244
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,431
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

1245
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:07,231
They said they'd give me more.

1246
01:17:07,311 --> 01:17:08,351
They gave me things.

1247
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:11,941
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

1248
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:14,271
They gave me things.

1249
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:16,571
Did you just nod off?

1250
01:17:16,741 --> 01:17:17,741
Hey.

1251
01:17:17,821 --> 01:17:19,651
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1252
01:17:19,741 --> 01:17:22,161
And the thing was, he needed someone

1253
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:26,161
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

1254
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:30,581
"He"?

1255
01:17:33,211 --> 01:17:35,171
-Killian?
-Killian.

1256
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:38,091
-He created you?
-He created me.

1257
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:39,801
Custom-made terror threat.

1258
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:42,091
Yes. Yes.

1259
01:17:42,301 --> 01:17:44,051
His think tank thinked it up.

1260
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:46,771
The pathology of a serial killer.

1261
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:49,851
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

1262
01:17:50,351 --> 01:17:53,441
Ready for another lesson?

1263
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:54,981
Blah, blah, blah.

1264
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:56,521
No.

1265
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:58,441
Of course,
it was my performance

1266
01:17:58,531 --> 01:17:59,571
that brought the Mandarin to life.

1267
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:01,151
Your performance?

1268
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:03,201
Where people died?

1269
01:18:03,281 --> 01:18:04,991
No, they didn't.

1270
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:09,001
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

1271
01:18:09,081 --> 01:18:11,211
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1272
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,081
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

1273
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:15,341
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

1274
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:16,591
and he might not wake up.

1275
01:18:16,921 --> 01:18:18,001
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

1276
01:18:18,091 --> 01:18:19,591
You're still going down, pal.

1277
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:20,671
You under...

1278
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:30,271
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1279
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:32,851
-I didn't tell him anything.
-Nothing?

1280
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:34,851
No.

1281
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:36,441
You should have pressed
the panic button.

1282
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:39,651
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1283
01:18:49,121 --> 01:18:50,291
TONY: Ah...

1284
01:18:52,331 --> 01:18:53,421
Okay.

1285
01:19:02,381 --> 01:19:04,011
It's just like old times, huh?

1286
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,101
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.

1287
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:08,811
It wasn't my idea.

1288
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:10,891
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1289
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:12,061
I took his money.

1290
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:14,521
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

1291
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:16,441
-No.
-Yeah.

1292
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:18,191
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

1293
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:20,111
Yeah?

1294
01:19:23,991 --> 01:19:25,491
A lot has happened, Tony.

1295
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:27,911
But I'm close.

1296
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:30,701
EXTREMIS is practically stabilized.

1297
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,951
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

1298
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:34,461
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

1299
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:35,871
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1300
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:37,211
Then help me fix it.

1301
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,881
Did I do that?

1302
01:19:45,221 --> 01:19:46,221
Yes.

1303
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:47,931
I remember the night, not the morning.

1304
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:50,221
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

1305
01:19:50,311 --> 01:19:52,391
-You don't remember?
-I can't help you.

1306
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:56,981
You used to have a moral psychology.

1307
01:19:57,061 --> 01:19:59,231
You used to have ideals.

1308
01:19:59,651 --> 01:20:01,981
You wanted to help people.

1309
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:03,941
Now look at you.

1310
01:20:04,991 --> 01:20:06,951
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

1311
01:20:10,241 --> 01:20:11,781
still has their soul.

1312
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:18,461
Get me out of here.

1313
01:20:21,461 --> 01:20:22,921
Come on.

1314
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:25,511
KlLLlAN: You know what my old man
used to say to me?

1315
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:29,891
One of his favorite of many sayings...

1316
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:34,351
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."

1317
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:36,681
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1318
01:20:36,771 --> 01:20:39,191
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1319
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:41,271
I'm here to thank you.

1320
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:43,651
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

1321
01:20:44,441 --> 01:20:45,901
Desperation.

1322
01:20:46,451 --> 01:20:48,111
If you think back to Switzerland,

1323
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:51,201
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

1324
01:20:51,281 --> 01:20:54,161
Well, for the first 20 minutes,

1325
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:56,581
I actually thought you'd show up.

1326
01:20:56,661 --> 01:20:58,461
And the next hour...

1327
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:04,461
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1328
01:21:04,761 --> 01:21:05,761
If you know what I mean.

1329
01:21:06,131 --> 01:21:09,131
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1330
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:11,891
But as I looked out over that city,

1331
01:21:12,141 --> 01:21:14,811
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,

1332
01:21:14,891 --> 01:21:17,141
no one was even looking.

1333
01:21:17,231 --> 01:21:21,231
I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.

1334
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,021
Anonymity, Tony.

1335
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:26,321
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

1336
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:27,651
Right?

1337
01:21:27,741 --> 01:21:30,151
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

1338
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:32,701
Because the second
you give evil a face,

1339
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:35,741
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,

1340
01:21:35,831 --> 01:21:37,451
you hand the people a target.

1341
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:39,161
You're something else.

1342
01:21:41,421 --> 01:21:42,501
You have met him, I assume?

1343
01:21:42,591 --> 01:21:44,171
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1344
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:46,591
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

1345
01:21:46,671 --> 01:21:48,381
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1346
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:49,511
He's a stage actor.

1347
01:21:50,511 --> 01:21:53,601
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1348
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:55,721
Anyway, the point is,

1349
01:21:55,811 --> 01:21:59,141
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1350
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:00,521
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1351
01:22:01,191 --> 01:22:02,771
What's next for you in your world?

1352
01:22:02,861 --> 01:22:05,571
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift

1353
01:22:05,651 --> 01:22:07,981
that you so graciously imparted to me.

1354
01:22:14,781 --> 01:22:15,781
Desperation.

1355
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:17,791
Now, this is live.

1356
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:21,081
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

1357
01:22:21,171 --> 01:22:24,461
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS

1358
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:25,631
or just give up.

1359
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,551
And if it gives up,

1360
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:32,551
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

1361
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:36,931
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

1362
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:41,641
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1363
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:44,231
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1364
01:22:45,111 --> 01:22:46,111
MAYA: Let him go.

1365
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:48,401
Hold on, hold on.

1366
01:22:49,361 --> 01:22:50,401
Maya...

1367
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,451
I said, let him go.

1368
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,611
What are you doing?

1369
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:57,411
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1370
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:02,501
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1371
01:23:02,581 --> 01:23:03,921
Maya, give me the injector.

1372
01:23:04,001 --> 01:23:06,461
If I die, Killian,

1373
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:09,631
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1374
01:23:09,711 --> 01:23:10,921
We're not doing this, okay?

1375
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:13,051
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

1376
01:23:26,271 --> 01:23:27,311
KlLLlAN: The good news is,

1377
01:23:28,651 --> 01:23:30,901
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

1378
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:41,581
You are a maniac.

1379
01:23:41,661 --> 01:23:43,831
No, I'm a visionary.

1380
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:46,371
But I do own a maniac.

1381
01:23:46,461 --> 01:23:49,421
And he takes the stage tonight.

1382
01:23:53,131 --> 01:23:54,221
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1383
01:23:54,301 --> 01:23:57,261
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1384
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:58,721
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked

1385
01:23:58,801 --> 01:23:59,971
there was somebody
inside of it.

1386
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:07,441
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1387
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:12,611
Hello, Colonel.

1388
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:14,941
Step aside.

1389
01:24:21,951 --> 01:24:23,291
Oh!

1390
01:24:23,371 --> 01:24:25,121
We'll get you out of there.

1391
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:26,331
Don't worry.

1392
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:28,791
You'll damage the armor.

1393
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:30,421
Yes, I will.

1394
01:24:31,001 --> 01:24:32,171
But you can fix it, right?

1395
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:35,761
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

1396
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:37,341
And I want Potts with me.

1397
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:38,431
She's still in Phase Two.

1398
01:24:40,471 --> 01:24:41,511
You're not going deaf, are you?

1399
01:24:58,201 --> 01:25:00,701
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.

1400
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:02,161
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.

1401
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:05,331
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

1402
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:06,541
832 miles.

1403
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:08,121
Very nice.

1404
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:09,541
I'm good like that.

1405
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:11,631
Can you, uh, stop that?

1406
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:13,251
Break it, you bought it.

1407
01:25:15,631 --> 01:25:16,631
I think I bought it.

1408
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:19,221
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

1409
01:25:19,301 --> 01:25:21,681
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

1410
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:23,851
-What are you gonna do to me?
-You'll see.

1411
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:25,561
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1412
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:27,891
This.

1413
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:31,981
That.

1414
01:25:36,741 --> 01:25:38,361
Are you coming out?

1415
01:25:41,111 --> 01:25:42,821
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

1416
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:44,491
All right. Let's go.

1417
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:54,881
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1418
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:02,131
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1419
01:26:02,221 --> 01:26:04,181
This time tomorrow,

1420
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:07,851
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

1421
01:26:07,931 --> 01:26:11,691
and the world's
most feared terrorist in the other.

1422
01:26:11,981 --> 01:26:14,941
I'll own the war on terror.

1423
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:16,981
Create supply and demand.

1424
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:21,401
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1425
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:25,701
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1426
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:28,201
on the ground in five, four, three...

1427
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,581
Come on! Two...

1428
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:32,621
How did we get this shift?

1429
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:34,171
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1430
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:36,041
Put down your weapons.

1431
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:38,501
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

1432
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:40,971
In five, four, bang!

1433
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:42,131
-Ooh!
-Wow. That was...

1434
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:44,051
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

1435
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:45,681
I am just beyond terrified.

1436
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:47,261
Here it comes.

1437
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:49,681
-Three, four...
-Shut up.

1438
01:26:50,021 --> 01:26:51,521
Five, four, three, two, one!

1439
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:54,021
Told you.

1440
01:27:05,741 --> 01:27:06,741
Where's the rest?

1441
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:08,591
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

1442
01:28:14,561 --> 01:28:16,351
Ah! Better late than never.

1443
01:28:22,071 --> 01:28:24,281
Not this time.
Not the face.

1444
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:27,661
Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

1445
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,071
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.

1446
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,661
GUARD: All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.

1447
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:39,631
Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.

1448
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:40,921
Ah! Let's go!

1449
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:42,591
Aw, crap.

1450
01:28:55,391 --> 01:28:56,391
Tony?

1451
01:28:56,601 --> 01:28:57,771
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

1452
01:28:57,941 --> 01:28:59,941
-No. You got yours?
-Uh... Mmm.

1453
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:02,151
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

1454
01:29:02,521 --> 01:29:04,031
There's somebody l'd like you to meet.

1455
01:29:08,951 --> 01:29:11,571
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1456
01:29:11,781 --> 01:29:14,161
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1457
01:29:14,241 --> 01:29:15,451
What's this? I had winners.

1458
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:24,801
What have you come as?

1459
01:29:25,131 --> 01:29:27,301
You make a move,
and I break your face.

1460
01:29:28,761 --> 01:29:32,261
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1461
01:29:32,681 --> 01:29:33,721
This is the Mandarin?

1462
01:29:33,891 --> 01:29:35,811
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

1463
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:37,681
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1464
01:29:38,021 --> 01:29:40,901
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1465
01:29:40,981 --> 01:29:42,861
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1466
01:29:42,981 --> 01:29:44,731
there's some people l'd like to roll on.

1467
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:46,281
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1468
01:29:46,361 --> 01:29:48,491
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1469
01:29:48,651 --> 01:29:50,111
Doing what?

1470
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:52,361
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!

1471
01:29:52,911 --> 01:29:56,161
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1472
01:29:56,241 --> 01:29:57,241
Spill.

1473
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:58,411
RHODEY: Do you know
what they did to my suit?

1474
01:29:58,501 --> 01:29:59,541
What? No.

1475
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:02,081
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1476
01:30:02,171 --> 01:30:05,591
Something to do with a big boat.

1477
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:07,001
I can take you there.

1478
01:30:07,671 --> 01:30:09,551
Olé, olé, olé, olé...

1479
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:12,641
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1480
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:16,681
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1481
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:18,431
Is that...
Is that important?

1482
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:20,311
-Somewhat.
-Yeah, a little bit.

1483
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:24,151
TONY: So?

1484
01:30:24,691 --> 01:30:26,071
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?

1485
01:30:26,151 --> 01:30:27,231
I mean, we don't have any transport.

1486
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:28,321
Right.

1487
01:30:30,201 --> 01:30:31,321
Hey, Ringo.

1488
01:30:31,401 --> 01:30:34,031
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1489
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:38,741
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1490
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:39,951
But we also have to figure out this

1491
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:41,791
-Vice president thing, right?
-Right.

1492
01:30:41,871 --> 01:30:43,081
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1493
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:44,171
Oh! That's the vice president.

1494
01:30:44,421 --> 01:30:45,711
Thanks.

1495
01:30:46,341 --> 01:30:47,461
Hello?

1496
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:49,211
TONY: Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1497
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:51,171
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1498
01:30:51,341 --> 01:30:53,551
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1499
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:55,141
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1500
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:57,931
Mr. Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1501
01:30:58,011 --> 01:31:00,271
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1502
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:03,641
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1503
01:31:03,731 --> 01:31:04,771
I think we're good, here.

1504
01:31:04,861 --> 01:31:06,861
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.

1505
01:31:07,231 --> 01:31:08,941
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1506
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:10,571
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.

1507
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:12,281
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1508
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:14,611
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1509
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:17,621
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1510
01:31:17,781 --> 01:31:19,201
-Thank you, Colonel.
-Rhodes and Stark out.

1511
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,831
Everything okay, sir?

1512
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:24,921
Couldn't be better.

1513
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:33,261
I love you, babe.

1514
01:31:53,861 --> 01:31:55,361
Colonel Rhodes.

1515
01:31:55,451 --> 01:31:58,781
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1516
01:32:03,621 --> 01:32:04,751
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1517
01:32:04,831 --> 01:32:07,631
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1518
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:09,421
JARVIS: Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.

1519
01:32:09,501 --> 01:32:11,631
The cranes have finally arrived,

1520
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:13,761
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.

1521
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:15,551
TONY: And what about
the suit I'm wearing?

1522
01:32:15,721 --> 01:32:17,971
JARVIS: The armor is now at 92%.

1523
01:32:18,051 --> 01:32:20,141
That's going to have to do.

1524
01:32:28,441 --> 01:32:30,271
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.

1525
01:32:30,361 --> 01:32:31,401
Sure.

1526
01:32:32,441 --> 01:32:33,821
Oh!

1527
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:49,711
Everything all right, Colonel?

1528
01:33:22,701 --> 01:33:24,741
It is an honor, Mr. President.

1529
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:27,121
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1530
01:33:27,711 --> 01:33:29,461
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.

1531
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:31,041
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1532
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:33,631
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

1533
01:33:33,711 --> 01:33:35,631
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1534
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:36,881
Get me eyes on it now.

1535
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:39,171
Image coming through now, sir.

1536
01:33:41,591 --> 01:33:43,391
Was that Rhodes?

1537
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:53,901
MAN: Is anyone there?

1538
01:33:54,231 --> 01:33:55,901
WOMAN: Let us out!

1539
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:13,881
TONY: The President.

1540
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:15,591
Now.

1541
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:16,671
He's not here.

1542
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:22,551
Try the jet stream?

1543
01:34:23,721 --> 01:34:25,601
Speaking of which, go fish.

1544
01:34:48,331 --> 01:34:50,291
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1545
01:35:03,301 --> 01:35:04,301
How many in the air?

1546
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:06,011
JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.

1547
01:35:07,931 --> 01:35:09,971
-How many can I carry?
-JARVIS: Four, sir.

1548
01:35:19,361 --> 01:35:21,571
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

1549
01:35:28,081 --> 01:35:30,621
HEATHER: Oh, God! No! No!

1550
01:35:31,081 --> 01:35:33,461
TONY: Listen to me.
See that guy?

1551
01:35:33,671 --> 01:35:35,331
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

1552
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:37,041
-You got it?
-What? Oh!

1553
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:42,881
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

1554
01:35:44,131 --> 01:35:45,341
We can do this, Heather.

1555
01:35:54,231 --> 01:35:56,481
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1556
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,941
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

1557
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:03,111
That's what we're going to do.

1558
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:04,451
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.

1559
01:36:04,531 --> 01:36:05,901
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

1560
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:12,241
Nice.

1561
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:14,251
JARVIS: 10,000 feet.

1562
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:18,881
6,000 feet.

1563
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,591
Come on, people.

1564
01:36:21,551 --> 01:36:22,751
Come on, come on, come on!

1565
01:36:26,051 --> 01:36:27,181
Yeah!

1566
01:36:27,721 --> 01:36:29,091
JARVIS: 1,000 feet.

1567
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:31,851
400 feet.

1568
01:36:32,431 --> 01:36:33,641
200 feet, sir.

1569
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:34,851
TONY: He's a chunky monkey,
let's get him.

1570
01:36:35,891 --> 01:36:37,061
Hello.

1571
01:36:58,421 --> 01:36:59,501
MAN: We made it!

1572
01:37:00,251 --> 01:37:01,711
Nice work, guys!

1573
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:04,421
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

1574
01:37:04,711 --> 01:37:05,801
All right, Jarvis.

1575
01:37:05,881 --> 01:37:07,421
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

1576
01:37:15,311 --> 01:37:16,891
That came out of nowhere.

1577
01:37:16,981 --> 01:37:18,191
Wow.

1578
01:37:18,601 --> 01:37:19,731
Give me some good news, man.

1579
01:37:19,811 --> 01:37:20,811
I think they all made it.

1580
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:21,861
Oh, thank God.

1581
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:22,941
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1582
01:37:23,441 --> 01:37:25,321
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

1583
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:27,531
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

1584
01:37:27,611 --> 01:37:29,661
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?

1585
01:37:29,741 --> 01:37:31,661
The House Party Protocol, sir?

1586
01:37:31,741 --> 01:37:32,781
Correct.

1587
01:38:03,151 --> 01:38:04,481
Hi.

1588
01:38:11,991 --> 01:38:14,321
You think he's gonna help you?

1589
01:38:14,991 --> 01:38:16,411
He won't.

1590
01:38:20,871 --> 01:38:24,791
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...

1591
01:38:25,251 --> 01:38:27,961
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

1592
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,261
You're here as my, um...

1593
01:38:31,181 --> 01:38:33,011
Trophy.

1594
01:38:33,141 --> 01:38:35,181
Mmm.

1595
01:38:45,321 --> 01:38:46,571
Good evening, sir.

1596
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:53,951
Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

1597
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:04,041
KlLLlAN: Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?

1598
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:08,921
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

1599
01:39:11,261 --> 01:39:12,381
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1600
01:39:12,631 --> 01:39:13,631
And, of course, you'll remember

1601
01:39:13,721 --> 01:39:16,391
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

1602
01:39:16,641 --> 01:39:19,391
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1603
01:39:19,811 --> 01:39:21,561
What do you want from me?

1604
01:39:22,521 --> 01:39:23,771
Uh, nothing, sir.

1605
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:27,611
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1606
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:29,731
You see, l've moved on.

1607
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:32,191
I found myself
a new political patron,

1608
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:35,411
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

1609
01:39:36,411 --> 01:39:38,241
String him up.

1610
01:39:39,741 --> 01:39:40,911
Hey!

1611
01:39:57,011 --> 01:39:58,641
Come on.

1612
01:40:02,141 --> 01:40:04,061
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

1613
01:40:04,141 --> 01:40:05,851
TONY: I hope not.

1614
01:40:30,501 --> 01:40:32,341
Oh, my God.

1615
01:40:32,461 --> 01:40:36,091
He's strung up over the oil
tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.

1616
01:40:36,181 --> 01:40:38,761
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

1617
01:40:38,851 --> 01:40:40,641
Yeah, death by oil.

1618
01:40:46,811 --> 01:40:48,651
Broadcast will commence shortly.

1619
01:40:48,731 --> 01:40:49,861
Take final positions.

1620
01:40:51,321 --> 01:40:52,441
Okay. That's good.

1621
01:40:52,531 --> 01:40:56,361
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1622
01:40:57,531 --> 01:40:58,781
Is your gun up?

1623
01:40:58,871 --> 01:41:00,451
Yep. What do I do?

1624
01:41:00,531 --> 01:41:02,991
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

1625
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:05,331
Six, high, back. All right.

1626
01:41:14,261 --> 01:41:15,551
You see that? Nailed it.

1627
01:41:16,171 --> 01:41:17,381
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1628
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:18,681
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1629
01:41:18,761 --> 01:41:19,761
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1630
01:41:21,471 --> 01:41:22,931
All personnel, we have hostiles

1631
01:41:23,011 --> 01:41:24,011
-on east unit 12.
-MAN: Over there!

1632
01:41:24,271 --> 01:41:25,851
-I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
-I'm out. Give me...

1633
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:28,231
-You got extra magazines?
-They're not universal, Tony.

1634
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:30,441
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

1635
01:41:30,521 --> 01:41:31,811
-One of yours.
-I don't have one that fits that gun.

1636
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:32,981
You've got, like, five of them.

1637
01:41:33,071 --> 01:41:34,271
Here's what I'm going to do.

1638
01:41:34,441 --> 01:41:36,321
Save my spot, ready?

1639
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:39,201
-What'd you see?
-Too fast. Nothing.

1640
01:41:39,281 --> 01:41:40,571
Here we go.

1641
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:46,371
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

1642
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:58,011
God, I would kill
for some armor right now.

1643
01:41:58,091 --> 01:42:00,051
-You're right. We need backup.
-Yeah, a bunch.

1644
01:42:01,721 --> 01:42:02,841
You know what?

1645
01:42:06,811 --> 01:42:07,891
RHODEY: Is that...

1646
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:09,851
Yep.

1647
01:42:09,941 --> 01:42:11,521
-Are those...
-Yeah.

1648
01:42:28,251 --> 01:42:29,501
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1649
01:42:34,841 --> 01:42:37,501
TONY: Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1650
01:42:37,591 --> 01:42:39,421
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1651
01:42:39,921 --> 01:42:40,921
Yes, sir.

1652
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:47,811
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1653
01:42:49,311 --> 01:42:50,351
Take them to church.

1654
01:42:57,441 --> 01:42:59,111
JARVIS: Gentlemen.

1655
01:43:06,371 --> 01:43:07,371
TONY: Incoming!

1656
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:13,621
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1657
01:43:26,641 --> 01:43:28,641
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

1658
01:43:28,721 --> 01:43:29,811
Everybody needs a hobby.

1659
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:37,691
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

1660
01:44:06,261 --> 01:44:07,841
TONY: Nice timing.

1661
01:44:07,931 --> 01:44:10,141
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

1662
01:44:11,521 --> 01:44:13,271
Oh, I'm sorry,
they're only coded to me.

1663
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:15,601
What does that mean?
I got you covered.

1664
01:44:18,901 --> 01:44:21,271
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?

1665
01:44:21,361 --> 01:44:22,821
Very funny.

1666
01:44:39,881 --> 01:44:41,171
JARVIS: Sir, l've located Ms. Potts.

1667
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:42,251
About time.

1668
01:44:54,811 --> 01:44:59,731
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1669
01:45:00,771 --> 01:45:04,401
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1670
01:45:05,571 --> 01:45:06,821
You're such a jerk.

1671
01:45:06,991 --> 01:45:08,241
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1672
01:45:10,831 --> 01:45:12,081
Come on. A little more, baby.

1673
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:21,251
Oh!

1674
01:45:28,591 --> 01:45:29,631
Is this guy bothering you?

1675
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:32,801
Don't get up.

1676
01:45:35,981 --> 01:45:36,981
Ooh.

1677
01:45:37,441 --> 01:45:38,561
Is it hot in there?

1678
01:45:40,861 --> 01:45:42,061
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1679
01:45:43,321 --> 01:45:46,611
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

1680
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:47,941
Oh, Tony.

1681
01:45:48,031 --> 01:45:50,031
She's watching.

1682
01:45:51,701 --> 01:45:52,951
I think you should close your eyes.

1683
01:45:53,451 --> 01:45:54,951
Close your eyes.

1684
01:45:55,621 --> 01:45:57,791
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

1685
01:46:05,131 --> 01:46:06,921
Yeah, you take a minute.

1686
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:41,581
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1687
01:46:52,591 --> 01:46:53,591
Oh, come on!

1688
01:46:55,511 --> 01:46:58,721
Mr. President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1689
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:02,021
Just hold on. Hold on.

1690
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:16,241
Okay.

1691
01:47:23,751 --> 01:47:25,041
Bye-bye.

1692
01:47:36,761 --> 01:47:37,931
Brace yourself.

1693
01:47:48,901 --> 01:47:50,781
You look damn good, Mr. President,

1694
01:47:50,941 --> 01:47:52,401
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1695
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:07,131
RHODEY: The President
is secure, Tony

1696
01:48:07,211 --> 01:48:08,541
-I'm clearing the area.
-Nice work.

1697
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:11,341
-Ready, sir?
-What do you mean "ready"?

1698
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:22,851
TONY: Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

1699
01:48:22,931 --> 01:48:23,931
Just look at me!

1700
01:48:26,441 --> 01:48:28,441
Honey, I can't reach any
further and you can't stay there.

1701
01:48:28,771 --> 01:48:30,231
All right?
You've got to let go.

1702
01:48:30,691 --> 01:48:33,781
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

1703
01:48:35,531 --> 01:48:37,201
No!

1704
01:49:03,971 --> 01:49:07,101
A shame. I would've caught her.

1705
01:49:38,181 --> 01:49:39,261
Eject.

1706
01:50:24,681 --> 01:50:26,261
Well, here we are on the roof.

1707
01:50:36,981 --> 01:50:38,071
JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.

1708
01:50:38,241 --> 01:50:41,571
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

1709
01:50:57,551 --> 01:50:58,551
Whatever.

1710
01:50:59,761 --> 01:51:01,261
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1711
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:06,641
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

1712
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:11,771
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

1713
01:51:11,941 --> 01:51:14,231
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1714
01:51:15,611 --> 01:51:17,521
Here's where you're wrong.

1715
01:51:17,611 --> 01:51:18,821
She was already perfect.

1716
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:28,201
Jarvis,

1717
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:30,791
do me a favor and blow Mark 42.

1718
01:51:31,211 --> 01:51:32,291
No...

1719
01:52:46,241 --> 01:52:48,321
No more false faces.

1720
01:52:49,201 --> 01:52:50,991
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1721
01:52:52,161 --> 01:52:54,871
You're looking right at him.

1722
01:52:55,211 --> 01:52:58,211
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

1723
01:52:58,711 --> 01:53:00,381
I am the Mandarin!

1724
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:13,061
I got nothing.

1725
01:53:19,901 --> 01:53:22,651
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1726
01:53:30,911 --> 01:53:32,831
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?

1727
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:45,091
Whoo!

1728
01:53:58,941 --> 01:54:00,141
TONY: Honey?

1729
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:06,071
Oh, my God.

1730
01:54:07,611 --> 01:54:09,821
That was really violent.

1731
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:12,821
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

1732
01:54:12,991 --> 01:54:15,031
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1733
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:20,161
Who's the hot mess now?

1734
01:54:20,331 --> 01:54:22,421
It's still debatable.

1735
01:54:22,961 --> 01:54:24,251
Probably tipping your way a little bit.

1736
01:54:24,341 --> 01:54:26,381
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?

1737
01:54:26,461 --> 01:54:28,381
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1738
01:54:28,471 --> 01:54:31,681
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1739
01:54:31,841 --> 01:54:34,391
What am I going to complain
about now?

1740
01:54:35,221 --> 01:54:36,851
Well, it's me.

1741
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:38,681
You'll think of something.

1742
01:54:40,271 --> 01:54:41,641
-No, don't touch me.
-Don't worry about it.

1743
01:54:41,731 --> 01:54:43,651
-No, I'm gonna burn you.
-No, you're not.

1744
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:45,691
Not hot.

1745
01:54:47,111 --> 01:54:48,781
Am I gonna be okay?

1746
01:54:48,861 --> 01:54:49,861
No.

1747
01:54:49,951 --> 01:54:52,661
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

1748
01:54:52,951 --> 01:54:54,781
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1749
01:54:55,031 --> 01:54:56,741
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

1750
01:54:56,831 --> 01:54:59,951
I think I can get you better.

1751
01:55:00,581 --> 01:55:03,081
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1752
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:05,461
And all your distractions?

1753
01:55:06,001 --> 01:55:08,091
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

1754
01:55:08,341 --> 01:55:10,721
Jarvis. Hey.

1755
01:55:10,801 --> 01:55:14,091
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1756
01:55:14,341 --> 01:55:16,301
You know what to do.

1757
01:55:16,391 --> 01:55:19,141
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?

1758
01:55:19,221 --> 01:55:22,391
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1759
01:55:58,681 --> 01:55:59,971
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?

1760
01:56:02,561 --> 01:56:03,561
It'll do.

1761
01:56:12,651 --> 01:56:15,361
TONY: And so,
as Christmas morning began,

1762
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:18,161
my journey had reached its end.

1763
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:23,541
You start with something pure,

1764
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:28,791
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.

1765
01:56:29,921 --> 01:56:31,591
The compromises.

1766
01:56:38,141 --> 01:56:40,851
We create our own demons.

1767
01:56:41,561 --> 01:56:43,601
Oh!

1768
01:56:46,101 --> 01:56:48,271
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!

1769
01:56:49,821 --> 01:56:53,531
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.

1770
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:57,411
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"

1771
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:04,581
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,

1772
01:57:04,661 --> 01:57:08,171
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.

1773
01:57:08,581 --> 01:57:11,631
And now, neither will I.

1774
01:57:12,421 --> 01:57:14,301
Let me tell you...

1775
01:57:14,381 --> 01:57:16,551
...that was the best sleep
l'd had in years.

1776
01:57:37,451 --> 01:57:39,411
It's okay. It's okay.

1777
01:57:39,491 --> 01:57:40,531
It's okay.

1778
01:57:40,621 --> 01:57:41,621
No, look.

1779
01:58:58,901 --> 01:59:02,951
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...

1780
01:59:03,031 --> 01:59:07,331
I guess l'd say my armor,
it was never a distraction,

1781
01:59:07,411 --> 01:59:09,501
or a hobby.

1782
01:59:09,581 --> 01:59:11,581
It was a cocoon.

1783
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,581
And now,

1784
01:59:15,541 --> 01:59:17,841
I'm a changed man.

1785
01:59:26,761 --> 01:59:30,431
You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.

1786
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:34,271
One thing you can't take away...

1787
01:59:36,821 --> 01:59:38,611
I am Iron Man.

1788
02:09:04,421 --> 02:09:06,761
TONY: You know, and thank you
by the way. For listening.

1789
02:09:06,841 --> 02:09:09,301
Plus, something about just getting it off
my chest,

1790
02:09:09,391 --> 02:09:12,931
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...

1791
02:09:13,021 --> 02:09:15,731
I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.

1792
02:09:15,811 --> 02:09:18,851
Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.

1793
02:09:18,941 --> 02:09:21,441
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

1794
02:09:21,521 --> 02:09:22,651
and my experiences with someone,

1795
02:09:22,731 --> 02:09:25,281
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

1796
02:09:25,361 --> 02:09:26,741
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

1797
02:09:26,821 --> 02:09:28,611
Everything comes full circle.

1798
02:09:28,701 --> 02:09:30,121
And the fact that you've been able to

1799
02:09:30,201 --> 02:09:32,081
help me process...

1800
02:09:34,621 --> 02:09:36,081
-Are you with me?
-Sorry... I was, yeah.

1801
02:09:36,161 --> 02:09:37,251
We were at, uh...

1802
02:09:37,461 --> 02:09:38,671
Are you actively napping?

1803
02:09:38,791 --> 02:09:41,041
I was... I... I drifted.

1804
02:09:41,541 --> 02:09:42,711
Where did I lose you?

1805
02:09:44,711 --> 02:09:46,381
Elevator in Switzerland.

1806
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:49,431
So, you heard none of it.

1807
02:09:49,761 --> 02:09:52,721
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

1808
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:54,641
I'm not a therapist.

1809
02:09:54,811 --> 02:09:56,681
-It's not my training.
-So?

1810
02:09:56,811 --> 02:09:58,441
-I don't have the...
-What? The time?

1811
02:09:58,521 --> 02:09:59,771
Temperament.

1812
02:10:00,061 --> 02:10:01,561
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

1813
02:10:01,651 --> 02:10:03,021
Oh! God, my original wound.

1814
02:10:03,271 --> 02:10:05,441
-1983, all right?
-Yes.

1815
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:08,241
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
