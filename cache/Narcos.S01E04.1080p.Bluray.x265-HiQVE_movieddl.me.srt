19
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,802
Murphy, join the party, huh?

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,690
What's wrong?

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,888
All you guys having a good time?

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,566
You gotta let it go, man.
There's good that came out of this.

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,528
Yeah, we used him,
then we got him killed.

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,365
No, we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,807
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,126
Look on the bright side, huh?

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,048
Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

28
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,528
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,967
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,330
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,006
Finally, the Colombian government
had to react.

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,123
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,043
PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100,000 REWARD

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,331
Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,050
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,566
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US,

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,166
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,487
This made all the difference in the world.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,484
If you were a narco in Colombia,

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,404
jail time meant banging girls,
watching movies,

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,204
hanging with the fellas...

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,285
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,203
It was a fucking joke.

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,801
Back home,
it was a whole different deal.

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,680
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,049
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day,
just like every other loser,

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,690
a fucking nightmare.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,601
Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.

49
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,324
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,926
- With our help, you will.
- Oh, that's right.

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,530
Gringos to the rescue.

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,361
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,929
One man with helicopters, airplanes,
vehicles, planned escape routes,

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,771
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money,

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,247
- men, weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,362
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,890
Help us catch him.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,970
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,644
Let me take care of that.

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,610
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

61
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,208
Escobar will not go lightly.

62
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,651
He will make Colombia bleed.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,289
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,967
You make the mistakes,
and then you preach solidarity?

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,361
- Shut up, fag.
- What the fuck, Carlos?

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,570
Why are you always defending him?

67
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,608
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,486
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,451
Gentlemen...

70
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,561
I suggest we form another organization

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,087
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

72
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,367
Like John Lennon said,

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,928
- "Come together, brothers and sisters..."
- Stop that fag shit right now.

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,129
So Jorge...

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,241
what will we call it?

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,601
First, "Death to Kidnappers,"
then "the Extraditables."

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,011
Once again, the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,721
But it was not quite like
"one for all, and all for one."

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,489
it was more like each man for himself.

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,971
Next!

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,204
Gacha, being Gacha, decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,325
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- Fire!

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,643
So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,562
Next!

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,526
Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

86
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,008
The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,443
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,682
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

89
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,604
I mean, all of our problems...

90
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,964
are because of those imperialist gringos!

91
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,606
No, stay there... stay there.

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,651
As for the Ochoa brothers,
they went with a fancy PR firm

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,281
and got ripped off because, well...
that's what PR agencies do.

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,482
"Better a grave in Colombia

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,005
than a grave in the United States."

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,091
No, I've got it, Fabio, I've got it.
Let's see...

97
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,683
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

98
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,250
- What do you think?
- I love it.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,641
Very good.

100
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,162
And for $50,000 more,
we'll make your logo.

101
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,245
Done.

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,326
By the way,
here's the logo $50,000 got you.

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,086
In the upcoming presidential election,
extradition became the defining issue

104
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,525
amongst the candidates.

105
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,171
Those the narcos could buy,
they bought.

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,482
The ones they could scare,
they scared.

107
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,445
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,531
And so, unable to buy him
and unable to scare him,

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,809
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery,

110
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,803
and he wrote Galán a letter.

111
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,605
"And to conclude, I want
to express my most energetic protest

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,411
over the improper interference
of North America

113
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,370
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

114
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,488
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

115
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,209
He's got some balls.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,004
Escobar is shameless.

117
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,688
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galán.

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,809
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States,

119
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,770
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

120
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,730
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

121
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,689
My campaign manager,
Dr. Gaviria,

122
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,240
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,329
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle,

124
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,131
when clearly,
they're losing a war.

125
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,168
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

126
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,522
If you speak in favor
of extradition, you will be their puppet,

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,967
and that will be your death sentence.

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,284
I don't care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,648
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

130
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,051
then let them take them.

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,645
Since he couldn't get to Galán,

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,491
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

133
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,411
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,608
if no judge was willing to apply it.

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,291
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,603
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States,

137
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,082
know we, the Extraditables,
will pass judgment on you

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,731
and bring a sentence far harsher."

139
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,127
The judges were so scared and intimidated

140
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,965
that special court procedures
had to be created.

141
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,486
For the first time
in the history of Colombia,

142
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,450
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

143
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,284
Defendants, please rise.

144
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,840
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

145
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,844
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

146
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,288
Despite his threats,
many brave men defied him.

147
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,882
And true to form,
when the pen failed...

148
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,008
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

149
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,002
In light of this terrorism,
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

150
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,926
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority, right?

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,411
Well, guess again.

152
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,361
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

153
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,081
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

154
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,887
We got FARC, we got M-19,
we got EPL, we got ELN,

155
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,531
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

156
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,366
Sorry, Agent Peña, but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems,

157
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,727
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

158
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,730
Communists. Remember them?

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,246
With Reagan in the White House,
it was hard to forget.

160
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,367
In his words:

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,564
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

162
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,970
The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing, always had been.

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,562
In Hollywood, he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

164
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,684
In Washington,
he created the Reagan Doctrine,

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,411
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

166
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,961
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,647
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world,

168
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,881
you'd better be chasing reds.

169
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,482
Ambassador, if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets,

170
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,528
the Colombians will get Escobar.

171
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,649
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

172
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,371
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

173
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,526
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

174
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,888
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker, and as such,

175
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,921
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

176
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,166
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

177
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,890
Let the Colombians get him.

178
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,041
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100,000

179
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,283
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah, it's a fucking joke.

180
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,129
That's about what he spends on shoes,
isn't it?

181
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,329
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

182
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,811
So what do we do now?

183
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,406
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

184
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,087
It's true,
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

185
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,891
But delivered into the right hands,
it could make a difference.

186
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,727
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia,
honorable men.

187
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,721
But the head of counternarcotics,
General Jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em.

188
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,929
And as such,
he was exactly what we needed.

189
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,688
Thank you for seeing me, General.

190
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,364
You're welcome.

191
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,041
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

192
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,523
With all due respect, General Jaramillo...
l propose Horacio Carrillo.

193
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,763
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

194
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,683
Well, I don't want him to follow.

195
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,204
I want him to lead.

196
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,281
Go ahead.

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,489
Yes, General.

198
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,688
As you wish.

199
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,961
Understood.

200
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,168
What happened, honey?

201
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,049
Things with work.

202
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,327
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

203
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,291
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's out with the girlfriend.

204
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,402
Tell me what's wrong.

205
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,331
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

206
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,728
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

207
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,731
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man,

208
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,485
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

209
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,608
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

210
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,681
Hm.

211
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,207
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

212
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,203
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

213
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,965
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

214
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,884
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

215
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,801
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police, you know?

216
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,166
And most of all, to the top brass.

217
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,125
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

218
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,326
Mm.

219
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,284
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,051
Egrets from the Himalayas.

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,646
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

222
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,801
They cost me a million dollars.

223
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,080
Bastards.

224
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,807
Stay in the fucking tree!

225
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,407
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,570
That's your problem, Pablo.

227
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,120
You think that everything
can be controlled,

228
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,720
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

229
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,648
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,048
Your English is really good.

231
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,249
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

232
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,965
How long you been at the comuna?

233
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,128
Just a few weeks.

234
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,771
Is your husband
gonna help us here, too?

235
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,162
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

236
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,002
Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,201
- I fucked up.
- How?

238
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,845
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

239
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,042
No, Jaramillo's sending a message.

240
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,807
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

241
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,451
He's setting Carrillo up for failure,
and when he does fail,

242
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,851
he'll fire him for incompetence,

243
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,725
and me and you,
we lose the only cop we can trust.

244
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,606
- Hey!
- Hey!

245
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,409
- Sorry I'm late, honey.
- Mm...

246
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,970
Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.

247
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,849
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

248
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,967
Nice to meet you.

249
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,447
Are you another... janitor at the embassy,
like Steve?

250
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,642
No, actually, I'm CIA.

251
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,128
But that's classified,
so don't tell anybody.

252
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,761
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,571
- The janitor thing, what, that was you?
- Mm.

254
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,802
No, it's just a cover.

255
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,326
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

256
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,370
Just so you know,
I'm a communist guerrillera.

257
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,641
Perfect.

258
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,320
If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

259
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,963
we probably wouldn't have cared.

260
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,327
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,483
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

262
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,643
He had better resources
and better information.

263
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,161
And at the time,
he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

264
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,250
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

265
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,927
And cops...
he owned a lot of them, too.

266
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,167
But not all of them.

267
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,724
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

268
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,371
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

269
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,681
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

270
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,406
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

271
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,049
Trapped a little bird.

272
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,730
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,887
Jesus.

274
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,807
Just remember that you wanted all in.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,889
Hand me that coffee.

276
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,126
He already gave up
the name of three fincas,

277
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,481
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

278
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,609
But you do know
where he is hiding, don't you?

279
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,722
Look, little brother,

280
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,043
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

281
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,967
But I will also kill you.

282
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,131
And very slowly.

283
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,365
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

284
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,088
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

285
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,962
We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out,

286
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,562
but there was a small part of me
that thought, in his arrogance,

287
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,808
he would stand and fight.

288
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,326
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

289
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,289
Boss!

290
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,361
Poison...

291
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,771
Boss!

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,004
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

293
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,845
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

294
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,166
Two hours, boss.

295
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,728
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

296
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,723
- We're leaving.
- All right.

297
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,810
We have to go.

298
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,131
Go where?

299
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,884
The police are coming.

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,247
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry, my love,

301
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,211
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

302
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,169
We'll buy new ones later,
won't we?

303
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,286
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,124
Do you hear me complaining?

305
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,165
As long as you're with us, Pablo,
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

306
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,207
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,611
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

308
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,843
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

309
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,251
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

310
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,766
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

311
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,403
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

312
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,164
Yes, sir!

313
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,043
What's wrong, Gustavo?

314
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,530
You fucked us, Pablo.

315
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,122
Not only you and me.

316
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,844
You fucked the whole family.

317
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,566
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

318
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,331
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

319
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,721
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

320
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,404
But what the fuck...

321
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,247
a man only dies once, right?

322
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,645
Come here.

323
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,805
My brother.

324
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,451
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

325
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,609
There we go.

326
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,761
I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

327
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,281
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,

328
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,763
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

329
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,925
You may have 800 houses, my friend,
but none of them is home.

330
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,083
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life,

331
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,130
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

332
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,726
From now on, nowhere is safe.

333
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,161
The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

334
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,561
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

335
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,886
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

336
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,688
Hey, if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too.

337
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,686
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

338
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,570
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

339
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,120
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

340
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,331
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit,
I got very lucky.

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,130
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

342
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,965
We raided it,
and guess who we found?

343
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,201
Blackbeard.

344
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,648
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

345
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,245
In custody,
he would describe a cocaine empire

346
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,166
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

347
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,050
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

348
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,489
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice,

349
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,767
home of Colombia's supreme court,

350
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,411
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

351
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,209
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

352
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,645
Fuck.

353
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,440
Fuck.

354
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,568
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

355
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,802
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

356
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,241
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

357
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,448
Javi, there's some good stuff in here,
stuff we can use.

358
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,727
None of it can leave the room.

359
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,571
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

360
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,490
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

361
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

362
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,486
Take 'em.

363
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,651
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

364
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,688
What are you talking about?

365
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,240
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

366
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,084
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

367
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,606
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

368
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,409
They're not gonna
search a white boy, OK?

369
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,721
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

370
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,921
Just do it.

371
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,531
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

372
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,683
- And sometimes, bad people...
- Señor.

373
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
...help you do good things.

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,651
These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

375
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,770
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

376
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,327
Yes.

377
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,445
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

378
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,010
Obviously, it's an alias.

379
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,005
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

380
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,361
Because he's not Colombian.

381
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,964
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

382
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,769
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

383
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,962
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

384
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,568
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

385
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,731
Suarez, do you ever worry
what will happen to you

386
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,088
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

387
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,811
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

388
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,527
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

389
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,405
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

390
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,371
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

391
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,848
Wha... What the fuck is this?

392
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,524
This is me giving you homework.

393
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,001
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,850
And I need you to find out who it is.

395
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,805
First off, I don't fucking work for you,
Murphy, you hear me?

396
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,770
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

397
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,288
What's he up to these days?

398
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,686
Barry Seal.

399
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,047
Barry Seal, a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football,

400
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,811
mind-altering chemicals,
and pussy...

401
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,441
which made him perfect CIA material.

402
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,730
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

403
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,523
Finding Barry was easy.

404
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,683
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

405
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,241
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite, too.

406
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,926
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

407
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,326
No, I'm serious.

408
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,731
Look.

409
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,009
Oh, my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

410
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,565
Until next time.

411
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,049
- Goddamn, is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

412
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,561
Come on, we got you a ride
waiting over here.

413
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,324
Hi, Vanessa.

414
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,045
It's fun to say, though,
ain't it? "McPickle"?

415
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,444
Have a seat, Barry.

416
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,165
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

417
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,971
Well, you guys ain't got shit.

418
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,807
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

419
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,882
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

420
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,682
Yeah? Well, let's see
if that holds up in court, huh?

421
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,487
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

422
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,289
without making a refueling stop.

423
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,689
Yeah, according to the records,
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

424
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,326
The manifests don't lie.

425
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,530
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine,

426
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,286
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?

427
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,251
Well, damn...
you guys are good.

428
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,685
Communist sympathizer.

429
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,762
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big, red bow

430
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,644
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

431
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,200
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments,

432
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,851
that's treason and trafficking.

433
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,281
What's that,
two life sentences for the price of one?

434
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,526
That's right.

435
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,650
Well... see,
I figured this day might come.

436
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,764
Why don't you uncuff me, boys.
I got something to show you.

437
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,966
Yeah? What's that?

438
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,765
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

439
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,242
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on, uncuff me.

440
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,800
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

441
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,891
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

442
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,010
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas,

443
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,890
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

444
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,691
for cocaine shipments to the US.

445
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,810
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

446
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,211
I couldn't have made that up.

447
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,169
- Holy shit.
- It was too good.

448
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,050
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait, wait, wait. No.

449
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,885
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

450
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,442
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

451
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,682
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

452
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,242
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

453
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,561
- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

454
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,167
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

455
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,808
I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants,

456
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,963
but frankly,
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

457
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,929
He was just another busted trafficker

458
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,607
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

459
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,327
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

460
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,563
to get the resources we needed,
then fuck him.

461
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,967
Strange bedfellows, indeed.

462
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,806
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

463
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,008
Washington is gonna go crazy.

464
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,484
Thank you, Ambassador.

465
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,930
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

466
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,126
Of course.

467
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,407
Thank you.

468
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,402
In Washington, "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

469
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,531
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

470
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,530
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

471
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,003
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

472
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,289
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

473
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,603
This picture shows Federico Vaughan,

474
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,526
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua,

475
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,561
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

476
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,884
No, there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

477
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,209
Being a rat is a dangerous business,

478
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,408
and Escobar's reach was long.

479
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,131
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

480
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,329
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

481
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,846
Whoops.

482
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,371
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

483
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,569
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña, if he wanted a long life,

484
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,405
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

485
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,251
I didn't kill him, Escobar did.

486
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,527
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

487
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,762
Look on the bright side, man.

488
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,768
From then on, according to Reagan,

489
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,287
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

490
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,001
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

491
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,050
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

492
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,564
planes, helicopters,
you fucking name it. Everything.

493
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,764
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

494
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,402
and burn 'em straight to the ground,
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

495
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,524
We were kicking ass,
and the narcos were feeling it.

496
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,090
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

497
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,444
Despite all this, we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

498
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,241
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether,

499
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,090
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

500
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,202
Got it!

501
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,451
The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia,

502
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,002
Medellín's biggest processing lab,
and we hit it hard.

503
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,443
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

504
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,285
but in the end,
it got us our biggest victory to date,

505
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,649
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

506
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,810
In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

507
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,882
ten times this if you give me one hour.

508
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,409
There's no way out,
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

509
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,525
Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States,

510
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,084
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

511
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,283
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

512
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,441
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

513
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,842
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán,

514
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,164
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

515
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,601
Extradition would become his battle cry.

516
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,609
Gentlemen?

517
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,651
Thank you.

518
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,726
And for the narcos,
this was a declaration of war.

519
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,969
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

520
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,243
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

521
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,006
against the legality of extradition.

522
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,007
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

523
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,686
Can we buy someone in that court?

524
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,842
Unfortunately, no.

525
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,402
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

526
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,484
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

527
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,370
Brother... even after he's dead,

528
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,803
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

529
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,803
He's totally fucked.

530
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,530
This is gringo bullshit.

531
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,400
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

532
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,728
We're next, aren't we?

533
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,849
You're right.

534
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,843
Pablito?

535
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,410
Do you have an answer or what?

536
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,044
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

537
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,327
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

538
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,971
Carlos was one of us.

539
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,846
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

540
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,208
But remember,
there's something they want more than us.

541
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,409
So, brothers...

542
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,489
it's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

543
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,367
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

544
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,762
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

545
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,209
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

546
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,605
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

547
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,404
Two million US dollars.

548
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,084
It's very dangerous.

549
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,041
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

550
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,965
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous, right?

551
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,769
But for us, brother...

552
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,326
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

553
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,048
We have a historical obligation.

554
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,006
We can't forget that.

555
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,730
I'm his girlfriend.

556
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,890
Meet Pablo Escobar.

557
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,966
Miss.

558
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,724
- OK.
- We have a deal.

559
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,245
All right, then.

560
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,481
We were just leaving.

561
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,925
Good night.

562
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,527
What the hell is this?

563
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,768
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

564
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,561
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

565
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,324
In exchange for what?

566
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,963
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
I cannot say.

567
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,043
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

568
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,529
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

569
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,445
Connie?

570
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,363
Elisa? What's going on?

571
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,725
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

572
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,802
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

573
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,086
Yeah.

574
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,930
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

575
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,206
About what?

576
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,411
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

577
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,523
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's gonna be bad.

578
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,604
Wait, Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

579
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,247
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

580
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,765
and you need to hide me.

581
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,690
OK. Come on.

582
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,210
Steve's already at work,
but Javi lives downstairs.

583
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,564
I just hope he's here.

584
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,051
I am.

585
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,607
- Well, what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

586
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,170
I'll be right back. Go.

587
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,843
- She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

588
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,890
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

589
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,327
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

590
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,801
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

591
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,086
Escobar and M-19?

592
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,447
She didn't tell me any details,
just that it would be bad.

593
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,443
No... that doesn't make any sense.

594
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,330
She asked me to hide her,
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

595
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,447
OK. All right.

596
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,841
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

597
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,169
Ambassador, I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

598
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,880
- ...supreme court building.
- Oh, my God.

599
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,884
"Oh, my God" is right.

600
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,443
Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

601
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,007
and occupied the supreme court.

602
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,323
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

603
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,086
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

604
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,805
but it was all bullshit.

605
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,171
The military attacked.

606
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,124
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage,

607
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,688
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

608
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,285
Most of the M-19 were killed.

609
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,565
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

610
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,930
setting fire to the room that contained
600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

611
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,691
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

612
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,282
In the United States,
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

613
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,362
so they can't testify in court.

614
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,810
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

615
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,166
The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

616
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,811
as cannon shells exploded inside.

617
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,121
- Where is she?
- Well, come on in.

618
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,563
You, up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

619
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,926
Put the gun away.

620
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,086
Put it away.

621
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,322
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

622
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,562
- Can I say something?
- No, you may not.

623
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,201
Murphy... calm down.

624
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,886
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

625
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,162
Your wife brought her to me.

626
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,565
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife, I truly do,

627
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,688
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

628
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,724
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

629
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,961
If she can tie Escobar to the siege,
I say we bring her in.

630
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,644
Well, she's M-19.

631
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,087
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

632
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,446
and then she gets disappeared.

633
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,761
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

634
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,968
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

635
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,407
Look, all she did was warn us.

636
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,926
She's not on anybody's radar.

637
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,128
She's not involved in anything.

638
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,124
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

639
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,601
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

640
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,771
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

641
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,446
Folks, this is more complicated
than what it seems.

642
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,047
This was Escobar, classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

643
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,891
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

644
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,084
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

645
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,521
He doesn't hold grudges,
not if it suits his purposes.

646
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,525
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

647
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,121
You willing to identify this informant,
Agent Peña?

648
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,926
- No, I am not.
- Needless to say...

649
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,607
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

650
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,808
in light of this communist aggression.

651
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,769
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

652
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,810
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

653
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,128
They're looking for us everywhere.

654
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,168
What did you expect?

655
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,248
That it would be any different?

656
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,769
You did a very good job.

657
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,047
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

658
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,289
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

659
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,010
You, Ivan...

660
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,368
gave me the sword of Simón Bolivar.

661
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,885
The same one that freed this country.

662
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,484
Now it belongs to you.

663
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,410
With it, you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

664
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,570
I promise you,
I will continue the fight.

665
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,768
You earned it, brother.

666
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,049
As for me...

667
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,362
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

668
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,930
We are also...

669
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,448
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

670
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,804
And the fucking sword.

671
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:40,828
