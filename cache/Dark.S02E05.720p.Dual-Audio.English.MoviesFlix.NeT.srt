1
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:11,338
Is it not peculiar
that one feels the greatest aversion

2
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,421
towards the very people
who are most similar to oneself?

3
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,921
I want to know how to get back home.

4
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,380
Get dressed.

5
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,755
JUNE 25, 2020

6
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:06,421
TWO DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

7
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,255
Wait.

8
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,463
I have to show you something.

9
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,005
We've got an appointment.

10
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,213
Maybe you'd better sit down.

11
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:56,338
Can we do this some other time?
We really have to go.

12
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:59,255
It's... I...

13
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,421
I have to tell you something.

14
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:05,338
It sounds totally crazy, but I have
to know what you think about it.

15
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:06,963
Are you nuts?

16
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:11,421
You've hardly spoken to us in months
and now you want to know what we think?

17
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:13,630
Look around you.

18
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:18,421
We're the kids, but you've been acting
like one for months.

19
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:21,880
Mom,
you act as if you're alone with this shit.

20
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,880
But we lost them too.

21
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:33,546
No.

22
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,880
So you want to talk,
that doesn't mean we do!

23
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:51,588
Why is he so interested
in the nuclear power plant?

24
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,880
Find someone at Criminal Investigation
who knows this Clausen guy.

25
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,796
What does he really want here?

26
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,755
Call me as soon as you know something.

27
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,463
Bartosz isn't here.

28
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,880
His bed hasn't been slept in.
He wasn't here all night.

29
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,463
- Maybe he's with Martha.
- They're not together anymore.

30
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:25,130
They must've made up. Have you called?

31
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:26,963
No one's answering.

32
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,296
I'm sure it's nothing.

33
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:34,921
Tell me it'll all be fine.

34
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:45,838
It'll all be fine.

35
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,963
You good, Inspector?

36
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,380
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
EGON TIEDEMANN

37
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,755
FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 26, 1987

38
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:33,463
CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING HIS DEATH STILL UNCLEAR

39
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:39,088
Ms. Tiedemann?

40
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,880
The French delegation.

41
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,880
They're all waiting.
I think you'd better get going.

42
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:50,171
Reschedule.

43
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,546
What?

44
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:01,546
Reschedule.

45
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,005
But I can't just...

46
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,421
Why am I here?

47
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:36,463
A person lives three lives.

48
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:40,296
The first ends with the loss of naïveté,

49
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:43,421
the second with the loss of innocence,

50
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,130
and the third
with the loss of life itself.

51
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:53,921
It is inevitable
that we go through all three stages.

52
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:58,421
You will turn into your older self,

53
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,713
and your older self

54
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,755
into what you see before you.

55
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,963
I don't have time for this shit.

56
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,005
I have to go back home. To my time!

57
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,421
I've seen what will happen.
I've seen their graves.

58
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,380
You still have lots of time.

59
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,213
This is the year 1921.

60
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:24,713
Strictly speaking,
you still have 99 years.

61
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:36,088
Here. A fresh snack.

62
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,046
People can say what they like,

63
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,838
but Reagan is a first-rate guy.

64
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,546
The Olympic Games in East and West Berlin.

65
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,296
I call that visionary.

66
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:55,130
I have the whole speech on VHS.

67
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,671
You haven't been here in a long time.

68
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,838
I just wanted
to quickly check how you are.

69
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,380
It's fine.

70
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:44,838
Claudia.

71
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,171
You do know that I'm proud.

72
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,630
Of all you've accomplished.

73
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,130
And your mother would be, too.

74
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,421
I've got to go.

75
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,130
The real reason I came...

76
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:21,963
I want you to move in with us.

77
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,921
You wouldn't be so alone.

78
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,796
And Regina would be happy
to see more of you.

79
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,630
Tomorrow would be best.

80
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:36,255
Tomorrow?

81
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,921
You're acting
like I'm almost on my deathbed.

82
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,755
Think it over.

83
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:49,755
All right?

84
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,713
Katharina?

85
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,713
What do you want?

86
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,630
Is he here?

87
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:29,380
Jonas?

88
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,713
He has vanished.
I have no idea where he is.

89
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,713
You said you saw Mikkel.

90
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:40,838
You were there. How do I get to him?

91
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,213
He has this kind of...

92
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:50,380
device.

93
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:53,171
I guess it's like a...

94
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,588
time machine.

95
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,130
A time machine.

96
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:03,130
And do you know how it works?

97
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,255
Even if I did, it wouldn't help.

98
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:08,380
He took it.

99
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:22,380
He was always here.

100
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:25,921
Right in front of me.

101
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:35,338
I just can't believe you slept
with my husband and my son.

102
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,046
But you always did want
what belonged to me.

103
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,088
You're like a parasite.

104
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,255
Did Ulrich ever actually tell you
he loved you?

105
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,296
In the end, he would always choose us.

106
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:07,671
Hello.

107
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:09,296
Hello.

108
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,338
You missed your appointment yesterday.

109
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,380
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

110
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:16,421
must have forgotten.

111
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,838
Hard to believe you'd forget it
when your own child is missing.

112
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,088
Mrs. Nielsen.

113
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,046
You were the last person
I expected to see here.

114
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,588
But since you're here...

115
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,296
Do you know who this is?

116
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,463
No, I don't.

117
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,213
And you?

118
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:08,963
Do you know this person?

119
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,046
No.

120
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,380
Do you know everything that will happen?

121
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,421
I know when wars begin and end,

122
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:50,546
what discoveries will be made
in the years ahead,

123
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,005
what shares I should invest in.

124
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,588
But I don't know
what my counterpart will do

125
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,338
as long as I haven't seen his future.

126
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,755
But you know my future.
You know what I'll do.

127
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:09,213
I am your future.

128
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,255
There must be a way to change it all.
So things happen differently.

129
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,296
A loophole.

130
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:24,338
It took me 66 years to find out how,

131
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,880
to find a way to escape this hell.

132
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:34,921
I've been here almost a week.

133
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,755
And I get the impression
no one is telling the truth.

134
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,671
Everyone's trying to hide something.

135
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,380
Although I'm not sure
if you're all hiding the same thing

136
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:51,296
or if everyone is trying
to keep their own skeleton in the closet.

137
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:58,921
Does he pay you?

138
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:05,171
Aleksander Tiedemann.

139
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,796
I don't quite follow you.

140
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:14,046
You worked as his physiotherapist.
You no longer do so, right?

141
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,713
Yet he still transfers you
the same amount every month.

142
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:25,505
One would normally expect
a service in return, so what is it?

143
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,671
What you don't get is
we stick together here.

144
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,755
We support each other.

145
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:45,755
My son disappeared.

146
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,255
Aleksander helps me with the money.

147
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,130
That's it.

148
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,296
Nothing beats a good neighborhood.

149
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:04,255
It's remarkable that Mrs. Nielsen
feels the same way about that.

150
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:09,588
Oh, well,
maybe that's how small towns are.

151
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,630
People share not only secrets,

152
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,046
but also money and beds.

153
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:56,546
- I want to know what you know.
- Fine.

154
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,088
Who is Noah?

155
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,296
He's one of them.

156
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:03,880
A traveler.

157
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,338
He's Adam's puppet.

158
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,505
He killed the children.

159
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,130
Mads, Erik, Yasin.

160
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:23,046
I think

161
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,046
all of this has to do with me.

162
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,630
Do you know who my parents are?

163
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:35,880
No.

164
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:40,546
But I knew your grandfather.

165
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:44,088
He's not my real grandfather.

166
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,463
I just grew up with him.

167
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,671
Did he know all this?

168
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,963
Is he one of them?

169
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,463
A traveler?

170
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:01,880
He's just a pawn, like most of us.

171
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,088
Claudia.

172
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:07,588
She used him.

173
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:10,671
Just like she used me, Peter
and the others.

174
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,130
She had him build this.

175
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:36,838
You know what will happen.

176
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,838
In the future.

177
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,255
Yes.

178
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:04,963
What is this?

179
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,338
Want to spend another night here?

180
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,171
Man, Bartosz, look at us.
What are we doing here?

181
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,838
Why won't you tell us what's going on?

182
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,921
I would if I could.

183
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,213
I'm not allowed to.

184
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:26,755
Even if I did tell you,
you wouldn't believe me.

185
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,338
Why not?

186
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:33,088
The human body
can go three days without liquid.

187
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,630
You're nuts. You can't do this!

188
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:47,921
You want to leave me here to die or what?

189
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:49,880
Hey, Martha.

190
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:52,755
Martha, wait. Please.
Martha, you can't do this!

191
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,921
Martha!

192
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,630
Okay.

193
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,421
It's a time machine.

194
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,505
What?

195
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,296
Are you screwing with me?

196
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:15,630
I said you wouldn't believe me.

197
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:19,796
Come on. We're leaving.

198
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,338
No. Wait.

199
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:27,546
Then show us how it works.

200
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,130
I need a phone.

201
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:48,296
- There's no reception here.
- That's irrelevant.

202
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,963
It just needs
to search for a signal, that's it.

203
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,213
ARIADNE

204
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,463
You need to come closer.

205
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:37,005
The incident last summer.

206
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:42,296
You told me it was from a reaction
in the volume control system.

207
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:45,505
I checked the data.

208
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:47,296
Everything was normal.

209
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:49,546
So...

210
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,421
What really happened?

211
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,130
I knew you wouldn't be able
to let it rest.

212
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,463
After the incident
I had a sample taken and analyzed.

213
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:12,005
What you see there are the results.

214
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:21,130
These values, they aren't possible.

215
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,213
I initially thought that too.

216
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,213
So I had the tests repeated.

217
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,088
The results were identical.

218
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,755
If this data is correct, then...

219
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,796
- Is this what I think it is?
- Possibly.

220
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,171
In many respects it corresponds

221
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:40,088
to Englert, Brout
and Higgs' calculations in 1964.

222
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,671
But not entirely.

223
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,088
The God Particle.

224
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,755
The particle
that gives all things its mass.

225
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,630
This is a sensation.

226
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:00,171
If this data is correct,
we have to go public with it.

227
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:03,171
I already told you

228
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,380
some sleeping dogs should be left to lie.

229
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:14,046
If we go public with it
people will want to know how we found it.

230
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:18,338
The nuclear power plant

231
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,130
is my legacy.

232
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:25,005
Do what you like with the data,

233
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,255
but leave my name

234
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,671
and the power plant out of it.

235
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,796
At least as long as I'm alive.

236
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:05,796
Can I help you?

237
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,338
Are you not well?

238
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:47,713
- Hello, Ines.
- Ina!

239
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:48,963
Hello.

240
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,838
We're out of iodine again.

241
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,130
Have you heard?

242
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:57,921
A guy escaped from the loony bin.

243
00:27:58,505 --> 00:28:02,130
They say he killed two kids in the 1950s,
and beat another half to death.

244
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:06,755
He's on his last legs himself now,
but they say to be vigilant.

245
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:26,755
Thanks.

246
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:51,130
You seem familiar somehow.

247
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:07,046
I've waited over 33 years for this moment.

248
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:24,338
The question is not how,

249
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:26,546
but when.

250
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:30,505
You said that.

251
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:33,963
Remember?

252
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,005
Dad.

253
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,088
In the future
there's a prophecy about a new world.

254
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:56,921
That Sic Mundus
will lead people into paradise.

255
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,713
Is this that?

256
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:03,713
A religion?

257
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:07,088
We're the exact opposite of that.

258
00:30:08,463 --> 00:30:10,713
We've declared war on time.

259
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,755
Declared war on God.

260
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,546
We're creating a new world,

261
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:19,546
without time,

262
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:21,380
without God.

263
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:24,296
What does that mean?

264
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:29,963
It means that what people
have worshipped for millennia,

265
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:32,338
the God who holds everything together,

266
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:36,046
that God is nothing more than time itself.

267
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,630
Not a thinking, acting entity.

268
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,088
A physical law

269
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,963
with which one can negotiate
as little as one can with one's own fate.

270
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:48,338
God

271
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:50,588
is time.

272
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,671
And time is not merciful.

273
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:59,880
We are born,
and our life is already trickling away

274
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:01,630
like the sand in this hourglass.

275
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:04,088
Death is forever inevitably before us.

276
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,796
Our fate

277
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:10,088
is nothing
but a concatenation of cause and effect.

278
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:12,838
In light

279
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,046
and in shadow.

280
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:16,255
Charlotte.

281
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,088
What do you want?

282
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:34,505
- I'm Noah.
- I know who you are.

283
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:40,713
You killed the children.

284
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:49,921
I can no longer change
what you think of me.

285
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:51,880
But...

286
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,421
maybe one day you'll understand

287
00:32:56,505 --> 00:33:00,755
that I only did this
so that it will one day no longer happen.

288
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:07,880
So you're not taken from me again.

289
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,588
And neither is your mother.

290
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,880
When you were born
they didn't give you much of a chance.

291
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,588
You were premature. You were tiny.

292
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,838
But you wanted to live.
You were so strong.

293
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:38,463
Your little hand grasped my finger
and wouldn't let go.

294
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:39,630
Stop.

295
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:43,713
That's impossible.

296
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,130
Your mother took that picture.

297
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:59,046
I promised her I'd bring you back.

298
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:03,255
I've looked for you all these years.

299
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,421
But you were here the entire time.

300
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:12,963
Adam knew it was you.

301
00:34:15,463 --> 00:34:17,421
He knew it all the time.

302
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:21,046
He's preparing for what comes afterwards.

303
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:24,630
I read the last pages.

304
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:28,088
The nuclear power plant, Jonas.

305
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:30,130
It'll all happen again. The apocalypse.

306
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,463
In two days.

307
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:34,630
But I now know

308
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,463
what I must do.

309
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,546
I have to end Adam.

310
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,880
So everyone lives.

311
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,838
Not just those in the bunker.

312
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,546
Who is my mother?

313
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,338
She loved you very much.

314
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:14,963
She still does.

315
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:54,880
What happened here?

316
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:06,671
The armchair is gone.

317
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:10,755
- What's going on?
- I didn't believe it at first either.

318
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,088
But then he told me things
that would happen.

319
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,671
And they did, just as he said.

320
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,380
That...

321
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,421
you and Jonas kissed.

322
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,088
He told me that before you did it.

323
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:30,630
That my mother would get cancer.

324
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,088
That Jonas would vanish.

325
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,880
Who told you that?

326
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,546
Noah.

327
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:41,713
Noah?

328
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:44,380
The priest with the big blue eyes?

329
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:46,713
- You know him?
- I don't.

330
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:47,963
But Elisabeth does.

331
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,630
Okay, what's going on?

332
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:53,130
Noah said it was about a war.

333
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,213
And about ruling over time.

334
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:01,130
That my grandma is involved in it
and that Jonas will return and...

335
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:02,088
Jonas?

336
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,713
Jonas is coming back?

337
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,171
Yes.

338
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:09,713
He's part of the war.

339
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,630
I'm going home.

340
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:20,421
You have to believe me.

341
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:34,796
Michael?

342
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,796
Michael?

343
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:50,505
Michael?

344
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:01,046
Egon, it's Ines.

345
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,588
I know it sounds strange, but...

346
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:06,921
I just got home
and Michael isn't here and...

347
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,338
The man who broke out
of the psychiatric ward...

348
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,838
Which man from the psychiatric ward?

349
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:16,005
It was on the radio today.

350
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:17,963
Do you remember

351
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,671
the children
on the construction site in 1953?

352
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:24,213
That man, he escaped.

353
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:27,546
I'll call the police station at once.

354
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,463
I might know where they're heading.

355
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:31,588
I'll come pick you up.

356
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:02,880
Stop! Freeze!

357
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:04,921
- Michael!
- Let the boy go!

358
00:39:05,421 --> 00:39:06,921
- No!
- Get on the ground!

359
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:07,880
Michael!

360
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:10,088
- You don't get it!
- Get down!

361
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:12,338
- He's my son.
- I said get down now!

362
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,005
- Mikkel.
- Michael! Michael.

363
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:21,671
Mikkel, I'll be back. I'll take you home.

364
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:23,588
I promise.

365
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:24,671
I promise.

366
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,130
It's all your fault. It always has been.

367
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:32,296
I swear, next time I'll kill you.

368
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:34,296
Come on!

369
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,130
Mikkel!

370
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:42,963
Mikkel.

371
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:44,880
Michael.

372
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:46,005
Our father

373
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:48,880
is just a small part of a knot

374
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:52,921
that is infinitely larger
and more convoluted.

375
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,921
The entire universe

376
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:59,838
is nothing but a gigantic knot
from which there is no escape.

377
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,421
If that's so,

378
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,046
if everything is perpetually in that knot,

379
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:08,088
if nothing can be changed,

380
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:11,838
then you've already had this conversation?

381
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:14,421
And posed that very question.

382
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:18,713
My whole life, I was convinced

383
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,421
that this moment

384
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:24,671
could never be repeated in this way.

385
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,755
I could never speak the words

386
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:31,671
that my older self said to me back then.

387
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:36,671
Because I could not understand

388
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:41,921
how I could ever in my life want
what he wanted.

389
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,505
Now,

390
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:50,505
66 years later, I understand it.

391
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:55,505
Some moments change us forever.

392
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:03,796
Some pain you never forget.

393
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,171
But there is a way

394
00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:17,630
that leads us out
of all of this cruel futility.

395
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:22,921
But if that's true, if there is a way,

396
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:27,296
why does it all happen as it always has,
why have you changed nothing?

397
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,671
Every development
builds on the previous one.

398
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:53,171
First you have the wheel, then the car.

399
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,796
I can't be me
without previously having been you.

400
00:41:58,505 --> 00:42:01,338
You saw the passage, in the bunker.

401
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,380
The chair, the device.

402
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,963
The thing in the future.

403
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,421
But that is not the end of the chain.

404
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:18,630
Thanks for taking the time.

405
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:24,755
I'd like...

406
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,338
you to analyze this for me.

407
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:31,380
And not a word,

408
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:33,755
to anyone.

409
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,755
What is it?

410
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,296
If it's what I think it is,

411
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:49,755
it'll revolutionize
our understanding of the world.

412
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,421
MODERN TALKING
ALBUM TOUR, 1987

413
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,921
PRESERVE CREATION
GAIN THE FUTURE

414
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:50,588
Stop! Wait, stop! Pull over!

415
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:52,671
Those are my children!

416
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,130
Magnus! Martha!

417
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,755
Do you believe me now?

418
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,463
You're back!

419
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:32,963
Where have you been?

420
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:49,338
Did this ever mean anything to you?

421
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:55,630
Did you ever actually love Dad?

422
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:02,630
I know you had an affair with Ulrich.

423
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:08,213
If you could choose
between Dad and Ulrich now...

424
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,880
With all this shit, I thought you were
the only person I can trust.

425
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:45,963
I ruined everything,

426
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:47,713
I know.

427
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:50,630
Maybe you always have.

428
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,546
Jonas.

429
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,213
You need no one.

430
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,130
Just yourself.

431
00:49:04,796 --> 00:49:08,171
It's not the same
as what lies in the future.

432
00:49:08,755 --> 00:49:12,046
It is, in a manner of speaking, it's twin.

433
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:17,171
It is a part of the infinite.

434
00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:21,671
It pervades everything.

435
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:26,963
People have given it a myriad of names
over the centuries,

436
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:31,088
ether, dark matter, the Higgs field.

437
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:32,796
How did it come to be?

438
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:38,963
The one in the future, via the disaster
in two days you so dearly want to prevent.

439
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:43,713
This one here we produced ourselves.

440
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:47,838
It is the end
of a technological evolution.

441
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:49,755
And...

442
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:53,088
it will be the end of the knot.

443
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:58,546
This right here
will take you to the exact day

444
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:01,213
that you want to travel to.

445
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,463
It breaks the 33-year cycle.

446
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:10,546
That's why I'm here.

447
00:50:11,546 --> 00:50:13,046
That's what you want from me.

448
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:17,296
There is a way to stop it all
if I stop the beginning.

449
00:50:18,296 --> 00:50:19,630
That there is.

450
00:50:20,963 --> 00:50:23,713
The question is only,
when is the beginning?

451
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,463
And what sacrifice must we make?

452
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,046
June 20, 2019.

453
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:37,880
The day before it all happened.

454
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:41,921
Before Dad took his own life.

455
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,838
Before it all fell apart.

456
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,171
If you can prevent him
from taking his life,

457
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:58,338
then everything that follows
will not occur.

458
00:51:00,088 --> 00:51:02,963
Mikkel will not travel back.

459
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:06,713
You...

460
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:08,296
I...

461
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:11,255
We won't be born.

462
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,213
But everyone else will live.

463
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:22,630
Martha will live.

464
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:02,130
If you succeed

465
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:05,338
we will reorder the world.
