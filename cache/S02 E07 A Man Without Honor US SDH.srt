00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,548
A CRIPPLE?

3
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,592
YOU LET A CRIPPLE ESCAPE?

4
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,554
<i>THE BOY CAN'T WALK,</i>

5
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,389
BUT SOMEHOW
HE SLIPPED PAST YOU?

6
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,017
THE GIANT MUST HAVE
TOOK HIM.

7
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,478
THE GIANT?

8
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,898
HODOR?

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,693
OH, WELL,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, THEN.

10
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,113
YOU LET A HALFWIT
ESCAPE WITH A CRIPPLE.

11
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,031
AND RICKON, TOO?
THE LITTLE ONE?

12
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,577
GONE ALONG WITH
THE WILDLING WOMAN,

13
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,204
THE ONE YOU WERE FUCKING.

14
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,132

17
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:06,311
RIGHT, GET THE HORSES
AND THE HOUNDS.

18
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,899
- ( dogs barking )
- COME ON, FIND THE SCENT.

19
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,906
COME ON,
WHERE THEY GOING?

20
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,957
HALT!

21
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,839
ENJOYING
YOUR FIRST HUNT?

22
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,967
SO FAR, HUNTING
SEEMS VERY SIMILAR
TO RIDING, MY LORD.

23
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,471
- WITH HUNTING,
THERE'S BLOOD AT THE END.
- THEY'RE LITTLE BOYS.

24
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,974
I WAS A LITTLE BOY
WHEN I WAS TORN AWAY FROM
MY HOME AND BROUGHT HERE.

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,517
SO I KEPT MY WORD.

26
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603
I NEVER RAN AWAY.

27
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,899
IF I FIND THEM SOON ENOUGH,
I WON'T HURT THEM.

28
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,860
WELL, I'LL HURT THEM,
BUT I WON'T KILL THEM.

29
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,821
THOSE BOYS
ARE OF FAR MORE VALUE
TO YOU ALIVE THAN DEAD.

30
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,032
THEY HAVE NO VALUE
TO ME MISSING.

31
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,576
ROBB WILL HAVE SENT A FORCE
TO RETAKE WINTERFELL BY NOW.

32
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,663
ROBB'S IN THE RIVERLANDS.
MY SISTER'S IN DEEPWOOD MOTTE.

33
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,457
<i>SHE'LL GET HERE</i>
<i>LONG BEFORE THEY DO.</i>

34
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,670
AND NED STARK ALWAYS
SAID 500 MEN COULD HOLD
WINTERFELL AGAINST 10,000.

35
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,756
-<i> ( dogs barking )</i>
<i>- Man: WE HAVE A SCENT!</i>

36
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,467
THE HOUNDS HAVE THE SCENT.

37
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,011
COME, MAESTER,
DON'T LOOK SO GRIM.

38
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,889
IT'S ALL JUST A GAME.

39
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,031
Osha:
WE SHOULD HAVE
TOOK MORE FOOD.

40
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,325
WE COULDN'T RISK
GOING TO THE KITCHENS.

41
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,868
THOSE PEOPLE
ALL LOVE YOU.

42
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,370
THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN
YOU WHATEVER YOU NEEDED.

43
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,163
AND IF THEON FOUND OUT,
HE'D HANG THEM.

44
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,293
- THE BOY CAN'T
SURVIVE ON WALNUTS.
- I'M FINE.

45
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,045
WE'VE BEEN WALKING
SINCE BEFORE SUNRISE.

46
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,548
- EVEN HODOR WILL TIRE.
- HODOR.

47
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,676
- EVEN YOU, SWEET GIANT.
- ( chuckles ) HODOR.

00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,390
WAIT, I KNOW THAT FARM.

50
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,351
<i>I SENT THOSE TWO</i>
<i>WINTERFELL ORPHANS THERE.</i>

51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,270
JACK AND BILLY.

52
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,022
THEY'LL GIVE US SOME FOOD.

53
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,273
WE CAN'T RISK IT.

54
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,649
IF THEON TRACKS US HERE,
HE'LL TORTURE THEM

55
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,609
UNTIL HE FINDS OUT
WHERE WE ARE.

56
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,154
BILLY CLIMBS A TREE
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

57
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,905
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME
CLIMB A TREE, LITTLE MAN.

58
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,575
<i>THEY'LL BE AFTER US</i>
<i>WITH HOUNDS.</i>

59

<i>WE GOT A GOOD START</i>
<i>ON THEM,</i>

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,662
BUT WE CAN'T OUTRUN
HOUNDS FOREVER.

61
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,648
DID YOU PULL A KNIFE
ON ME IN THE NIGHT?

62
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,327
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

63
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,079
CAN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
YOU PRESSED YOUR BONE

64
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,789
AGAINST A WOMAN'S ASS.

65
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,751
LET'S MOVE.

66
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,967
OH, IT IS
THE FIRST TIME.

67
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,304
HOW OLD ARE YOU, BOY?

68
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,015
I'M A MAN
OF THE NIGHT'S WATCH.

69
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,770
YOU'RE A BOY WHO'S
NEVER BEEN WITH A GIRL.

70
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,691
DON'T YOUR STONES
START TO HURT

71
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,277
IF YOUR BONE
NEVER GETS--

72
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,488
DON'T CALL THEM THAT.

73
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,658
WHAT, STONES?

74
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,493
OR BONE?

75
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,829
NEITHER.

76
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,331
BOTH.

77
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,793
MOVE!

78
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,633
Ygritte:
I HEARD THEY GET
ALL SWOLLEN

79
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,052
AND BRUISED IF YOU
DON'T USE THEM.

80
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,846
OF COURSE, MAYBE THAT'S
JUST WHAT THE LADS SAY

81
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,473
WHEN THEY WANT ME
FEELING SORRY FOR THEM.

82
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,892
AS IF I'D FEEL
SORRY FOR THEM.

83
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,730
ARE THERE
NO GIRL CROWS?

84
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,191
THERE ARE NO WOMEN
OF THE NIGHT'S WATCH, NO.

85
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,443
SO THE LADS JUST DO IT
WITH EACH OTHER?

86
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,279
NO.

87
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,906
- NEVER?
- NEVER.

88
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,367
WE SWORE AN OATH.

89
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,744
YOU HAVE SHEEP
AT THE WALL?

90
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,999
WITH YOUR HANDS, THEN?

91
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,043
NO WONDER
YOU'RE ALL SO MISERABLE.

92
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,587
WOULD YOU PLEASE SHUT UP?

93
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,797
( mocking )
WOULD YOU PLEASE SHUT UP?

94
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,217
YOU THINK YOU'RE
BETTER THAN ME, CROW.

95
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,928
- I'M A FREE WOMAN--
- YOU'RE A FREE WOMAN?

96
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,347
I MIGHT BE YOUR PRISONER,
BUT I'M A FREE WOMAN.

97
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,099
IF YOU'RE MY PRISONER,
YOU'RE NOT A FREE WOMAN.

98
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,934
THAT'S WHAT
"PRISONER" MEANS.

99
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,978
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE FREE?

100
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,064
YOU SWORE
SOME STUPID OATH

101
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,441
AND NOW YOU CAN NEVER
TOUCH A GIRL.

102
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,027
IT WAS MY CHOICE
TO SAY THE WORDS.

103
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,987
- SO YOU DON'T LIKE GIRLS?
- OF COURSE I LIKE GIRLS.

104
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,864
BUT YOU CHOSE
NEVER TO TOUCH THEM.

105
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,617
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY
IF YOU WANT TO BE A MAN
OF THE NIGHT'S WATCH.

106
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,493
SO INSTEAD OF GETTING
NAKED WITH A GIRL,

107
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,037
YOU'D PREFER
TO INVADE OUR LANDS--

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,788
INVADE YOUR LANDS?

109
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,874
WILDLINGS RAID
OUR LANDS ALL THE TIME.

110
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,752
SOME OF THEM TRIED TO
KILL MY LITTLE BROTHER,
A CRIPPLED BOY!

111
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,712
THEY'RE NOT YOUR LANDS!

112
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,631
WE'VE BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

113
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,301
YOU LOT CAME ALONG
AND JUST PUT UP A BIG WALL
AND SAID IT WAS YOURS.

114
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,095
MY FATHER WAS NED STARK.

115
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,097
I HAVE THE BLOOD
OF THE FIRST MEN.

116
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,392
MY ANCESTORS LIVED HERE,
SAME AS YOURS.

117
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,980
SO WHY ARE YOU
FIGHTING US?

118
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,249
GO ON.

119
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,881
NOW I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

120
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,009
- Guard:<i> COME ON, THIS WAY.</i>
<i>- ( man screaming )</i>

121
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>COME ON, SPEAK UP.</i>
<i>SPEAK UP.</i>

122
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,768
( sniffs )

123
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,312
WOLFSBANE--

124
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,023
A RARE SUBSTANCE.

125
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,317
THIS IS NO COMMON ASSASSIN.

126
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,486
WE HANGED 20 MEN
LAST NIGHT.

127
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,364
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU HANGED 100.

128
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,949
A MAN TRIED TO KILL ME.

129
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,993
I WANT HIS NAME
AND I WANT HIS HEAD.

130
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,452
Mountain:
<i>WE THINK IT WAS</i>
<i>AN INFILTRATOR</i>

131
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,289
FROM THE BROTHERHOOD
WITHOUT BANNERS.

132
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,250
PRETENTIOUS NAME
FOR A BAND OF OUTLAWS.

133
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,794
WE CAN'T ALLOW REBELS
BEHIND OUR LINES

134
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,879
TO HARASS US
WITH IMPUNITY.

135
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,173
WE LOOK LIKE FOOLS
AND THEY LOOK LIKE HEROES.

136
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>THAT'S HOW KINGS FALL.</i>

137
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,011
I WANT THEM DEAD,
EVERY ONE.

138
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,846
KILLING THEM
ISN'T THE PROBLEM.

139
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,806
<i>IT'S FINDING THEM.</i>

140
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,100
HAVE YOU GONE SOFT,
CLEGANE?

141
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,269
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU HAD
A TALENT FOR VIOLENCE.

142
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,772
BURN THE VILLAGES,
BURN THE FARMS.

143
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,233
LET THEM KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
TO CHOOSE THE WRONG SIDE.

144
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,651
MMM.

145
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,906
IS THAT MUTTON?

146
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,533
YES, MY LORD.

147
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,994
DON'T LIKE MUTTON.

148
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,579
I'LL BRING
SOMETHING ELSE.

149
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,497
LEAVE IT.

150
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,043
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?
- NO.

151
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,669
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

152
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,254
EAT.

153
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,549
I'LL EAT
IN THE KITCHEN LATER.

154
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:37,720
IT'S BAD MANNERS
TO REFUSE A LORD'S OFFER.

155
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,972
SIT.

156
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,808
EAT.

157
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,438
YOU'RE SMALL FOR YOUR AGE.

158
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,900
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN
UNDERFED YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

159
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,443
I EAT A LOT.

160
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,696
-<i> I JUST DON'T GROW.</i>
<i>- HMM.</i>

161
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,912
THIS WILL BE MY LAST WAR,

162
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,247
WIN OR LOSE.

163
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,334
HAVE YOU EVER
LOST BEFORE?

164
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,420
DO YOU THINK
I'D BE IN MY POSITION
IF I HAD LOST A WAR?

165
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,181
BUT THIS IS THE ONE
I'LL BE REMEMBERED FOR.

166
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,809
<i>THE "WAR OF FIVE KINGS"</i>
<i>THEY'RE CALLING IT.</i>

167
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,230
MY LEGACY WILL BE DETERMINED
IN THE COMING MONTHS.

168
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,943
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT LEGACY MEANS?

169
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,364
IT'S WHAT YOU PASS DOWN
TO YOUR CHILDREN

170
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,575
AND YOUR CHILDREN'S
CHILDREN.

171
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,662
IT'S WHAT REMAINS OF YOU
WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

172
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,794
HARREN THE BLACK
THOUGHT THIS CASTLE
WOULD BE HIS LEGACY.

173
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,965
THE GREATEST FORTRESS
EVER BUILT--

174
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,468
THE TALLEST TOWERS,
THE STRONGEST WALLS.

175
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,139
THE GREAT HALL
HAD 35 HEARTHS.

176
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,350
35. CAN YOU IMAGINE?

177
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,060
LOOK AT IT NOW--

178
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,063
<i>A BLASTED RUIN.</i>

179
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,108
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

180
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,485
DRAGONS?

181
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,739
YES, DRAGONS HAPPENED.

182
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,663
HARRENHAL WAS BUILT
TO WITHSTAND AN ATTACK
FROM THE LAND.

183
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,710
A MILLION MEN
COULD HAVE MARCHED
ON THESE WALLS

184
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,171
AND A MILLION MEN
WOULD HAVE BEEN REPELLED.

185
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:40,926
BUT AN ATTACK FROM THE AIR
WITH DRAGON FIRE-- MM.

186
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,388
HARREN AND ALL HIS SONS
ROASTED ALIVE WITHIN
THESE WALLS.

187
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:49,310
AEGON TARGARYEN
CHANGED THE RULES.

188
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,396
THAT'S WHY EVERY CHILD ALIVE
STILL KNOWS HIS NAME

189
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,356
300 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH.

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,734
AEGON AND HIS SISTERS.

191
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,904
MM?

192
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,115
IT WASN'T JUST AEGON
RIDING HIS DRAGON.

193
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,034
IT WAS RHAENYS
AND VISENYA, TOO.

194
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,328
CORRECT.

195
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,705
A STUDENT OF HISTORY,
ARE YOU?

196
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,124
RHAENYS RODE MERAXES.

197
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,960
VISENYA RODE VHAGAR.

198
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,505
I'M SURE I KNEW THAT
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

199
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,842
VISENYA TARGARYEN
WAS A GREAT WARRIOR.

200
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,720
SHE HAD A VALYRIAN STEEL SWORD
SHE CALLED DARK SISTER.

201
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,223
HMM.

202
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,475
SHE'S A HEROINE
OF YOURS, I TAKE IT?

203
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
AREN'T MOST GIRLS
MORE INTERESTED

204
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,563
IN THE PRETTY MAIDENS
FROM THE SONGS?

205
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,565
<i>JONQUIL WITH THE FLOWERS</i>
<i>IN HER HAIR?</i>

206
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,151
- MOST GIRLS ARE IDIOTS.
-<i> HA!</i>

207
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,031
YOU REMIND ME
OF MY DAUGHTER.

208
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,574
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
ALL THIS STUFF

209
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,620
ABOUT VISENYA AND HER
VALYRIAN STEEL SWORD?

210
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,498
FROM MY FATHER.

211
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,962
HE WAS A WELL-READ
STONEMASON.

212
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:02,466
CAN'T SAY I'VE EVER MET
A LITERATE STONEMASON.

213
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,219
HAVE YOU MET MANY
STONEMASONS, MY LORD?

214
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,515
CAREFUL NOW, GIRL.

215
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,809
<i>I ENJOY YOU,</i>
<i>BUT BE CAREFUL.</i>

216
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,728
TAKE THAT BACK
TO THE KITCHEN.

217
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,605
EAT WHAT YOU WANT.

218
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,860
AND, GIRL.

219
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,573
M'LORD.

220
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,493
LOWBORN GIRLS
SAY "M'LORD,"

221
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,912
<i>NOT "MY LORD."</i>

222
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,331
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO POSE AS A COMMONER,

223
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,458
YOU SHOULD DO IT
PROPERLY.

224
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,461
MY MOTHER SERVED
LADY DUSTIN

225
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,590
FOR MANY YEARS,
MY LORD.

226
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,968
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO SPEAK
PROPER-- PROPERLY.

227
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,471
YOU'RE TOO SMART
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

228
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,558
-<i> HAS ANYONE</i>
<i>TOLD YOU THAT?</i>
<i>- YES.</i>

229
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,436
GO ON.

230
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,075
I BEG PARDON, SER.

231
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,286
I SHOULD HAVE
COME TO YOU AFTER

232
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,705
TO THANK YOU
FOR SAVING ME.

233
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,124
- YOU WERE SO BRAVE.
- BRAVE?

234
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,628
A DOG DOESN'T NEED COURAGE
TO CHASE OFF RATS.

235
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,380
DOES IT GIVE YOU JOY
TO SCARE PEOPLE?

236
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,342
NO. IT GIVES ME JOY
TO KILL PEOPLE.

237
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,844
SPARE ME.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME

238
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,639
LORD EDDARD STARK
OF WINTERFELL NEVER
KILLED A MAN.

239
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,017
IT WAS HIS DUTY.
HE NEVER LIKED IT.

240
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,894
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

241
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,605
HE LIED.

242
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,358
KILLING IS THE SWEETEST
THING THERE IS.

243
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,194
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
SO HATEFUL?

244
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,862
YOU'LL BE GLAD
OF THE HATEFUL THINGS I DO

245
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,698
SOMEDAY WHEN YOU'RE QUEEN
AND I'M ALL THAT STANDS

246
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,284
BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR BELOVED KING.

247
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,003
I'VE DEMANDED A MEETING
OF THE THIRTEEN.

248
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,838
ONE OF THEM DID THIS
OR KNOWS WHO DID.

249
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,507
YOU ARE ONE
OF THE THIRTEEN.

250
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,509
IF I WANTED YOUR DRAGONS,
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM.

251
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,887
- THEY MEAN NOTHING
TO ME ON THEIR OWN.
- NOTHING?

252
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,390
THEY'RE MORE VALUABLE
THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

253
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,267
SHALL WE LOOK
INSIDE MY VAULT AND SEE
WHAT SELLING YOUR DRAGONS

254
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,353
WOULD BUY ME
I CANNOT BUY ALREADY?

255
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,563
WE WILL GET THEM BACK.

256
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,273
THERE IS NO WE,

257
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,984
SO WHY WOULD YOU HELP ME
GET THEM BACK?

258
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,736
I TOOK YOU
UNDER MY PROTECTION

259
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,822
IN FRONT OF THE RULERS
OF MY CITY.

260
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,908
A MAN IS WHAT OTHERS
SAY HE IS AND NO MORE.

261
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,536
IF THEY SAY THAT
XARO XHOAN DAXOS IS A LIAR,

262
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,996
MY WORD IS WORTH NOTHING.

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,541
I CANNOT LET THIS THING
HAPPEN TO YOU UNDER MY ROOF.

264
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,043
BUT IT DID HAPPEN
UNDER YOUR ROOF.

265
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,588
KHALEESI, MANY TIMES
IN MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN--

266
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,257
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN.

267
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,576
YOU THINK WE'RE SAVAGES
BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE
IN STONE CASTLES.

268
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,580
WE CAN'T MAKE STEEL
AS GOOD AS YOURS,
IT'S TRUE, BUT...

269
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,999
WE'RE FREE.

270
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,294
IF SOMEONE TRIED TO TELL US
WE COULDN'T LIE DOWN
AS MAN AND WOMAN,

271
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,005
WE'D SHOVE A SPEAR
UP HIS ASS.

272
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,965
WE DON'T GO SERVING
SOME SHIT KING

273
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,467
WHO'S ONLY KING
BECAUSE HIS FATHER WAS.

274
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,053
NO. NO, YOU SERVE
MANCE RAYDER,

275
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,305
THE KING-BEYOND-THE-WALL.

276
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,266
WE CHOSE MANCE RAYDER
TO LEAD US.

277
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,769
HE WAS A CROW,
SAME AS YOU,

278
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,062
BUT HE WANTED
TO BE FREE.

279
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,817
YOU COULD BE FREE, TOO.

280
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,652
YOU DON'T NEED TO LIVE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE

281
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,863
TAKING COMMANDS
FROM OLD MEN.

282
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,741
WAKE UP WHEN YOU WANT
TO WAKE UP.

283
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,577
I COULD SHOW YOU
THE STREAMS TO FISH,
THE WOODS TO HUNT.

284
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,915
<i>BUILD YOURSELF A CABIN</i>
<i>AND FIND A WOMAN TO LIE</i>
<i>WITH IN THE NIGHT.</i>

285
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,001
YOU'RE A PRETTY LAD.

286
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,379
THE GIRLS WOULD CLAW
EACH OTHER'S EYES OUT
TO GET NAKED WITH YOU.

287
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,927
WALK.

288
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,846
I COULD TEACH YOU
HOW TO DO IT.

289
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,057
I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

290
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,522
YOU KNOW NOTHING,
JON SNOW.

291
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,128
( chatter )

292
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,885
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?

293
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,555
SHE ADMIRED YOUR SPIRIT,
YOUR GRACE.

294
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,807
AND WHAT THEN?

295
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,352
SHE, UH...

296
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,563
IF EVERY MAN
WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

297
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,398
FOR THE ACTIONS
OF EVERY DISTANT RELATIVE,

298
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,609
SER ALTON, WE'D ALL HANG.

299
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,949
SHE TORE THE PAPER
IN HALF, YOUR GRACE.

300
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,409
YOU'VE ACTED WITH HONOR.

301
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,411
I THANK YOU FOR IT.

302
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,581
LORD KARSTARK, SEE THAT
SER ALTON'S PEN IS CLEAN.

303
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,124
AND GIVE HIM A HOT SUPPER.

304
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,501
SER ALTON'S PEN
IS OCCUPIED, YOUR GRACE.

305
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,087
THE PRISONERS
FROM THE YELLOW FORK.

306
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,089
TOO MANY PRISONERS.

307
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,050
IS THERE ROOM
FOR SER ALTON?

308
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,304
DOES HE NEED
TO LIE DOWN?

309
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,933
HAVE THE MEN
BUILD HIM A NEW PEN.

310
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,769
<i>PUT HIM IN WITH</i>
<i>THE KINGSLAYER FOR NOW.</i>

311
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,897
HAVE YOUR BOY
WATCH OVER THEM.

312
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,441
TORRHEN.

313
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,151
THAT WILL BE ALL.

314
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,326
YOUR GRACE.

315
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,536
<i>A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME?</i>

316
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,136
I'VE BEEN TREATING
YOUR WOUNDED MEN.

317
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:25,474
AND MY ENEMIES
AS SOME OF MY BANNERMEN
ARE FOND OF MENTIONING.

318
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,975
THEY'RE NOT MY ENEMIES.

319
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,019
THAT'S WHAT I TELL
MY BANNERMEN.

320
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,897
I'VE ALREADY RUN
THROUGH THE SUPPLIES
I BROUGHT WITH ME.

321
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,357
SOME ARE EASILY REPLACED--

322
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,485
EGG YOLKS, TURPENTINE,
OIL OF ROSES.

323
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,695
BUT SOME ARE NOT.

324
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,491
I NEED SILK
FOR STITCHING.

325
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,410
I NEED FENNEL ROOT
FOR THOSE WITH FEVER,
WILLOW BARK.

326
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,663
MOSTLY I NEED
MILK OF THE POPPY.

327
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,832
YOU SAW WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO AMPUTATE A FOOT
WITHOUT ANY.

328
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,544
I ASSUME THERE WILL BE
MORE LOSS OF LIMB BEFORE
THIS WAR IS OVER.

329
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,548
- IF YOU NEED
HELP FINDING THESE--
- I KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM.

330
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,844
I'M SORRY, I SHOULDN'T
INTERRUPT YOU.

331
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,181
CONTINUE, MY LADY.

332
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,647
- YOU'RE RIDING TO THE CRAG
TO NEGOTIATE A SURRENDER?
- YES.

333
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,900
THE CRAG WILL HAVE A MAESTER
AND HE WILL HAVE WHAT I NEED.

334
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,027
I EXPECT HE WILL.

335
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,988
IF I COULD WRITE A LIST--

336
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,490
COME WITH ME
TO THE CRAG.

337
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,451
I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE--

338
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,787
LET THE MAESTER
SHOW YOU HIS STORES.

339
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,125
I WANT THE WOUNDED MEN
TO BE TREATED WELL--

340
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,960
ALL THE WOUNDED MEN.

341
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,716
<i>( dog barking )</i>

342
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,220
Woman:
<i>CHILDREN, COME INSIDE, QUICK.</i>

343
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,180
HURRY UP!

344
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,559
-<i> ( dog barking )</i>
<i>- Man: CAN'T FIND</i>
<i>ANYTHING, SER.</i>

345
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,395
- THEY'VE LOST THE SCENT.
- TRY AGAIN.

346
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,980
WE'VE CIRCLED
THIS FARMHOUSE TWICE.

347
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,606
THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM.

348
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,527
WE COULD START
THE SEARCH FRESH
IN THE MORNING, MY LORD.

349
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,446
I'M LOOKING AT SPENDING
THE REST OF MY LIFE

350
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,449
BEING TREATED LIKE
A FOOL AND A EUNUCH
BY MY OWN PEOPLE.

351
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,409
ASK YOURSELF,
"IS THERE ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO

352
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,077
TO STOP THAT
FROM HAPPENING?"

353
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,371
THE HOUNDS WILL FIND
THE SCENT AGAIN.

354
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,540
I'LL BEAT THEM
UNTIL THEY DO.

355
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,000
I'LL WHIP EVERY MAN HERE

356
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,544
<i>UNTIL I HAVE</i>
<i>BOTH THOSE BOYS IN HAND.</i>

357
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,589
AND ONCE I'VE GOT THEM,
THE PAMPERED LITTLE SHITS...

358
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,301
IT'S BETTER TO BE
CRUEL THAN WEAK.

359
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,553
PRINCE THEON.

360
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,764
- WHERE ARE THEY?
- WHO, M'LORD?

361
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,057
THE STARK BOYS.
WHERE ARE THEY?

362
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,267
I DON'T KNOW.
I SEEN NO ONE.

363
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,144
OH!

364
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,645
THINK HARDER.

365
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,941
I SWEAR, M'LORD,
I DON'T KNOW.

366
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,778
MY LORD, OVER HERE.

367
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,366
I THINK I'VE FOUND
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

368
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,420
SEND THE OLD MAN HOME.

369
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,927
GO BACK TO WINTERFELL.

370
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,887
TAKE HIM BACK.

371
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,558
THEON, DON'T DO THIS.

372
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,606
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

373
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,454
YOU CAME BACK.

374
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,623
AS SOON AS I HEARD.

375
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,000
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

376
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,671
- IRRI IS DEAD.
-<i> I KNOW.</i>

377
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,006
- SHE WAS A GOOD--
- SHE'S DEAD.

378
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,591
SHE DIED ALONE.

379
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,261
SHE DIED FOR ME
AND I COULDN'T PROTECT HER.

380
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,305
DOREAH?

381
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,266
WE CAN'T FIND HER.

382
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,436
SHE MUST BE DEAD, TOO.

383
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,438
I LED MY PEOPLE
OUT OF THE RED WASTE

384
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,357
AND INTO
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

385
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,026
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

386
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,237
YOU WENT TO FIND ME
A SHIP.

387
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,364
MY PLACE IS BY YOUR SIDE.

388
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,783
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU
ALONE WITH THESE PEOPLE.

389
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,535
THESE PEOPLE?

390
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,954
THEY ARE NOT
TO BE TRUSTED.

391
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,832
AND WHO IS TO BE TRUSTED?

392
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,375
WHO ARE MY PEOPLE?

393
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,544
THE TARGARYENS?

394
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,379
I ONLY KNEW ONE--
MY BROTHER,

395
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,715
AND HE WOULD HAVE LET
1,000 MEN RAPE ME

396
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,925
IF IT HAD GOT HIM
THE CROWN.

397
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,886
THE DOTHRAKI?

398
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,222
MOST OF THEM TURNED ON ME
THE DAY THAT KHAL DROGO
FELL FROM HIS HORSE.

399
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,891
YOUR PEOPLE
ARE IN WESTEROS.

400
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,602
THE PEOPLE IN WESTEROS
DON'T KNOW I'M ALIVE.

401
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,729
- THEY WILL SOON ENOUGH.
- AND THEN WHAT?

402
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,939
THEY'LL PRAY FOR MY RETURN?

403
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,525
THEY'LL WAVE DRAGON BANNERS
AND SHOUT MY NAME?

404
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,653
THAT'S WHAT
MY BROTHER BELIEVED
AND HE WAS A FOOL.

405
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,031
YOU ARE NOT YOUR BROTHER.

406
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,783
TRUST ME, KHALEESI.

407
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,744
THERE IT IS--

408
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,205
"TRUST ME."

409
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,749
AND IT'S YOU
I SHOULD TRUST,
SER JORAH?

410
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,792
ONLY YOU?

411
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,007
I DON'T NEED TRUST
ANY LONGER.

412
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,885
I DON'T WANT IT
AND I DON'T HAVE
ROOM FOR IT.

413
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,137
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG
TO BE SO--

414
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,348
AND YOU ARE TOO FAMILIAR.

415
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,480
FORGIVE ME, KHALEESI.

416
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,026
NO ONE CAN SURVIVE
IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT HELP.

417
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,527
NO ONE.

418
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,113
LET ME HELP YOU, PLEASE.

419
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,991
TELL ME HOW.

420
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,370
FIND MY DRAGONS.

421
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,588
Ygritte:
HOW LONG TILL WE GET
BACK TO YOUR CROWS?

422
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,342
WE'RE CLOSE.

423
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,971
WHAT, A DAY?
A HALF-DAY?

424
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,185
YOU DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?

425
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:06,314
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE?
- WE'RE CLOSE.

426
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,525
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL SAY WHEN THEY
HEAR ABOUT YOU AND ME?

427
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,652
NOTHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

428
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,905
"I SWEAR IT,
OLD MASTER KING CROW, SER,

429
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,741
WE WERE ONLY CLOSE
TOGETHER FOR WARMTH.

430
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,410
AND THEN I FELT IT,

431
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,037
RIGHT UP AGAINST
ME BACKSIDE LIKE A CLUB.

432
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,665
I CAN SHOW YOU THE BRUISE
ON ME TAILBONE.

433
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,168
AND BEFORE I KNEW
WHAT WAS WHERE,
HIS-- HIS--

434
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,005
WELL, IT WAS
ALL OUT IN THE OPEN,
ALL ANGRY AS YOU LIKE.

435
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,092
AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO WANT IT,
BUT, OH, I DID!

436
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,178
AND HE SPREAD ME LEGS
AND-- RUINED.

437
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,972
THE SHAME OF IT.

438
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,057
NOW I CAN NEVER MARRY
A PERFUMED LORD.

439
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,686
- WHAT WILL ME POOR
SAVAGE FATHER SAY?"
- TURN BACK AROUND.

440
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,022
"AND I THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE DONE,
BUT HE SAID,

441
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,691
( deep voice )
'TURN BACK AROUND.'"

442
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,277
( normal voice )
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
JON SNOW,

443
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,404
SINCE IT'S GOING TO BE
YOUR WORD AGAINST MINE,

444
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:58,450
AND SINCE YOU CAN'T TALK
ABOUT IT WITHOUT BLUSHING,

445
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,578
WE MAY AS WELL JUST.

446
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,040
WHAT, RIGHT HERE
IN THE MUCK?

447
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,250
I'LL KEEP YOU
WARM ENOUGH.

448
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,087
ARE YOU THAT AFRAID
OF IT?

449
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,756
THAT'S ENOUGH.

450
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,050
OH, IT'S NICE

451
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,219
AND WET AND WARM.

452
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,096
ENOUGH!

453
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,099
IT DON'T HAVE TEETH.

454
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,108
ALL RIGHT!

455
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,195
ALL RIGHT.

456
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,281
GODS, YOU'RE DULL.

457
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,452

IT'S ALL RIGHT.
GIVE ME THAT.

I CAN HAVE JOFFREY'S
CHILDREN NOW...

469
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,212
HELP ME FLIP IT OVER.

470
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,648
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- TO TELL HER GRACE.

471
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,777
YOU'LL SAY NOTHING
TO ANYONE.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

473
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,220
YOUR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE
PREPARED YOU.

474
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,430
YOU FLOWERED, MY DEAR.
NO MORE.

475
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,683
MY MOTHER TOLD ME,
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE DIFFERENT.

476
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
IN WHAT WAY?

477
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,396
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE LESS--

478
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,399
LESS MESSY.

479
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,402
WAIT UNTIL YOU BEAR
THE CHILD.

480
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,031
YOU'RE A WOMAN NOW.

481
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,200
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS?

482
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,827
I'M FIT TO BEAR CHILDREN
FOR THE KING?

483
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,080
A PROSPECT THAT
ONCE DELIGHTED YOU--

484
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,749
BRINGING LITTLE PRINCES
AND PRINCESSES INTO THE WORLD,

485
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:38,378
THE GREATEST HONOR
FOR A QUEEN.

486
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,219
JOFFREY HAS ALWAYS
BEEN DIFFICULT.

487
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,221
EVEN HIS BIRTH,
I LABORED A DAY AND A HALF

488
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,348
TO BRING HIM
INTO THIS WORLD.

489
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,892
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE
THE PAIN.

490
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,769
I SCREAMED SO LOUDLY,
I WAS SURE

491
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,229
ROBERT WOULD HEAR ME
IN THE KINGSWOOD.

492
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,357
HIS GRACE WAS NOT
WITH YOU?

493
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,025
ROBERT WAS HUNTING.

494
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,860
THAT WAS HIS CUSTOM.

495
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,491
WHENEVER MY TIME WAS NEAR,

496
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,077
MY ROYAL HUSBAND
WOULD FLEE TO THE TREES

497
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,873
WITH HIS HUNTSMEN
AND HIS HOUNDS.

498
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,375
AND WHEN HE RETURNED,
HE WOULD PRESENT ME

499
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,628
WITH SOME PELTS
OR A STAG'S HEAD,

500
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,755
AND I WOULD PRESENT HIM
WITH A BABY.

501
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,051
NOT THAT I WANTED
HIM THERE, MIND YOU.

502
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,221
I HAD GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE,
AN ARMY OF MIDWIVES,

503
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,056
AND I HAD MY BROTHER.

504
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,602
WHEN THEY TOLD JAIME
HE WASN'T ALLOWED IN
THE BIRTHING ROOM,

505
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,896
HE SMILED AND ASKED
WHICH ONE OF THEM

506
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,024
PROPOSED TO KEEP HIM OUT.

507
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,654
JOFFREY WILL SHOW YOU
NO SUCH DEVOTION.

508
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,492
YOU MAY NEVER
LOVE THE KING,

509
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,369
BUT YOU WILL LOVE
HIS CHILDREN.

510
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,831
I LOVE HIS GRACE
WITH ALL MY HEART.

511
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,709
THAT'S SO VERY
TOUCHING TO HEAR.

512
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,591
PERMIT ME TO SHARE
SOME WOMANLY WISDOM WITH YOU

513
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,761
ON THIS VERY SPECIAL DAY.

514
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,514
THE MORE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,
THE WEAKER YOU ARE.

515
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,976
YOU'LL DO THINGS
FOR THEM THAT YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T DO.

516
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,772
YOU'LL ACT THE FOOL
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY,
TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

517
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,027
LOVE NO ONE
BUT YOUR CHILDREN.

518
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,572
ON THAT FRONT,
A MOTHER HAS NO CHOICE.

519
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:34,410
BUT... SHOULDN'T
I LOVE JOFFREY, YOUR GRACE?

520
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,332
YOU CAN TRY,

521
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,417
LITTLE DOVE.

522
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,300
<i>( chatter )</i>

523
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,894
WHO DID YOU SAY
YOUR MOTHER WAS AGAIN?

524
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,729
CINDA LANNISTER.

525
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,482
IS SHE THE FAT ONE?

526
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,150
WELL, PERHAPS SHE'S GOTTEN
A LITTLE LARGER THAN SHE--

527
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,821
NO, NO.
THERE'S ONLY ONE
FAT LANNISTER.

528
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,699
IF SHE WAS YOUR MOTHER,
YOU'D KNOW IT.

529
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,704
I-- I SQUIRED
FOR YOU ONCE, YOU KNOW?

530
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,790
WHEN?

531
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,127
THE TOURNAMENT THE DAY
OF WILLEM FREY'S WEDDING.

532
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,130
I WENT TO
WILLEM FREY'S WEDDING?

533
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,923
<i>YOU DID.</i>

534
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,426
YOUR SQUIRE HAD GOTTEN
SO DRUNK THE NIGHT
BEFORE THAT HE--

535
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,594
HE THREW UP ON HIS HORSE

536
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,263
ON THE WAY
TO THE TOURNEY GROUNDS.

537
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,807
- WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
- BRYAN.

538
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,893
( laughs )
POOR LAD.

539
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,021
THAT WAS
MY BROTHER'S DOING,
I SEEM TO RECALL.

540
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,234
I REMEMBER YOU.

541
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,112
YOU HAD NEVER SQUIRED
FOR ANYONE BEFORE.

542
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,114
THAT'S RIGHT.
I RAN UP AND VOLUNTEERED.

543
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,451
"LET ME, MY LORD.
LET ME."

544
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,953
MY FATHER WAS FURIOUS,

545
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,663
AFRAID I'D EMBARRASS
OUR FAMILY

546
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,291
IN FRONT OF<i> THE</i> FAMILY.

547
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
YOU DIDN'T, THOUGH.

548
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,297
- YOU REALLY REMEMBER?
- MM.

549
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,924
YOU KNEW
WHEN YOU WERE NEEDED
AND WHEN TO GO AWAY.

550
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,509
IT'S A RARE TALENT.

551
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,221
MOST OF MY SQUIRES,
THEY MEAN WELL,

552
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,641
BUT YOUNG MEN WITH BIG JOBS,
THEY TEND TO OVERDO THEM.

553
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,643
WELL, WHEN I THINK
BACK TO THAT DAY--

554
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,479
( hisses )

555
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,614
YOU WERE SAYING?

556
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,991
I--

557
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,827
NEVER MIND.
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

558
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,622
MORE EMBARRASSING
THAN BEING CHAINED
TO A POST

559
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,500
COVERED IN YOUR OWN SHIT?

560
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,085
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING
ABOUT THAT DAY--

561
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,463
YOUR HELMET, YOUR HORSE,

562
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,174
THE RAKE LINES IN THE DIRT
ALONG THE LIST,

563
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,759
WHERE THE SUN WAS
IN THE SKY

564
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,011
WHEN YOU KNOCKED
BALON SWANN FROM HIS HORSE,

565
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,348
AND THE DENT IN YOUR SHIELD
WHEN YOU HANDED IT BACK TO ME.

566
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,394
I'LL REMEMBER IT ALL
UNTIL I DIE.

567
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,815
THAT WAS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

568
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,780
AND I REMEMBER
BEING ON THE FIELD
AFTER IT WAS OVER.

569
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,198
ALL THE COMPETITORS
WERE DONE.

570
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,408
I WAS THE LAST ONE
OUT THERE.

571
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,080
AND I COULDN'T LEAVE.

572
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,499
<i>I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF</i>
<i>TO GO AND SIT WITH MY FAMILY</i>

573
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,543
AT A TABLE SO FAR
ON THE EDGE OF THE FEAST

574
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,837
YOU COULD BARELY
EVEN SEE THE BRIDE.

575
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,298
AND I COULDN'T BEAR
TO TELL THEM WHAT IT HAD
BEEN LIKE SQUIRING FOR YOU

576
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,094
WHEN I KNEW THAT THEY COULD
NEVER HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

577
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,430
I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.

578
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,600
HOW COULD YOU?

579
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,562
S-SORRY, I-- I DIDN'T
MEAN TO DOUBT YOU.

580
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,107
- IT'S JUST THAT I--
- I WAS 16 ONCE.

581
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,485
I ALSO HAD TO REPLACE
SOMEONE'S SQUIRE
ON SHORT NOTICE.

582
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,362
WHICH KNIGHT WAS IT?

583
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,990
BARRISTAN SELMY.

584
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,076
THE FIGHT AGAINST
THE KINGSWOOD OUTLAWS.

585
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,996
BEFORE YOUR TIME.

586
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,414
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

587
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,166
( sighs )

588
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,753
HE WAS

589
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,423
A PAINTER,

590
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,843
A PAINTER
WHO ONLY USED RED.

591
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,433
I COULDN'T IMAGINE BEING
ABLE TO FIGHT LIKE THAT,

592
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,685
NOT BACK THEN.

593
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:34,066
AND TO HELP HIM DO THAT,
TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING
THAT PERFECT...

594
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,611
I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN
HOW THAT FELT, NOT TO YOU.

595
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,614
IT'S HARD TO PUT
INTO WORDS.

596
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,700
IT'S LIKE STEPPING
INTO A DREAM

597
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,037
YOU'VE BEEN DREAMING
FOR AS LONG AS YOU
CAN REMEMBER

598
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,872
AND FINDING OUT
THAT THE DREAM

599
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,917
IS MORE REAL
THAN YOUR LIFE.

600
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,963
LEAVING
THAT BATTLEFIELD WAS

601
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,132
LIKE BEING DRAGGED OFF
TO PRISON.

602
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:01,719
- DID YOU SQUIRE
FOR HIM AGAIN?
- NO.

603
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,431
I DIDN'T HAVE YOUR GIFT.

604
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,893
HE COULDN'T TAKE A STEP
WITHOUT STEPPING ON ME.

605
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,146
I WAS AWFUL,
A COMPLETE LIABILITY...

606
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,816
UNTIL ONE OF THE OUTLAWS

607
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,362
DECIDED TO TAKE ON
A 16-YEAR-OLD SQUIRE.

608
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,536
IT'S A GOOD THING
I AM WHO I AM.

609
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,540
( chuckles )
I'D HAVE BEEN USELESS
AT ANYTHING ELSE.

610
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,965
I'M NOT WELL-SUITED
FOR IMPRISONMENT.

611
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,883
SHOCKING, I KNOW.

612
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,468
SOME MEN ARE.

613
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,055
NED STARK--
I IMAGINE HE MADE

614
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,433
AN EXCELLENT PRISONER
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END.

615
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,062
BUT ME, THOUGH--
MY LIFE HAS LEFT ME

616
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,148
UNIQUELY UNFIT
FOR CONSTRAINT.

617
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,610
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT...?

618
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,362
OF COURSE.

619
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,240
- EVERY DAY.
- AND?

620
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,204
GOOD PRISONERS BREED
GOOD JAILERS, APPARENTLY.

621
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,373
THE STARKS
ARE VERY CAREFUL.

622
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,586
BUT THERE IS A WAY,
I THINK.

623
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,256
IT WASN'T POSSIBLE
UNTIL NOW.

624
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,676
WHAT IS IT?

625
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,558
- IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE.
- WELL, LET ME HELP YOU.

626
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,519
YOU'LL ONLY HAVE
TO DO ONE THING.

627
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,479
TELL ME.

628
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,942
YOU'LL HAVE TO DIE.

629
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,456
<i>( crunching )</i>

630
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,184
( choking )

631
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,356
( bone breaks )

632
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,615
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

633
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,123
JORAH THE ANDAL.

634
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,126
THIS MAN MUST SAIL
PAST OLD VALYRIA.

635
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,464
ALL WHO TRAVEL
TOO CLOSE TO THE DOOM
MUST HAVE PROTECTION.

636
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,382
I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR LESSONS.

637
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,843
NO, YOU CAME
FOR THE DRAGONS.

638
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,845
YOU HAVE THEM?

639
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,182
WHERE ARE THEY?

640
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,142
DRAW YOUR SWORD.

641
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,729
SEE WHAT YOUR STEEL
IS WORTH.

642
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,902
YOU WANT TO PLEASE
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

643
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,910
YOU LOVE HER.

644
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,041
WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS?

645
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,544
WILL YOU BETRAY HER AGAIN,
JORAH THE ANDAL?

646
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,343
WILL YOU BETRAY HER AGAIN?

647
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,180
NEVER.

648
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,438
<i>THE THIEF YOU SEEK</i>

649
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,316
IS WITH HER NOW.

650
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,198
Spice King:
<i>I DID NOT LEAVE</i>
<i>THE COMFORT OF MY HOME</i>

651
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,992
TO COME TO YOURS
AND BE CALLED A THIEF.

652
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,035
NO ONE IS CALLING YOU
A THIEF.

653
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,871
WHO IS SHE TO ACCUSE US?

654
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,873
PLEASE,
THEY'RE MY CHILDREN.

655
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,208
- I'M BEGGING YOU.
- BEGGING US?

656
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,669
IT WASN'T VERY LONG AGO
YOU WERE THREATENING US.

657
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,380
WITHOUT ME,
THE DRAGONS WILL DIE.

658
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,424
IT WILL BE
FOR THE BEST.

659
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,843
<i>YOUR DRAGONS</i>
<i>WILL BRING THE WORLD</i>

660
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,554
NOTHING BUT DEATH
AND MISERY, MY DEAR.

661
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,182
IF I KNEW WHERE THEY WERE,
I WOULD NOT TELL YOU.

662
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,100
Pyat Pree:
<i>YOU ARE CRUEL, MY FRIEND.</i>

663
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,061
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS
IS IN THE RIGHT.

664
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,064
<i>SHE MUST BE REUNITED</i>
<i>WITH HER BABIES.</i>

665
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,152
- I WILL HELP YOU,
KHALEESI.
- HOW?

666
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,655
I WILL TAKE YOU
TO THE HOUSE OF THE UNDYING

667
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,325
WHERE I HAVE PUT THEM.

668
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,660
YOU HAVE MY DRAGONS?

669
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,038
WHEN I LEARNED YOU WERE
COMING TO OUR CITY,

670
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,624
I MADE AN ARRANGEMENT
WITH THE KING OF QARTH.

671
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,626
( laughter )

672
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,419
HE PROCURED THEM FOR ME.

673
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:48,005
- BUT THERE IS
NO KING OF QARTH.
- Xaro: THERE IS NOW.

674
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,341
THAT WAS THE OTHER HALF
OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

675
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,180
<i>YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR GATES</i>
<i>AND YOUR MINDS CLOSED</i>

676
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,266
TO EVERYTHING
OUTSIDE YOUR WALLS,

677
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,436
BUT QARTH CANNOT REMAIN
THE GREATEST CITY THAT EVER WAS

678
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,230
IF IT REFUSES TO CHANGE.

679
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,774
I WILL OPEN QARTH
TO THE WORLD

680
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,153
AS I HAVE FORCED IT
TO OPEN ITSELF TO ME.

681
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,114
YOUR AMBITION
IS AN INSPIRATION.

682
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,243
BUT LIKE ALL UPSTARTS,
YOU OVERREACH.

683
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,954
THREE DRAGONS
THE SIZE OF CATS

684
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,164
AND AN ALLIANCE
WITH A CHARLATAN

685
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,792
DO NOT MAKE YOU A KING.

686
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,086
AN UPSTART
AND A CHARLATAN?

687
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,089
<i>EMPIRES HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>BUILT BY LESS.</i>

688
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,467
THOSE ON THE MARGINS
OFTEN COME TO CONTROL
THE CENTER,

689
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,011
AND THOSE IN THE CENTER
MAKE ROOM FOR THEM,

690
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,596
<i>WILLINGLY OR OTHERWISE.</i>

691
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,770
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS
WILL BE WITH HER BABIES.

692
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,481
SHE WILL GIVE THEM
HER LOVE

693
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:50,442
AND THEY WILL THRIVE
BY HER SIDE...

694
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,488
FOREVER.

695
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,219
A MOTHER SHOULD BE
WITH HER CHILDREN.

696
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,641
WHERE WILL YOU RUN TO,
DAENERYS STORMBORN?

697
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,978
YOUR DRAGONS WAIT FOR YOU
IN THE HOUSE OF THE UNDYING.

698
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,522
COME SEE THEM.

699
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,242
- LADY STARK!
- NO FARTHER.

700
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,202
KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF ME, WOMAN.

701
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:46,415
DON'T ENTER WITHOUT
AN INVITATION,<i> MAN.</i>

702
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,667
FORGIVE ME.
LADY STARK.

703
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,378
- Catelyn:<i> WHAT IS IT?</i>
<i>- THEY CAUGHT THE KINGSLAYER.</i>

704
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,134
( men shouting )

705
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,054
- KILL THE FUCKING KINGSLAYER!
- HANG HIM!

706
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,640
( men shouting )

707
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
YOU'LL DIE TODAY.

708
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,978
JUSTICE FOR
THE KARSTARK.

709
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,701
GUT HIM!

710
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,591
GET BACK!
I WANT HIS HEAD!

711
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,470
ANY MAN WHO STANDS
BETWEEN A FATHER

712
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,972
AND HIS VENGEANCE
ASKS FOR DEATH.

713
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,266
LORD KARSTARK,

714
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,144
THIS MAN
IS OUR PRISONER.

715
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,146
THIS MONSTER
KILLED MY SON.

716
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,148
AND CRIPPLED MINE.

717
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,900
HE WILL ANSWER
FOR HIS CRIMES,

718
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,944
<i>I PROMISE YOU,</i>
<i>BUT NOT HERE.</i>

719
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,196
I WILL HAVE HIS HEAD.
AND IF YOU TRY AND STOP ME--

720
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,824
YOU WILL STRIKE ME DOWN?

721
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,118
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME, SER?

722
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,328
<i>I AM THE WIDOW OF YOUR</i>
<i>LIEGE LORD EDDARK STARK.</i>

723
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,955
I AM THE MOTHER
OF YOUR KING!

724
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,749
- AND WHERE IS OUR KING NOW?
- YOU KNOW VERY WELL.

725
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,709
HE HAS GONE TO THE CRAG
TO ACCEPT THE SURRENDER.

726
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,672
AYE, GONE TO THE CRAG,
BUT NOT TO NEGOTIATE.

727
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,632
HE BROUGHT THAT
FOREIGN BITCH WITH HIM.

728
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,593
- HOW DARE YOU?
- THREATENING MY LADY
IS AN ACT OF TREASON.

729
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,803
TREASON?

730
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,513
HOW CAN IT BE TREASON
TO KILL LANNISTERS?

731
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,640
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR GRIEF, MY LORD--

732
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,143
BETTER THAN MOST
I UNDERSTAND IT--

733
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,020
BUT IN THE NAME OF MY SON,
THE KING IN THE NORTH,

734
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,231
STAND DOWN.

735
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,359
WHEN YOUR SON RETURNS,

736
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,695
<i>I WILL DEMAND</i>
<i>THIS MURDERER'S HEAD.</i>

737
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,030
WISE MEN DO NOT
MAKE DEMANDS OF KINGS.

738
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,159
FATHERS WHO LOVE
THEIR SONS DO.

739
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,536
I WILL HAVE HIS HEAD.

740
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,333
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING
ON MY BEHALF, LADY STARK.

741
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,294
I WOULD HAVE COME
TO YOUR DEFENSE, BUT--

742
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,838
TAKE HIM TO THE STOCKADES.

743
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,090
BIND HIM WITH EVERY CHAIN
YOU CAN FIND!

744
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,633
YOU'VE BECOME A REAL SHE-WOLF
IN YOUR LATER YEARS.

745
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,011
THERE'S NOT MUCH FISH
LEFT IN YOU.

746
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,804
AND GAG HIM!

747
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,353
SINCE WHEN DO YOU LIGHT
YOUR OWN CANDLES?

748
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,814
SINCE I DECIDED THAT
I CAN'T STAND TO LOOK

749
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:20,027
AT ANY OF MY HANDMAIDENS
FOR ANOTHER INSTANT.

750
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,155
HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU
READ ONE RAVEN SCROLL?

751
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,909
STANNIS BARATHEON'S FLEET
HAS BEEN SPOTTED SAILING NORTH

752
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,536
PAST TARTH-- 200 SHIPS.

753
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,624
- MORE THAN WE HAVE.
- YES, THAT'S MORE
THAN WE HAVE.

754
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,210
HE'LL BE AT OUR GATES
WITHIN FIVE DAYS,

755
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,878
FOUR IF HE HAS THE WIND.

756
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,547
WE HAVE STRONG,
HIGH WALLS.

757
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,717
WE'LL RAIN FIRE
DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE.

758
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,886
"RAIN FIRE ON THEM
FROM ABOVE."

759
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,846
YOU'RE QUOTING FATHER,
AREN'T YOU?

760
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,223
WHY NOT?

761
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,225
HE HAS A GOOD MIND
FOR STRATEGY, DOESN'T HE?

762
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,936
WE CALL IT TACTICS,
NOT STRATEGY.

763
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,230
BUT, YES, HE DOES HAVE
A GOOD MIND FOR IT.

764
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,065
THE BEST MIND,
SOME WOULD SAY.

765
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,983
SADLY, HE'S NOT HERE.

766
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,237
IT'S JUST YOU,
ME, AND JOFFREY,

767
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,531
THE LORD
OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS

768
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,449
AND PROTECTOR OF THE REALM.

769
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,786
I'M SURE YOU'LL MAKE
A POINT EVENTUALLY.

770
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,248
HE NEEDS TO START
ACTING LIKE A KING.

771
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,543
THIS WAR YOU STARTED
IS COMING TO OUR DOORSTEP.

772
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,711
AND IF THE ENTIRE CITY
WANTS JOFFREY DEAD--

773
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,130
I'M NOT THE ONE GIVING
THE BOY WHORES TO ABUSE.

774
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,258
I THOUGHT THE GIRLS
MIGHT HELP HIM.

775
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,552
- DID YOU?
-<i> I WAS WRONG.</i>

776
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,932
IF WE CAN'T
CONTROL HIM...

777
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,725
DO YOU THINK
I HAVEN'T TRIED?

778
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,522
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME.

779
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,527
IT'S HARD TO PUT
A LEASH ON A DOG

780
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,446
ONCE YOU'VE PUT
A CROWN ON ITS HEAD.

781
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,327
I ALWAYS HOPED
HE'D BE LIKE JAIME.

782
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,582
HE LOOKS LIKE HIM...

783
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,588
IN A CERTAIN LIGHT.

784
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,925
THE BOY IS MORE
ROBERT THAN JAIME.

785
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,971
ROBERT WAS A DRUNKEN FOOL,
BUT HE DIDN'T ENJOY CRUELTY.

786
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,975
SOMETIMES I WONDER...

787
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,186
WHAT?

788
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,690
IF THIS IS THE PRICE

789
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:25,986
FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE,
FOR OUR SINS.

790
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,071
SINS?

791
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,823
THE TARGARYENS--

792
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:33,118
WED BROTHER AND SISTER
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS,
I KNOW.

793
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,415
THAT'S WHAT JAIME AND I
WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER
IN OUR MOMENTS OF DOUBT.

794
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:42,336
IT'S WHAT I TOLD NED STARK
WHEN HE WAS STUPID ENOUGH
TO CONFRONT ME.

795
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,549
HALF THE TARGARYENS
WENT MAD, DIDN'T THEY?

796
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,301
WHAT'S THE SAYING?

797
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:53,513
EVERY TIME
A TARGARYEN IS BORN,
THE GODS FLIP A COIN.

798
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,016
YOU'VE BEATEN THE ODDS.

799
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,727
TOMMEN AND MYRCELLA
ARE GOOD, DECENT CHILDREN,

800
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,520
BOTH OF THEM.

801
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,816
( crying )

802
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,385
- WHY WAIT?
- WE'RE SWORN TO THE KING.

803
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,096
- THERE'S NOT A KING.
- THAT'S TREASON.

804
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,390
SO IS SAVING
LANNISTERS, YEAH?

805
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,101
- BACK OFF, YOU.
- NO, I WON'T.

806
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,645
YOUR SON RETURNS
AT DAWN, MY LADY?

807
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,355
SO THEY SAY.

808
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,066
Brienne:
<i>THE KINGSLAYER</i>
<i>WON'T LAST THE NIGHT.</i>

809
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,277
<i>THE MORE THEY DRINK,</i>
<i>THE ANGRIER THEY'LL GET.</i>

810
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,363
AND WHEN THE KARSTARKS
DRAW THEIR SWORDS...

811
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,908
<i>WHO WANTS TO DIE</i>
<i>DEFENDING A LANNISTER?</i>

812
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,078
COME.

813
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,263
I NEED TO BE ALONE
WITH HIM.

814
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,350
- MY LADY, OUR ORDERS--
- YOUR ORDERS, WHICH I JUST
GAVE YOU,

815
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,061
ARE TO LEAVE ME
ALONE WITH HIM.

816
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,609
COME TO SAY GOODBYE,
LADY STARK?

817
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:34,573
I BELIEVE
IT'S MY LAST NIGHT
IN THIS WORLD.

818
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,116
IS THAT A WOMAN?

819
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,910
DO YOU HEAR THEM
OUT THERE?

820
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,621
THEY WANT YOUR HEAD.

821
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,000
WELL, OLD LORD KARSTARK
DOESN'T SEEM TO LIKE ME.

822
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:48,253
YOU STRANGLED HIS SON
WITH YOUR CHAINS.

823
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,589
OH, OH.

824
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,174
WAS HE THE ONE
ON GUARD DUTY?

825
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,843
<i>( sighs )</i>

826
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,595
HE WAS IN MY WAY.

827
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,221
ANY KNIGHT WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME.

828
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,599
YOU ARE NO KNIGHT.

829
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,059
YOU HAVE FORSAKEN
EVERY VOW YOU EVER TOOK.

830
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,978
SO MANY VOWS.

831
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,646
THEY MAKE YOU SWEAR
AND SWEAR.

832
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,566
<i>DEFEND THE KING,</i>
<i>OBEY THE KING,</i>

833
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,151
<i>OBEY YOUR FATHER,</i>

834
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,529
PROTECT THE INNOCENT,
DEFEND THE WEAK.

835
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,366
BUT WHAT IF YOUR FATHER
DESPISES THE KING?

836
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,078
WHAT IF THE KING
MASSACRES THE INNOCENT?

837
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,164
IT'S TOO MUCH.

838
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,709
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
YOU'RE FORSAKING ONE VOW
OR ANOTHER.

839
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,838
WHERE DID YOU FIND
THIS BEAST?

840
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,966
SHE IS A TRUER KNIGHT
THAN YOU WILL EVER BE,

841
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,177
KINGSLAYER.

842
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,930
KINGSLAYER.

843
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,140
WHAT A KING HE WAS.

844
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,811
<i>HERE'S TO AERYS TARGARYEN,</i>
<i>THE SECOND OF HIS NAME,</i>

845
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,105
LORD OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS,
PROTECTOR OF THE REALM,

846
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:53,109
AND TO THE SWORD
I SHOVED IN HIS BACK.

847
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,405
YOU ARE A MAN
WITHOUT HONOR.

848
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,742
DO YOU KNOW

849
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:04,329
I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH
ANY WOMAN BUT CERSEI?

850
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,998
SO IN MY OWN WAY,

851
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:12,254
I HAVE MORE HONOR
THAN POOR OLD DEAD NED.

852
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,882
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THAT BASTARD
HE FATHERED?

853
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,427
- BRIENNE.
- NO, THAT WASN'T IT.

854
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,723
SNOW, A BASTARD
FROM THE NORTH.

855
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,434
NOW, WHEN--
WHEN GOOD OLD NED

856
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,021
CAME HOME WITH
SOME WHORE'S BABY,

857
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,149
DID YOU PRETEND
TO LOVE IT?

858
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:37,237
<i>NO. YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD</i>
<i>AT PRETENDING.</i>

859
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,447
<i>YOU'RE AN HONEST WOMAN.</i>

860
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,951
YOU HATED THAT BOY,
DIDN'T YOU?

861
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,287
<i>HOW COULD YOU NOT</i>
<i>HATE HIM?</i>

862
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,123
<i>THE WALKING,</i>
<i>TALKING REMINDER</i>

863
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,793
THAT THE HONORABLE
LORD EDDARK STARK

864
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,671
FUCKED ANOTHER WOMAN.

865
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,217
YOUR SWORD.

866
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,434
I TOLD YOU
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

867
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,645
ALL OF YOU--

868
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:15,150
I TOLD YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF YOU SERVED ME LOYALLY...

869
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,444
<i>AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN</i>
<i>IF YOU DID NOT.</i>

870
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,155
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

871
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,407
IF THERE'S ANY
WHO STILL QUESTION
WHETHER YOUR NEW LORD

872
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,159
MEANS WHAT HE SAYS...

873
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,248
HERE IS THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION.

874
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,418
<i>( crowd gasps, murmurs )</i>

875
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,843
NO!

876
00:53:51,937 --> 00:55:10,015
<i>( theme music playing )</i>
