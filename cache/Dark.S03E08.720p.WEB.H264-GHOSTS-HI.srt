Are you okay?

[WÖLLER] Hey? Everything okay?

I'm not sure.
I think I just had déjà vu or something.

This is going to sound
utterly absurd, but...

What happened now, last night...

that's what I dreamed about.

The light was flickering,

loud thunder outside,

672
01:05:49,819 --> 01:05:52,717
and then the place was totally dark.

01:05:55,403 --> 01:05:56,508
And somehow...

01:05:58,403 --> 01:06:01,008
the world had ended.

[HANNAH] Yeah, I don't know.

It was just dark
and it was never light again.

And the weird thing is...

679
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:21,258
that it felt really good.
