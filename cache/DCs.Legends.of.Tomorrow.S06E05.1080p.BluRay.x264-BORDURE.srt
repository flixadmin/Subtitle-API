1
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:22,398
Look out, world.
I have arrived.

2
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,866
Twenty-five quid.

3
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,283
Oh... Uh...

4
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,620
I've got... two.

5
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,820
That will get you this.

6
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,252
No money, no ride.

7
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,421
Just get me to my house.
There's money there and I can...

8
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:46,589
Out.

9
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,858
Can I ask what your business is?

10
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,988
I reckon you're selling something
if you came all the way out this way.

11
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,949
I... came from over there.

12
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:15,660
Oh, I see...

13
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,288
Oh, I'm glad the owner
finally got a housekeeper.

14
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,206
If you've got reasonable rates,

15
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,875
me and the missus
could use a hand at ours.

16
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,504
I've a collection of Bethany fixtures
which need constant dusting...

17
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:30,466
- What's your name, sir?
- Robert Truss. From number 220.

18
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:35,722
Well, Robert.
I'm not the help. I live here.

19
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,222
We're neighbors.

20
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,641
Oh!

21
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,476
That's a good one, yes.

22
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,271
Oh, you're serious.

23
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,401
But, that can't be. I mean, you living
in an upstanding community such as this.

24
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,194
You don't know anything about me.

25
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:53,990
I know the kind of people who do
live here and you are not the type.

26
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,325
Oh, really?

27
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,202
So what "type" am I exactly?

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,623
What about me doesn't
fit in with you upstanding residents?

29
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:06,252
Is it because I'm tall?
Or female? Or Black?

30
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,840
You stay back. I'll not be threatened
this way in my own neighborhood.

31
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,468
And I won't be treated
like a criminal in mine.

32
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,848
There you are!

33
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,851
I have got a list
of things I need you to fix,

34
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,895
starting with punishing
your racist neighbor.

35
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,206
You'll have to be more specific, love,
and I am on the clock.

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,710
I got a bloke in an alien costume
with another alien inside him

37
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:30,902
and I've got to prep
my gut for a purging spell.

38
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,437
Damn it!

39
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,566
Please get me out of this
meat-fumed atrocity!

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,071
What do you mean? You don't want any
special sauce with that big bang burger?

41
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,274
Hold it right there.

42
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,199
- Hey, girl!
- Hey.

43
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,493
John, where's your washing machine?

44
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,703
I don't need one.

45
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:26,082
You see, my clothes are bewitched to
clean themselves whenever they see fit.

46
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,293
Your clothes
have thoughts, that's kind of hot.

47
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,420
Creepy...

48
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,672
I also need the Internet.

49
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,633
Yes... the Internet...

50
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,510
I will get right to that.

51
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,972
I will whip up a spell in no time.
I just...

52
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:42,950
- I've got to get...
- John...

53
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,434
Something with... Yeah.

54
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:04,120
You and your
empty promises, John.

55
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,875
Yes, I am a US citizen,
but my mother was from Northumberland

56
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,585
so I'm practically a local.

57
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,130
My background check says I'm only 15?

58
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,301
Okay, yeah, that's because I spent
my adolescence in another dimension

59
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,624
where time works differently so...

60
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,471
Hello?

61
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,595
Oh, God!

62
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:07,850
Oh, good, you're back.
I need you to fix the kitchen sink and...

63
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,100
What are you wearing?

64
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,705
Have you seen my emergency
pack of smokes?

65
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,396
I knew that
I left them here somewhere.

66
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,068
No. I still need the Internet
and a job and... food, apparently.

67
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,403
Living topside takes work, love.

68
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,825
- But you do everything with magic.
- Which is work!

69
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,950
Bollocks!

70
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,374
There you are.

71
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,460
Oh, thank you!

72
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,755
How about a spell to fix the sink?

73
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,595
Oh, come on,
you've got to be kidding me!

74
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:49,475
You try getting a job when your last
employers were the Triumvirate of Hell!

75
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:53,437
Give me my power back or I'll have your
blood drained to fill my swimming pool!

76
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,236
I miss my blood pool.

77
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,657
Sterling silver...

78
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,375
European enamelware.

79
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,337
Hundred-year-old designer luggage. Okay.

80
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,506
Huh. Bethany table lamp.

81
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,236
Sorry I never learned
to read music like you, Mom.

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,198
- <i>My, how the mighty have fallen.</i>
- Hello?

83
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,997
- Who said that?
<i>- Back right corner, my lady.</i>

84
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:54,749
<i>Further right.</i>

85
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:55,958
<i>Almost there...</i>

86
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,251
<i>And now you've got it.</i>

87
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,466
Who are you?

88
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,385
Aleister Crowley, at your service.

89
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:11,933
But enough about me.
My concern is for you, dear girl.

90
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:15,770
What's become
of the notorious Astra Logue?

91
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,564
- You know who I am?
- Of course I do.

92
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,485
You are the woman who clawed
her way to the tops of Tartarus.

93
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,654
Looks like you've
discovered the hard way

94
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,031
that you can't take
that power with you, eh?

95
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,202
In some ways, it's easier in Hell
because there aren't any rules.

96
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,747
But here there are so many and following
them isn't getting me anywhere. It's...

97
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,249
humiliating.

98
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,504
A powerful queen
has become a helpless princess

99
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,839
and Hell is lesser for it.

100
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,508
Look who's talking!

101
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,926
A renowned warlock, Satanist

102
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,428
and alien enthusiast
trapped in a portrait.

103
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,932
Touché, my lady.

104
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,143
That scoundrel, John Constantine,

105
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,980
summoned me from Hell
to learn my secrets.

106
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,232
And when he was done with me,

107
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,068
he banished me
into this blasted painting

108
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,238
and tossed me into
this rubbish heap. Hmph!

109
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,032
Yeah, that sounds about right.

110
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:13,869
John made me promise to give living
like a normal human being an honest go.

111
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:17,289
But he did not prepare me
for how hard it would be up here.

112
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,209
This house is falling apart,
I'm completely broke.

113
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,712
And I don't know how to fix any of it.

114
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:26,048
Master Constantine
has neutered us both, hasn't he?

115
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:30,886
But your predicament
is easily rectified.

116
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,891
A simple set of spells will give you
the power to change things around here.

117
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:41,230
- I can teach you how, if you'd like.
- You're offering to teach me magic?

118
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,357
It would be my greatest honor.

119
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:54,118
The infamous Sara Lance.
I've been waiting a long time for you.

120
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,580
So you must be the all-powerful
space lord behind all of this.

121
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,499
When you put it that way,
I sound like a super-villain.

122
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,209
Such a bummer.

123
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,919
Not at all my speed.

124
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,465
Oh!

125
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:12,053
But I have been waiting
a long time to meet you, Sara.

126
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,763
Is it okay if I call you that?

127
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,098
I feel like I've known you
my whole life.

128
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:21,395
Like we're old friends.
Simpatico. Dancing to the same drummer.

129
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,730
Who the hell are you?

130
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,816
My name... is Bishop.

131
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
But that means literally nothing, right?

132
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,278
You've never heard of me.

133
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:33,282
There's no context
for that label, whatsoever, but...

134
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,951
<i>Who am I to you?</i>

135
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,455
Ooh, you were stung by a Zaguron.

136
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,083
Its venom has almost reached your heart.

137
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,044
You've got about
ten seconds before it's lights out.

138
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,521
You'll have come
all this way for nothing

139
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:50,508
and you'll die
with no answers as to why. So...

140
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,968
<i>Who am I to you?</i>

141
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,014
I'm the man who's
going to save all of humanity.

142
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,310
Starting with you and this antidote.

143
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,690
Five, four, three...

144
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,442
<i>To you</i>

145
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:09,985
<i>To you</i>

146
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:14,406
<i>And to this great big universe
We're spiraling through...</i>

147
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,286
<i>We're spiraling through...
Through...</i>

148
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,632
No, no, no, don't struggle.
Your muscles need time to adjust.

149
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,427
- What is that stuff?
- Medicine to vitalize your organs.

150
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,471
The transition can be tough.

151
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,850
- Bishop saved your life.
- I don't want anything from him.

152
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:41,934
Get me out of here.

153
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,812
How's our patient this morning,
Nurse Ava?

154
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,982
Pissed off and calculating
the different ways she can kill you.

155
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,151
- Back to her old self.
- Perfect.

156
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,570
I've got
the presentation all ready for her.

157
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,904
Let me go.

158
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,865
But you haven't even seen the pitch yet.

159
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,869
A/VAva worked on it for days.

160
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,454
She'll be crushed if you
don't give it even just a little peek.

161
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,128
Our planet was perfection.

162
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,463
It had everything
carbon-based life forms

163
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:15,467
needed to coexist in harmony with nature

164
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,802
and each other.

165
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,805
But humanity would not be satisfied.

166
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:25,769
Human greed destroyed Earth
and all who lived there.

167
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,732
Everyone perished.

168
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,568
Except for one man.

169
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,197
Me!

170
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:40,534
As a pioneer in bio-engineering,
the founder of A-V-A Corp

171
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:43,871
and the designer,
creator of the Ava clone,

172
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:50,544
I alone have the knowledge
and means to restart humanity...

173
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,630
in the stars.

174
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,760
The problem with Earth
wasn't its finite resources,

175
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:03,807
the problem was man, which is why
I'm creating a new version of mankind.

176
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:08,562
One with a body that can withstand
the harsh conditions of our new home

177
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:15,027
and with a spirit to adapt
and thrive under any circumstance.

178
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,948
That is a terrible plan.

179
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,200
You can't save humanity

180
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,161
by creating a bunch
of monster people like Amelia Earhart.

181
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,664
No one gets it right
out of the gate, okay?

182
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,751
But I have perfected a process

183
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:35,172
of enhancing human capabilities
by adding extraterrestrial DNA.

184
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,716
I just needed
the raw materials to work with.

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,843
That was what was in those other pods.

186
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,888
And that's why you
kidnapped me to be raw material?

187
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,932
Well, if that's the case
then here you go...

188
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,602
There's your raw material,
now take me home.

189
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,647
Ugh. Don't sell yourself
so short, sweet cheeks.

190
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,483
You're here... to be my partner.

191
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,156
These new humans need
to be taught to have a fighter spirit.

192
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,450
That's where you come in, Sara Lance.

193
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,578
You want me to teach
your hybrids to be badasses?

194
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,662
To be their trainer?

195
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:12,126
Who better to imbue those qualities
than you, the woman who can't be killed?

196
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,503
There you go.

197
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,924
- I know it's a lot to take in, sweetie.
- Don't call me that, ever.

198
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,760
Right. Because of the bossy Ava
you're attached to, back on Earth?

199
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,304
She's not "Bossy Ava."

200
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,265
She's Ava and she's human
and she has her own thoughts.

201
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,226
You may believe that,

202
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,854
but all Avas have
affinities and weaknesses

203
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,231
that I built into
their genetic blueprint.

204
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,025
Hey...

205
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:40,821
You found and fell in love
with one of my greatest accomplishments.

206
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,949
It's as though the
universe knew to bring us together.

207
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,285
You're a sick son of a bitch.

208
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,578
Think about my offer.

209
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,831
We've got all 15 seasons
of <i>Wynonna Earp</i> cued up for you, so...

210
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,209
<i>Take all the time you need</i>

211
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,878
Season two's my favorite.

212
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,796
Here you go.

213
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:10,642
Transformation is the most vital
cornerstone of the dark arts.

214
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:15,147
To do this spell, twist your wrist
in the direction of the object

215
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,401
and visualize what you want
your object to change into.

216
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,236
Little more fluid...

217
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,614
That's almost it. Try again...

218
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,199
Just tell me the damn words.

219
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,659
<i>Permuto!</i>

220
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>Permuto!</i>

221
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,209
My stars! You're a natural.

222
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,337
Well, my mother was a powerful witch.

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,923
Well, you've
made her proud, dear girl.

224
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,927
Smashing job. But that was an easy one.

225
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,597
You know, "permuto"
has several meanings in Latin.

226
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:53,602
One is "to transform,"
but the other is "to exchange."

227
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,065
If you provided an able body
with whom I could change places,

228
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,943
I'd be able to teach you
with greater expediency.

229
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,905
So, some poor fellow will be trapped
in the painting and you'd have a body

230
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,740
you could use to stab me in the back.

231
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,785
- Nice try.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

232
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:15,290
No, I promise the spell is easy to do
and easy to undo if you so wish.

233
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,710
So, it's the same spell,
just a different intention?

234
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,547
If I could nod,
that's what I'd be doing right now.

235
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,341
All we need is a body for me to borrow.

236
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,178
Astra? You home, love?

237
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,350
What's all this?
What the hell is he doing down here?

238
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:36,812
I'm teaching this
brilliant young lady how to use magic.

239
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,355
Like you said, John.

240
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,942
Life topside takes work
and this is me getting to it.

241
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,028
Magic is a slippery slope.
All right, love?

242
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,673
Your mother knew that
and that's why she got out of it.

243
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,366
I mean, she left me
because I wouldn't give it up.

244
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,118
She wouldn't want this
for you, all right?

245
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,121
You don't get to speak for her
or tell me how to live my life.

246
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,541
- Well, you are in my home, aren't you?
- Okay, so now this is your house.

247
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,751
I mean, how about
when it was falling apart

248
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,063
and the bills weren't being paid.
Was it your house then too?

249
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,506
God, you're such
an insufferable hypocrite.

250
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,383
She's got you there, old chap.

251
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,386
Sneaky old bastard,
preying on her desperation.

252
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,846
Whose fault was that?

253
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,699
- You're a vile old snake.
- Unhand me you fiend.

254
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,701
I should've locked you in the cellar
where no could've found you...

255
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,895
Put him down. Put him down!

256
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,063
<i>Permuto!</i>

257
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,903
What the bloody hell?

258
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,071
My word!

259
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,115
It actually worked.

260
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,286
- Brilliant job, dear girl.
- Astra, put us back!

261
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,788
<i>Permuto!</i>

262
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,500
Oh, damn!

263
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,171
Easy to do, easy to undo.

264
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,632
- Oh, Astra, don't...
<i>- Permuto!</i>

265
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,345
Astra!

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,555
Astra, undo this right now.

267
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,807
Crowley is dangerous.
He can't be trusted.

268
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:02,147
Bravo, dear girl! Bravo to you!

269
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:07,110
Here's the deal, you have 12 hours
to stretch your legs and teach me magic.

270
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,571
Twelve hours and then
back into the painting.

271
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:15,577
If you do
one unsanctioned spell, it is over.

272
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,078
You got me?

273
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:22,834
Like the clap, my lady.
Now, let's get to work, shall we?

274
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:35,305
While studying the secrets of Egypt,
I learned that sorcery requires a...

275
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,600
fruitful imagination.

276
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:45,816
One must find potential in the dullest
of things to be truly magnificent.

277
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,582
Mmm.

278
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,135
Finally!

279
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,020
Oh, my!

280
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,608
There you are, killer.

281
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:41,371
I have never seen anyone
take to the dark arts with such ease.

282
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,583
Your natural talents are unparalleled.

283
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,712
No one likes a kiss-ass, Aleister,
and I'm not extending your parole.

284
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,505
Understood, my lady.

285
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,966
What happened to my money?

286
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,553
Oh, dear girl, you didn't think
that treasure was real, did you?

287
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,265
These transformations
are but glamour, a trick.

288
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,353
They're effective in deception,
but temporary by nature.

289
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,938
So, everything I just made,
the money, these clothes...

290
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,608
Will disappear before your very eyes.

291
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,695
Such are the rules
of beginner-level magic.

292
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,114
What if I level up?

293
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,784
No, no, no, no, no. You're not ready.

294
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:23,622
It takes ruthlessness and concentration
unlike any you can muster.

295
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,043
Oh, Al, you clearly don't know me.

296
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,885
Time for your check-up.

297
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:39,929
Hmm.

298
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,640
Vitals are good.

299
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,809
Just gonna check your mobility.

300
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,854
So, are you an Earper for Life yet?

301
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,538
Oh, yeah, I'm digging it.
You were totally right about season two.

302
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,694
They really figured out
what the show was and they went with it.

303
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,572
Well, I really hope you are a WayHaught
shipper, because if you aren't...

304
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,451
Listen to me carefully.
You're gonna take me out of here

305
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,246
and help me find a power source
to fuel my ship. Understood?

306
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,958
I can't do that.
It's not in my DNA to disobey.

307
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,876
That's just what he wants you to think.

308
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,462
Look, the only thing
that's holding you back is you.

309
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,923
And you, with that thing at my throat.

310
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,551
Just promise
you'll help me escape.

311
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,261
Go ahead and kill me.

312
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,347
I'm disposable. He'll have
another Nurse Ava ready by lunch.

313
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,852
You are a human being!

314
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,562
You have a soul!

315
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,898
You can decide for yourself
what's right and what's wrong.

316
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,111
Look, Bishop may have created you,
but he doesn't control you.

317
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,284
Well, at least I can verify
that your mobility is working very well.

318
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,618
Back to bed, you.

319
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,661
Ava...

320
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,415
Please, just think about what I said.

321
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,965
Astra, don't fall for his tricks.

322
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,568
He's too dangerous to be out and about.

323
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,486
Why do you think I trapped him
in a bloody painting,

324
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,304
instead of sending him back to Hell?

325
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,640
He will go back into the painting
as soon as I get what I want.

326
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:09,060
What, magic power?
Astra, you don't need it, love.

327
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,104
Start from the bottom
and work your way up

328
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,689
like everyone else.

329
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,567
I am not like everyone else, John.

330
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,029
My bottom was a little deeper
than everyone else's,

331
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,907
but at least down in Hell, I was a boss.

332
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,326
A ruler and richer than God.

333
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,288
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked to get there?

334
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:32,793
To go from being that traumatized,
terrified little girl with nothing

335
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:33,877
to a queen?

336
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:39,132
I won't go back to nothing, John.
I can't.

337
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,219
John, are you meddling?

338
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,429
Astra, please switch us back.

339
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,765
I didn't realize
how hard it was for you.

340
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,644
I thought you had everything in hand.
I promise, I'll help you.

341
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,647
John and his empty promises.

342
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,775
Shall I remove the distraction?

343
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,568
Be nice, hmm, ish.

344
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,824
Don't worry, I know exactly
where to place him.

345
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,326
You're a right bastard, Aleister.

346
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,453
Trapping you in a painting was merciful.

347
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,746
It should have been the loo.

348
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,291
You're not so tough now,
are you, my boy?

349
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,877
How does it feel to be powerless?

350
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,965
To find yourself stripped of
everything you ever worked for?

351
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:24,469
Astra and I have both felt that sting,
but now we will be unstoppable.

352
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:28,431
I can finally complete my search
for the Fountain of Imperium,

353
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,141
out there in the heavens.

354
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,603
Don't wrap her up in your mad theories
of alien magic.

355
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,397
The Fountain is real...

356
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,693
and with my loyal protege at my side,

357
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,028
I will finally possess it.

358
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,154
Now...

359
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,910
let's bring you up to your
final resting place, shall we, Johnny?

360
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:57,836
Oh, no!

361
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,838
Finally, we're here.

362
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,674
You'd think at least one of us
would have this address memorized.

363
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,093
What? John always zaps us
in and out of here.

364
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,803
Speaking of, where is he?

365
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,180
- John?
- What are you all doing here?

366
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,933
We're out of the Timeship
and we need a place to regroup.

367
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,644
Walking around Northumberland for hours
trying to find this house.

368
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,438
Now is really not a good time.

369
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,732
See, I'm in the middle of something
and I just...

370
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:22,777
- Ooh, are you expecting someone?
- Is it a date? Are you dating?

371
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm starved, y'all.
What is there to eat?

372
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:26,948
I'll make something.

373
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,020
Astra, where's your Wi-Fi router?
I need to hook up Gideon.

374
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:35,373
Ooh, what you making?
Something with ferret liver extract?

375
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,252
- You all need to leave, now!
- And gangrene oil?

376
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,462
Astra, your router.

377
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,213
There's nothing in the fridge. It's sad.

378
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,798
You won't like me when I'm hangry.

379
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:44,922
You don't have your phone?

380
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,053
<i>Permuto!</i>

381
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:55,976
Wow!

382
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,396
Sorry, guys.

383
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,482
Astra,
what have you done?

384
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,359
I'll turn you back as soon as I'm done.

385
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,442
I promise.

386
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:07,989
- Let go!
- Am I a flip phone?

387
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,699
Hey, let go!

388
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,243
Astra!

389
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:20,418
Miss Logue, I've got that chatterbox
John Constantine up in the attic.

390
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,838
Distraction is the enemy
of accomplishment.

391
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:28,885
No distractions here.
Let's make some real power.

392
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:37,227
We'll first create a magical
energy-containing amulet.

393
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,613
Yes, yes.

394
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,496
Brilliant work, my lady.

395
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,041
Your amulet is ready to be charged.

396
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,336
There's only one thing powerful enough
to sustain this amulet...

397
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,006
- a human soul.
- Great.

398
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,760
I've got Christopher Columbus, Ed Gein.

399
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:15,932
No, we'll need a live human soul.
From a beating heart.

400
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,103
You conveniently left that off
the ingredient list.

401
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:26,651
As queen of Hell, you spent millions
of souls like they were pennies.

402
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,947
What's one more
before it goes down below, eh?

403
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:35,452
You said you wanted power.
This is the price.

404
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:42,042
Hi, Robert. It's Astra Logue,
your neighbor.

405
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:46,713
Anyway, I was cleaning out my attic,
and wouldn't you know it,

406
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,382
I uncovered a Bethany lamp.

407
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:55,096
I know you have a collection, so
why don't you come by and take a look?

408
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,935
Wonderful, see you soon.

409
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,939
Astra, are you really luring

410
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,109
an unsuspecting neighbor over
so you can steal his soul?

411
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,821
My unsuspecting racist neighbor?
Yeah, I sure am.

412
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:16,076
If y'all got a Proud Boy
who needs talkin' to, let me at him.

413
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,452
I'll fork his eyes out.

414
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No one is going to do anything.

415
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,249
Astra, using humans as currency
is wrong, remember?

416
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,751
Ow!

417
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,711
Captain,
what did you do with John?

418
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,671
Who's this weirdo possessing his body?

419
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,424
John is fine.
Just, leave me alone.

420
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:34,344
And let you backslide?
You've come a long way since Hell.

421
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,678
You're one of us now.

422
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,198
Yeah,
I don't think she wants to be

423
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,681
grouped with the household objects,

424
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,600
- Cheese.
- Not helping, Z.

425
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,978
Think about what you're doing,
Astra. That guy is a human being.

426
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:47,524
He is a jerk. His soul is going to
end up in Hell anyway.

427
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,777
I'm not worried about his soul.
I'm worried about yours.

428
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,113
Stay out of my way.

429
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,991
Astra, wait.

430
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,833
A little late for a check-up,
isn't it?

431
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:05,874
I would have come sooner,

432
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,129
but I had to wait until
Bishop danced himself to sleep.

433
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,339
I want to help you.

434
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,841
You do?

435
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,884
What you said to me earlier
really struck a nerve.

436
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,720
We are human, we do have souls,

437
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:21,099
and wants, and dreams, and opinions.

438
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:26,187
What Bishop is doing here...
is an abomination.

439
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,191
I knew there was some of that
real Ava spirit in you.

440
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,361
All right, the ship that I crashed in,
it isn't far from here.

441
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,738
We just need to find something
to power it up.

442
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,074
I brought you a fuel cell.

443
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,160
Look at you, thinking ahead.

444
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,286
Let's go.

445
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:48,168
It's much tidier in here
than I thought it would be.

446
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,838
You cleaned up well, too.

447
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,050
Charming how you changed for company.

448
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,386
Playing posh, eh?

449
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,808
Here's the lamp. What do you think?

450
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:11,566
Floral mosaic, favrile glass.

451
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,985
It's not in stellar condition...

452
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,655
Yo! You can still back out.

453
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,950
- You say something?
- No, must be a draft.

454
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,138
Really think about
what you're doing, Astra.

455
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,915
- Hey!
- There's that noise again.

456
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,375
He's a fussy grandpa,
he's not worth it.

457
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,378
Excuse me, while I'm just gonna
tidy up a little bit.

458
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,673
That condescending snob
is not helping his own case.

459
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,842
I think you've
left the telly on.

460
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,261
Maybe, I'm just gonna go check.

461
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,388
Hey, put me down.

462
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,895
What a splendid specimen.

463
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,148
His bitter soul will more than suit
our purposes.

464
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,441
Just tell me what to do!

465
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,776
Hold it up to his heart

466
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,196
and it will leech his very soul
from his mortal coil.

467
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,697
Great.

468
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,412
I hope Earl Grey is okay.

469
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,957
Hmm. Yes, that'll do.

470
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:13,753
Ah...
Let's talk about price, eh?

471
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:19,217
I was thinking 50 pounds
to take it off your hands.

472
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,638
Fifty? That lamp is an antique,
Mr. Truss.

473
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:30,103
Oh, I know. But what would someone
like you want with a dusty old lamp?

474
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,440
Fine, fine, 75 then.

475
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,652
But you better clean it up for me first.
It's filthy!

476
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,112
To be honest,

477
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:42,657
I was thinking of making you pay
a lot more than that.

478
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,299
What's all this, then?

479
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:03,344
Damn it. Get out of here,
Mr. Truss. Now.

480
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:08,141
All right, I'll go to 80.
But that's my last offer. I...

481
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,934
Who the bloody hell are you?

482
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,018
No!

483
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:28,911
That's it, Crowley.

484
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,664
Time for you
to go back to where you came from.

485
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,290
<i>Permuto!</i>

486
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:43,760
Those parlor tricks
are no match for my newfound power.

487
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:48,014
I'm terribly
disappointed in you, dear girl.

488
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,975
I'd hoped
that you'd make yourself a Queen again.

489
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,271
But all you really wanted was
a "Dark Prince" to come and save you.

490
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,939
Sadly...

491
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:01,110
you're just another "Helpless Princess."

492
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,120
Hello!

493
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:27,178
<i>Why, oh, why
Must I be forced to sing</i>

494
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,512
Ooh!

495
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:29,764
Pity.

496
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:33,059
You would've made a smashing evil witch.

497
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,938
<i>Your very harsh words
They hold no sway!</i>

498
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:42,819
<i>Sure, you can run
But you won't get away!</i>

499
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:48,032
And are you going to stop me
all by yourself?

500
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,121
<i>Annoying Legends
I tried to hide</i>

501
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:58,626
<i>So glad they're here
They'll fight by my side!</i>

502
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,211
Get him!

503
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,257
Charge!

504
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,759
Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Pew! Pew! Pew!

505
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,762
Legends, roll out.

506
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,598
Num, num, num, num!

507
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:19,021
<i>- Vámonos!</i>
- This guy. Ho!

508
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,860
Hi-yah!

509
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,781
Impressive, my lady.

510
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:32,076
Transforming your friends into objects!

511
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:41,627
Lucky for me, their souls will infuse
even more power into my amulet.

512
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,046
Now, out of my sight.

513
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,299
Whoa!

514
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:51,803
Ugh.

515
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,937
<i>Oh, how will I ever
Flee from...</i>

516
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,774
Nope, sorry! No more singing!

517
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,319
Oi!
What the hell has Crowley done?

518
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,489
Since we're all trapped
in a bloody cartoon,

519
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:14,452
I'm guessing he's betrayed you
and is about to gain untold power.

520
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,163
Oh, John, whatever shall I do?

521
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,750
That evil wizard is much too powerful.

522
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,836
He has the Legends at his mercy!

523
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,528
He's got the Legends?

524
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,216
He'll kill them all.
They're doomed unless you stop him!

525
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,468
I'm afraid I don't know how!

526
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Astra, listen to me.

527
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,182
Years ago, your mum created
a powerful cleansing spell.

528
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,642
Like an enema for magic.

529
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,144
It expels all sorcery from the vicinity.

530
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:43,147
There wasn't any reason to use it...
until now.

531
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,024
Goodness me,

532
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,443
why would she ever create such a spell?

533
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,569
For me.

534
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,489
<i>If I ever went too far.</i>

535
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,616
<i>Those days, I was reckless.</i>

536
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,828
<i>She was afraid I'd overdose,
so she created the spell as a failsafe.</i>

537
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,832
I reckon it's somewhere
among her things.

538
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:05,711
You don't suppose it's in
this charming little book, do you?

539
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,923
Of course, Natalie's music notebook.

540
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,675
The spell must be a song.

541
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,972
Goodness gracious, I found it!

542
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,432
Oh, fiddlesticks!

543
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,935
My mother never taught me
how to read music.

544
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:28,192
Wait, I can read the music.

545
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,028
But how? I never could before.

546
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,409
Because every cartoon princess
knows how to sing, love.

547
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,875
You unlocked the door.

548
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,169
That ain't the first lock
I've ever picked.

549
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:50,423
Now come on, Princess,
we've got some saving to do.

550
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,069
You won't
get away with this.

551
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,971
Oh, I think I will.

552
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:03,394
Hold still my friend.
This won't hurt... much.

553
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,522
<i>Rest your head</i>

554
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,648
Astra?

555
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:11,652
<i>It's time to sleep</i>

556
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:16,032
<i>Dreams are calling</i>

557
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,035
<i>Count the sheep</i>

558
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,664
<i>Lie in bed</i>

559
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:27,084
<i>Turn off the lights</i>

560
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,004
<i>So we can spy</i>

561
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,422
That spell.

562
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,591
<i>The starry night</i>

563
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,674
It's making me weak.

564
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:42,933
<i>The moon is bright</i>

565
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:47,146
<i>In the sky</i>

566
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:51,275
<i>Close your eyelids</i>

567
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,779
<i>Say goodbye</i>

568
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:59,116
<i>Put your troubles</i>

569
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,453
<i>In the ground</i>

570
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,791
<i>You'll be with me</i>

571
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:10,503
<i>Safe and sound</i>

572
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,631
Oh, no!

573
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,260
<i>Rest your head</i>

574
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:22,348
<i>It's time to sleep</i>

575
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,644
<i>Dreams are calling</i>

576
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,271
<i>Count the sheep</i>

577
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,524
No!

578
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,321
- It worked.
- Oh, my gosh.

579
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,994
Oh, I never thought I'd be so happy
to see this coat again.

580
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,414
You guys okay?

581
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,083
So glad to have my arms back.

582
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,752
So over being cheese.
That smell was getting aggressive.

583
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,116
Yeah, I was gonna say something.

584
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,547
Yo, why was I a fork?

585
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,884
- So... How about that Bethany lamp?
- Get out!

586
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,594
Who are these people?

587
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,515
These are my friends,
and this is my house.

588
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,101
Now, get out.

589
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,071
You can't just leave me here, John.

590
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:23,492
I know what that spell did to you...
and I can help.

591
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:26,662
Out there in the cosmos,
in the Great Beyond,

592
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,582
there's an unlimited source of power.

593
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,751
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go again,

594
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,086
yammering on about
the Fountain of Imperium.

595
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,130
The Fountain is out there.

596
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:41,385
It's a well of unexplored,
untapped and unstoppable magic.

597
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,430
We could work together,
brothers in arms.

598
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,265
Just don't put me away again.

599
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,392
Yeah, so long, Master Crowley.

600
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:51,729
No, I ask you to reconsider.
I'll do anything,

601
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,773
I'll do the dusting,
I'll polish your boots.

602
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,983
I don't think that's gonna be enough.

603
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,401
Well, it was enough

604
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,070
until you set him free
with your bloody meddling.

605
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:04,408
If you had helped out with the house,
and the bills, and the damn Internet,

606
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,703
then Crowley wouldn't have been able
to get his hooks in.

607
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:09,746
You know, you're right.

608
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:12,708
It was my fault you
sought out Crowley's help.

609
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:16,754
I should have listened, rather than
being stuck in my own bloody world.

610
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,799
And I wasn't ready for how hard
it would be up here.

611
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:24,136
I felt like that lost the little girl in
Hell all over again,

612
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,596
completely powerless.

613
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:28,891
You wouldn't understand.

614
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,434
Actually, I do.

615
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,146
Your mom's expulsion spell,

616
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,317
let's just say that
it was... pretty effective.

617
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,822
It didn't just strip Crowley
of his powers.

618
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:44,907
John, I...

619
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,493
I knew very well what the spell
would do. It had to be done.

620
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,622
Listen, Astra,
magic takes a lot of patience.

621
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,041
There are no shortcuts, love.

622
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,627
But seeing as I have

623
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,712
to start from the bottom,
and work my way up,

624
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,465
how's about you and I do it together?

625
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:09,056
All right, see you later, study buddy.

626
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:25,531
You're right. We just need to connect
the fuel cell to the ship's mainframe.

627
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,122
What did you do?

628
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,333
What I had to... He's my maker.

629
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,338
Sara.

630
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:42,881
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

631
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,427
I'm not only disappointed
because our time together

632
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,345
obviously meant nothing to you,

633
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,891
but also because you didn't realize
that this fuel cell

634
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,560
is just my sleepy wakey nightlight.

635
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,104
So soothing, right?

636
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,398
I'm gonna be honest.

637
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,942
I actually needed you to lead me
to the location of this ship

638
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,653
so I could retrieve
the rest of my cargo.

639
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:07,197
Good luck with that
because I ejected all of them

640
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,450
into the deep void of outer space.

641
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:14,830
Sara Lance.

642
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,626
It's called data redundancy.

643
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,411
Those capsules not only kept you safe
during transport,

644
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,756
they also extracted DNA samples...

645
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,260
from each and every one of you.

646
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:31,388
I prefer to have live creatures
to work with but this...

647
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:33,933
is the next best thing.

648
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,633
What the mother...

649
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,836
That was quite an adventure
we had out in the woods.

650
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:47,423
I think we had a real breakthrough,
you and I.

651
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:49,633
We are closer than ever, now.

652
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:54,096
Some may even say... inseparable.
