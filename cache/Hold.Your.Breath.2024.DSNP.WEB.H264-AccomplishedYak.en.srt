1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,250
<i>Ollie, Ada.</i>

2
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:36,833
<i>Mom's coming.</i>

3
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,875
Come on, this way.

4
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,832
Girls!

5
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,208
Mom!

6
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,624
Rose!

7
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,708
Mom, where are you?

8
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,312
Mommy!

9
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:24,958
Help us! Mom!

10
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:16,750
Dear Lord,
we ask that you keep the storms at bay.

11
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,833
Calm the dust.

12
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,333
We thank you for bringing Henry this job.

13
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,583
Preserve those who travel.

14
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,875
Bring Henry in safety
to his journey's end.

15
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,333
Let him earn enough to finish our home.

16
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,208
<i>Plant a crop.</i>

17
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,542
<i>Help me.</i>

18
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:41,667
<i>Help me to see the gifts you've given me
rather than the things you've taken away.</i>

19
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,792
<i>Help me to keep
Rose and Ollie healthy and safe.</i>

20
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,292
<i>Don't let them fall ill
like the other children.</i>

21
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,875
Rose, toss down some hay, sweetheart.

22
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,375
Just a little.

23
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,042
We have to make it last.

24
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,457
<i>Bruise me, bloody me,</i>

25
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,500
<i>if it means you
won't touch a hair on their heads.</i>

26
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,125
<i>Please kiss Ada for me.</i>

27
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,854
<i>Promise her that I will
fend off my human proneness</i>

28
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,917
<i>for evil so that we can be together again.</i>

29
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,208
<i>All of us.</i>

30
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:50,875
<i>And when I lie awake tonight,
banish worry from my heart.</i>

31
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,333
<i>Reward me with peaceful black sleep.</i>

32
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,208
Amen.

33
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,458
I asked your daddy to patch this.

34
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,208
There's just never enough time.

35
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,167
You think he'll see Philadelphia?

36
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,042
No, it's too far east.

37
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,583
Well, I wanna see it.

38
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,791
Hmm.

39
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,500
I wanna see what it's like.

40
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,333
Maybe next summer.

41
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,958
If the crops come in.

42
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,833
Lock this behind me.

43
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,667
Follow my finger as I read, okay?

44
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,707
"The Grey Man locked his lovely wife

45
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,667
and five children in the bedroom,
then gathered embers from the fire.

46
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,833
He aimed to burn the six angels up,
but fate had one more victim in mind.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,458
As the flames leaped higher,

48
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,417
the Grey Man
realized his shirt was caught.

49
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,292
It was no use.

50
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,208
The flames consumed him.

51
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,542
Now, during a dust storm,
the Grey Man's ashes blow together.

52
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,708
He walks the night.

53
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,583
If you don't wear your mask,
you'll breathe him in,

54
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:30,750
and he'll make you do terrible things."

55
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,625
You could come with me.

56
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,875
I won't put them in a tent,
lose what little we have.

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I won't leave her out there.

58
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,250
Alone.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
Girl...

60
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,792
So, how'd
Henry get off last week?

61
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,624
- Well...
- Yeah?

62
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,292
There were quite a few heading out.

63
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,042
Last man standing.

64
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,625
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

65
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,958
Just... It's hard to keep up with.

66
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,332
He's been at that all night.

67
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,791
Is it that cold that was going around?

68
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,625
It started out like that,
but it's just... it's just gotten worse.

69
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,625
It's pneumonia, Dr. Cox says.

70
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,445
Oh, it's not catching.

71
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,250
Doctor says it's
just too much dust in the air.

72
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,333
What are we meant to do about that?

73
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:27,958
It's a battle.

74
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,624
Thomas has been poorly.

75
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,458
Well, they should go see
that faith healer over in Guymon.

76
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,958
He pulled the arthritis
right out of an old man's fingers.

77
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,167
Bones just straightened right out.

78
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,083
It's good you brought the girls, Margaret.

79
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,917
Why is that?

80
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,625
I guess you haven't heard about Calabash.

81
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,332
The daddy said the door was locked.

82
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,875
But the drifter
got into the house somehow.

83
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,166
Ransacked the pantry.

84
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,229
They found him
eating crackers over the baby.

85
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,292
No, Birdie,
he'd already finished the crackers.

86
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,000
He was just looking at the baby.

87
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,707
He must have been hungry.

88
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,500
Hunger don't explain
staring at a baby like that.

89
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,457
Just staring.

90
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,792
And it certainly don't
explain what he did after.

91
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,000
He tied the daddy up

92
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,417
and made him watch
while he killed the mama and the kids.

93
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,958
Gutted like hogs.

94
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,000
Can't keep up with chores as it is.

95
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,667
How am I supposed
to watch out for fiends too?

96
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,250
You keep your guard up.

97
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Always.

98
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,227
Did they ever catch him?

99
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,458
The drifter.

100
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,082
No, not yet.

101
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,957
And I can't figure it.

102
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,832
Nobody saw him leave.

103
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,375
It's like he just melted into the dust.

104
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,625
Oh, sweet Jesus.

105
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,292
Goodness.

106
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,250
You're not leaving today.

107
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,332
Trying to.

108
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,583
The wind is terrible.
There must be a storm coming.

109
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,749
There's always a storm coming.

110
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,833
But people die in them and
you'll be exposed on that cart, Esther.

111
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,000
Unprotected.

112
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,458
All you need to do is make sure
Thomas and Jacob stay inside.

113
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,332
Clean. Seal the house.

114
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,500
Even so,
it seeps through everything.

115
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,667
Keep finding it in the oddest places.

116
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:43,833
I had a dream last night that, um...

117
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,583
He would not stop coughing.

118
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,958
I took a handkerchief,
and I stuffed it in his mouth.

119
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,083
Over and over and over.

120
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,625
Sorry.

121
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,542
I just got to get my boys outta here.

122
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,917
Whoa. Easy. Easy.

123
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,958
Girls, grab the twine
or you'll get lost in the dust!

124
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,917
Where's Ollie?

125
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,542
I can't see her.

126
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,625
What man?

127
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,208
Stay here.

128
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Mom, don't go out there.

129
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,167
The Grey Man?

130
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,875
You scared her with this, Rose.

131
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,042
Didn't I tell you to get rid of this?

132
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,167
Yeah.

133
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,542
This should help with the dust, okay?

134
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,375
What about that man?

135
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,541
That drifter that disappeared.

136
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,333
There isn't anyone out there.

137
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,083
Understand?

138
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,208
I'm taking this.

139
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,667
Will you tell us about the wheat?

140
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,833
The first year we planted,
it just took hold.

141
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:31,542
When the wind blew,
the weeds would wave like the ocean.

142
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,208
And one day, we played hide-and-seek
in the tall grass for hours.

143
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,875
Come on.

144
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,291
Hurry up.

145
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:51,083
<i>You could hide
inches away, and I couldn't see you.</i>

146
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,958
<i>But I could
always hear you giggling.</i>

147
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,208
<i>It was perfect.</i>

148
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:09,958
Good night.

149
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,417
Mom, wake up!

150
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,542
What? What happened?

151
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,333
Ollie was right.
Someone's outside.

152
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,625
See?

153
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,447
Wait here.

154
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,750
It's Jacob.

155
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,000
Esther's boy.

156
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,542
Cart must have gotten
overturned in the storm last night.

157
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,874
Where's Esther?

158
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't know.

159
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,208
I found Thomas
hiding under the cart alone,

160
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,000
so scared I could barely
get him to come out.

161
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,500
Probably left him there when
she went to go look for Jacob.

162
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,917
The Lord
works in mysterious ways.

163
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,500
But he's a wise provider.

164
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,457
All you can do is hold faith.

165
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,083
Faith that He has a plan for Jacob.

166
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,625
A plan more important
than we may ever understand.

167
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,333
- I guess some things...
- ...are just out of our hands.

168
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:05,792
Some things aren't.

169
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,125
You can't just have faith
that He'll do something,

170
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,000
that it's part of the plan or they'll die.

171
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,187
We'll all be buried.

172
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:17,708
Sounds like pride to me.

173
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,458
Better than burying another child.

174
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,667
I tried to leave.

175
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:23,750
In a storm.

176
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,292
I can't change the weather, Margaret.

177
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:27,708
I can't make it rain.

178
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,562
What should I do?

179
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:30,917
You might try sweeping.

180
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,083
Fit as a couple of fiddles.

181
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,458
It just started bleeding.

182
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,292
It wouldn't stop.

183
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,333
Well, air is dry.

184
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,125
That'd be my guess.

185
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,375
Your guess?

186
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,833
After Ollie and Ada, I just...

187
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:56,417
I worry.

188
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,583
Ada used to have
nosebleeds just like this.

189
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:00,583
Hmm.

190
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Esther mentioned something
about the dust making Thomas ill.

191
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,875
The air.

192
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,000
I got some masks for sale.

193
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,417
Might help.

194
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,125
You're taking your sleeping aid?

195
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:27,582
Mm-hmm.

196
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,957
Well, you want my advice?

197
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:33,000
I say keep the house sealed
best you can, wear the masks.

198
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,333
Relax.

199
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,208
Mom, are you awake?

200
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,833
We're not even supposed to
sleep in the same room as you.

201
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,500
There was only enough fabric
to seal one room.

202
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,125
What if it happens again?
What if you stop sleeping?

203
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,583
Don't you understand that
the dust seeps through every opening?

204
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:31,542
That's why your cousin, Thomas, is sick
and it's why your nose is bleeding.

205
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,792
Well, I want to leave.
I want to go to Dad.

206
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,958
Well, when your father sends more money,
we'll take the next train.

207
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,333
I promise.

208
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,917
Has anyone had any mail?

209
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,583
We're going to try to leave
when Henry's next letter arrives.

210
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:16,499
Well, I guess you hadn't heard.
Service has been halted indefinitely.

211
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,145
Dust built up so much, a train in Woodward
skipped plumb off the tracks.

212
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,792
Killed every soul on board except for
one donkey in the freight car.

213
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,417
You're stuck with us, looks like.

214
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:31,708
I see.

215
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,833
Any word on that drifter?

216
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,708
Well, now they're wondering
if the daddy did it himself.

217
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,167
Killed those kids and made up
the intruder wholesale.

218
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,333
Our neighbor said he'd been
acting off right before,

219
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>like a different man entirely.</i>

220
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,458
<i>Think about it.</i>

221
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,250
<i>No one saw that drifter coming or going.</i>

222
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,125
Put your nightgown on, sweetheart.

223
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,167
- Didn't I ask you to tie the doors?
- I did.

224
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:49,082
That cow is keeping us alive.

225
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,667
She's already starving
and something could have gotten to her.

226
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:53,167
- She could have died.
- I tied it.

227
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:54,687
Well, then it has to be tighter. What?

228
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:57,416
Stop.

229
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:00,667
No more Grey Man, understand?

230
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,333
You need to finish your chores.

231
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,417
Rose.

232
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,375
Toss down some hay, would you?

233
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,708
I'm sorry we argued, but...

234
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,833
Rose!

235
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,667
In the barn, who did you see?

236
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,167
But I thought you said he wasn't real.

237
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,667
That doesn't mean no one's out th...

238
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,583
Stay.

239
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:28,458
Come out or I will burn this whole thing
to the ground, I swear to God.

240
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,708
I told you to stay downstairs.

241
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,708
We're scared.

242
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,417
Stay back, girls.

243
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,375
Who are you?

244
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,583
Name's Brother Wallace Grady.

245
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,250
I mean you no harm, ma'am.

246
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:29,958
Just needed shelter.

247
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,458
Henry told me y'all had this barn.

248
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,624
Henry?

249
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,583
Don't you recognize his jacket?

250
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,167
Did you hurt him?

251
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,000
Of course not, ma'am.
I'm a man of the cloth.

252
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:49,708
I, uh, stopped through the works detail
on my way west

253
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,417
and, Brother Henry, he give me this,

254
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,000
and he asked me to check in on y'all.

255
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,749
Why not just knock on the door?

256
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,917
That was my intention, ma'am,
soon as I had a chance to recover.

257
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:08,042
See, I got caught in that storm
on account of my bad leg.

258
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,707
Thought I looked too poorly.

259
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:14,125
I didn't want to scare your girls,
uh, scare you.

260
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,167
Rose, right?

261
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,458
And you're Margaret.

262
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,875
Henry would have told me.

263
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,500
The mail is slow going
with the trains out.

264
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,541
You have to go. Now.

265
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:42,083
I could earn my keep.
People need the Word of God these days.

266
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:45,625
- People need rain.
- One follows the other, ma'am.

267
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:48,417
Just get out! Out!

268
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,875
It's just your cow's starving,
which means you're about to be.

269
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,333
Right?

270
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,125
The milk's dried up.
I could get her producing again.

271
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,207
- Okay. It's okay, it's okay.
- Oh, darlin'.

272
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,542
You're okay.

273
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,957
Mom, help.

274
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,792
Breathe. Breathe.

275
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,457
Stay back.

276
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,792
- Ma'am, I can help...
- Mom.

277
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,875
...but I'd have to touch her.

278
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,000
Why?

279
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,875
I lay hands.

280
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,333
I can heal. Truly.

281
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,292
Even if you don't believe,
what could it hurt?

282
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Margaret.

283
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,124
Mom, help!

284
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,333
Let her go.

285
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,667
Let her go!

286
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,865
What did you do to her?

287
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,458
Mom.

288
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,208
It stopped.

289
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,833
I'll go. I'll go.

290
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,292
I just gotta rest.

291
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,250
You said you could get our cow producing.

292
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,292
How?

293
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,292
Tumbleweeds will soak this water right up.
Yield a lot of feed.

294
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:33,333
I sleep with this,
and I know how to use it.

295
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:35,708
Do you understand?

296
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,750
People will talk if I let you stay.

297
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,958
I could keep out of sight for a bit.

298
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,292
Stick to the barn.

299
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,292
Did he heal me?

300
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,375
I don't know.

301
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,375
Rose!

302
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,667
Well, I hate you, Margaret.

303
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,165
What a fine hand you have.

304
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:12,458
Oh.
It's just our dream for the house.

305
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,000
Missed you in church this week, Margaret.

306
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,583
We were worried about you.

307
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,917
Mom, it's Thomas.

308
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:35,417
Where's Esther?
How did he get here by himself?

309
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:36,499
Oh, poor thing.

310
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,583
Birdie, go fetch the sheriff.

311
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,458
This is heartbreaking.

312
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,042
She's not looking after him, Margaret.

313
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,958
Maybe find out if it's
a short-term grief kind of aberration

314
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,250
or something more serious.

315
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,000
Esther. It's Margaret.

316
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,000
Esther?

317
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,333
Remember when Ada passed?

318
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:31,000
For a long while,
I thought I might just join her.

319
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,083
But you have to think of your other child.

320
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,583
His health.

321
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:46,167
The man has... been looking after him.

322
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,625
Or was that a dream?

323
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,708
Have some water.

324
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,833
Just a sip.

325
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,083
How long have you been lying here?

326
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,292
She... She's not fit.

327
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,082
You sure?

328
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,125
I'd take him,
but we can't feed him.

329
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,833
Come with me, little Thomas.
Yeah.

330
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,707
Margaret.

331
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:53,583
Thank you.
Thank you for visiting me.

332
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,583
It's all right.
You just have to take care of yourself.

333
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,083
What's going on?

334
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,680
Just for a little while, Esther.

335
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,750
What's for a little while?

336
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,000
Just until you get back on your feet.

337
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,667
Are you taking him? Where you taking him?

338
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,333
I won't... Oh. Hey.
Let's just take a moment here.

339
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,041
He's my son. He's all I've got left.

340
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,958
You're no different than me,
you know. You know that?

341
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,125
You're no different than me.
You always thought you were.

342
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,167
You'll be just like me, you hear me?

343
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,707
I'll show you what it's like.

344
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,125
Look at me. You'll be just like me.

345
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,874
You see me?

346
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,667
You'll be just like me.
You'll see. You'll be sorry.

347
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,583
Don't take him from me.

348
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,292
<i>"Count it all joy
when you fall into various trials,</i>

349
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,542
knowing that the testing of your faith
produces patience."

350
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,208
It's lovely.

351
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,374
Yours?

352
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,562
It was my mother's.

353
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,750
Hmm.

354
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,792
Is she how you got into the church?

355
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:27,792
Partly.

356
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:32,333
My daddy was a preacher.
He told me I had the touch young.

357
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:36,625
All my siblings do. I have four sisters.

358
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:39,417
Where are they now?

359
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:45,167
Two are in Texas
and, uh, scarlet fever took the others

360
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:46,833
while I was off spreading the Word.

361
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,917
Ollie had it. Scarlet fever. And Ada.

362
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:20,667
When they went into quarantine,
Ada never stopped calling out for me.

363
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,958
I clawed the door separating us until
my nails were ripped away from the quick.

364
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,208
Temporary parting is a burden
of our earthly lives.

365
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:39,792
But there's a reunion
that lasts an eternity.

366
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:43,292
You believe that?

367
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:45,292
I have to.

368
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:48,958
Don't have a choice.

369
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,417
Those girls are lucky to have you.

370
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,042
You don't think that?

371
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:16,833
After Ada, my sleep was fitful.

372
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,333
And I... I'd do things.

373
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:32,000
No mail today. But the letter carrier said
a haze is dropping in.

374
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,958
God above, I thank you.

375
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,458
I thank you for the warmth
of the Bellum family.

376
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,333
You connected us through Brother Henry,
and for that, I am eternally grateful.

377
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,625
Thank you for Rose's continued health,

378
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:04,792
and we ask that you hold little Ollie
in your ever-loving light.

379
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:09,833
I'm reminded of a verse
that my father taught me.

380
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,667
"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,

381
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:19,292
but this happened so that the works of God
might be displayed in Him."

382
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,917
Thank you for this nourishment.

383
00:46:22,918 --> 00:46:25,104
And thank you for this.

384
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:27,291
This came today?

385
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:29,666
- Ooh, is that from Daddy?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,625
- Mm-mmm. Next one, little...
- What's he got to say?

387
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:32,582
Stop!

388
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,000
- Rose.
- Well, I...

389
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,417
Hey.

390
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,250
"Dear girls,

391
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:57,500
my first hope is that
you can... d... deci... "

392
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:59,542
Decipher.

393
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,708
- Decipher.
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,792
"Decipher my chicken scratch."

395
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:09,458
"My second hope is that these
blades of grass will still be green

396
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,375
- by the time they reach you."
- Mmm.

397
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:13,041
"Just know that when I picked them,

398
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,500
they were the brightest thing
you ever saw."

399
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,208
"This next bit's just for Mama, girls."

400
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:20,292
Oh.

401
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,500
Come on.

402
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,792
Y'all telling secrets over there?

403
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:52,958
Now, Rose.

404
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:56,708
Put her down.

405
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:02,042
That seems like a bad idea.

406
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:03,958
Who are you?

407
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:06,916
Rose, read the letter. Aloud.

408
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,957
"I'm fine, Margaret,
but my jacket was took.

409
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:15,625
Along with the letter in its pocket,
money, and sweets for the girls.

410
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,000
There was a preacher hanging about,
asked to stay the night.

411
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,542
Next day, my bunkmate didn't
come back from lunch.

412
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:28,917
Found him with his head cracked open
like an egg, boots pulled off his feet.

413
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:33,750
Nobody knows how the preacher made off.
Like he just vanished."

414
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,125
I wouldn't have hurt y'all.

415
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:43,167
- Where's the money?
- Gone.

416
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,874
Where's yours?

417
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,458
Gone. Let her go.

418
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,625
I will. In exchange for that letter.

419
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,292
We better hold on to it.

420
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:56,667
See what the sheriff thinks.

421
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,374
Y'all would've starved without me.

422
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,750
Without you, his first letter
would have gotten to us.

423
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:26,291
We could have left!

424
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,875
"Do not neglect
to show hospitality to strangers,

425
00:49:28,876 --> 00:49:31,250
for thereby some have
entertained angels, unaware."

426
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,583
- Angels.
- I fixed her, didn't I?

427
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,083
How about I undo it?

428
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:37,957
Put her back the way she was.

429
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:41,458
Fixed her? You're a con.

430
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,167
Your father, the preacher, a con too?

431
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,792
My father, he'd like you.

432
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,917
Get out.

433
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,750
Get out!

434
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:15,167
I'd be scared too.

435
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,542
You're out here all alone.

436
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:26,333
Don't know when a man could come by.

437
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,250
A few locks. Some twine?

438
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:37,083
That's not gonna stop me.

439
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,250
That's not gonna stop the Grey Man.

440
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,333
I'll be seeing y'all.

441
00:52:58,417 --> 00:52:59,417
Mommy.

442
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,250
Ollie.

443
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:16,833
Did you say that?

444
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,125
What are you doing, Esther?

445
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:39,750
You'll be just like me.

446
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:47,625
You'll see. You'll breathe him in. He'll
make you do terrible things.

447
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:59,333
Mama. Mama. Mama.

448
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:07,125
Were you outside all night?

449
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,750
<i>Margaret.</i>

450
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:30,250
<i>It's not gonna stop.</i>

451
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,875
Mom! Get us out!

452
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:04,207
Mom! Mommy! Mom!

453
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:07,875
Open the door! Unlock it, please!

454
00:56:07,876 --> 00:56:09,875
- Mom!
- Is he in there?

455
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,458
Get us out!

456
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:17,916
Mommy!

457
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,667
Get out of here! Go!

458
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,708
Did you knock the lamp over?

459
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:44,042
No, it's Wallace.

460
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:45,500
How's he doing it?

461
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,833
I was up the whole night.

462
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,750
And the doors are still locked.

463
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,667
Unless he doesn't have to use doors.

464
00:56:58,668 --> 00:56:59,792
Mom, what do you mean?

465
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,000
I should have sealed under this door.

466
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:15,458
Mom. But the... the Grey Man's
just a story, like... like you said.

467
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,167
I-I lent Wallace the book one day.

468
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,750
But he healed you,

469
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,167
right?

470
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:39,292
And he came into a locked house
while I stood watch.

471
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,317
That is what he wants.

472
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,333
Go get your sister.

473
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:53,750
Slide fabric under the door
and don't come out.

474
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,250
Hi.

475
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,875
You're looking well.

476
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,667
What are you doing here?

477
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:11,542
I've come to apologize, Margaret.

478
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:18,875
The things that I was thinking and...
...the things I said, I'm sorry.

479
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:20,082
We're family.

480
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:23,625
Can't we put this all behind us
and just start fresh? I miss you.

481
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,583
I miss the girls and...

482
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,042
Well, you know...

483
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,583
folks are starting to worry.

484
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:35,208
They haven't seen you in a while.

485
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,833
It's difficult with such low light.

486
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:56,000
It's much easier to breathe though.

487
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:06,125
I wonder if it might help to get out more.

488
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,291
It's wild what happens upstairs
when you're allowed to stew.

489
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:14,583
It might be good to take the lid off
and let some of that steam out.

490
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:17,499
You know,
I've been trying to get out more too.

491
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,250
I've been working with the preacher,
praying to get my head right.

492
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,208
I've been visiting Thomas...

493
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:28,625
Margaret?

494
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,333
You might could start
with the dance tonight.

495
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:39,000
Take it from me, you don't want people
speculating the way they have been.

496
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:41,083
You might want to show 'em you're okay.

497
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:43,458
Oh, you're right.

498
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,750
We really should get out more.

499
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:47,958
Yeah.

500
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,707
We're really going to the dance?

501
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:02,792
Esther said
people were worried about us, so...

502
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,042
We have to put on a good face and go.

503
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,208
Well, Sheriff Bell will be there.

504
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,917
We could tell him about Wallace,

505
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:16,667
what's been happening.

506
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,958
Without the letter from your father...

507
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,166
If the sheriff thought
something was wrong, or...

508
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:33,167
He could take you both.
Promise me you won't mention it.

509
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:44,416
It's so pretty.

510
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:47,792
Oh. I think it's the wearer.

511
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,749
Stay inside!

512
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:16,833
We're very well. You?

513
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:26,667
Rose!

514
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:30,667
I can't breathe!

515
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:32,292
Mom!

516
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:36,207
Mommy! Mom, stop!

517
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,875
What is wrong with you?

518
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:45,042
You were crying out!
You were choking! You couldn't breathe!

519
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:46,625
No, I was laughing!

520
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:57,000
It's ruined.

521
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,833
I don't think we should still go.

522
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,000
You'll still look perfect.

523
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,667
It's not just the dress.

524
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,125
What are you...

525
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:31,957
Stop!

526
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,458
It's all right, Rose.

527
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,625
Daddy will be home soon,
and we'll sort everything out.

528
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:44,792
Until then, I just need to go
and show everyone we're okay.

529
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,667
Y'all look right as rain, Margaret.

530
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:19,750
- We're feeling much better. Thank you.
- Hmm. Mm-hmm.

531
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:21,542
Excuse me.

532
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,333
- Yeah, that's right.
- Margaret!

533
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:30,792
Would you, uh, care to go for a spin?

534
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:34,874
Happy to.

535
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,500
So, how's things?

536
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:48,792
Oh, we had a little bug,
but we're feeling much better.

537
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,297
Glad to hear it.
Have you been getting enough rest lately?

538
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:56,417
Why?

539
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,895
What did Rose say?

540
01:03:58,896 --> 01:04:00,208
What do you mean?

541
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:05,208
Oh, nothing.
She... She's been having nightmares lately.

542
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,292
Oh.

543
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,353
- Margaret.
- What?

544
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,000
You, uh...

545
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,250
You...

546
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:33,792
Oh, goodness.

547
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,667
It's just a cut.

548
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,875
It's just my leg.

549
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,208
Please keep playing.

550
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,542
Sorry. Pardon me.

551
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,042
What are you doing with him?

552
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,292
With Reverend Shaw?

553
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,917
Excuse me.

554
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,333
I didn't want the girls to miss the dance,

555
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:24,917
but this cut
h-has me a little light-headed.

556
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:26,000
Margaret.

557
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,750
Why don't I stop by later
with that healer that I mentioned?

558
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:34,707
Healer?

559
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:35,792
Yeah.

560
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,417
You mean Wallace.

561
01:05:38,418 --> 01:05:39,833
No.

562
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,333
His name is Everett Lee.

563
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:46,542
He's real nice.
He got me thinking right again and...

564
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:51,917
He even helps me keep up the house
and he got me this.

565
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,832
I don't care what he's calling himself.

566
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,000
That is the man who was
hiding in our loft, Sheriff.

567
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,937
Who threatened us!

568
01:06:03,938 --> 01:06:05,167
Margaret,

569
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,875
that can't be.

570
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,333
You are housing a murderer.

571
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:15,917
Henry sent me a letter.
Your healer killed a man at his ca...

572
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:18,292
No, she... she's telling the truth.

573
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:24,458
I saw him too.
And... And he threatened to come back.

574
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:26,125
You see?

575
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,375
He's not of this world.

576
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,375
He's...

577
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:38,833
He's been sneaking into our house,
moving things at night,

578
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:41,083
trying to hurt the girls.

579
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:46,583
He can get through locks, closed windows.

580
01:06:46,584 --> 01:06:48,583
He comes apart like dust.

581
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:52,833
- He seeps in through the cracks.
- Mom, please. Please, come on.

582
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:55,167
You can breathe him in.

583
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,750
He'll make you do terrible things.

584
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:18,875
They're gossiping right about now.

585
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:22,083
Wondering if I'm...

586
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:25,417
If I...

587
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,500
But I said I saw him too.

588
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,542
It doesn't matter.

589
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:40,083
They saw me like this.

590
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:54,000
Mom?

591
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,792
Mom.

592
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:09,958
Who did that?

593
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,583
You did.

594
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,583
When?

595
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,083
Was he in me?

596
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:43,542
It's okay.

597
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:48,750
Wait, wait.

598
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:51,750
You heard that, right?

599
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,500
Yes.

600
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,417
But what if it's someone checking on us?

601
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,542
Put your masks on. Slide fabric
under the door the moment I leave.

602
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:29,662
<i>Margaret.</i>

603
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,292
Wallace!

604
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:36,792
<i>Margaret.</i>

605
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:39,500
<i>Here, Margaret.</i>

606
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:41,374
<i>Margaret.</i>

607
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:42,792
<i>Here, Margaret.</i>

608
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,166
<i>You'll be just like me.</i>

609
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:46,792
<i>You'll be just like me.</i>

610
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,999
<i>Margaret.</i>

611
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,880
- <i>Here, Margaret.
- Margaret.</i>

612
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,375
<i>People are talking.</i>

613
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:00,542
Behind you.

614
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:14,917
Mom!

615
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:19,375
What happened? Was it Wallace?

616
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:23,917
Yes, but he vanished!

617
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:27,375
What do you mean?

618
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,499
Like the book!

619
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,208
He's in the air, Rose!

620
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,542
He could be anywhere!

621
01:10:41,417 --> 01:10:45,000
Get inside! Now!

622
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:47,833
Mom?

623
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:50,875
Wallace?

624
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:59,125
Ada, I'm sorry.

625
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,917
I'm sorry.

626
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,750
Please, let me in.

627
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:10,416
Please.

628
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:14,167
- Mom?
- I'm sorry.

629
01:13:14,168 --> 01:13:15,749
I'm so sorry.

630
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,542
Mom?

631
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,667
You're asleep.

632
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:02,708
It's you.

633
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,750
You're sleepwalking again.

634
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,791
It's me.

635
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:11,333
It's Rose.

636
01:14:14,438 --> 01:14:16,958
Mom, it's me! Wake up.

637
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:19,583
- Don't shoot, it's Rose!
<i>- Don't shoot, it's Rose!</i>

638
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:21,417
- It's your daughter!
<i>- It's your daughter!</i>

639
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,332
Don't shoot.

640
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,792
- Put the gun down.
<i>- Put the gun down.</i>

641
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,250
- Mommy, I'm really scared.
<i>- Mommy, I'm really scared.</i>

642
01:14:29,251 --> 01:14:30,707
- You have to trust me!
<i>- You have to trust me!</i>

643
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,958
- You have to wake up!
<i>- You have to wake up!</i>

644
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:33,125
You're not Rose.

645
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:34,124
Mom.

646
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:37,937
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

647
01:14:37,938 --> 01:14:41,750
- Mama! Ma...
- Mama!

648
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:53,042
Rose, what are you doing out here?

649
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:57,833
The Grey Man isn't haunting us.

650
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,292
What are you talking about?

651
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:01,958
It's you.

652
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:05,291
You're
doing things in your sleep again.

653
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,125
That's how the chairs moved
and how the bed caught fire.

654
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:22,125
You can never say that again
about the sleepwalking.

655
01:15:22,126 --> 01:15:23,208
Not to anyone.

656
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,917
Mom, why are you doing this?

657
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:30,875
Why?

658
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:33,333
To protect you.

659
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,125
Then we should have left.

660
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,708
- I was trying to keep us all together.
- Mom.

661
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
You, me,

662
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,749
and your sisters.

663
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,250
Ada is dead!

664
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,125
Don't you understand?

665
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:02,417
You girls are me.

666
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,917
Parts of me.

667
01:16:07,542 --> 01:16:10,542
- Cutaway pieces that never heal.
- Mom, you're scaring me.

668
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,500
I bleed when you're hurt.

669
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:19,332
I'm alive in that grave...

670
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,417
...suffocating under
the dirt with your sister.

671
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,083
And I would do anything,

672
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:29,542
anything to keep us together,

673
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:31,791
to keep us whole.

674
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,500
Rose!

675
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,958
Ollie!

676
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,958
Aunt Esther?

677
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,750
It's too late!

678
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,083
There's nowhere to go, Rose!

679
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,833
Let her go!

680
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:01,791
Mom!

681
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,750
That wasn't Wallace.

682
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:09,666
You killed Aunt Esther.

683
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:11,541
You're hurting her, Rose!

684
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:13,417
Let her go!

685
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:14,416
Help!

686
01:18:18,876 --> 01:18:20,625
They will take you.

687
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:23,000
They will take you away. Please.

688
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,708
Hi, sweet pea.

689
01:18:51,709 --> 01:18:53,000
Where's Mama?

690
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:15,000
Rose, you all right?

691
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,417
She's not fit.

692
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:23,417
Rose.

693
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:27,875
All right now.

694
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,333
You two just go wait in there.

695
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:36,791
Don't worry.

696
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:39,083
We're just gonna have
a nice little chat, all right?

697
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:45,458
I don't know what's gotten into her.

698
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:49,333
For the coyotes.

699
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:53,917
Had one recently?

700
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,083
They're always around.

701
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,249
Did, uh, did...
did Esther come by, Margaret?

702
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:13,125
She-She said she was gonna check in.

703
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:15,958
I hope she wasn't lost in the storm.

704
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,333
Margaret, the-the girls seem rattled.

705
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:27,583
Stir crazy, I guess.

706
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,792
Maybe I ought to take 'em.

707
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,458
Just till Henry gets back.

708
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:43,625
Hey, now, hey.

709
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,292
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

710
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,457
Hey, hey, hey.

711
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:53,000
Margaret, it's just a few days now,
just a few days.

712
01:20:53,001 --> 01:20:55,458
You done good. You done real good.

713
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,750
They're going to hang me, Rose.

714
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,833
But there is a way around it,

715
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:24,375
a way to stay together.

716
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:29,292
A reunion that lasts an eternity.

717
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:36,875
We just go to sleep like any other night,

718
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:39,667
but longer.

719
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,667
Please, no.

720
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,167
Yes, baby.

721
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,167
It's the only way.

722
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:58,583
It's okay to be scared.

723
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,125
It's okay. Come here.

724
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,125
Come here.

725
01:23:11,001 --> 01:23:12,250
Oh.

726
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:20,125
I'm sorry.

727
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,707
I'm so sorry for everything, Rose.

728
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:29,792
You're the loves of my life,
you know that.

729
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:55,166
I'm just so tired, Mommy.

730
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:57,833
Let's go be with Ada. All right?

731
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:27,250
Can you tell us about the wheat first?

732
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:30,917
Yes.

733
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:41,667
Our first year, it just took hold.

734
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:45,375
The field was-was chest-high.

735
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:52,375
And when the wind blew, the wheat
would ripple and wave like the ocean.

736
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:57,375
And we'd play in that field for hours.

737
01:24:58,125 --> 01:24:59,417
All together.

738
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,667
Could we have the medicine
in some peaches?

739
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:11,292
I think that's a wonderful idea.

740
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:37,875
Ollie!

741
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:40,708
Mom!

742
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:45,042
I-I tried to stop her,
but Ollie got scared and ran out.

743
01:25:45,043 --> 01:25:47,917
She has to be with us.

744
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,167
She could be drowning!

745
01:25:57,125 --> 01:26:00,583
Oh, please!

746
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,167
Where is she?

747
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:01,333
I'm sorry.
