1
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:03,500
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:06,570
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:09,656
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:12,526
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,196
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,248
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,752
but, in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:25,005
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:27,708
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,459
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,545
- He's your brother, Cisco.
- Not by choice.

12
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,797
So Mom tells me you're
still working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,716
We couldn't do what we do without Cisco.

14
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:37,267
Oh, he's loyal. Just like a dog.

15
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:39,102
We had a deal.

16
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:41,438
My speed for Wally's life.
Hand him over, and it's yours.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,390
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

18
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:44,858
He's becoming human again.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,226
Aah!

20
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,896
I know some piece of you did care for me.

21
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:52,232
Please, let him go.

22
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,984
- Caitlin!
- You are gonna get

23
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,403
your speed back, Allen,
and I'm gonna help you do that.

24
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,955
- How?
- By creating another

25
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,207
particle accelerator explosion.

26
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,745

[sirens wailing]

28
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:14,228
Barry, there's a high-speed chase

29
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,481
heading south on Milton Ave.

30
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:20,351
[tires screeching]

31
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:21,569
We lost 'em.

32
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,104
[laughing]

33
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,605
Not gonna lose him, though.

34
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,606
You wanna bet?

35
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:29,660
[engine revs]

36
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:33,164
Oh! Oh! You wanna play?

37
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,449
Okay! All right.

38
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:37,285
Get ready to bring it!

39
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:40,371
- They're not slowing down.
- Of course not!

40
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:43,841
[tires screeching]

41
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,260
There's our out... the tunnel!
Take the tunnel!

42
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,963
They're headed for the Fifth Street tunnel.

43
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:50,465
Satellite can't project in there.

44
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,300
What? You just thought of this now?

45
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,218
I didn't think he'd actually
try to outrun The Flash!

46
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,554
Lightning. Lightning toss!

47
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,189
He wants to do the lightning toss.

48
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,607
Nope. No lightning. It's a hologram.

49
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,642
- Remember?
- Just...[grunts]

50
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,644
No. No, no. The wind-up!

51
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:05,446
So we can block their field of vision.

52
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,647
Yes! Of course.

53
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,319
All right, Cisco.

54
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,204
This is where all
those countless hours gaming

55
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,623
in your basement are about to pay off.

56
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,326
Fingers, don't fail me now.

57
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,294
Leerooooy...!

58
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:25,049
- Ah, my eyes!
- What is this?

59
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,968
[tires screeching]

60
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:33,925

63
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,768
I need a breather.

64
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,019
I didn't think this hologram thing

65
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,605
was gonna work, but so far, so good.

66
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,907
[laughs] I mean,
I figured if they could get 2Pac

67
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,742
rapping again at a concert,
we could definitely get

68
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:53,194
The Flash running around Central City.

69
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:55,079
- It's not gonna last.
- There it is.

70
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,281
It's not gonna be long
before someone figures out,

71
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,200
"Oh, wait. You never say anything.

72
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,452
You never touch anything.
Oh, wait. You never go indoors"

73
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,204
Okay, well, without Barry's speed,

74
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:06,541
- this is as good an idea as any.
- Actually, I beg to differ.

75
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,593
I think a better idea, instead of playing

76
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,044
"Hoodlums and Holograms"

77
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:12,380
would be to rebuild the particle accelerator

78
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,432
- to get Barry's speed back.
- Yeah, Wells,

79
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,384
- that's what you keep saying.
- That's right.

80
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,886
Look at what that explosion
did to this city.

81
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,888
Not to mention, last time
we tried something like that,

82
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,191
we blew a hole in the universe
and created, like,

83
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,559
50 portals to your Earth.

84
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:26,277
Which is exactly how Zoom and his henchmen

85
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:29,197
- got here in the first place.
- I told you.

86
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,948
I know how to contain the explosion.

87
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,284
- Really?
- Yes.

88
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,570
You know how to contain
a dark matter explosion

89
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,823
that, last time, just radiated
all of Central City?

90
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:41,209
You tried this on your Earth, remember?

91
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,743
Didn't go so well.

92
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:44,328
And, even if you could contain it,

93
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,580
I thought you said that Barry couldn't tap

94
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,248
into the Speed Force anymore.

95
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,833
It wasn't connected the first
time he got his powers.

96
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,252
Look, I have your Wells's data.

97
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,421
The Harrison Wells from this
Earth, I have his science.

98
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:55,923
I know what chemicals
need to be in your body.

99
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,226
I know how the lightning needs
to bond with the dark matter

100
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,977
from the particle accelerator explosion.

101
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:03,564
I can recreate the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

102
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,932
This will work.

103
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:08,653
Your subterfuge... is not gonna last.

104
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:12,607
But more importantly...
it's not gonna save Snow.

105
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,993
[pensive music]

106
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,112
It's not gonna bring your Caitlin back.

107
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:20,197
You wanna be ready should Zoom return...

108
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,585
if Zoom returns... when Zoom returns...

109
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:26,454
there is only one way to do it,

110
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,040
and that's by getting your speed back.

111
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,477
Hey.

112
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,145
- Hey.
- How are you?

113
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,531
- You made it.
- Yeah.

114
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,483
- Look at this.
- Come inside. Get warm.

115
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,785
Yeah. Wow.

116
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:03,791
- Sure is a pretty drive up here.
- It is that.

117
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:11,666
I can't help but wonder why
a speedster needs a car.

118
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:16,304
Because I am no longer a speedster.

119
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,172
You've lost your powers?

120
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:22,343
I gave them up to save Wally, Joe's son.

121
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:26,647
Zoom had him, so it was either
give him my speed, or...

122
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:31,185
I couldn't let Wally die.

123
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:35,439
No. You couldn't.

124
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:39,327
Now Jay has taken Caitlin, and
we have no idea how to save her.

125
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,995
Jay took Caitlin?

126
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:43,247
Jay. It's... yeah.

127
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:48,869
Turns out Jay Garrick is not
the Flash from Earth-2.

128
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:50,204
He's Zoom.

129
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:52,256
Garrick?

130
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,842
Garrick, yeah. Why?

131
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,210
My mom's maiden name.

132
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,432
Maybe... maybe Wells is right.

133
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,385
Maybe I should try to get my powers back.

134
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,220
How would you do that?

135
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,889
By recreating the
particle accelerator explosion.

136
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,941
And getting struck by lightning again?

137
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,863
That doesn't seem like
the safest option, does it?

138
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,733
No.

139
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:24,238
I've watched you grow
ever since you became The Flash,

140
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,043
and I am so proud of that man.

141
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,630
But ask yourself,

142
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,299
do you really need powers

143
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,752
in order to be that person?

144
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:43,474
It just feels like every time something good

145
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,927
happens in my life, it's taken away.

146
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:52,767
Well, maybe it's time
we did something about that.

147
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:00,408
It looks like the Vacuum.

148
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,576
Uh, what's the Vacuum?

149
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,579
- No "Fringe" on Earth-2. Noted.

150
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,248
What is that thing?

151
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,451
That is how Barry's gonna
get his speed back.

152
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,037
This is what you've been
working on in the workshop?

153
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,955
Someone has to worry about Zoom.

154
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:18,459
- Okay. Barry cannot do this.
- He has to, Ramon.

155
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,960
You keep calling me that, but that's...

156

Dante?

158
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:33,107
What did you see? Zoom? Did you see Zoom?

159
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:35,192
No.

160
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:38,896
I saw my brother.

161
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:42,233
I got to go.

162
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,901
See where everybody is.

00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:45,402
Hey.

00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,570
Henry?

165
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,539
Iris. Hi.

166
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,241
It's so good to see you.

167
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,460
Aw, you too.

168
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,229
I guess Barry
dragged you back for a bit, huh?

169
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,215
Looks like maybe for good.

170
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,050
Wait, what? Seriously?

171
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:04,338
Yeah, yeah, I figured I spent
enough time away from my son.

172
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,006
Have you told Dad?

173
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,726
No, I wanted to tell him in person.

174
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,427
Yeah. I think he's with Wally at CCPD.

175
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:12,730
I'll give him a call.

176
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,349
- Good to see you.
- Yeah. Let's get settled.

177
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:18,269
[pensive music]

178
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:27,244
Your sister called,
checking in when we'd be home.

179
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,413
- As in, we need to get going?
- Thanks.

180
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,531
You know your sister.

181
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,750
Okay, move it. Let's go.

182
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,120
Do you ever get sick of this job?

183
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:37,454
Being a cop?

184
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:41,425
Oh, looks like someone inherited the West

185
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,928
I-need-to-help-people gene.

186
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,381
Ever since The Flash saved me, I just...

187
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:49,049
I don't know if designing cars

188
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:52,303
is what I'm meant to do with my life.

189
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,689
Well, I'm sure there's something out there

190
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,474
that'll satisfy your need for speed

191
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:00,027
and helping people, but, until then,

192
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,730
you should stick with engineering.

193
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:04,398
It's much safer.

194
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,233
We should get going before Singh comes up

195
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,152
with something for me to do.

196
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,572
Zoom!

197
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,874
Hello, old friend.

198
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,242
Stay away from him.

199
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,044
Do not move.

200
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,462
Or what?

201
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:22,132
You've tried your guns on me once before.

202
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,584
[dramatic music]

203
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:26,253
No! Don't hurt them.

204
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,590
Let them go, please.

205
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:41,151
Tell everyone that this city is mine.

206
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:44,688
Anyone who disobeys me

207
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,942
will meet their end.

208
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:54,114
All right. Clear out!

209
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:15,082
- Caitlin's with Zoom.
- Why would he bring her here?

210
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,450
To show power.

211
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,069
That's exactly what he did on my Earth.

212
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,571
- What are you talking about?
- The first thing he did

213
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:22,789
was murder people.

214
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,408
Slaughtered a bunch of policemen.

215
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:27,163
Then recruited every
meta-human he could find.

216
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,833
And those that disobeyed, he killed too.

217
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,719
- Where are the police now?
- Outside the precinct.

218
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,505
He'll kill them, Joe. He'll kill them all.

219
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,257
Not with Caitlin with him.

220
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:39,559
She talked him out of killing
everyone when he took over CCPD.

221
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:40,593
That's what we're gonna rely on?

222
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,011
Snow talking him out of it?

223
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,897
Joe, you need to get
those guys out of there.

224
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,899
What if they set up at Jitters?

225
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:48,518
That's a good idea... it's just
a block away from the precinct.

226
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,236
And then what? What happens next?

227
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,105
You saw what Zoom did on my Earth.

228
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,107
He will do the exact same thing here.

229
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:56,075
Barry, we need to get you your powers back.

230
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:59,329
- There must be another way.
- There's not.

231
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,332
There's not.

232
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,900
I'm gonna get word to Singh.

233
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,369
Get him to set up a task force at Jitters.

234
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,037
- And then what?
- I don't know yet,

235
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,540
but I'm gonna make sure
Wally and Jesse are safe.

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,387
You know they're gonna figure
out a way to stop you, right?

237
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,474
Who? Barry? Wells? The police?

238
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,693
No. Nobody can stop me now.

239
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,228
Not anymore.

240
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,697
So...what's your plan?

241
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,568
You're just gonna kill everyone?

242
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,905
Not everyone.

243
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,907
Then why are you keeping me here?

244
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,080
'Cause I don't want to be alone anymore.

245
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,751
I am never going to be with you.

246
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:57,921
You think that you're not like me,

247
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:01,140
but I've seen the darkness
inside of you, Caitlin.

248
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:04,811
Just like it was inside Killer Frost.

249
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:09,065
All you have to do... is unlock it.

250
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:15,772
[whoosh]

251
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:17,941
[sighs]

252
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,376
[rock music]

253
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:38,211
Hey.

254
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,096
There she is.

255
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,266
Still refuse to dress
like a grown-up, I see.

256
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:44,517
One grape soda.

257
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,219
Ah, no. I'm good.

258
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,271
Thanks.

259
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:51,474
So... what's wrong?

260
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:52,976
What? Something has to be wrong

261
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,644
for me to want to catch up with my brother?

262
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:55,778
Yeah, that's usually the way it works

263
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,196
with you, isn't it?

264
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,149
Actually, I had this...

265
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:02,785
feeling that I should come see you

266
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,654
and make sure you're okay, so...

267
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,539
Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped

268
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,157
by Snart and his pyromaniac friend again.

269
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,660
Us. You. Me. Us. They kidnapped both of us.

270
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,045
Yeah, well, you're not the one

271
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,213
who almost had his hands frozen off.

272
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,749
Lucky I can still play the piano.

273
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,501
Well, my octaves haven't quite
been the same,

274
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:19,836
but not that that matters to you.

275
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,171
Dante, I called you, more than once,

276
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,140
but, of course, you didn't answer.

277
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,175
Like I said. Only when something's wrong.

278
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,595
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,515
I don't know why I thought

280
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,851
that whole experience... that was it.

281
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,104
That was gonna bring us closer.

282
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:41,190
Cisco, we haven't been close
since we were kids.

283
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:44,410
I don't think anything's
ever gonna change that.

284
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:47,330
[pensive music]

285
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,501
All right. We'll bring down

286
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:52,585
some more supplies later.

287
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:54,370
How you can reach us.

288
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,789
And exactly how long
are we supposed to be in here?

289
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,875
Until someone lets you out.

290
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:02,762
This isn't ideal... none of it...
but Zoom's here,

291
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:04,931
and until he's taken care of,
this is what we're doing.

292
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,766
This is the safest place
for the two of you right now.

293
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,217
What are you gonna do?

294
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:10,219
- Whatever we can.
- Joe, let me do something.

295
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:12,188
Wally, there isn't anything
you can do right now.

296
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,523
Sit tight.

297
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,608
Okay, well, what about the...

298
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,646
bathroom? [both chuckle]

299
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:21,864
This room have Wi-Fi at least?

300
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,571
Wally and Jesse are all good.

301
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,790
[sighs] Thank you.

302
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:36,796
So this is what it takes
to get Barry his speed back.

303
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:38,998
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,918
It's not uncomplicated, but almost there.

305
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,303
I told you before,
once Barry makes up his mind,

306
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,389
it's impossible to change it.

307
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,725
Well, then we need to convince
him that this is the only way,

308
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,927
before he decides not to do it, right?

309
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,395
Shouldn't have to convince anyone

310
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:54,597
to do anything against his will.

311
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,234
Joe, we're talking about Barry, right?

312
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,353
I mean, I can't... I can't imagine

313
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:03,106
you don't feel the same way.

314
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,657
I mean, right now, I don't know what

315
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,192
the right thing to do is.

316
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:07,527
Seems clear to me.

317
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,246
This isn't just about your son.

318
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,832
Henry, this is about
the people in Central City.

319
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:15,668
About saving those people.
This is about stopping Zoom.

320
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,920
Your daughter is safe.

321
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:21,374
This could kill my son.

322
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,126
I'm not gonna let that happen.

323
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:24,794
The last time he was struck by lightning,

324
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,295
he was in a coma for nine months.

325
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,464
How did that happen? I know what I'm doing.

326
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:31,968
You are messing with something
that is out of your control.

327
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,470
And what if it did work? I mean, what then?

328
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,355
Joe? He goes up against Zoom,

329
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:40,193
the monster that snapped
his back and almost killed him,

330
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:43,312
and then took the one thing
that he's convinced now

331
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,198
that he needs in order to make him whole?

332
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,035
This is the way. This is the only way.

333
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,704
The people of Central City need The Flash.

334
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:52,789
Guys.

335
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:00,663
I know that you care about me,
each of you, in your own way,

336
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,248
and you all have
your own point of view on this,

337
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,583
but this decision is mine.

338
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,671
I have to make it on my own.

339
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:16,729
Can you put the Diamonds game on?

340
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,482
Ah, sports. That's my cue.

341
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:22,185
All right, well, this was fun.

342
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:26,105
Um...good hang. Whoa. Wait.

343
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,941
Gonna take care of that, right?

344
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:30,359
Dude, you invited me.

345
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:32,862
Unbelievable.

346
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:37,116
Hey, hold up!

347
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:41,204
Oh, no.

What? Cisco?

349
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,508
Hey, wait.

350
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:50,263
Yo! I need a lift home.

351
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:51,514
You still don't have a car?

352
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:52,715
Some of us don't have

353
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,801
a fleet of company cars at our disposal.

354
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,269
Dude, it's on the way.

355
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,970
Yeah, okay. Come on.

You okay?

359
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,297
Hello, Vibe.

360
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,117
Simmer down, Reaper.
We got no beef with you.

361
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,702
Maybe not,

362
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,654
but I've got beef with you, Vibe.

363
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:36,039
Why does he keep calling you that?

I don't know.

365
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,209
You killed my brother, so, now, you die.

366

Oh, my God.

367
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,797
You're "Princess Bride"-ing me right now!

368
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,000
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else, Inigo.

369
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:50,003
I don't think so. My brother was Reverb.

- Move!
- He looks...

372
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,733
- Get... get... get in the van!
- He looks like...

373
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:04,934
Now!

374
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:11,908
I knew there was something wrong.

375
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,242
Every time I see you, we get attacked

Come on! He's gonna
blast us with that thing!

[tires screeching]

You want to tell me exactly
what you've gotten us

into this time?

385

He calls himself Rupture.

00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:44,440
Another meta-human under Zoom's
control from my Earth.

387
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,726
Great, so he's bringing more
of his friends over.

388
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:49,062
That's what I told you he would do.

389
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:51,781
Okay, well, Zoom must've
lied to fake-Dante

390
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:53,316
and told him
I was the one who killed Reverb,

391
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,817
'cause dude wants me dead.

392

We got to do something.

393
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,854
What else do you know about him?

394
00:18:57,856 --> 00:19:00,073
He gets his power
from that scythe he wields.

395
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,291
Thing's legit too... it almost
took half the van with him.

396
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,960
All right, then that's what we need to do.

397
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:06,045
We need to figure out a way
to get it away from him.

398
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,498
Right. Okay, all right.

399
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,049
I'm sure I can come up with something.

400
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,468
I just have to figure out
a way to not tell Dante

401
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,671
why this psychopath looks exactly like him.

You know what you need to do.

I need a minute.

405
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:40,296
Hey.

Hey.

407
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:47,170
It should be an easy decision. Why isn't it?

408
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,589
I mean, it's not like you're picking out

what sweater you're gonna wear.

particle accelerator explosion?

412
00:19:57,315 --> 00:20:00,516
What if...

413
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:04,771
I thought bringing my dad here
would make this easier.

414
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:06,739
It's just made it a lot harder.

415
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:08,691
Yeah, I can understand him
not wanting you to do it.

416
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,660
He just wants you to be safe.

417

What about you?

418
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,581
I mean, I don't know if I could go through

419
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,867
what I went through last time
if you get hurt.

Not really.

What's up?

423
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,770
Do you remember when I told you

424
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:39,439
that I didn't want you going to Earth-2

425
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,607
if you felt like you
didn't have anything left here?

426
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:45,144
Yeah... because Patty left.

427
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:49,198
It wasn't just because of Patty.

428

What do you mean?

had someone to come home to.

About us.

What Wells said about us
being married in the future.

434
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,341
And on Earth-2.

435
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,978
And I can't help wondering if...

436
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,431
maybe we were meant to be together.

437
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,524
So...

438
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:35,194
when I told you how I felt
about you last year...

439

Why are you telling me this now?

that it doesn't matter to me
if you're The Flash or not.

for what he did to my brother!

And he will. Later, Rupture!

What are you gonna do, slugger?

479

Having The Flash might
be the best way to stop Zoom

and all the metas he's sending over.

But, look, until we know for sure

482
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:50,056
that setting off the accelerator
will work, it's too risky.

Not just for me. For the entire city.

00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:04,870
We're gonna have to figure out

490
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,739
how to do this without The Flash.

491
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,366
- Joe, did you reach The Flash?
- He'll be here.

492
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:28,034
Great, these guys are almost ready.

493
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,153
Put it on "1."

494
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:31,805
Hey, we're all set up.

495
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,289
Are you sure this is the best plan?

496
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,208
Look, I know you can't help as The Flash,

497
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,827
but stopping one of Zoom's
cronies sends him a message

498
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,829
that we won't be intimidated.

499
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,915
You think I made the right decision?

500
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,166
I don't know, Bare.

501
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,467
Whether you made the right one or not,

502
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,553
you're gonna have to live with it.

503
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:47,921
Yeah. All right.

504
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,683
What is this?

505
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,102
You went to another Earth?

506
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,853
You weren't supposed to read that.

507
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,189
It was on your desk.
It was addressed to Mom and me.

508
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,991
So, yeah, I read it.

509
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:10,493
Look, I got to go, okay?
We'll talk about this later.

510
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:12,362
No, man, we're gonna talk
about this right now!

511
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,947
Okay, let's talk about this now.

512
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,532
What did you want me to say?

513
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,834
"What up, fam?
I know you probably don't care,

514
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:19,786
"but I'm going off
to another Earth for a hot sec.

515
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,421
"If I don't make it back in time for dinner,

516
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,123
it probably didn't go so well."

517
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,008
Why did you even go in the first place?

518
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,711
Because my friends needed my help.

519
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,679
What kind of help?

520
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:32,549
- They needed me to vibe.
- Vibe?

521
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,519
That's what that lunatic
called you, who attacked us.

522
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,605
What aren't you telling me, Cisco?

523
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,474
[pensive music]

524
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:48,198
I have powers.

525

[laughs] Powers?

526
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,655
What, you're, like, a meta-human?

527
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,831
I was affected

528
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,966
when the accelerator went off two years ago,

529
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:12,172
and now I see things, vibes... of people.

530
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:15,508
Like visions?

531
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,260
So that's why you called me.

532
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,345
Yeah.

533
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,348
I had one of you, or at least
I thought it was you,

534
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,351
until your "World of Warcraft"
doppelganger showed up.

535
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,853
You killed his brother?

536
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,856
No, I didn't kill his brother.
Of course not.

537
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,524
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

538
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:35,195
Because you're right.
It's just like you said.

539
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:39,365
We haven't been close in years and...

540
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,668
and there's nothing
we can do to change that.

541
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:48,291
Look, I got to go.

542
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,376
Um...

543
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:53,046
just wait for me here, okay?

544
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,059
You all set, Cisco?

545
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,894
Yeah, we're set.

546
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:10,280

but you'll be a nice warm-up.

553
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,011
Too slow, Rupture.

554
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:52,488
Come on, Flash!

555
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,357
All right. Time to win an Oscar.

Are we the guys you were looking for?

be talking to anyone at Iron Heights.

CCPN has learned that a meta-human

568
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,316
was just apprehended after
an altercation with The Flash.

569

You said you would spare them.

I will see what I can do.

It won't be long now.

than he ever did on my Earth.

So what's next?

632
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:49,271
Next, he'll recruit every
meta-human he can find,

633
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:50,889
and then force them to do what he wants.

No. You're not even close.

637
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,948
This...

638
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,784
is a list of meta-humans from my Earth.

That didn't happen here.

643
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:11,410
Then why wouldn't we know
about other meta-humans here?

644
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:13,245
Because of The Flash.

645
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:15,297
And now that everyone knows
that he's not around...

646
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:17,249
They'll start coming out of the woodwork.

647
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,751
We don't know that.

648
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,803
What more do you need?

649
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:22,588
I told you he'd recruit meta-humans.

650
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,806
We've seen him do that. I told you

651
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:24,890
he would kill those officers.

652
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:26,258
We saw him do that too.

653
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,509
What more do you need?

654
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:30,929
[dramatic music]

655
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:34,850
Let's do it. I want to do it.

656
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:43,492
One of the cops that Zoom killed
tonight, he had a son.

657
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:45,361
Same age I was when Mom was murdered.

658
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,614
And now, another kid has to grow
up without one of their parents

659
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:52,951
because The Flash wasn't there
to stop that monster.

660
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:58,340
I left this city unprotected
by giving up my powers to Zoom.

661
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:01,460
I enabled him to rule this Earth.

662
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:02,628
I need my powers back.

663
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:07,299
Let's do it.

664
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:09,518
Let's set off the particle accelerator.

665
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,820
So how does this work?

666
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,104
It's an abbreviated version

667
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,156
of the accelerator evil Wells built,

668
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,444
except Harry is isolating
the antimatter and dark energy

669
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:34,113
to direct it to Barry
instead of the entire city.

670
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,032
Good. Last thing we need

671
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,785
is more meta-humans
running around Central City.

672
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:44,507
So... Barry just gets in,
we turn it on, and that's it?

673
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,342
Yeah.

674
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,628
No. Not exactly.

675
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,296
In addition to recreating what happened with

676
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:52,215
the particle accelerator explosion,

677
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,133
we also have to recreate
what happened to Barry.

678
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:56,019
Getting struck by lightning.

679
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,303
That's right.

680
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,688
Wait, so how are you gonna do that?

681
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,023
It's not even raining outside.

682
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,058
Well, Ramon, you have the wand.

683
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,810
The one I made for Mark Mardon?

684
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:05,812
No, the one you built
for the Harry Potter convention.

685
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:08,064
Yes, of course,
the one you built for Mardon.

686
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,283
How do you know about
the Harry Potter convention?

687
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:13,703
- Get the wand. Get on the roof.
- Why the roof?

688
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,955
Because we're gonna need a lightning rod,

689
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:19,826
and that, Ramon, is gonna be you.

690
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:31,170
All right, I'm on the roof. Wow.

691
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,673
I've never actually been up here before.

692
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,842
I think I can see my apartment from here.

693
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:37,560
Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.

694
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,178
When I give you the signal,

695
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,514
you're gonna create
a lightning storm above you.

696
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:43,349
So I'm just supposed
to stand here in the middle

697
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,351
- of a lightning storm?
- Really, Ramon.

698
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,103
Chances of being struck are slim, indeed.

699
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,988
Yeah, not when you're the one causing it.

700
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,691
All we need is one lightning
bolt to strike the satellite.

701
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,526
The satellite circuitry's
connected to the breach room.

702
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:55,695
Barry's in the breach room. Just do it.

703
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,080
Yeah. I'm doing it.

704
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,532
Mozart better watch out.

705
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:02,702
Cisco Ramon's about
to conduct something nasty.

706
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,425
You're gonna feel these
clamps, but they're necessary.

707
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,428
- [clamps locking]
- [grunts]

708
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,632
- You good?
- Yeah. You?

709
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,887
I'll be fine, Joe.

710
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,229
Barry, whatever happens,

711
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:33,232
it will never change
the way that I feel about you.

712
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:50,917
Son...

713
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,753
you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

714
00:37:56,558 --> 00:38:01,928
Being The Flash...
that's the best version of me.

715
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,983
If I don't have my speed, I'll
never be that person anymore.

716
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,520
I have to do this.

717
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,105
Okay.

718
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:17,076
You ready, Allen?

719
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,833
All right, then.

720
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,119
Here we go.

721
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,845
Think of it as hotwiring a car, right?

722
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,964
So there's a motor inside the wall.

723
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,799
So all we have to do is provide electricity

724
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,301
- to make it turn on.
- Exactly.

725
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,137
So we just do a little here...

726
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:45,688
- [electricity sizzles]
- [gasps]

727
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,640
And voila!

728
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:49,559
- [deep rumbling]
- Do you feel that?

729
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,145
Yeah, what's happening?

730
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,814
Particles are becoming unstable.

731
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,365
Ramon, get ready!

732
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,284
I'm gonna release the chemicals
into his system.

733
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,875
[metallic clanging]

734
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,910
- [injectors piercing]
- [grunts]

735
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,829
Why are you doing this?

736
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,831
The night Barry was struck by lightning,

737
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,666
he was doing fingerprint analysis.

738
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:15,551
Those chemicals got in his system then,

739
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,170
and they are going in now.

740
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,671
So you're injecting them into him?

741
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:20,006
We have to recreate everything

742
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:21,557
that happened to Barry that night.

743
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,343
I'm okay, Iris! [panting]

744
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:27,897
- Hold on, Barry.
- God!

745
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,850
- He's going hydrostatic.
- Almost there. Almost there.

746
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,985
- Wells!
- Almost there.

747
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:34,821
Ready, Ramon?

748
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:37,023
Ready!

749
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,576
- Now!
- Expecto Patronum!

750
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,246
[lightning crackling]

751
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,615
Great Scott! It's working!

752
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,254
No!

753
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,256
[whoosh]

754
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,625
[screaming]

755
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,210
Initiating collision.

756
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:11,641
Barry!

757
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,527
[electricity crackling]

758
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,050
[electricity crackles]

759
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,669
It worked!

760
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,672
Is everyone okay?

761
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,924
What happened?

762
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,520
No!

763
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:04,193
No. What did you do to my son?

764
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,695
[whoosh]

765
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,787
You thought you could give
The Flash his speed back?

766
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,876
Well done.

767
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:23,429
You killed him instead.

768
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,534
