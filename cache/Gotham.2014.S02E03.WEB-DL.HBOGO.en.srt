1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,840
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,720
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,840
Six criminally insane inmates
busted out of Arkham Asylum.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,960
I want mass panic.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,320
Hello, Jim. How do I look?

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,200
- Barbara!
- Yo, commish.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Yeah?

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Don't move.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,720
You should probably get back to work.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a new day, Jim.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,360
Jerome Valeska,
the attack on the G.C.P.D.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,640
Someone on the streets is talking.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,040
Somebody knows something.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,720
Valeska has red hair, crazy laugh

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,760
might be rolling
with a blonde number.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,680
I don't know anything. Honest.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,640
- You believe him?
- Nope.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Me neither.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,840
It's the truth.
But, hey, I can help you guys.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
You know, spread the word and stuff.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,760
Valeska killed a friend of ours.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,240
Anybody hides him,
anybody protects him,

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,280
they go down too. You got it?

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,360
- Now spread the word.
- No, no.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Sneaking out.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,040
{\an5}Just like a guy.

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
{\an5}There are loose ends that need tying.

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Need this?

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Bring back bagels.

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,720
No need for that.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
{\an5}I thought Miss Kean and I could have
a little chat. Good morning.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,960
{\an5}Jerome is waiting outside.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,480
{\an5}Try and keep him focused.

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
You be nice.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
{\an5}You two seems to be getting along.
I'm so glad.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
{\an5}She needs a friend.

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,880
{\an5}My sister is a very special person.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,520
{\an5}She seems so strong
but yet she's quite fragile.

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,360
{\an5}- Sugar?
- Sure.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,880
{\an5}You acquitted yourself very well
at the adventure at the G.C.P.D.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,880
{\an5}Jim Gordon escaped the carnage
unscathed.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
- Top marks.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,280
{\an5}Did you know my family
built this city?

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,840
{\an5}We carved the bedrock
upon which it stands.

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,320
{\an5}Yet there is not a bridge, an alley,
a ditch that carries our name.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,760
My forefathers were betrayed,
their legacy erased.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,520
And I am here to punish those
who wronged us.

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,520
And reclaim what is ours.

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
{\an5}Strawberry?

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,840
{\an5}I didn't ask.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
{\an5}So you're gonna take over Gotham
by unleashing a bunch of loonies?

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,440
- Awesome plan.
- It's only part one.

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
{\an5}So, what's the second part?

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,520
Oh, you're gonna love it.
There's a starring role for you.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,920
{\an5}You're gonna be famous and powerful,
and your finest dream will come true.

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,320
{\an5}You know my dreams, do you?

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,840
{\an5}When Jim Gordon has outlived
his usefulness,

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I'm gonna help you destroy him.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,040
Not kill him.

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,480
Destroy him.

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,640
{\an5}Body and soul.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,560
{\an5}<i>Shocking images.
Gotham is on high alert today...</i>

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,680
Look, I'm saying
I'll chuck mopes out of windows

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,520
until the cows come home
but at some point,

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,880
we gotta go see Penguin.

67
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,040
Why would he break Jerome
out of Arkham or attack the G.C.P.D.?

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,000
He wouldn't, but that weasel's
running things now.

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
- If there's chatter, he'd know it.
- I'll think about it.

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
- Jim.
- I'll think about it.

71
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Alvarez, where are you
with Jerome's circus contacts?

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,760
- Circus is upstate. I'm waiting...
- Follow up.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
His father is probably with him.
He covered for him once before.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,560
He might have some information.
Do it.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Yo, detective.

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,680
- Which escapee are you tracking?
- Helzinger. No one's seen him.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,200
He's 6'7, 275 with a mind
of a five-year-old.

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
Somebody's seen him.

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Hey!

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
What are you doing?

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,280
That stays up until we have
our killer in custody.

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
- Do you understand?
- Yes sir.

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,600
Sarah Essen and nine of your brothers
were killed in this house.

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
In our house.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,200
Their murderer stood right there
and he laughed at us.

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,560
Never forget that.

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
What?

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
- So how are you?
- I'm fine.

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Really?

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,200
- I know Essen was your friend...
- Lee, whatever you're about to say

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,080
I know it's coming from a good place,
but I can't hear it right now.

92
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,040
So the Gotham Children's Hospital
gala is tonight,

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,600
which I helped organize.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I can't.

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,200
- You can't go?
- No.

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,840
Even though a few hours away
from all of this might help.

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Lee...

98
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay.

99
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I just have to tell you something
because if I don't

100
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
and you find out,
you're gonna be pissed.

101
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
There's gonna be a magician.

102
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,960
Yeah. Right.

103
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,000
- Stop beating yourself up.
- I'm trying.

104
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,680
- I know you are.
- I should've been here. I wasn't

105
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Stop it.

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Kiss me.

107
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Kiss me.

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Better.

109
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,640
Not to interrupt your weirdly
timed make-out session

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,040
but Alvarez got in touch
with the circus manager,

111
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,000
the blind fortune teller,
Jerome's dad,

112
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,600
bailed on him, stayed in town,
got an address.

113
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,640
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Who's there?

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
I know someone's there...

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
Hi, Pops.

117
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Long time...

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
no see.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
So how are you doing?

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,000
The silent treatment, eh?

121
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
Here, I'll tell you a story.

122
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,120
You remember Kansas City, Dad?

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
The circus went through town.

124
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,160
Every spring.
Right around my birthday.

125
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
There was this guy.

126
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,840
Him and my mom used to drink
and fornicate

127
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,040
and beat the crap out of me.

128
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,920
They'd make a whole night out of it.

129
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,360
And I remember one time,

130
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
it was my ninth birthday.

131
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,000
Him and my mom
had just finished round one

132
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,200
of boozing, boning, beating up Jerome

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,040
and were deciding to take
a little break.

134
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Anyway...

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,200
I was outside the trailer
and you were there.

136
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,880
And you said:

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,960
"Why are you crying, Jerome?"

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
It's my birthday.

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,560
And my mom and the snake-eye
are beating me.

140
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,960
And then you said:

141
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,720
"This world doesn't care about you
or anyone else, Jerome.

142
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,040
Better to realize that now."

143
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
And that was it.

144
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,040
You see, there's this guy, dad.

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
He believes in me.
He thinks I'm gonna be a star.

146
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,960
And tonight, all of Gotham
will see that too.

147
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Except for you.
Because you'll be, you know, dead.

148
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
- Jerome...
- Is this the part

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,720
where you say how sorry you are?

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,240
How you should've believed in me,
how it's not too late to start again?

151
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,680
News flash, Dad. It's too late.

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,880
You don't have to do this.

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,280
No.

154
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm pretty sure I do.

155
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,160
I was a bad father
but I did love you.

156
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,520
To kill me for that?

157
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,800
That's not why I'm gonna kill you.

158
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
Plans to Arkham Asylum.

159
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
Look at these.

160
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,840
Letters between you
and your troubled son.

161
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,840
Innocent at first glance,
but Detective Gordon...

162
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,160
You remember him, right?

163
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,200
He will feel little bumps.

164
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,520
A secret message

165
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,040
written in Braille between you
and your son discussing my escape.

166
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
Finally, the knockout gas
used to disable the orderlies.

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,280
Because you see, Dad,

168
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,040
this guy I was telling you about,

169
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,040
he's the one who broke me
out of Arkham.

170
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,120
He doesn't want anyone
to know about that. Obviously. So...

171
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,280
The police will find these letters,
they'll think...

172
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,520
"The blind old fool
really loved his son.

173
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
What a wonderful father."

174
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,040
There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

175
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,440
They'll never believe it.

176
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Sure they will.

177
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Cops are dumb.

178
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
There's nothing to eat in this dump.

179
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
Finish up and let's go.

180
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Sorry you're gonna miss
my big night, Dad.

181
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,080
But, hey, you're psychic, so tell me,
do I kill?

182
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,480
You will be a curse upon Gotham.

183
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,400
Children will wake from sleep,
screaming at the thought of you.

184
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Your legacy will be death
and madness.

185
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Well...

186
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Say hi to mom for me.

187
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,800
G.C.P.D.

188
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,080
G.C.P.D.

189
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Mr. Cicero, it's Detective Gordon.

190
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
We need to speak
with you about your son.

191
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Cicero.

192
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,920
Mr. Cicero?

193
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,040
Harvey. Window.

194
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Harvey?

195
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,840
Detective Gordon. Old pal.

196
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,080
That gas sure packs a wallop, huh?

197
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,240
That's cute.

198
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,240
- I'm sensing anger.
- You killed Sarah Essen.

199
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,960
Now I'm gonna kill you.

200
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,080
Don't shoot him.

201
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,480
How about a little flesh wound?

202
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,680
No, no.

203
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
My dibs.

204
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,640
This is a waste of time.

205
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,640
We had a deal.
Didn't we, Master Bruce?

206
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,280
A part of which was you resuming
a normal lifestyle.

207
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,840
Your parents were patrons
to the Children's Hospital.

208
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,600
Therefore, it makes you a patron.

209
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Besides...

210
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
there's gonna be a magician.

211
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,920
And you like magicians, don't you?

212
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
No, I don't.

213
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,440
I hate magicians.

214
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,040
You know what I said
about being normal?

215
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Excuse me.

216
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,520
I'm Lee Thompkins.

217
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,880
I work with James Gordon.
He's mentioned you.

218
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,080
- I saw you and thought...
- Of course.

219
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,600
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

220
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,440
This is my guardian,
Alfred Pennyworth.

221
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,560
- It's an absolute pleasure.
- Thank you.

222
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,320
How is Detective Gordon doing
since the attack on the precinct?

223
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
- I was thinking I should call him.
- He'd appreciate that.

224
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,720
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Just water. Thank you.

225
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
So...

226
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,400
I hear there's gonna be
a magician.

227
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Hello, Selina.

228
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Hey.

229
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,040
I didn't expect to see you here.

230
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
Well, you wanna steal stuff,

231
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,960
it helps to go
where the rich people are.

232
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,320
You do know this is a benefit
for a children's hospital.

233
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
- So?
- So these people

234
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,280
are here for a good cause.

235
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,000
Me eating is a good cause.

236
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
Besides, didn't I steal something
for you once?

237
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,680
- Selina, that was different.
- Right.

238
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
How'd that go?

239
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
You get into that guy's safe?

240
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,080
Yes. Though things didn't turn out
quite like I planned.

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
A lot's happened since then.

242
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
Alfred says there's gonna be
a magician.

243
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
I'm working.

244
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
And I hate magicians.

245
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
See you around, Bruce.

246
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
So you wanna share your plan?

247
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,880
Remember I told you I could divine
the thing a person truly wants?

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,680
What Gotham wants is a hero.

249
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
And tonight...

250
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,320
I'm going to give them one.

251
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Shall we?

252
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
Jerome and Tabby went on ahead.

253
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Great cape.

254
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,480
Thank you for filling in
on short notice.

255
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,160
But how did you hear our magician
dropped out, Mister...

256
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Rudolpho.

257
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,240
Well, you know, magic.

258
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Oh, I won't be needing that.

259
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,000
- Come on.
- I'm sorry

260
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,120
but really there is no mystery.

261
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,000
Tabitha, have you met
Deputy Mayor Kane?

262
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
Harrison, this is my Tabitha.

263
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Nice to meet you.

264
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,920
Could you please tell your brother
that when a handsome billionaire

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,200
appears out of nowhere,
people get curious.

266
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,640
Where he'd come from?

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,160
How did he make his money?

268
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,320
Who's he dating?

269
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
My wife would kill me
if I don't get something. A tidbit.

270
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,040
He's a monster in the sack.

271
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,320
Do you have any news of Mayor James?

272
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,240
No. No, it's a real mystery.

273
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,080
We don't know where he is.

274
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,320
How intriguing.

275
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,080
Harrison, would you mind?
A little family business.

276
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,000
Of course. Miss Galavan.

277
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,800
Everything's ready.

278
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
See you at home.

279
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,760
So how do you go from being
in the Royal Marines to a butler?

280
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,520
Well, it is a bit tedious,
really, after a while.

281
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,000
You know, parachuting
into one global hot spot

282
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,160
after another warlords putting
ridiculous bounties on your head.

283
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,600
- It gets a bit boring, really.
- You have amazing stories.

284
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,200
Yeah, well, you know, one or two.

285
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,880
You know,
I don't really get nights off,

286
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,480
but if ever you'd like to

287
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,160
pop by Wayne Manor
for dinner one evening, I...

288
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,200
That's very kind of you,
Mr. Pennyworth...

289
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
No.

290
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,720
Alfred. Please, Alfred.

291
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,240
Alfred.
That's very kind of you but...

292
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,120
Now, having said that, I don't see
why I can't take a night off and I...

293
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,920
I happen to know the head chef
at Chez Parnasse.

294
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
Well, I'm afraid I...

295
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,480
Did you say Chez Parnasse?

296
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,600
I've been trying to eat there
for quite some time.

297
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,600
You have the most beautiful eyes.

298
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,920
Oh, wow. Okay, look.
Thank you but...

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,560
- Alfred, I'd like to leave.
- Yup.

300
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,400
What about Dr. Thompkins' water?

301
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,360
And of course,
you're gonna miss the magician.

302
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,280
Sorry, I must have forgotten
your water.

303
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,400
Alfred, I still want to leave.

304
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,880
- Are you not feeling well?
- No he's absolutely fine. He's fine.

305
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,480
Why don't you just hop off
to the bar, Master Bruce?

306
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,880
- Show's about to start.
- Is it time?

307
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,920
I've roped myself into emcee duties
for the night.

308
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,320
I hope you'll stay for the show.

309
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

310
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
What?

311
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Good evening.

312
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm Dr. Lee Thompkins.

313
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,480
For the past five years,
I've had the honor

314
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,280
of being part
of the Children's Hospital.

315
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,360
Thank you for your support and thank
you so much for coming out tonight.

316
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,600
Over the years, we've had magicians
come and entertain our children.

317
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,080
And so tonight, we have
one of the magicians here for you.

318
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,320
Without further ado,
please allow me to present to you,

319
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,360
The Great Rudolpho.

320
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Very nice.

321
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,040
Greetings, ladies and germs.

322
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,240
I am indeed The Great Rudolpho.

323
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,240
Please ogle my lovely assistant.

324
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,400
For my first act,
I'll require a volunteer.

325
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,840
Let me see.

326
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,760
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck,

327
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,800
Goose.

328
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
Go, Master Bruce. Be a sport.

329
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,840
Don't keep the lady waiting.

330
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Fine.

331
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,080
Hello, young man.

332
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Please.

333
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,800
Does this handsome gentleman
have a name?

334
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,440
- Bruce.
- Bruce.

335
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,960
Well, Bruce.

336
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
This won't hurt a bit.

337
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,600
Is there a doctor in the house?

338
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,560
No. Just...
Excuse me, just wait. Wait.

339
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,720
Wait one second.

340
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Go home.

341
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm fine.

342
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,720
You've been running this
since last night.

343
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,760
And you got a face-full of that gas.
Go home.

344
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
You going home?

345
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,440
I didn't think so.

346
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,080
- Maybe I will go get some sleep.
- Good idea.

347
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,360
Well, we got somewhere, right?

348
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,480
At least now we know
who broke Jerome out of Arkham.

349
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,520
Yeah, a crazy old blind man
that lived alone.

350
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,200
A clever, crazy old blind man.

351
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,280
If his father broke him out,
why'd Jerome kill him?

352
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,200
He was probably planning this maniac
shtick since you sent him away.

353
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,760
He was just kid.

354
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,000
Every evil bastard in the world
was just a kid once.

355
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah.

356
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,400
But I don't think it was his father
that broke him out.

357
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,640
Oh, cool. Back to square one.

358
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,680
All right, I will go
and get some sleep.

359
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,040
And for the record, I knew Essen
a hell of a lot longer than you.

360
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,640
She saved my ass hundreds of times.

361
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,120
You really should go home.

362
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,040
First thing tomorrow,
we'll go see Penguin.

363
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,760
You're right.

364
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,040
He's got his ears on the street.

365
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Jim.

366
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Never mind.

367
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
I'll see you tomorrow.

368
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,840
Give them a wave.

369
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,760
Some people say Bruce
has a split personality.

370
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,080
Very good, Master Bruce.

371
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,160
For my next illusion,

372
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,040
I'd like to call to the stage
esteemed deputy mayor,

373
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,560
Harrison Kane.

374
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,800
Is there something familiar to you
about those two?

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Oh, my God.

376
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,600
- Lee. I was just...
- Jim, it's Barbara. She's here.

377
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,960
And I think maybe Jerome...

378
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,360
By the way, nobody here

379
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,320
is getting out alive.

380
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Really?

381
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,160
Right, Master Bruce, time to leave.

382
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,840
Ta-da!

383
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,760
- You're not going anywhere.
- Don't shoot!

384
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,840
- Selina.
- Bruce!

385
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
You.

386
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,680
- What's going on?
- Hostage situation.

387
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,480
The magician just killed
the deputy mayor.

388
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,880
It's Jerome Valeska, the same man
that killed Commissioner Essen.

389
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,000
- Who's in charge here?
- I guess you are.

390
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,840
Lee. Thank God.
I've been trying to...

391
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,800
<i>Sorry, Jimbo,
it's just little old me.</i>

392
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,240
<i>- Jerome.</i>
- Are you outside?

393
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,920
You are, aren't you? Oh, goodie.

394
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,800
I swear to God,
if you've hurt her...

395
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
<i>Breathe, James.</i>

396
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,960
<i>I haven't touched a hair
on your girlfriend's pretty head.</i>

397
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
<i>See for yourself.</i>

398
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,520
<i>This is live television after all.</i>

399
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,080
The police are here,
they are trying to...

400
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
The feed just came back.

401
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,720
You son of a bitch.

402
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,360
<i>True, but not the point.
Hey, let's talk about what I want.</i>

403
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
<i>Excuse me.</i>

404
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,960
<i>47 million dollars, a helicopter,</i>

405
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,720
<i>obviously, the dry cleaning
I left at Mr. Chang's...</i>

406
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,040
<i>Be careful, that man is a crook.</i>

407
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,240
<i>And I don't know, a pony.</i>

408
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
<i>You got 10 minutes,
or I start killing people.</i>

409
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,120
<i>Remember, this is being broadcast
to every home in Gotham,</i>

410
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,200
<i>so, you know, don't let people die.</i>

411
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
<i>Bye.</i>

412
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,000
I think that went well.

413
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Enough.

414
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,480
<i>You need to pack up your pathetic
little sideshow and leave.</i>

415
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,120
Is that right?

416
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
It may be presumptuous to speak
for all the citizens of Gotham,

417
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,560
<i>but we are sick of you.</i>

418
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,080
You're a small vicious man
with a pathetic need for attention.

419
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Enough, man.

420
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,600
For God's sakes, enough.

421
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,360
I'm curious what your leverage
is here, Mister...

422
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,160
<i>Theo Galavan.</i>

423
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,440
<i>Well, Mr. Theo Galavan,
if you don't sit down,</i>

424
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,880
<i>I'm going to shoot you.</i>

425
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
In the face.

426
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,320
I know there is some human decency
left in you.

427
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,200
If you need to take a hostage,
take me.

428
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,720
But let these people go home
to their families.

429
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,120
To their children.

430
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,440
<i>Boring.</i>

431
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
<i>Right?</i>

432
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,160
Get your men. We're going in.

433
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,880
I used this to sneak into the party.

434
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
We're lucky those dummies
didn't know about it.

435
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
- Wait. Wait.
- We're almost outside.

436
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,520
- I have to go back.
- Are you crazy?

437
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,040
- That guy was killing people.
- Yes, and Alfred's back there.

438
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,000
- I'm not going back.
- I don't expect you to.

439
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Selina.

440
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I miss you.

441
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
I just wanted to say that.

442
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,200
You're refusing a direct order?
I could have your stripes.

443
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,560
That maniac killed the commissioner.

444
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,160
Not my men,
we're not equipped for this.

445
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Fine. I'll go it alone.

446
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,320
Hold very still.

447
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,320
I can't look.
Someone tell me how it turns out.

448
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Damn.

449
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Turn around.

450
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Well, clap.

451
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,000
So, Lee, how's Jim doing?

452
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,200
I hope he's not blaming himself

453
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,320
for this whole Essen-being-killed
thing.

454
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,160
You are one crazy bitch.

455
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,880
So rude.

456
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,680
You know, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna make a prediction.

457
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,280
Within a year,
Jim and I are gonna be back together.

458
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Wanna know why?

459
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,720
Because we're both the same.

460
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,040
We both have a dark side.

461
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,040
And one day,
we will tell our grandchildren

462
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,800
about how this man-eating harpy
almost tore us apart.

463
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,480
But in the end, love conquered all.

464
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,840
- You...
- I'm sorry. What's that?

465
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,520
Hasn't been 10 minutes.
I need to buy you a watch.

466
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,960
Well, I think it's time
for tonight's first official victim.

467
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,680
You all know and love him.
Poor rich boy.

468
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,120
Parents murdered in an alley
and my favorite volunteer.

469
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,520
Where is Bruce Wayne?

470
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,600
Did you know I'm an orphan too,
Bruce?

471
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,000
I killed my parents, though.

472
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,920
Where are you hiding?

473
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Bruce.

474
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,800
Where are you, buddy?

475
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,440
Kill his butler.

476
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,240
Come on, move it, butler.

477
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,920
All right, last chance, Bruce,

478
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,680
but it's about to get
very butler-brainy out here.

479
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Detective Gordon.

480
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,320
He's going to kill Alfred.
I have to help him.

481
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,600
Brucey!

482
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,080
No. It's you he wants.

483
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,760
Bruce, he just wants you.

484
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,160
I will not let him hurt Alfred.

485
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,880
I'm bored. Shoot the butler.

486
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Stop!

487
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,000
What the bloody hell
are you doing, Bruce?

488
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
There's a gun in my jacket.

489
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,240
Detective Gordon
is behind the curtain.

490
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,560
Let's get this started, huh?

491
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,240
You. Check behind the curtain.

492
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,280
Make sure no one's playing
silly buggers.

493
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Drop the knife!

494
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
I don't have a clean shot.

495
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,680
Stay calm, Bruce.

496
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,000
Seems like we've got
ourselves a pickle.

497
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,640
What do you say, Brucey boy?

498
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,560
Wanna boost our ratings, huh?

499
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Smile.

500
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,440
I said, enough.

501
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
I know, I know.

502
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
This is not what we rehearsed.

503
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,080
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

504
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,800
You have real talent,

505
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,240
but now you see, the plot thickens.

506
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,520
Enter, the hero.

507
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,600
You said...

508
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,920
I was gonna be...

509
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,960
Jim, stop her!

510
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
<i>a pony.</i>

511
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,280
See, someone like that
has no interest in building things.

512
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,920
He's not part of a tradition.

513
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,680
It's chaos for chaos' sake.

514
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,440
Perhaps I could use a new laugh.

515
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Huh?

516
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Wow.

517
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,280
Dude! Color me impressed.

518
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
You know, if I close my eyes,

519
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,080
I can still see you holding
Fish's umbrella.

520
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,360
"Yes, Miss Mooney."
"No, Miss Mooney."

521
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,440
"Whatever you say, Miss Mooney."

522
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,480
"That wig looks great on you,
Miss Mooney."

523
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,720
Seriously, the worm has turned.

524
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Detective Bullock.

525
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,840
I heard you rejoined the force.

526
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm so happy.

527
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,320
But aren't you missing
all of the excitement?

528
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,560
Yeah, I got the word too late.
Besides, I wanted to talk to you.

529
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,400
Of course. Always happy to help.

530
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,120
See, there's talk on the street
that Jim Gordon did a favor for you.

531
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,440
Collected a debt,
and the guy ended up dead.

532
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Rumors!

533
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Rumors.

534
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,840
Then again, where there's smoke...

535
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,720
Jim shouldn't worry about that.

536
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
He and I are good friends.

537
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,960
Well, see, that's the problem,
Oswald.

538
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,440
I think he is worried.

539
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Because something happened today,

540
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,200
and you were the obvious person
to come to

541
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,320
and I sensed Jim was a little
reluctant to come down here.

542
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,680
Like I said, he shouldn't worry.

543
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,880
Yeah, as long as you two
remain friends.

544
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,920
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

545
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,600
I got a half a mind
to take you outside

546
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
and beat you senseless
with a garbage can.

547
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,360
Maybe some other time.

548
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,760
Call yourself whatever you want, man.

549
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,880
The king of Gotham.

550
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,520
But to me, you'll always be
that little umbrella boy.

551
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,720
And if you come after Jim Gordon,
you gotta come after me.

552
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,800
And I still owe you for Fish.

553
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,160
But seriously, this place is amazing.

554
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,520
Give me another drink!

555
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,360
You were very brave.

556
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,680
You helped save the lives
of everyone in here.

557
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Your parents...

558
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
they would have been proud.

559
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
That they would have been.

560
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,280
They also would have given me
the sack

561
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,200
for letting you do something
so idiotic.

562
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,680
It was all of us. We were a team.

563
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,400
Yeah. I guess we were.

564
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
- Is he okay?
- Fine.

565
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
Though I'd still like him
to get checked out at the hospital.

566
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,080
Barbara gave him quite a knock.

567
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,680
Any word on her?

568
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,040
No, she went through a trap door
on the stage.

569
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,440
They must have always been planning
to use that as their exit.

570
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
Don't worry. We'll find her.

571
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,800
Mister Galavan, sir.

572
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,800
Alfred Pennyworth.

573
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,240
I'd just like to thank you
for saving young Master Wayne's life.

574
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,280
If there's anything I can ever do
for you, sir...

575
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,600
Or I.

576
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,920
I really just did what any citizen
of Gotham would have done.

577
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I wish that were true.

578
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Jim Gordon.

579
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Theo.

580
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,480
Well, if you ever need anything,
please call.

581
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,840
We're all in this together, right?

582
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Thank you, sir.

583
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Right. Well, I suppose I better
be getting this young man home.

584
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,800
It's been much more of an exciting
evening than originally planned.

585
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,080
I never did like magicians.

586
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Good night.

587
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,920
It was very nice meeting you,
Dr. Thompkins.

588
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,040
And you, Bruce.

589
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
A good night's sleep,
and you'd be right as roses.

590
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,560
I do hope we get to see you again
soon.

591
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Thank you.

592
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Alfred.

593
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,320
Sure you're okay?

594
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,880
I'm fine.

595
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Kiss me?

596
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
- Jim...
- Kiss me.

597
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,640
- Oh, bugger.
- Alfred.

598
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,400
- You knew, didn't you?
- I didn't know, Alfred.

599
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,320
You did. You let me
make a mug of myself.

600
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
Alfred, I had no idea.

601
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,440
- You did.
- I didn't know.

602
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,720
Well, I didn't know.

603
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,160
<i>Despite the presence
of the G.C.P.D,</i>

604
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,040
<i>it was billionaire Theo Galavan,
newly arrived in Gotham</i>

605
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,840
but already making his name

606
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,760
<i>who stood up to the escaped lunatic.</i>

607
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,640
Am I a hero?

608
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Apparently.

609
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,480
<i>I think tonight, the people of Gotham
have said enough.</i>

610
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,240
<i>The reign of tyranny is over.</i>

611
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,680
Now the real fun begins.

612
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,360
- Poor Jerome.
- Yes. Very sad.

613
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,480
Such a compelling character,
but limited, you know?

614
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,040
He was never gonna last long.

615
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,880
I don't know about that.

616
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,400
The kid had a way about him.

617
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,480
Oh, poor baby.

618
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,880
Did you get a bump?

619
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,200
<i>Jerome Valeska is dead.</i>

620
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,960
<i>His murderous escapades
left a deep impression on Gotham.</i>

621
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,320
<i>Nobody here is getting out alive.</i>

622
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
Coming through.

623
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,720
<i>You will be a curse upon Gotham.</i>

624
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,640
<i>Children will awake from sleep
screaming at the thought of you.</i>

625
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,560
<i>Your legacy will be death
and madness.</i>
