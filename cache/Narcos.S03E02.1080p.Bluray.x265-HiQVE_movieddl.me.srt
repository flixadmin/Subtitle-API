Careful. You already lost one.

20
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,527
Good.

21
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,989
- Faster, gentlemen, please.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,036
How's it coming?

23
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,704
This is fucking cool.

24
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,123
What did I tell you, motherfucker?

25
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,502
Stop fucking around.

26
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,671
I don't want to be here all night.
Understood?

27
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,881
Yes, it's all good.

28
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,632
Let's go.

29
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,303
Fucking idiot.

30
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,683
My dad had 20 years in this shit.
I only have six months.

31
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,145
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

32
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,443
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

33
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,154
How much fucking money
do you want to make?

34
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,614
A fucking lot.

35
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,007
'In its prime, the Cali cartel

36
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,427
'was moving 30 tons of coke
a month into America...

37
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,472
'...most of it
through their New York operation

38
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,183
'and an alliance with Mexican traffickers
out of Juárez

39
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,061
'that brought tons of product
across our border.

40
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,730
'That means that
in an average six-month period,

41
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,524
'they could put 180 tons
on the street.

42
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,653
'But there was nothing average
about this.

43
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,700
'These were the last six months
in the life of the Cali cartel.

44
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,704
'They were going for it, making sure
there were no loose ends.'

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,501
Mrs. Salazar?

46
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,505
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

47
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,549
- Come back later, please.
- As you wish.

48
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,029
If you want something done right...

49
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,866
...you have to do it yourself.

50
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,202
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

51
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,163
If you don't play,
you're going to watch others score.

52
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,879
My organisation has four partners,
but only one leader.

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,924
I wanted to meet with you

54
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,928
to make sure there are
no misunderstandings in the North Valley

55
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,891
regarding the restructuring
and the necessary house cleaning.

56
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:14,523
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

57
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,819
I will be honest with you.
Salazar never contributed a thing.

58
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,948
He never gave anyone work.
He made more noise than money.

59
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,743
Better said, too much noise.

60
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,792
We are moving forward with the plan,

61
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,963
and we would like to know
if our friends are in agreement.

62
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,384
Your message about the surrender
was very clear

63
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,888
and was very well received
by all of us in the North Valley.

64
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,058
Have a safe trip home.

65
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,853
Henao... thank you for your friendship.

66
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,522
Excuse me.

67
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,276
Pacho.

68
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,908
Pacho.

69
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,411
Let's take advantage of this window
to maximise our profits.

70
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,164
I'd like to double our output
through Mexico.

71
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,586
Why don't you go there?
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

72
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,297
Make one last deal.

73
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:26,095
We both know that isn't the only reason
you're sending me there.

74
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,806
Pacho.

75
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,475
Look, Pacho...

76
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,021
I think it would be best
if you left Cali for a bit,

77
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,941
while things cool off.

78
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:46,240
Remember, Pacho, we're going
to walk away from this happy and rich.

79
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,577
'Like I said,
they were going for it.

80
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,497
'While they were building up
their retirement accounts,

81
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,208
'what were we doing about it?

82
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,835
'Jack shit.'

83
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,715
I don't want
to rub your noses in that, gentlemen.

84
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,136
My concern is that your men in Cali

85
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:11,682
didn't so much as contact
my senior officer there.

86
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:17,563
We've agreed that we can't have
those kinds of unilateral operations.

87
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,192
Our laws, our rules, will be respected.

88
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,610
Of course, General.

89
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,780
We apologise for the misunderstanding.

90
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,907
Won't happen again.

91
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:34,163
Well, I'm sorry, but I will need more
than your assurances.

92
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,798
Colonel.

93
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,386
Agent Peña.

94
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,306
- How's your son?
- Oh, he's fine.

95
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,809
He got transferred to technical services.
Better fit for him.

96
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,565
Maybe I should join him.
Not a lot of police work these days.

97
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,194
Yeah.
What did you expect?

98
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,573
When you sell your soul to the devil,
you're not allowed to ask for it back.

99
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,831
The men who let loose Los Pepes
on Colombia should have been arrested.

100
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,459
Instead, they got promoted.

101
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,049
Excuse me.

102
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,104
There he is.
Javi Peña,<i>el jefe.</i>

103
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,400
Never thought I'd see the day,
but I'm sure as shit glad to see you now.

104
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,778
- Duff, it's been a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,531
- Lopez.
- Hey.

106
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,324
I still can't believe
you two were in the same class.

107
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,201
It's a miracle this place
is still standing, huh?

108
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,208
Some bullshit, huh, Javi?

109
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,339
Come on. Is this where you go
all "Bad Lieutenant" on us?

110
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,715
Like you and Murphy were never made?

111
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,427
Yeah. You guys are famous.

112
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,562
Sometimes you get them,
sometimes they get you, huh?

113
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,772
Next time, we get them.

114
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,985
There isn't gonna be a next time.
They're rotating you home.

115
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,446
The Colombians are pulling your visa.
You're outta here tonight.

116
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,118
Come on.
Who's running things here, man?

117
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,330
They are.

118
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,628
Well, thanks for getting our back, sir.

119
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,687
Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era? Take a look.

120
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,690
- Just like the Cauca River, right?
- Identical.

121
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,403
Dad, where are we
with the government?

122
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,035
They won't let us use the drug stores
as collateral for the Centenario property

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,329
until they're cleared through surrender.

124
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,581
I know, but eventually they will be.

125
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,837
And that's all you can tell me?

126
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,883
You know the rule.

127
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,510
You can't be a part of this.

128
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,430
I didn't send you to law school
so you could worry about our surrender.

129
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,474
That's already been planned.

130
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,560
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

131
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,897
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

132
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,652
You're reading it again?

133
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,155
You should read it once in a while.
Wise words.

134
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,449
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

135
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,118
You have a call
from our friend in the capital.

136
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,462
Hello?

137
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,799
'Four people,
including three children,

138
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,093
'are dead and thousands more injured

139
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,805
'in a mysterious gas leak
in the area of Yumbo in Cali.

140
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,099
'Investigators are at the scene
of the incident,

141
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,852
'but have not yet discovered
the source of the gas leak.

142
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:31,733
'State officials told residents
there will be a formal investigation.'

143
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,830
Silvio! Can I bum a smoke?

144
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,839
Isn't it dangerous?

145
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,800
No more than it ever was.

146
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,972
If it was a natural gas leak,
I want to know before lighting up.

147
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,851
Unless it's not.

148
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,688
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

149
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,898
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

150
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:18,405
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.
Off the record.

151
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,658
I don't know, Carolina.

152
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,494
Why don't you talk to him?

153
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,788
He is the district safety inspector.

154
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,875
He'll issue the report.
Why don't you ask him for a comment?

155
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,298
- Silvio!
- Excuse me.

156
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,720
Careful picking it up.
Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.

157
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,727
That's good. A little bit more.

158
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,610
If they connect us to this, our friend
doubts the government will honour our deal.

159
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,531
We'll be seen as no different from
Escobar, killing women and children.

160
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,494
Months of negotiations and money
down the drain.

161
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,205
Just like the poison
you monkeys dumped.

162
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,417
There's a reporter asking questions
in Yumbo.

163
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,295
And there's this safety inspector
in charge of the investigation.

164
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,341
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.
We have lots of reporters.

165
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,135
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

166
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,679
Dad, let me take care of it.
I said I would handle it.

167
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,849
You've demonstrated very clearly
that you can't handle it.

168
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,686
Take care of it. Discreetly.

169
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,648
Without any violence.
That's the last thing we need.

170
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,318
What? You have another bright idea?

171
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,288
That's why I didn't want our children
in the business.

172
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,292
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

173
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,756
Let go. Turn. Run.

174
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,385
You need to let out some string.
Careful with Grandma.

175
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,928
You see?

176
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,430
Mm-hmm.

177
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,683
- This is the bedroom.
- Uh-huh.

178
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,892
No, sorry, Dad.

179
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,187
- No, this is the living room.
- The living room.

180
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,273
It's big, Jorge.

181
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,609
And the pool will go here.

182
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,654
- And there, the kitchen.
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,990
And look...

184
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,286
Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

185
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,620
A jacuzzi?

186
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,168
I always thought
your brother would have...

187
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,046
...the house on the hill.

188
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,802
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

189
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,015
What was the last one?

190
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,558
Bio-diesel.

191
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,603
Bio-diesel.

192
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,064
Vegetable gas?

193
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,317
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

194
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,319
Well...

195
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,864
Very good.

196
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,326
Better late than never.

197
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,871
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

198
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,707
- Thank you.
- Jorge, the girls are calling you.

199
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,959
Yes, I'm coming.
Paola.

200
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,464
You'll be very happy
when you build the house here.

201
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,675
- It's all very nice.
- Affirmative, General.

202
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,061
You impressed him.

203
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,397
I don't care what he thinks.

204
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,401
That's why you haven't told him
who you work for?

205
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,030
It was always temporary.

206
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,573
Temporary?

207
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,617
Right.

208
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,412
You know this lot is bigger
than we need.

209
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,331
Yes, but it's the one we want.

210
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,418
It's the one you deserve.

211
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,256
Six more months.

212
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,011
Okay? I promise.

213
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,772
Go.

214
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,067
- I'll go with your parents.
- I'm sorry, honey.

215
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,567
- 'Hello?'
- It's me.

216
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,693
'Chepe!'

217
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,280
- How's everything going, brother?
- 'All right.'

218
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,867
We're about to beat
our profit record, brother.

219
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,037
Good. Keep me posted.

220
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,373
'You should be happy, Gilberto.'

221
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,834
'Chepe, do me a favour.'

222
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,088
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

223
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,634
I got a lot of stuff going on up here
at the moment.

224
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,597
I just need more ether
to reach the numbers we talked about.

225
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,099
'Why? Is everything all right?
You sound weird.'

226
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,977
I'm dealing with a problem
that is stressing me out.

227
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,229
It's our fault.

228
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,482
Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.

229
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,485
- 'Is it bad?'
- I hope not.

230
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,237
'But it could complicate our surrender.'

231
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,908
Okay. I'll be careful.

232
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,411
So good you're coming back, brother.

233
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,539
You'll leave behind the hustle
and shit of that city.

234
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,957
'It's not so bad.'

235
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,419
I love the trees in fall.

236
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,297
The park looks gorgeous.

237
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,884
'I love you, brother. Talk soon.'

238
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,010
Okay.

239
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,939
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

240
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,441
- I see. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

241
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
- María.
- Luisa.

242
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,072
What's happening?
Claudio hasn't returned?

243
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,116
No. And Diego?

244
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,078
Diego dragged his drunk ass in
at six in the morning.

245
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,746
Okay.

246
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,997
- Bye.
- Bye.

247
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,632
Spell that for me.

248
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,387
What the fuck are you doing?

249
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,140
- Prime real estate opened up.
- You vulture.

250
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,183
You know, Lopez is probably
still at the airport.

251
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,476
Yeah.

252
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,437
Got it.

253
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,233
Thanks. We'll run these down.
And Eddie, hey, congrats again.

254
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,654
- Eddie?
- Yeah, Kacerosky.

255
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,948
Cornerstone's his.
Good haul on Cali.

256
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,076
He's got addresses, numbers,
a couple of names.

257
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,538
Now you and your badass sunglasses
and hockey hair

258
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,832
want to go ring some doorbells?

259
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,294
Cali's the front line, Dan.

260
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,963
More like the express lane home.

261
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,508
I got a soon-to-be ex waiting
to serve me the second I get back.

262
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,595
Well, I didn't transfer to Colombia
to file wire reports

263
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,972
and drink stale Bud at Mr. Ribs.

264
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,852
I'm moving you to Duffy's desk
while you're gone. I feel alone up here.

265
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,604
Okay, knock yourself out.

266
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,193
- You got a minute, sir?
- Yeah.

267
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,531
Wanted to talk to you about all this intel
coming out of Miami with Cornerstone.

268
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,744
Paper trail from the warehouse
they busted threw up some flags.

269
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,372
- What's this?
- It's a shitty diagram.

270
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,500
But there's five or six companies
that show repeatedly.

271
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,711
Now, my buddy in Customs
did some digging.

272
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,131
They're all owned by Cali or are
the address of record for shell companies.

273
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,508
They're moving Swiss francs
from Liechtenstein,

274
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,386
bearer bonds from Luxembourg,
but even they leave tracks.

275
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,430
- What's your name?
- Feistl.

276
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,932
Chris Feistl.

277
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,559
Feistl, what are you asking me?

278
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,478
Send me to Cali, sir.

279
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,814
You know, I want it, sir.

280
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:37,362
I mean, these companies,
this is the cartel's financial brainstem.

281
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,448
It's overstating it a little bit,
wouldn't you say?

282
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,952
It's a start.

283
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,829
We're not sending any personnel
to Cali at the moment.

284
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,832
I don't understand.
Who's the new Cali team?

285
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,253
- For now, there isn't one.
- There... Sir?

286
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,674
We have arrest warrants for Gilberto
and Miguel Rodríguez, Pacho Herrera...

287
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,009
I'm aware who runs the Cali cartel.

288
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,512
Is there anything else, Agent Feistl?

289
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,474
No, sir. That's... I'm good.

290
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,017
Good.

291
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,855
Nice office, by the way.

292
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,236
Thanks.

293
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,293
I got your message.
What's going on?

294
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,921
We have a problem
with the fucking safety inspector.

295
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,715
He won't accept the money?

296
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,260
He has three crucifixes in his office.
Three.

297
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,763
- Reasoning with him is impossible.
- I see.

298
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,978
Tell me, what the hell was David doing
with the chlorine gas?

299
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,272
Do you really want to know?

300
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,902
About a year ago, Don Miguel and
Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

301
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,326
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

302
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,664
They don't check it at Customs
because it's a poisonous gas.

303
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,463
So that's why David spilled
the gas in Yumbo?

304
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,012
We should let him clean up
his own mess.

305
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,432
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

306
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:35,063
If the fucking inspector doesn't say
what we need him to say, we're all fucked.

307
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,106
Do you think they're going
to honour the pact?

308
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,192
Do you think there's really
going to be a surrender

309
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:43,279
between the cartel and the government
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

310
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,822
Never.

311
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,285
What do we know
about the safety inspector?

312
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:55,083
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,
his home and office addresses,

313
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,170
bank accounts, income tax, properties.

314
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,173
And the only thing we're sure about?

315
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,343
This motherfucker is clean.

316
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,851
There's no one clean in this world,
Córdova. No one.

317
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,398
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

318
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,859
Gentlemen!

319
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,239
We're going to put all our assets
on this man.

320
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:33,246
'We have to watch his wife, his kids,
even his fucking dog.'

321
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,333
We need to watch his house,
from the inside and out,

322
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,711
every single corner, 24/7.

323
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,051
I want to know what he does at work,
who he meets and where.

324
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,429
'I want to know his agenda.'

325
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,891
Whatever he does,
we're going to find out.

326
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,478
'We will be in charge of his fucking life!'

327
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,066
And, of course,
we have to tap all his phones.

328
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,570
At home, at the office,
and his cell phone.

329
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,530
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

330
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,371
Come to my house this Saturday
after soccer.

331
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,498
My dad gave me permission.

332
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,335
- 'Awesome, I'll see you there.'
- 'Cool, bye.'

333
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,464
'End of call.

334
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,389
'Recording number two. 2:16pm.'

335
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,267
Yes, the company is registered

336
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,353
under one of the Rodríguez's
fake companies.

337
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,941
'Recording number three. 4:32pm.'

338
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,696
I want to suck your dick.
Tomorrow.

339
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,698
At the same place.

340
00:24:58,748 --> 00:24:59,874
Hello?

341
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,251
'Ma'am,
I'm so sorry to bother you.'

342
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,213
It's María. Is Claudio there?

343
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,966
No. Isn't he with you?

344
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,552
No. He didn't come home last night.

345
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,471
'I'm worried.'

346
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,350
Hmm... You're fighting again.

347
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,186
'You're the reason
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.'

348
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,729
Nobody's seen him.

349
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:28,861
No one's seen him?
What did you do, María?

350
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,738
- No...
- I'm sending the boys.

351
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,617
No, that's not necessary.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

352
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,380
Mrs. Salazar,
will you be checking out today?

353
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,076
Hello, sir.

354
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,454
They're always in room 105.

355
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,206
Very good, thank you.

356
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,091
What a woman.

357
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,555
- This was well done.
- Thank you, sir.

358
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,351
The inspector has a press conference
scheduled this afternoon.

359
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,316
Someone needs to talk to him.
Finish the job.

360
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,112
Don Gilberto, he knows me.
They won't let me in.

361
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,698
Jorge...

362
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,785
Jorge... you should handle it.

363
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,288
You've done such great work.
Great work so far.

364
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,959
And no one knows who he is.

365
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,299
I appreciate that.
But I only gather information.

366
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,971
Sir, the truth is,
I'm a man of... few words.

367
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:50,062
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest
companies depend on a small outcome

368
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,772
to determine their future.

369
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:59,029
Like the success of one operation
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

370
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,533
This is the final stretch.

371
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:06,871
We all have to do our part.
Understood?

372
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,205
Yes, sir.

373
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,674
'The Cali cartel came
to New York for the cocaine market.

374
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,801
'It's the largest in the world.

375
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,347
'But they stayed for the ether.
You can't make coke without ether.

376
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:29,101
'And while export restrictions had made it
hard to come by in Colombia,

377
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,812
'it flowed freely in the States.

378
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,232
'But maybe not as freely
as the godfathers would've liked.'

379
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,570
Was there a problem
with your last order?

380
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,322
No. No problems.

381
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,700
I need to add another 300 barrels
to my next order.

382
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:49,455
300 barrels?
Mr. Crespo, that's nearly double.

383
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,665
I can't do it.

384
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,751
How come?

385
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:57,588
There's a new buyer. Their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

386
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,258
We're already stretched very thin.

387
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,428
I've been your most important client
for years.

388
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,723
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

389
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,060
- However, this other organisation...
- Isn't.

390
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,562
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,273
So who are they?

392
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,278
- They're kids.
- Hmm.

393
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,572
Dominicans.

394
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,951
Running out of some beauty parlour
in Queens.

395
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,703
I see.

396
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,957
They'll probably end up dead
or locked up.

397
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,794
You know, it's a young man's world.

398
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,131
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

399
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,638
This beauty parlour in Queens,
give me the address.

400
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,642
But...

401
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,749
Can I get one of those?

402
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,091
Quit four months ago.

403
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,511
Looks like it's going well.

404
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,981
Carolina Alvarez, "El Tiempo".

405
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:50,451
So... what conclusions
should be drawn from the fact

406
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:55,247
that the new DEA attaché has
this intimate history with Los Pepes?

407
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:59,710
And does the fact that the Los Pepes death
squad being financed by the Cali cartel

408
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,546
explain why no one seems
to be interested

409
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,674
in going after Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela
and his partners?

410
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,802
You can call the press office
if you want a comment, Miss Alvarez.

411
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,971
Carolina, please.

412
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,808
Have a nice day.

413
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,394
Have you heard much
about the Cali accident?

414
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,396
Four more people dead.

415
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,650
Children.
Dozens more sick.

416
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,906
An empty chlorine gas canister
was found nearby.

417
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,534
And there's a rumour its manufacturer
is linked to a front company

418
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,703
operated by the Cali cartel.

419
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,749
Looks like you said, it was an accident.

420
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,210
By the end of the day, it will be.

421
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,545
No matter what the truth is.

422
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,842
Thanks for the cigarette.

423
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,559
Transportation came out
to $5 million each.

424
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,105
You can see here that
the product loss was very little.

425
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,607
And the bribes?

426
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,235
Well, the payoffs...

427
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,988
...they went up this week.

428
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,450
Went up this week to six million, sir.

429
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,288
- Guillermo.
- Yes, sir?

430
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:24,503
What happens in six months
when these people stop receiving money?

431
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,344
No more friends.

432
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,764
This is everything, right?

433
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,934
This is everything
down to the last penny, sir.

434
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:43,313
And we have here coded pages
for all the politicians,

435
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,358
the senators, congressmen,
all the cops.

436
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,529
- I want an exact copy of this book.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,699
It's our insurance
if they try to fuck us afterward.

438
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,037
You think someone would dare
do something to you?

439
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:02,708
Anything can happen.
If you're a pussy, they fuck you.

440
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,215
Any news about Salazar's wife?

441
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,510
Yes, Don Miguel.

442
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,263
The bitch has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

443
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,561
You want me to handle it?

444
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,063
'I understand you have
information on the Yumbo incident.'

445
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,274
- Yes, I do.
- Good. Tell me.

446
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,803
Your wife.
At the Palace Motel at 3:45pm.

447
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,015
After she dropped the kids off
at soccer practice.

448
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,731
So?

449
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,611
At your press conference
this afternoon,

450
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:59,116
you will announce that the gas leak
was a municipal accident.

451
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,578
We have video and audio as well.

452
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,624
Look, you bought-off monkey,

453
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,794
take these pictures
and go fuck yourself.

454
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,214
At the press conference this afternoon,
I'm going to tell the truth,

455
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,758
so that the world will know
what you people do.

456
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,262
And don't worry about my wife.
I already knew.

457
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:24,141
Sometimes we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

458
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,856
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

459
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,985
However, you're not understanding me.

460
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,740
The men that I work for don't care
about your relationship with your wife.

461
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,784
They care what your children
might think,

462
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,621
what their classmates might think.

463
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:49,041
And your distinguished family.

464
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,212
Think of what they would say
at your church.

465
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,965
If you don't do what I tell you,

466
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,428
the men I work for will make sure

467
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,849
that the whole world
will have a copy of this tape.

468
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,274
Thank you.

469
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,739
Mrs. Salazar.

470
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,907
So you've never had
a relaxation treatment before?

471
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,159
I've never heard of it.

472
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,246
Relaxation treatment?

473
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,540
That sounds nice.

474
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,377
You have a funny accent.

475
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,005
- Where are you from?
- Colombia.

476
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,050
- Colombian.
- This guy is Colombian, too.

477
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,929
- Check it out. Both.
- Really?

478
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,864
And I suppose that guy at the door
is also Colombian?

479
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,743
What a small world, right?

480
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,374
All right. What do you want?

481
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,546
I want you to go through that door.

482
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,674
The one with the English writing
I don't understand.

483
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,511
Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

484
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:11,767
is getting a relaxation treatment
and would like to speak with them.

485
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,020
Go.

486
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,443
You stay.

487
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,246
Cool.

488
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,864
- Please, take a seat.
- It's better if I stand.

489
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,120
- A drink?
- No. Thank you.

490
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,624
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

491
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,255
I understand you have a question.

492
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,259
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

493
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,637
- And you think I know the truth?
- Yes.

494
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,474
And I don't think
you are afraid to tell me.

495
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:20,770
- And if I don't tell you?
- Then I was wrong. And you are a coward.

496
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,782
Your husband is dead.
He was killed by an associate of mine.

497
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,203
For a personal injury he caused.

498
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,837
This market, we made it ourselves.

499
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:13,174
It's ours.
We can't just give it up to you.

500
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,344
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

501
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,930
Say what you got to say.

502
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:24,436
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

503
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,396
and never come back.

504
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,191
Oh, yeah?
And the second? What?

505
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,776
Second...

506
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,323
There is no second.
Just the first thing.

507
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,080
- So you think this is a joke?
- Gentlemen.

508
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:49,878
Part of being an adult is accepting things
that you wish weren't true.

509
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,924
Recently, I have had to accept
some things that I don't like.

510
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,304
I advise you to do the same.

511
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:07,812
Look, you and your fucking hair
have ten seconds to get out of here.

512
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,691
- Ten.
- Nine.

513
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,944
- Nine.
- Eight.

514
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,198
You think this is funny,
motherfucker?

515
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,159
Seven.

516
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,997
- Seven.
- Six.

517
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,711
- Six.
- Five.

518
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,588
- Four.
- Four.

519
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,798
Three, two, one.

520
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,427
- Check on him.
- Got it.

521
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:37,110
"So then the crow flew up
as high as he could,

522
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:41,781
"losing sight of the dogs,
and returned to the flock.

523
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,492
"The crow went to find
his friend the cat,

524
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,163
"whom he had saved from danger,

525
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:52,751
"and lived with him
in peace and happiness."

526
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,587
And that's where we'll leave off
because it's time for bed.

527
00:45:58,715 --> 00:45:59,716
You too.

528
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:02,927
Very good.

529
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,308
- Did the girls go to sleep?
- Yes.

530
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,809
How's the book?

531
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,479
I think they understand it
better than I do.

532
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,773
'The municipal safety inspector

533
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:18,026
'closed his investigation
into the tragedy in Yumbo today.

534
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:20,779
'Hundreds were injured in a leak,

535
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:24,783
'some are still in critical condition.

'The deceased were two seven-year-old
boys and a six-year-old girl.

538

- 'Fuck. This is terrible.'

541
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:47,305
- '...there will be tears at their funerals.'
- It's terrible.

542
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,390
I can't find my binoculars.

543
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,602
- Dad, let's go, we're gonna miss the game.
- Sir.

544
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:57,482
Flaco. You're my fourth wife, buddy.

545
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,150
I love you, man.

546
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,402
Sir, they want to make
an announcement at tonight's game,

547
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:04,155
in honour of the victims
of the Yumbo tragedy.

548
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,657
Good idea.

549
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:09,828
And tell them to say we'll donate
half the ticket sales to the victims.

550
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,538
- You got it.
- Now, let's see if we win.

551
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,414
If we get to the game on time.

552
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,460
'Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll keep this brief.

'that the Yumbo chemical exposure

Er... Yeah, kind of.
