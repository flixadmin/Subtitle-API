1
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,266
You know what happens
at that height?

2
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,742
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen.

3
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:26,299
Cell by cell.

4
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,782
It just shuts down.
And the body goes with it.

5
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,585
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

6
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,621
Why don't you start at the beginning?
It's always the easiest.

7
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:21,818
Okay.

8
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,064
I'll start at the beginning.

9
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,023
I grew up on the plains
in Indiana.

10
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,904
I was a flatlander through
and through.

11
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,736
To be honest, I really
didn't have much to leave behind.

12
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:03,583
Virtually no family and
very few friends.

13
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:07,096
Anyway, it was January.

14
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,300
I'd already been in London,
a year and a half...

15
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:14,143
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

16
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,376
Then I met Jake.

17
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:24,055
What I loved the most was how
comfortable we were with each other.

18
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:27,575
I felt safe.

19
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,216
Okay, let's go.

20
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,376
I design CD-ROMs and web sites
for corporate clients.

21
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,574
- That must pay well.
- I sound fancier than it is.

22
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:54,363
Jake was an engineer.

23
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,699
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

24
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:00,862
He kept his tube tickets in a wallet
he got when he was twelve.

25
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,053
Same wallet.
Same inside pocket.

26
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:06,780
Alice?

27
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,894
I'll see you later.

28
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,619
- Hey, Alice. You going in?
- Yeah.

29
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,331
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay.

30
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:26,130
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

31
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:29,336
...to make it look like
a game on the web site.

32
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,249
We tried that with
the Appliance Kings.

33
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,733
Yeah, this isn't about
washing machines.

34
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,609
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

35
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,870
You're the new media pioneers.

36
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,568
Think of something.

37
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:50,132
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

38
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,016
Are you with us, Alice?

39
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:10,127
I'm going out to get my hair trimmed.
I'll be back after lunch.

40
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:32,695
Shoot!

41
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,730
- And you got in?
- Yeah.

42
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,773
I got in.

43
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:46,448
- What's your name?
- Alice.

44
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,168
Don't turn away.

45
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,359
Come here tomorrow.

46
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,600
I have to work.

47
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,646
Then, come back tonight.

48
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,562
I can't.

49
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,078
Whenever you want, Alice.
You decide...

50
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:38,921
...and I'll be here.

51
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,318
I couldn't believe what
had happened that day.

52
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,522
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

53
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,680
I wanted everything back
the way it was.

54
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,359
What do you want me to do?

55
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,160
Nothing. Just keep doing
what you're doing.

56
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,084
That's when I found out
his name.

57
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,323
Adam Tallis.

58
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,882
And that he climbed mountains.

59
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:21,000
He caused quite a stir here yesterday.

60
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,563
He saved six people
up there.

61
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,115
No oxygen.

62
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:20,033
- You stop me whenever you want.
- Please, don't stop.

63
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,280
Please, don't stop.

64
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:32,519
I bought your book today.

65
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:35,400
It isn't my book.

66
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,633
I'm just in it.

67
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,194
It looks good.

68
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,596
People died, Alice.

69
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,435
Something went very wrong.

70
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:10,911
There was a woman
named Françoise Colet.

71
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,318
I lost her whole group.

72
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,716
I still don't understand what happened.

73
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,554
There was no room for error.
Everything had been checked.

74
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,110
I was in love with her.

75
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:40,195
Do you know what it's like
over twenty thousand feet?

76
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,749
It's like this.

77
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,313
Without air,
the brain cells die.

78
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,470
It shuts down.

79
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,271
And then the rest
of the body follows.

80
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,349
It has been two years...

81
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,917
...and it doesn't go away.

82
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,108
I live with someone.

83
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,876
But you're here.

84
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,390
I have to go.

85
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:40,513
No.

86
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,356
Don't put them on.

87
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:08,348
- Hello?
- Hi. Where are you?

88
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,448
I'm running some errands.

89
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:14,337
Ah. Do you think you can pick up
my watch on the way home?

90
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,986
- I'm running behind schedule.
- Of course I can.

91
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:20,187
I missed you today, Alice.

92
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,273
Miss you.

93
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,675
- I love you.
- Love you.

94
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:43,547
Knock it! Knock... Nice!

95
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:47,233
And give it!

96
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,586
What are you doing?!

97
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,469
Oh God, ref.
That's a bit harsh.

98
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,186
- Jake?
- Yeah, sorry, I'm just...

99
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,709
Oh, there's nobody there!

100
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:22,273
Jake, I have to leave you.

101
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,144
- You what?
- I can't go on like this. I'm sorry.

102
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:28,352
I have to leave.

103
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,111
You have, you have to leave me?

104
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:47,865
Alice...

105
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,111
...we're together.

106
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,672
We're perfect together.

107
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:56,504
I wanna marry you.

108
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:02,905
I met somebody.

109
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,071
Who?
Who did you meet?

110
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:16,984
You don't know him.

111
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:20,984
- I'm sorry.
- When did you meet him?

112
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:24,092
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's not the point.

113
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:26,110
It's very much the point!

114
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,350
We go to the market together
every Sunday.

115
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,223
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

116
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,106
Jesus!

117
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:43,382
Where are you going?

118
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:11,549
You were looking for Adam?
He's not here at the moment.

119
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,065
It's cold out there, come in.

120
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,261
Please, come in.

121
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,708
I've been climbing in Chile.

122
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,188
Adam always takes
these pictures down.

123
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,707
Or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

124
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,221
Oh, please, sit down.

125
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,704
For me, pictures
tell me who I am.

126
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:47,540
But for Adam,
they steal his soul.

127
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,620
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

128
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,541
- No, it's quite good.
- No.

129
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,428
Oh, I'm his sister.

130
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,947
- You're his sister?
- Yep. I'm Deborah.

131
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:05,147
We climb together a lot.

132
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,023
He was having some work done
on his place, so...

133
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,899
...he stayed here while
I was gone.

134
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,464
This...

135
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:16,027
...is Mr. Know-It-AII.

136
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:22,106
It's his name.

137
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:28,182
This is Françoise, right?

138
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:31,378
That's the real reason my brother
takes the pictures down.

139
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:35,538
Because it's... it's too hard
for him to see her.

140
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,342
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

141
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:44,826
...he's afraid of remembering.

142
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,975
What he forgets is that he's not
the only one responsible.

143
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,544
I was up there too.

144
00:21:57,497 --> 00:21:59,702
She was my best friend, Alice.

145
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:11,217
Yes, I know your name.

146
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:16,017
You're very beautiful.

147
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:20,824
I can see why he'd fall
so hard for you.

148
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:30,096
The thing about my brother...

149
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,620
...is you're either with him
or you're not.

150
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,417
And once you've made the jump
and you're with him, that's it.

151
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,656
There's no discussion.

152
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,656
Can I have his address?

153
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:50,577
Yes, of course.

154
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,499
Thank you.

155
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,853
I left him.

156
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:16,981
You're hurting me.

157
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,012
Adam?

158
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,974
Morning.

159
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:12,814
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

160
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,218
Joanna Noble from
"The Guardian".

161
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:22,091
I'm interviewing Adam about
his Himalayan clean-up project.

162
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:24,651
Nice to meet you.

163
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,856
Where can I find a shirt?

164
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,016
Adam?

165
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,892
- Your phone.
- Could you get that for me?

166
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,489
No one there.

167
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:21,930
And it’s just become a playground
for the rich and inexperienced.

168
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:31,749
I have to go to work.

169
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,613
- Will you think about me today?
- Yes.

170
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,172
- What are you doing today?
- Thinking about you.

171
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,332
- Do you want to learn how to climb?
- Sure.

172
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:43,533
- Come and see me after work.
- Okay.

173
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:32,972
He's good.

174
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,054
He's not as strong as he was
last week tough.

175
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:36,812
Ah, he'll get there.

176
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:44,971
- Hi.
- It's great to see you.

177
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,308
I see you've got a harness.

178
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:51,908
- Do you want to put it on?
- I guess.

179
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:56,169
Just put your feet in there and
pull it like a pair of trousers.

180
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:02,246
That's great.

181
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:10,408
That's right, double back
and look, there we go.

182
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,644
- It suits you.
- Thank you.

183
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,185
It's okay. I'm helping her.

184
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,213
Hi. How are you?

185
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:26,084
I'm sorry.

186
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:28,332
- Let me check your harness.
- Okay.

187
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,445
Seems to be good.

188
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:39,852
She's my sister, but she drives me
mad. I swear it's chemical.

189
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:43,689
- Are you ready?
- Well, no. Maybe.

190
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:50,888
Well, finally, Alice.

191
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:54,405
The flatlander who captured
the mountain boy.

192
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:57,284
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

193
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:59,203
I liked your book.

194
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:02,403
Well, thank you.

195
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:06,243
Well, nice to meet you.

196
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:11,851
This looks hard.

197
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:14,084
It's all in the mind.

198
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:35,424
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

199
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:38,726
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

200
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:41,925
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

201
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:46,405
No, it's probably best. I'm still in
the big white cotton panties.

202
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,610
I'm sorry, I'm a little maniac.

203
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,401
Have you seen Jake?

204
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,241
Course I have, he's been
my friend for fifteen years.

205
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:00,712
How is he?

206
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,004
He's smoking like a fiend
and he's completely fucked up.

207
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,889
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

208
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,404
Sorry.

209
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,768
I think that you're destroying
both of your lives.

210
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,281
I'm sorry.

211
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,044
You had somebody
who loved you.

212
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:31,517
You loved each other and
you let him go for good sex.

213
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,408
Love isn’t just a good fuck, you know.

214
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,647
- This is more.
- More what?

215
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,847
More everything. When I'm with him,
everything is more.

216
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:43,363
Oh, God! You could write greeting
cards, you really bloody could.

217
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,244
I'm sorry.

218
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:55,041
Right.

219
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,349
Let's get out of here. I could do with
some retail therapy myself I think.

220
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,643
I can't. I'm gonna see Adam at three
o'clock and you can meet him.

221
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:10,300
I've been spending way too much
money and I saw this dress...

222
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,960
...and it was in this really
amazing store.

223
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,120
Really?

224
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,762
- Give it here. Come on.
- Oh my God, Alice!

225
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,160
It's okay, she's fine.

226
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:01,118
Call the police.

227
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,645
Adam! Stop!

228
00:32:05,317 --> 00:32:06,878
Stop!

229
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,681
When I saw him...
Oh, Jesus.

230
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:23,200
That'll never happen again.
I won't let it.

231
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,259
Are you all right?

232
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,803
Are you okay?

233
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:31,204
- I'll always be here, Alice.
- Yeah.

234
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,400
I'll protect you.
Say you believe me.

235
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:36,163
I believe you.

236
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:43,996
Marry me.

237
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,516
Marry me.

238
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:51,036
And soon.

239
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:52,955
Tomorrow.

240
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,520
The day after. As soon as possible.
Marry me.

241
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:58,080
Yes.

242
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:12,320
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

243
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,321
"Use your head, Alice. What do
you really know about him?"

244
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,917
- Hey, you ready?
- Look at this.

245
00:33:53,153 --> 00:33:55,040
Someone is trying to scare you.

246
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:58,241
There was another call this morning,
but they didn't say anything.

247
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,336
It makes me sick.

248
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:05,270
If anything else happens like this
again, make sure you tell me.

249
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:07,517
- Okay?
- Okay.

250
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:09,434
You'll be fine.

251
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:41,494
Do you, Alice, promise to love
and cherish Adam...

252
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,420
...for as long as
you both shall live?

253
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:44,794
I do.

254
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:48,316
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

255
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,876
...for as long as
you both shall live?

256
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:52,159
I do.

257
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:56,309
May the Lord bless this union and
secure it from all harm.

258
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,692
How do you know the priest?

259
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:22,718
This is my family church.

260
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,278
You have a family church?

261
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,798
I have a mother that doesn't talk
to me and a dad I've never met.

262
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,951
It doesn't matter. Our life began
when we first saw each other.

263
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,033
- I need you to see something.
- What?

264
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,851
No, no, no wait.

265
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,153
Now I want you to see this through
my eyes when I was six.

266
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,717
Look... like this.

267
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,992
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces...

268
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,432
...and we spend our lives searching
for our other half?

269
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:22,229
You're it.

270
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:31,828
Okay, here we are.

271
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:34,709
We're getting dressed here?

272
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,075
Yep. Here.

273
00:36:58,587 --> 00:37:02,069
No, no, don't do that. I need
to remember you like this.

274
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,875
Come on, before you freeze to death.

275
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:20,794
Come on.

276
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,670
Alice?

277
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,665
This is the only way station
for hikers in the whole area.

278
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:59,509
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

279
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,748
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

280
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:12,944
It was his idea of romance.

281
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:14,866
Adam.

282
00:38:18,104 --> 00:38:21,171
I thought that a honeymoon was
lying in bed with room service.

283
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:24,785
Oh, I'll give you a honeymoon
you won't forget. I promise.

284
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,992
No, no, no, sit down.
Sit down.

285
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:32,145
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

286
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:35,025
Count if you have to.

287
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:42,871
I'm gonna make you strong.

288
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:54,068
I wanted him
to be proud of me.

289
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,626
So I followed
the trail for hours.

290
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:28,466
Adam?

291
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:47,022
You made it.

292
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,702
- What's that?
- It's an anchor.

293
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:01,588
To catch a falling body.

294
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,424
Catch.

295
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,868
Do you trust me?

296
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:22,381
Don't move.

297
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,428
I gave up all control.

298
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,628
I let him decide when
I could breathe...

299
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:02,865
...and when I couldn't.

300
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:05,266
And I loved it.

301
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:56,144
I love you.

302
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,218
I love you. God, I love you!

303
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,625
We returned to London and
Joanna Noble's article came out.

304
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:16,465
I was happier than I'd ever been...

305
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:20,461
Excuse me.

306
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,062
Hello, Jake?

307
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,102
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

308
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:16,621
I must have dialed wrong.
I thought I was calling Jake.

309
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:20,139
Oh, no, no, that's fine. I just
happened to be over actually.

310
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:22,694
Jake's gonna be back soon, I think.

311
00:43:23,055 --> 00:43:25,804
Look, Alice, this is gonna
sound a bit weird...

312
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:27,821
...and I was definitely
gonna tell you but...

313
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:31,975
...Jake and I have actually
been seeing each other.

314
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,214
You and Jake?

315
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:37,734
Well, it... it just sort of happened.

316
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:41,733
Did you move in?

317
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:45,101
Yeah, I did.
Sort of.

318
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:48,141
Oh, God.

319
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,721
How cliché is this?

320
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:54,374
Old friend moves in to console
jilted boyfriend...

321
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,937
...and then these two
find themselves together.

322
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:00,933
Are you gonna be okay with this?

323
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:03,074
Yeah, I'm okay.

324
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:04,457
Alice...

325
00:44:05,132 --> 00:44:06,693
We're gonna be late. Hurry up.

326
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:08,616
Alice?

327
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:11,813
Yeah, I gotta go. We'll talk
about it later, okay?

328
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:32,937
Here we go.

329
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:37,732
Good evening.
Good evening, Adam.

330
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,973
Hey, Alice. Alice, I'm sorry.

331
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,092
Sorry.
Excuse me.

332
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,295
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

333
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,977
It's Alice Tallis.

334
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:03,492
My rhyming sister-in-law.

335
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:06,696
Are you okay?

336
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:08,832
I have a headache and
I was looking for some aspirin.

337
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:11,172
Oh, no, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

338
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:20,131
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah, it really hurts.

339
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,008
Close your eyes.

340
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:25,891
Breathe.

341
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,132
Slowly.

342
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:42,693
That's good.

343
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,171
It's a meridian that
controls the kidney...

344
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:50,047
...or the brain
or the left big toe.

345
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:52,608
I forget which.

346
00:46:54,247 --> 00:46:57,094
But it's whatever
works, right?

347
00:46:59,687 --> 00:47:00,616
Thank you.

348
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:02,849
Close your eyes.

349
00:47:04,326 --> 00:47:05,887
Close your eyes.

350
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:11,014
Okay, you can open.

351
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:13,247
Oh my God!

352
00:47:14,886 --> 00:47:17,734
I want to drink to that beautiful
lady in blue. Where is she?

353
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:27,007
I don't think she's ever climbed
past the third floor,

354
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,533
but she has conquered our Adam.

355
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:35,642
What she doesn't know is that
to get Adam she also gets us.

356
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:50,213
Most of the people using
the program are women.

357
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:52,988
And we tried to sell them a game.
But women don't like games.

358
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:55,646
Women lime stories.
Men like games.

359
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:58,213
Men like to slay the dragon
and get the princess.

360
00:47:58,564 --> 00:48:00,027
But women like
to know...

361
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,370
...how the dragon and the princess
get in there in the first place.

362
00:48:04,644 --> 00:48:06,533
A game is the wrong approach.

363
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:13,569
Sorry.

364
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,273
Alice Tallis.

365
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:20,608
This is Joanna Noble.
Do you remember me?

366
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:22,426
Oh yes, I remember you.

367
00:48:22,564 --> 00:48:25,084
I got a weird note
about the article.

368
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:30,525
I'm not gonna do anything with it.
I'm certainly not gonna follow it up.

369
00:48:31,523 --> 00:48:32,986
It's probably stupid of me...

370
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:35,643
but I somehow felt obliged
to tell you about it.

371
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:39,492
Shall I send it to you?

372
00:48:39,843 --> 00:48:41,403
Yeah, you can send it.

373
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,644
Is it private?

374
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,429
I don't want this sitting
in a public in-basket.

375
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:49,411
- I understand. You can fax it.
- Okay. I'll do that.

376
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,651
- You have the number?
- Yeah, I got it from your secretary.

377
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,187
Okay, thanks for calling.

378
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:54,844
Sorry, I had
to take that.

379
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:59,323
No problem.
Gave me a chance to think.

380
00:49:00,643 --> 00:49:03,807
We shouldn't be playing games. It's
obvious. Women don't like games.

381
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:09,883
I think this project needs
a new face.

382
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,764
Dear Joanna Noble, what you wrote
made me sick.

383
00:49:13,123 --> 00:49:15,326
Your big hero, Adam Tallis,
raped me.

384
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:17,887
Why don't you try reporting the truth?

385
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,522
It's out of paper.

386
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,610
I've decided that from now on...

387
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:31,169
...this is Alice's project.

388
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:33,081
You're the new point man.

389
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:35,646
I mean, point girl.
Woman.

390
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,886
Excellent.

391
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:45,568
- Congratulations, Alice.
- Thank you.

392
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,607
- Open or closed?
- Closed.

393
00:50:00,545 --> 00:50:02,432
Ligue para a vítima se quiser
a verdade: Michelle Stowe.

394
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,928
Fuck!

395
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:14,902
Alice Tallis' office.

396
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,828
Hello. Claudia? It's Adam.

397
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,164
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Is Alice there?

398
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,041
- No, she’s just left actually.
- Where did she go?

399
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,280
I think she went to the doctor's.

400
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,265
You thought this woman
was sending the notes.

401
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,327
Yes.

402
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,564
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian".

403
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,079
I called you before.
Are you Michelle Stowe?

404
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah, I am. Come in.

405
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,879
I was having a birthday party.

406
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,719
I asked him to dance...

407
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:15,958
...and then... I don't know...

408
00:51:18,879 --> 00:51:20,439
...we started kissing.

409
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:23,319
I was shit-faced.

410
00:51:25,598 --> 00:51:27,487
Think I even put
my hand in his shirt.

411
00:51:28,798 --> 00:51:30,358
Then we went outside.

412
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:37,877
I guess the air must have
straightened me up,

413
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:41,398
cos I remember wondering...

414
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,877
...what the hell I was doing.

415
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:58,197
Then he pulled me
into the bushes.

416
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,077
Undid my dress.

417
00:52:02,396 --> 00:52:04,284
There was a zip.

418
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,518
In the back.

419
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:14,197
I was so young.

420
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:23,156
I started to cry.

421
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:26,679
He put his hand over my mouth
and kept going.

422
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,436
He's strong.
There was nothing I could do.

423
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:36,755
I tried to fight him.

424
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:45,398
When he was done, he shook me
and said something like...

425
00:52:46,715 --> 00:52:50,839
"It's only sex, just sex."

426
00:52:52,475 --> 00:52:54,035
He got up...

427
00:52:55,036 --> 00:52:56,596
...and left the party with his sister.

428
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:06,681
So...

429
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:09,717
...you wanna write an article
about this, then?

430
00:53:10,715 --> 00:53:14,195
I mean, he's not royal or anything,
but he's close enough.

431
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,041
We could make some money
out of this, Joanna.

432
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:26,674
It doesn't work that way.

433
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:30,202
Everybody's always blabbing about
who's sticking it into who.

434
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:36,438
You have no proof. This is a question
of 'he said, she said'.

435
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,561
Jesus, Alice.
I can't believe you did this.

436
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:44,754
What if she calls my editor?
I could be fired.

437
00:53:45,754 --> 00:53:48,274
Do you think that nosy wives have
immunity from normal behavior?

438
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:52,114
I knew the minute I called that
it was a mistake. I'm sorry, Alice.

439
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:57,136
I thought you should know what I did.
It was really just innocent curiosity.

440
00:53:57,274 --> 00:54:00,755
It's never innocent.
Curiosity gets people killed.

441
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:04,599
What would you do
if it was your husband?

442
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,415
I don't have one.

443
00:54:06,553 --> 00:54:09,073
You not only have one, but one
who's wild about you.

444
00:54:12,313 --> 00:54:14,200
You're right.
I have to trust him.

445
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:43,281
People have stories.
You and I... everyone.

446
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:47,990
But couldn't tell you one
complete story about my husband.

447
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,650
Practically everything knew about
him came from a book or a newspaper.

448
00:54:54,743 --> 00:54:57,493
Or shreds of information dropped
by other people.

449
00:54:58,487 --> 00:54:59,599
I couldn't help myself...

450
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,387
I needed to know more.

451
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,081
Adele Blanchard.

452
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:40,691
It's crazy, but want to show
the world my bruises.

453
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:45,492
What we're doing
is dangerous...

454
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,604
...but still can't help
wanting more.

455
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,972
The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

456
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:00,939
We have to stop
what we're doing.

457
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:03,732
I've decided to go back
to my husband.

458
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,570
I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you any more.

459
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,412
I know you won't fall,
but I will. I'm sure of it.

460
00:56:13,364 --> 00:56:16,299
This tears me apart, but
I have to go back to Michael.

461
00:56:18,165 --> 00:56:20,139
I love you... Adele.

462
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,318
I've been thinking about you.

463
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:34,024
Me, too.

464
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,103
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

465
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:57,992
Oh, yeah?

466
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,912
Claudia said you weren't feeling well,
thought you might be at the doctor's.

467
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,624
I... had an appointment but
I never got out of my meeting.

468
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:23,821
Where was the meeting?

469
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:25,775
At the client's hotel.

470
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:34,608
- Which hotel?
- The Hilton.

471
00:58:40,272 --> 00:58:42,060
I'm sorry for being nosy.

472
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:45,901
I just like to picture what you do
during the day.

473
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,772
Where did you get this?

474
00:59:14,863 --> 00:59:16,650
Deborah gave it to me.

475
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:24,331
She has good taste.

476
00:59:32,142 --> 00:59:33,035
Adam?

477
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:36,812
I got a call about... a weird call
about the article.

478
00:59:38,862 --> 00:59:40,750
And there was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

479
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:42,765
She sent a fax.

480
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:47,461
It didn't happen.
I never raped her.

481
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:50,438
I shouldn't have...

482
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:54,188
I've known her since
we were kids.

483
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:57,061
And think she saw me
as a way out.

484
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:00,812
If you'd met her, you'd understand.

485
01:00:01,804 --> 01:00:03,692
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

486
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:09,547
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

487
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:22,987
- Hurry up. Are you ready?
- I'll just get my jacket.

488
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:24,898
Oh, hi, Alice.

489
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:31,529
I'm sorry to barge in like that,

490
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,594
but your husband refuses to understand
that sponsors need talk shows.

491
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,386
And knew he'd only
show up if drove.

492
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:45,893
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna be on a talk show?

493
01:00:46,026 --> 01:00:47,915
It’s just a stupid chat show.

494
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:53,638
Bye, Alice.

495
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,537
Shit!

496
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:48,867
- Directory Inquiries?
- Yes... Adele Blanchard.

497
01:02:49,863 --> 01:02:51,749
- Which city, please?
- It's London.

498
01:02:51,878 --> 01:02:54,628
Do you have a listing for Adele
Blanchard on Marchmont Road?

499
01:02:54,758 --> 01:02:56,449
One moment.

500
01:03:38,725 --> 01:03:40,699
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Adele Blanchard.

501
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:44,452
- I'm her mother.
- Is she home?

502
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,266
You must be one
of her American friends.

503
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,128
We tried to contact everyone.

504
01:03:56,998 --> 01:03:58,972
She's been missing
for eight months.

505
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,755
Missing?

506
01:04:01,893 --> 01:04:03,682
What did you say your name was?

507
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:06,653
Joanna.

508
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,434
She never tried to contact
her husband?

509
01:04:10,341 --> 01:04:12,281
Not even a letter to
an old boyfriend or something?

510
01:04:12,356 --> 01:04:14,332
Eight months
and not a word.

511
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:20,094
And this is from a daughter who manages
to e- mail her mother from Nepal.

512
01:04:26,757 --> 01:04:30,465
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

513
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:32,571
It helps a little if...

514
01:04:33,476 --> 01:04:35,364
If one tries to be positive.

515
01:04:44,036 --> 01:04:46,010
She was so happy that day.

516
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,801
No jitters. Nothing.

517
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:54,650
Do you know him?

518
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,432
Adam Tallis.

519
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:00,411
She climbed all over the world
with him.

520
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:04,250
My son-in-law Michael is
a trader in Milan.

521
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:09,920
At first he never stood in her way
when it came to climbing.

522
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,816
But after two years
he got fed up.

523
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,639
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

524
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:19,518
She chose the marriage.

525
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:24,221
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

526
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:29,121
...she went out...
And never came back.

527
01:05:32,898 --> 01:05:34,009
I found that in her bags.

528
01:05:35,776 --> 01:05:37,752
It's probably the last picture
taken of her.

529
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:44,381
Today had two signs
that Adele is close by.

530
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:47,458
You arrived.
And Adam called.

531
01:05:55,072 --> 01:05:58,783
He wanted to know if there was
anything new in the investigation.

532
01:06:01,697 --> 01:06:02,776
Would you like to stay for dinner?

533
01:06:02,848 --> 01:06:05,599
No, thank you. Just have
to get home. It's really late.

534
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:10,301
I'm disappointed.

535
01:06:10,529 --> 01:06:12,417
He should be here
around five.

536
01:06:16,096 --> 01:06:18,071
You and Adam
would love each other.

537
01:06:20,127 --> 01:06:22,016
Sit, sit.
I'll get it.

538
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:44,884
Oh, Joanna, do you really have
to go now? What a shame.

539
01:06:45,982 --> 01:06:47,772
I was hopping that
you would stay a little.

540
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:05,462
Adam?

541
01:10:31,639 --> 01:10:33,396
What are you doing?

542
01:10:33,464 --> 01:10:35,352
I'm making you mine.

543
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,047
Sometimes feel like
I don't know you.

544
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:46,957
Oh, you know me.

545
01:10:49,783 --> 01:10:51,759
You know everything
you need to know.

546
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:55,566
Look at me.

547
01:10:58,519 --> 01:11:00,307
Open your eyes.

548
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:03,089
Please.

549
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:05,111
Open your eyes!

550
01:11:17,591 --> 01:11:19,476
Have you been with another man?

551
01:11:21,526 --> 01:11:23,217
No.

552
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:27,060
What are you doing, then?
What's going on in there?

553
01:11:29,205 --> 01:11:31,092
Why do you keep
sneaking around?

554
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:34,924
Is the suspicion exciting?
Do you need it to get off? What is it?

555
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:39,538
I found Adele's letters.

556
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:44,336
You...

557
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:47,281
...found... her letters?

558
01:11:50,197 --> 01:11:52,085
Is that how you tell the story?

559
01:11:53,077 --> 01:11:55,891
What, they were just sitting
on the table...

560
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,931
...and you just happened
to notice them?

561
01:12:12,276 --> 01:12:15,211
Look what just happened to find.
These... and these.

562
01:12:16,115 --> 01:12:19,825
And found these. Here, read them.
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

563
01:12:39,123 --> 01:12:41,010
To sneak around
behind my back because...

564
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,904
...you need it to get rougher
and rougher. Is that it?

565
01:12:47,859 --> 01:12:49,648
I'm trying to understand you.

566
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,762
You do this
so punish you?

567
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,507
Is that where you're going?

568
01:13:05,074 --> 01:13:06,863
Please, untie me.

569
01:13:06,994 --> 01:13:08,784
If you trusted me...

570
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:12,722
...you wouldn't be in this position.

571
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,373
I just...

572
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,320
I wanted to know more
about you.

573
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:25,256
And wanted to
know your past.

574
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:27,216
And wanted to
know your stories.

575
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:32,878
I just thought if knew more,
that could love you more.

576
01:13:37,744 --> 01:13:41,454
I know the only thing that matters
is us together. Know that.

577
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:44,522
Because when you're
not around I get lost.

578
01:13:46,481 --> 01:13:49,229
It drives me crazy to
think about losing you.

579
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,869
I'm yours, Alice.

580
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:02,672
What more do you need to know?

581
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:13,321
I could break your neck.
I love you so much.

582
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,007
Do you want to stay here?

583
01:14:21,903 --> 01:14:22,918
I mean,

584
01:14:24,784 --> 01:14:26,572
do you like this?

585
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:31,559
Adam...
have to pee.

586
01:15:17,455 --> 01:15:19,341
Oh, my God. Alice?

587
01:15:26,253 --> 01:15:29,004
Alice, please don't do this!
Alice!

588
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,728
Please.

589
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:36,774
Where are you going?

590
01:15:38,636 --> 01:15:41,484
Alice, please,
what are you doing?

591
01:16:07,404 --> 01:16:08,332
Alice?

592
01:17:06,153 --> 01:17:07,942
And that's when
came to you.

593
01:17:26,154 --> 01:17:27,941
I want to be clear with you.

594
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:31,008
In my experience, charges of domestic
violence are too little too late.

595
01:17:31,817 --> 01:17:33,888
I want you to re-open
the Adele Blanchard case.

596
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,736
Well, it's not easy to re-open
a case like this.

597
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:40,607
- Britain is swimming in missing persons.
- He killed her.

598
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:44,263
Any case,
missing person or murder...

599
01:17:45,257 --> 01:17:48,290
needs evidence.
I have to ask you what you have.

600
01:17:49,256 --> 01:17:51,046
Adele's letters?

601
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:52,903
No.

602
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:54,081
Warning notes?

603
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:56,774
- No.
- You have...

604
01:17:58,729 --> 01:17:59,809
two photos.

605
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,629
Proof of nothing.

606
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,567
- He raped Michelle.
- She never reported it.

607
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:16,158
Yes?

608
01:18:19,847 --> 01:18:21,735
Start without me.
I'll be thee in a bit.

609
01:18:26,759 --> 01:18:28,646
I'd like to help you, Mrs. Tallis.

610
01:18:31,368 --> 01:18:33,441
...knew what everyone else does,
but we like it.

611
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:36,319
He can't see you.

612
01:18:37,127 --> 01:18:39,101
She's pretty shaken up.
- Is she?

613
01:18:40,008 --> 01:18:41,087
I mean, is she hurt?

614
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:44,006
Jesus, she was running into traffic.
Let's get a doctor. Is there a doctor?

615
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:45,886
She'll be fine.

616
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:50,626
I would never hurt her.

617
01:18:53,543 --> 01:18:55,298
I love her.

618
01:18:55,558 --> 01:18:57,315
You brought him in?

619
01:18:57,383 --> 01:18:59,271
He walked in looking for you.

620
01:19:00,262 --> 01:19:02,238
He brought a pair of shoes.
He was worried about your feet.

621
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:11,840
I believe your husband has
the potential for violence.

622
01:19:12,839 --> 01:19:14,725
I believe he's unpredictable.

623
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:17,506
But is he a murderer?

624
01:19:19,398 --> 01:19:20,478
I don't know.

625
01:19:22,182 --> 01:19:25,117
The truth is, what you two have been
doing together was consensual.

626
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:28,964
You said it yourself.

627
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:31,746
You liked it.

628
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,866
Can you close the blinds?

629
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:08,223
I won't be able to keep him
for more than a few hours.

630
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,115
That's as much of a window
I can give you.

631
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:16,961
You're accusing a hero and
you have absolutely no evidence.

632
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,446
Deborah?

633
01:20:31,395 --> 01:20:33,184
Alice, what's
happened to you?

634
01:20:34,274 --> 01:20:36,250
I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy. I just...

635
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:38,946
I went to the police station but
they wouldn't believe me...

636
01:20:39,171 --> 01:20:42,019
Then he came in and he brought my
shoes and he thought was nuts.

637
01:20:42,819 --> 01:20:45,667
I know he's your brother but
you were her friend, too.

638
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:49,698
You remember when you said that
you were either with him or not?

639
01:20:50,498 --> 01:20:52,538
Well, I'm not...
I'm trying to understand...

640
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,498
I just...
wanna ask...

641
01:20:59,138 --> 01:21:01,113
Was Françoise with
someone else?

642
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:08,801
Yes.

643
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,651
It wasn't an accident.
She left him...

644
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:17,530
...so he killed her.

645
01:21:26,273 --> 01:21:27,201
Maybe.

646
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:38,678
This is the anchor that we used.

647
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,337
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

648
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:44,439
...it can hold two
thousand falling pounds.

649
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:48,282
I've got a friend in Katmandu who sent
me an anchor they're making locally...

650
01:21:49,089 --> 01:21:50,201
...with the wrong material.

651
01:21:51,103 --> 01:21:53,854
This is what happened with
just seventy five pounds.

652
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,666
Maybe you're right.

653
01:21:56,735 --> 01:21:58,809
Adam could have switched the
anchors for Françoise's group.

654
01:22:04,543 --> 01:22:06,332
He killed them.

655
01:22:42,942 --> 01:22:44,917
Leave him, Alice.
I know him.

656
01:22:45,822 --> 01:22:48,572
You have to leave him
for your own good.

657
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:52,607
Deborah, it's not the only time.

658
01:22:53,503 --> 01:22:54,484
What?

659
01:22:54,559 --> 01:22:57,210
I think that he was with
a woman, Adele Blanchard.

660
01:22:57,343 --> 01:22:59,316
And think that she was gonna leave
him to go back to her husband.

661
01:23:00,126 --> 01:23:02,013
But
think that he killed her.

662
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,086
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

663
01:23:05,886 --> 01:23:06,998
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

664
01:23:09,726 --> 01:23:10,838
I read her letters.

665
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:13,717
She ended it with Adam.

666
01:23:16,445 --> 01:23:20,340
I think that... that she's there.

667
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,356
What?

668
01:23:25,245 --> 01:23:28,092
I went to the police. They won't do
anything, they need evidence.

669
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,828
I think he buried her here,
at St. Edmundís.

670
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,709
I need you to help me find her.

671
01:23:37,564 --> 01:23:39,452
Do you wanna go with me?

672
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,034
I have a confession to make.

673
01:23:56,763 --> 01:23:57,877
I sent you those notes.

674
01:23:59,643 --> 01:24:02,578
I know about my brother's violence.
I've seen it.

675
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,435
I should've done more, but...
There's no excuse...

676
01:24:11,356 --> 01:24:13,144
But he scares me.

677
01:24:17,979 --> 01:24:19,768
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

678
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:23,803
You'll be okay now.

679
01:25:58,616 --> 01:25:59,730
- Can I take that?
- Yeah, sure.

680
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:04,529
I think it's here.

681
01:26:05,528 --> 01:26:08,277
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

682
01:26:49,623 --> 01:26:51,411
Oh my God!

683
01:26:51,638 --> 01:26:52,565
Deborah.

684
01:27:24,245 --> 01:27:26,035
Deborah!

685
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:33,621
She didn't have to die.

686
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:39,540
If only she'd told me
she was going back to Michael.

687
01:27:46,165 --> 01:27:47,276
I gave her one, too.

688
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:51,114
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

689
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,809
Why did you to this?

690
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:55,727
Why did you do this?

691
01:27:59,636 --> 01:28:02,570
Who do you think gave him his first
piece of silk? He was just fifteen.

692
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:05,267
I'm talking about fucking, Alice!

693
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,291
That's right.
We fucked right here!

694
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:17,932
Adam is mine.

695
01:28:18,738 --> 01:28:19,851
He's mine!

696
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,034
Why?!

697
01:28:38,035 --> 01:28:41,831
I was never yours.
We were kids. Kids.

698
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:47,500
It's over.
It's all over.

699
01:28:50,418 --> 01:28:51,530
Alice?

700
01:28:53,782 --> 01:28:54,830
Oh, my God.

701
01:29:07,957 --> 01:29:08,939
Adam.

702
01:29:52,276 --> 01:29:54,065
She and I...

703
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:00,019
We used to come
here together.

704
01:30:06,547 --> 01:30:08,620
I just thought
you had to trust me.

705
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:56,398
And that's how it ended.

706
01:30:57,393 --> 01:31:01,288
Yet, not a day goes by without at
least one thought about the passion.

707
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:04,173
Maybe was so
blinded by it...

708
01:31:05,074 --> 01:31:07,921
that missed all the clues
to his past.

709
01:31:17,777 --> 01:31:19,534
I often wonder...

710
01:31:19,602 --> 01:31:23,310
what would have happened if
I hadn't looked up that morning.

711
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:35,888
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

712
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,312
I don't know.

713
01:32:15,215 --> 01:32:19,013
Maybe a flatlander like me
can't live at that altitude.

714
01:32:20,974 --> 01:32:23,823
Maybe it never would have been
possible to sustain what we had.

715
01:32:25,871 --> 01:32:27,561
Maybe.

716
01:32:29,519 --> 01:32:31,494
Well, that's what
I tell myself...
