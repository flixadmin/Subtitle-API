1
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,661
HIGH SEPTON:
May the Warrior grant him courage

2
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,706
and protect him in these perilous times.

3
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,916
May the Smith grant him strength

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,335
that he might bear this heavy burden.

5
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,129
And may the Crone,

6
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,923
she that knows the fate of all men,

7
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,217
show him the path he must walk

8
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,179
and guide him through the dark places
that lie ahead.

9
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,472
In the light of the Seven,

10
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,642
I now proclaim Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

11
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,269
First of His Name,

12
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,646
King of the Andals and the First Men

13
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,399
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,487
Long may he reign!

15
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,406
ALL: Long may he reign!

16
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,075
(CHEERING)

17
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,752
Special day.

18
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,636
(CROWD CHATTING)

19
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,938
Your Grace.

20
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,692
Your Grace.

21
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,885
CROWD: Your Grace.

22
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,152
Your Grace.

23
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,074
There he is.

24
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,785
Long may he reign.

25
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,328
Long may he reign.

26
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,127
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

27
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,422
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

28
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,924
No, he wasn't.

29
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,266
You still mourn for Joffrey?

30
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,268
He was my husband. My king.

31
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,436
He would have been your nightmare.

32
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,568
Your Grace, I feel...

33
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,570
You knew exactly what he was.

34
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,697
I did, too.

35
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,410
You never love anything in the world
the way you love your first child.

36
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,539
Doesn't matter what they do.

37
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,878
And what he did, it shocked me.

38
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,507
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

39
00:04:58,591 --> 00:04:59,800
No.

40
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,220
The things he did shocked me.

41
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,770
He's only a boy.

42
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,065
A good, decent boy. He always has been.

43
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,487
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

44
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,991
He could be the first man who sits on
that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

45
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,787
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

46
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,123
For all the horror that put him there.

47
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,923
He will need help

48
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,926
if he's going to rule well.

49
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,011
He has you.

50
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,346
A mother is not enough.

51
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,101
You're still interested in being queen?

52
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,561
(SCOFFS)

53
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,939
After all that's happened?

54
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,278
It sounds strange, but I am...

55
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,449
I haven't even given any thought to it,
what comes next.

56
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,452
It would be a great honour, of course.

57
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:12,122
But I will have to speak to my father about it.

58
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,126
Yes, speak to your father.

59
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,255
I'll speak to mine.

60
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:28,138
We may be faced with an alarming number
of weddings soon.

61
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,808
- (CHUCKLES)
- I won't even know what to call you.

62
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,644
Sister?

63
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,731
Or Mother?

64
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,400
(CHUCKLES)

65
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,737
JORAH: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

66
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,491
Murdered at his own wedding.

67
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,786
BARRISTAN: And we've taken
the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

68
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,913
The Second Sons took the navy.

69
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,957
Who told you to?

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,126
No one.

71
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,587
So why did you do it?

72
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,755
I heard you liked ships.

73
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,344
How many ships?

74
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,762
93, Your Grace.

75
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,306
How many men can they carry?

76
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,891
9,300, not counting sailors.

77
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,810
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

78
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,021
The Lannisters have more.

79
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,273
BARRISTAN: They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,191
They're tired, dispersed.

81
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,360
And now their king is dead.

82
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,405
8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons

83
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,825
sailing into Blackwater Bay

84
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,494
and storming the gates without warning.

85
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,125
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

86
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,503
But we're not fighting to make you
queen of King's Landing.

87
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,590
10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

88
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,342
BARRISTAN: The old houses
will flock to our queen

89
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,926
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

90
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,679
JORAH: The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

91
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,765
as they always have.

92
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,353
There's other news.

93
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,271
From Yunkai.

94
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:02,274
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,

95
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,735
the Wise Masters have
retaken control of the city.

96
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,280
They've reenslaved the freedmen
who stayed behind

97
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,741
and sworn to take revenge against you.

98
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,994
And in Astapor,

99
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,664
the council you installed to rule over the city

100
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,833
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

101
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,087
who's declared himself
"His Imperial Majesty."

102
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,091
DAENERYS: Please leave me.

103
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,306
Not you, Jorah.

104
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:51,198
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay
isn't going quite as planned.

105
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,287
You could sail for Westeros
and leave it all behind.

106
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,206
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

107
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,377
A boy many believe to be
a bastard with no right to it.

108
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,838
They've never been more vulnerable.

109
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,632
You counselled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

110
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,301
I didn't listen.

111
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,345
That all worked out well.

112
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,472
(CHUCKLES)

113
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,147
How can I rule seven kingdoms

114
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,984
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

115
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,862
Why should anyone trust me,

116
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,531
follow me?

117
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,074
You're a Targaryen,

118
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,326
the Mother of Dragons.

119
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,414
I need to be more than that.

120
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:52,009
I will not let those I have freed
slide back into chains.

121
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,678
I will not sail for Westeros.

122
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,722
What, then?

123
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,392
I will do what queens do.

124
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,064
I will rule.

125
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,310
Pull up your hood.

126
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,523
A memorable shade.

127
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,609
But how would they know?

128
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,321
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

129
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,157
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

130
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,914
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?

131
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,208
The mountains are impassable.

132
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,545
If you want to get to the Eyrie,
you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

133
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,090
It doesn't matter how large your army is,

134
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,968
if you attack this gate, you do it on this road,

135
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,928
three men abreast,

136
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,514
and get slaughtered like goats.

137
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,475
The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much,

138
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:27,354
but they had these mountains
and they knew how to use them.

139
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,231
And the fortress they built here
has never been overcome.

140
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,109
Not once in 1,000 years.

141
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,988
Know your strengths, use them wisely,

142
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,157
and one man can be worth 10,000.

143
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,747
KNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

144
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,750
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

145
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,798
Stand to.

146
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,175
KNIGHTS: Stand to!

147
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,137
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

(DOOR OPENS)

150
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,545
Uncle Petyr!

00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,848
Oh.

153
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,561
I have brought you a gift.

154
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,359
Lord Baelish.

155
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,028
- My lady.
- Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

156
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,697
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

157
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,367
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Lady Arryn.

158
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,913
- My name is...
- Oh, do take down that hood, child.

159
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,665
Don't you think I know who you are?

160
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,877
You think I'd let my intended
leave the Eyrie on urgent business

161
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,130
without knowing what that business was?

162
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,386
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.

163
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,558
My flesh and blood.

164
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,479
It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

165
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,690
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

166
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,526
- I understand.
- No one can know you're here.

167
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,736
It would put us in a very precarious position.

168
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,363
I would never say a thing.

169
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,657
The Lannisters want to destroy us.

170
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,826
They've been trying for years.

171
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,869
Now they know what it feels like.

172
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,581
Mummy said they killed your mother
and they chopped off your brother's head.

173
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,878
They did, and my father's.

174
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,715
They killed my father, too, with poison.

175
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,094
I wanted to make
the little Lannister baby man fly, (CHUCKLES)

176
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,971
But Mother said I couldn't.

177
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,806
Make him fly?

178
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,725
Through the Moon Door.

179
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,312
(GIGGLES)

180
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,732
LYSA: And on top of everything else,

181
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,151
they made you marry that filthy troll.

182
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,863
They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

183
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,823
LYSA: I don't believe that.

184
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,950
Did he force himself on you?

185
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,287
- No. We never...
- LYSA: Good.

186
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,582
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

187
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,625
But you're not to call her Sansa
in front of anyone

188
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,753
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

189
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,963
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

190
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,300
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

191
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,429
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.

192
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,642
Go. We'll speak soon.

193
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,029
What took you so long?

194
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,782
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

195
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,327
extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

196
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,581
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

197
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,418
Let's get married tonight.

198
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,254
Ought we not...

199
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,924
...inform the Lords of the Vale
about the ceremony?

200
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,801
(HUFFS) There's only one Lord of the Vale.

201
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,719
The others can all hang.

202
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,932
Lurking and simpering on the stairs
like buzzards the moment my husband died,

203
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,643
- trying to get their claws in me.
- I do think that we could wait until...

204
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,395
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

205
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,774
We had our wedding night many years ago.

206
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,025
Or don't you remember?

207
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,694
Like it was yesterday.

208
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:49,074
What wife would do for you
the things I've done?

209
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,202
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

210
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,871
When you gave me those drops

211
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,415
and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,

212
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,042
my husband's wine.

213
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,254
When you told me to write a letter to Cat

214
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,755
telling her it was the...

215
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,217
(LYSA MOANING)

216
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,728
The deed is done.

217
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,982
Faded into nothing.

218
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,317
Only speaking of it can make it real.

219
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,447
Tonight it is, then.

220
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,449
(LAUGHS)

221
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,453
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

222
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,249
Once I'm presentable,
I'll call on the Septon immediately.

223
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,009
I'm warning you.

224
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,470
I'm going to scream when
my husband makes love to me.

225
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:58,935
So loud they'll hear me
clear across the Narrow Sea.

226
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,857
(LYSA SCREAMING)

227
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,069

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

230
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,005
TYWIN: When will the wedding take place
in your mind?

231
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,965
CERSEI: As soon as decency permits.

232
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,720
After we've allowed Tommen
the appropriate time to mourn his brother

233
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,472
and Margaery to mourn her husband.

234
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,725
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

235
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,020
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,

236
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,356
no 77-course meals.

237
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,777
And your wedding to Loras?

238
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,571
Shortly after Tommen's.

239
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,823
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

240
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,619
I know you don't like them.

241
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,788
I didn't like your husband.

242
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,290
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

243
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,625
I didn't trust him.

244
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,669
We had that in common.

245
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:10,257
You don't need to make formal alliances
with people you trust.

246
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,842
Then whom can we trust?

247
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,512
Ourselves alone.

248
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,517
The Tyrells

249
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,729
are our only true rivals in terms of resources

250
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,941
and we need them on our side.

251
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,819
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

252
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,530
Robert had me funding him.

253
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,033
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

254
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,578
I suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

255
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,332
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

256
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,500
Haven't a clue.

257
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,294
Your best guess.

258
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,088
Pounds, tons, ounces?

259
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,382
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

260
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,135
Can't be.

261
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,179
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

262
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,391
Then how do we pay for anything?

263
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,603
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos
a tremendous amount of money.

264
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,147
How much?

265
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,859
A tremendous amount.

266
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:16,906
There must be someone at the Iron Bank
you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

267
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,368
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.
There is no someone.

268
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,996
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

269
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,248
And a temple is comprised of stones.

270
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,501
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

271
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,922
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

272
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,509
That's what the Iron Bank is, a temple.

273
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:40,096
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

274
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,475
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

275
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,728
You can't sway them with excuses.

276
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:50,440
If you owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

277
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,108
you pay it back.

278
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:56,029
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown
will help a great deal.

279
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,616
It's for the good of the family,
I understand that.

280
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,330
I'm not sure my brothers do.

281
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,837
I know you're building a strong case
against Tyrion.

282
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,091
And as a mother, that is your right.

283
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:20,512
But as a judge,
I cannot discuss the trial with you.

284
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,931
I respect that.

285
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,185
We don't need to discuss it.

286
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:34,067
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

287
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,569
You've started wars to protect this family.

288
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,991
Turned your back on Jaime
for refusing to contribute to its future.

289
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,537
What does Tyrion deserve

290
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,747
for lighting that future on fire?

291
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,968
ARYA: Joffrey.

292
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,970
Cersei.

293
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,264
Walder Frey.

294
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,390
Meryn Trant.

295
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,101
Tywin Lannister.

296
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,229
The Red Woman.

297
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,690
Beric Dondarrion.

298
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,277
Thoros of Myr.

299
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,695
Ilyn Payne.

300
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,572
The Mountain.

301
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,615
Would you shut up?

302
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,202
I can't sleep until I say the names.

303
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,789
The names of
every fucking person in Westeros?

304
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,500
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

305
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,668
(CHUCKLES)

306
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,130
Hate's as good a thing as any
to keep a person going.

307
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,215
Better than most.

308
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,720
We come across my brother,

309
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,639
maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

310
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,353
If he were here right now, what would you do?

311
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:04,407
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up
so I can get some sleep.

312
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:12,832
Go on, get it over with,
your list of doomed men.

313
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,212
I'm almost done.

314
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,631
Only one name left.

315
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,133
Go on.

316
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,768
The Hound.

317
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,401
SANSA: Thank you.

318
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,362
Your mother always had a sweet tooth.

319
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,988
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

320
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,158
At suppertime,
she would go straight for honey cakes,

321
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,868
candied almonds, custard.

322
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,411
Anything sweet.

323
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:54,832
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign
a septa to watch her at meals.

324
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,377
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

325
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,003
It was important that she remain desirable

326
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,631
so Father could arrange a good match for her

327
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,300
and she was starting to get fat.

328
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,970
My mother fat?

329
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,388
(BOTH CHUCKLE LIGHTLY)

330
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,268
She never let me have my pudding
until I'd finished all my proper food.

331
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,604
This is before she married your father
and moved to the North.

332
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:20,191
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

333
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,152
Marriage changes people.

334
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,322
(GASPS)

335
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,951
I didn't mean for you to stop. Enjoy them.

336
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,957
How do you like them?

337
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,001
They're delicious.

338
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,464
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

339
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,174
Oh, gods, no.

340
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,428
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way from King's Landing.

341
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,555
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

342
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,931
He's so kind.

343
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,767
He really cares for you.

344
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,769
Think where you'd be without him.

345
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,147
In their clutches, on trial for murder.

346
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,526
Yes. I'm very lucky.

347
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,111
He feels responsible for you.

348
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,905
- Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
- Why?

349
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,200
Why does he feel responsible for you?

350
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,955
Well, I'm half Tully.
He loved your family so much.

351
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,123
- Loved your mother.
- No.

352
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,750
That's what you wanted to say.

353
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,795
- He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
- Your mother never loved him.

354
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,548
Cat always went straight for
the sweetest thing.

355
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,635
The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.

356
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,971
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

357
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,182
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.

358
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,434
And your mother loved him anyway.

359
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,313
And now Petyr is risking his life to save you,

360
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,815
the daughter of a woman who didn't love him.

361
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,069
No more than those whores in his brothels.

362
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,821
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

363
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,658
He hasn't told you about
the vile things they do with their bodies,

364
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,035
they let him do with their bodies?

365
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,870
- Never.
- Are you pregnant?

366
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,541
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never...

367
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,460
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

368
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,420
What have you let Petyr do with your body?

369
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,173
- Aunt Lysa, no, I...
- Your young, pretty body.

370
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,093
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

371
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,427
You're hurting me.

372
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,764
I'll know if you lie.

373
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,350
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

374
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,227
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

375
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,187
All he says is that I'm stupid.

376
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,357
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams
who never learns,

377
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,567
and I'm a terrible liar,
so I should always tell the truth.

378
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,945
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

379
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,280
- Not once, not ever.
- (SHUSHING)

380
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,867
It's all right.

381
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,911
It will all be all right.

382
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,496
You'll be a widow soon.

383
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,915
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

384
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,042
and you'll be free to marry Robin.

385
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,336
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

386
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,629
Hmm.

00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,113
Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?

390
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,782
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

391
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,660
There wasn't much call for it
with Lord Tyrion, though.

392
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,329
He preferred litters.

393
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,915
Perhaps you should have stayed with him.

394
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,340
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

395
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,802
It could take weeks to get to the Wall,
depending on the weather.

396
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,554
PODRICK: That's a long way off.

397
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,849
Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black.

398
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,894
If I were her, that's where I'd go.

399
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,687
Feel free to stop at any point.

400
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,648
Never, my lady. I'm your squire.

401
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,151
I've made it this far in the world
without a squire.

402
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,694
I don't see why I need one now.

403
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,906
- All knights have squires, my lady.
- I'm not a knight.

404
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,992
And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.

405
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,369
I swore an oath, my lady.

406
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,413
I am releasing you from that oath.

407
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,835
That means you could leave.

408
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,086
I know.

409
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,757
What do you think will happen if you leave?

410
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,052

- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

- Yes.
- How?

430
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,609
- He was killed.
- Who by?

431
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,528
- Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn's on my...
- Meryn Trant?

The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,451
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

434
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,369
could beat three Meryn Trants.

For one of my daughters.

You have several, don't you?

I named her after my sister Elia.

- Beautiful name.
- Yes.

But I can't say it without turning sad.

And after I turn sad,

I grow angry.

Perhaps that's why she's difficult.

I know he did.
