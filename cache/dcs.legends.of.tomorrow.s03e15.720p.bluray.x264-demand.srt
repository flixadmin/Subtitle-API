1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,460
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash
<i>and</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,832
I love you, Jesse.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,923
I love you too.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,234
<i>Jesse's breaking up with me.</i>

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,545
She told me
she needs to focus on herself.

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,197
<i>You and Miss Lance.</i>

7
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,574
<i>I think there's something
real there. She's special.</i>

8
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,214
I'm guessing that's bad.

9
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,536
<i>Those are tears
on the fabric of time itself.</i>

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,099
The first Totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil.

11
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,725
And time is his cage.

12
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,606
<i>The more the timeline
is corrupted,</i>

13
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,684
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,658
Maybe these Totems
are the keys to stopping him.

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,406
The good news is we already
have the Air, Earth and Fire Totems.

16
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,492
<i>"Death Totem."</i>

17
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,095
<i>"The most volatile of all
the Totems."</i>

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,327
Whoever wields it
has dominion over the dead.

19
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,247
<i>We need to make sure
we keep that Death Totem on lock.</i>

20
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,869
I'm sorry I forgot about you.

21
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,167
It's okay.

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,419
Hey, I'm right here.

23
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,504
It's okay.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,423
Here I thought you
gave nightmares, not had them.

25
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,588
First time for everything.

26
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,552
Wanna talk about it?

27
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,631
No, I'm fine.

28
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,933
No.

29
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,262
So, who's John?

30
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,772
What?

31
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,144
It's just, you called his
name out in your sleep,

32
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,036
and I was trying very hard
not to be jealous.

33
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,444
Uh-oh.

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,530
No, it's...

35
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,194
It's probably John Constantine.

36
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,823
He's a demonologist
that helped me with Mallus.

37
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,323
And he kinda looks like Sting.

38
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,950
So, he's just a friend?

39
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,909
Yeah, you could say that.

40
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,328
Yeah, we did

41
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,421
- sleep together, but...
- Ah.

42
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,126
It was the '60s,
and everybody was getting wild.

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,677
- The '60s, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

44
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,598
I thought I waited
a long time between partners.

45
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,221
The year was 1969,

46
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,728
but it was like, three weeks ago.

47
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,227
Three weeks?

48
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,606
Yeah, well, three weeks
before I had a girlfriend.

49
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,938
Did you just call me your girlfriend?

50
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,575
Maybe.

51
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,030
I mean, why not?

52
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,446
John's fun.

53
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,059
Oh, please don't talk about John.

54
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,791
Well, he's no Ava Sharpe.

55
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,064
<i>Pardon the interruption,
Captain,</i>

56
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,649
<i>but you're needed on the bridge.</i>

57
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,834
Come on.

58
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:56,926
Hey.

59
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,177
Good morning, Captain.

60
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,468
Where's Mrs. Captain?

61
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,174
Ava had to work.

62
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,972
With all the new anachronisms,
the time tears are getting worse.

63
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,392
Hey, I thought we were
calling them time cracks.

64
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,645
Hey, uh, what happens if
we don't repair history?

65
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,847
Working theory,

66
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,898
time is frappÃ©d
together like a smoothie,

67
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,022
so, instead of just dealing
with Julius Caesar in Aruba

68
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,479
we have to fight off Genghis Khan,

69
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,612
a herd of woolly mammoths,

70
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,565
and a swarm of locusts
from the Old Testament.

71
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,867
And Mallus is freed from time jail,

72
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,570
so he could rule over
this giant mess.

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,078
So, worse than Flashpoint?

74
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,895
Is that what we're calling
the thing that Barry did?

75
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,160
I think it's something similar.

76
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,916
All right, enough hand wringing.

77
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,544
Mallus and his team are
doubling down on anachronisms,

78
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,633
so, so are we.

79
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,922
From now on, we're gonna
do our repairs in teams.

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,930
Where is Rory?

81
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,806
Wally, wait.

82
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,510
Nice robe.

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,891
Who dressed me?

84
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,980
Uh... Me. FYI, Heatwave sleeps
in the nude.

85
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,977
Yeah, tried to warn you, kid.

86
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,943
As riveting as this conversation is,
Gideon, please.

87
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,901
So, Z and Amaya,
you take the Time Courier

88
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,078
to Billings, Montana in 1997.

89
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,580
The <i>Mona Lisa</i> is about to
make a very special appearance

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,747
on the <i>Antiques Roadshow.</i>

91
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,995
Nate and I will pick up
Einstein in the Ice Age,

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,877
and you two, are on the Jumpship

93
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,585
to find and return a dog named Laika
to the Soviet space program.

94
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,263
No.

95
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,849
Excuse me?

96
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,058
I'm not chasing a Russki pooch.

97
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,679
Uh, I could actually use Mick's
help reforming the Fire Totem.

98
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,607
Fine.

99
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,978
Nate, you go with Wally,

100
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,435
and I'll go get Einstein alone.

101
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:40,979
Mmm.

102
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,072
Are you okay?

103
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,900
Yeah, do you... I'm fine.

104
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,613
All right, that's it. No snazzy
send-off. Momma's got a headache.

105
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,077
Even when you don't try,
you still got it.

106
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,877
My hypothesis is that
the Fire Totem can only be reignited

107
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,587
if it reaches Big Bang conditions.

108
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,140
Which is where this handy-dandy
cold fusion reactor comes in.

109
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,219
We will be two of the only people
to have ever experienced

110
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,637
cold fusion in action.

111
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,815
Can you even imagine?

112
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,358
I'm bored.

113
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,279
Where are you going?

114
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,614
What if I need your help?

115
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,945
I just put a mystical Totem
into a nuclear reactor.

116
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,285
- Don't you wanna see what happens?
- No.

117
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,126
Do me a favor, Gideon,
get John Constantine on the line.

118
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,504
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Constantine
does not currently own a phone.</i>

119
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,303
Because God forbid
he'd do anything normal.

120
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,005
<i>It calls to you, doesn't it...</i>

121
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,009
<i>The Death Totem chose you.</i>

122
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,598
- You're...
- You. After you died.

123
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,601
This is the Death Totem.

124
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,770
It yearns for a new bearer.

125
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,442
Imagine,

126
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,816
all you could do with
dominion over the dead.

127
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,362
You could banish
that little girl from your dreams.

128
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,073
Bring back your sister.

129
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,453
I'm no Totem bearer.

130
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,288
You've conquered your demons.

131
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,793
You're strong enough to wield it.

132
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,671
<i>Pick up the Totem, Sara.</i>

133
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,048
<i>It's the only way to defeat Mallus.</i>

134
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,131
<i>The six Totems
need six Totem bearers.</i>

135
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,516
<i>Who else on your team
was born to wield Death?</i>

136
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,413
Wait, so,
the <i>Mona Lisa</i> was a self-portrait?

137
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,831
Da Vinci in drag.

138
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,206
Wow.

139
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,627
Mick?

140
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,791
What, what, what, what?

141
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,545
- Well, at least he's wearing clothes.
- True.

142
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,043
Hey, Ray, we're back.

143
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,672
You read me, schmience guy?

144
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,089
Gideon, where's Ray?

145
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,327
<i>I'm sorry, Miss Tomaz,</i>

146
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,059
<i>but all of my internal monitoring
systems have been disabled.</i>

147
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,353
<i>I've been rendered blind, I'm afraid.</i>

148
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,524
Ray!

149
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,436
I can't tell if he's breathing.

150
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,316
I have a pulse.

151
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,742
It's smoking.

152
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,071
This just happened.

153
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,617
Whoever did this
is still on the ship.

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,790
Gideon, run a scan.

155
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,796
<i>Dr. Palmer has
suffered a collapsed lung,</i>

156
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,398
<i>three broken ribs,
a shattered femur...</i>

157
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,170
Okay, okay, we get it. Just fix him,

158
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,964
and find out who disabled your cams.

159
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,836
I take one lousy nap...

160
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,887
<i>If I was capable
of rage, I would feel it.</i>

161
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,803
<i>The saboteur must be punished.</i>

162
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,306
You stay with Ray.
Mick and I will search the ship.

163
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,642
Wait, guys, you don't
know what's out there.

164
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,137
On second thought, you got this.

165
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,028
Gideon, we need to reach Sara.

166
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,489
Is there any way to
message her in the Ice Age?

167
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,291
<i>There's no need.
The Jumpship never left its hangar.</i>

168
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,748
Holy mother of God.

169
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,501
Sara, what happened?

170
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,003
Sara Lance is lost to you.

171
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,353
I am Death.

172
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,837
Sara.

173
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,042
I know you're still in there.

174
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,597
Amaya?

175
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,057
<i>She can't hear you.</i>

176
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,146
Mallus.

177
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,349
<i>You've always secretly
feared you're a monster.</i>

178
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,985
<i>And now, a monster
is what you've become.</i>

179
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,437
<i>Sara, please, no!</i>

180
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,675
Amaya, what happened?

181
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,669
It's Sara.
She's wearing the death thingy.

182
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,972
The Death Totem? Why would
Elvis's totem make Sara evil?

183
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,515
The totems work by amplifying

184
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,843
the true nature
of whoever wears them.

185
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,724
But Constantine warned Ray

186
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,806
that Mallus' power was inside Sara.

187
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,606
Maybe he's taken her over.

188
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,151
So, if Elvis could
raise the dead with the Totem,

189
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,105
what could a former assassin
connected to a demon be capable of?

190
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,942
<i>Captain Lance,
I strongly recommend</i>

191
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,368
<i>you reconsider this command.</i>

192
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,242
Hey. Um...

193
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,621
So I was thinking about the whole
GF conversation we had earlier,

194
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,715
and I...

195
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,588
Whoa. You look...

196
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,506
Good, great.

197
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,094
Just sometimes these holo-feeds
can really wash out your skin.

198
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,192
Did you do something different
with your hair?

199
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,977
What the hell is going on here?

200
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,106
Mr. Rory, would you please move?

201
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,400
Sara's bonded with the Death Totem.

202
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,402
- What?
- We think Mallus

203
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,699
tricked her into wearing it.

204
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,526
Look, the woman
on that bridge was not Sara.

205
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,661
All I care about right now

206
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,028
- is getting her back.
- We need to find John Constantine.

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,831
The demonologist?

208
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,626
Yeah, I know he wears his tie
a little too loose for my liking,

209
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,954
but he has saved
Sara from Mallus before.

210
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,960
Gideon, can you up
my pain medication?

211
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,382
My leg is killing me.

212
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,861
- Gideon?
<i>- The Nostromo sequence</i>

213
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,006
<i>has been activated and will
commence in T minus three seconds.</i>

214
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,057
<i>T minus two seconds.</i>

215
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,349
Gideon, un-commence.

216
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,198
<i>That option has expired.</i>

217
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,519
Door's locked.

218
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,895
I'll kill that witch.

219
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,860
- If you kill her then Sara dies, too.
- Better her than me.

220
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,708
- How can you say that?
- By moving my lips.

221
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,051
- Hey, guys...
- Where were you when Ray

222
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,177
was getting the crap beat out of him?

223
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,443
- Day-drinking again?
- Better than kidnapping a dog.

224
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,028
- We rescued the dog, man!
- I'm claustrophobic!

225
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,951
Everyone, just stop yelling.

226
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,294
Guys, everyone, just relax.

227
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,917
I'm gonna knock her out, tie her up,

228
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,088
and no one gets hurt.

229
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,886
Oh, we're screwed.

230
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,614
Wally.

231
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,116
Hey.

232
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,658
Never thought we'd
see each other again.

233
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
You look good.

234
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,737
This isn't you. You're not real.

235
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,201
Are you sure about that?

236
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,293
Yeah.

237
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,292
I've seen apparitions before.

238
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,334
I remember
the first night I said I love you.

239
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,363
We were in the back seat of your car.

240
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,593
You acted like you couldn't hear me.

241
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,305
Yeah, 'cause I couldn't understand
why someone like you would love me.

242
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:29,975
Why not?

243
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,551
Come on, Jesse.

244
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,180
Wally, you're a good-looking guy.

245
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,604
Great smile.

246
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,813
I know you've had
girlfriends before me.

247
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,060
None of them were you.

248
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,277
You're everything.

249
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,152
You're like an actual genius,

250
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,776
and the family you come from,
and the...

251
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,654
You're just a speed junkie
with a drug addict for a mom?

252
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,618
I wonder why it didn't
work out between us.

253
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,371
Um...

254
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,954
So, you're just here to hurt me.

255
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,296
Well, you can't.

256
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,254
I'm actually glad
that you broke my heart.

257
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,170
You know, I traveled because of you.

258
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,096
I found some kind of inner peace,

259
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,969
I made new friends.

260
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,846
One day I'm gonna
fall in love with someone.

261
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,845
And that person isn't gonna be you.

262
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,858
Well said.

263
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,352
Unfortunately,

264
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,987
I can hurt you.

265
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,294
<i>John Constantine, age 36.</i>

266
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,718
One older sister,
both parents deceased. Huh.

267
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,679
He's part of the Newcastle Crew.
He accidentally summoned a demon

268
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,473
that dragged a child,
Astra Logue into Hell.

269
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,137
He sounds like a real weirdo.

270
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,228
He's a warlock.

271
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,846
You know I happen
to be a level nine warlock.

272
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,556
<i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>
doesn't count, Gary.

273
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,569
Stay back.

274
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,241
Don't look, Gary.

275
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,196
I'm gonna catch you. Come on.

276
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,414
Okay.

277
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,116
Hey, do us a favor,
give us a hand, will you?

278
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,667
Grab it, grab it, grab it.

279
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,632
Ah. Ah. There you are.

280
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,334
All right. Oh, nice one, lad.

281
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,302
Hey, you're a fast
little bastard, aren't you?

282
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,255
Are you guys from the housing co-op?

283
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,012
Because it's perfectly legal
to win an apartment in a duel.

284
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,435
- We're here about Sara Lance.
- Ah.

285
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,057
Right, well...

286
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,776
Mrs. Veras, we will have to
continue the ritual tomorrow.

287
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,069
But not to worry, love.

288
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,272
We'll have your son
married in no time, all right?

289
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,981
<i>Gracias, Senor</i> Constantine.

290
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,075
<i>Oui.</i>

291
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,947
It's a gig economy.

292
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,162
Have to take the work
when I can find it, you know.

293
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,376
Now, let me guess.

294
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,083
Sara has succumbed
to the demon Mallus.

295
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,965
I sensed his power growing,
but not to worry,

296
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,301
I gave Ray very specific instructions

297
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,878
to kill her if that ever happened.

298
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,347
- What?
- Eggs and omelets, love.

299
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,049
And extreme measures.

300
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,681
Well, I'm here to save Sara.

301
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,136
She's bonded with the Death Totem.

302
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,145
- Bollocks.
- What does that mean?

303
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,047
- Oh, it's a British expletive used...
- I know what "bollocks" means, Gary,

304
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,071
what did you mean by it?

305
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,944
Well, about this
so-called Death Totem,

306
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,160
recently, whilst heavily
influenced by ayahuasca,

307
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,488
I came to learn why
the sixth lost tribe of Zambesi

308
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,665
was stricken from the oral record.

309
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,659
This lost tribe,

310
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,166
which had been entrusted to
watch over the domain of the dead,

311
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,507
sided with Mallus
while the other five tribes rallied

312
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,879
to imprison him.

313
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,381
Perhaps explaining why
the Death Totem is inextricably

314
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,054
linked with our demon friend.

315
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,385
Wally, can you hear me?

316
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,428
Wally, talk to me, man.

317
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,977
Kid's dead.

318
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,562
I gotta go after him.

319
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,354
Just be careful out there.

320
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,310
If I'm not back in five minutes...

321
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,692
Just wait longer?

322
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,858
No, come rescue me.

323
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,106
Okay, guys, this is ridiculous.

324
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,193
We can't just wait here.
Sara's gonna take us out one by one.

325
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,197
But I can decouple
the Jumpship from Gideon's mainframe.

326
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,824
We are getting off of this ship.

327
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,331
Sara's soul is likely
trapped in Mallus' realm.

328
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,755
Usually,

329
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,542
I'd have to cast the demon
into myself to rescue her, but

330
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,548
luckily, I already have
a link to Sara's soul.

331
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,384
So, I'll enlist Aken,

332
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,057
the Egyptian ferryman of the dead.

333
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,681
What do you mean you
already have a link to Sara's soul?

334
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,305
Well, let's just say
our souls have been one.

335
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,311
Leaves a metaphysical
connection, love.

336
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,942
- Don't call me "love."
- Oh. Pardon me, pet.

337
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,273
Sara and I also share a very,
very strong metaphysical connection.

338
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,527
- So...
- Wait.

339
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,868
I can't believe...
You both slept with Captain Lance?

340
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,783
- Gary...
- Did we now?

341
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,329
Well then, we both have
excellent taste in damaged women.

342
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,705
- Sara's not damaged.
- Yeah.

343
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,206
And I'm the bloody pope.

344
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,788
You know what,
let's get on with this.

345
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

346
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,879
You're going after Sara,
I'm coming with you.

347
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,259
To the realm of Mallus?

348
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,837
Start chanting.

349
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,056
Very well, give me your hand.

350
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,976
Are you serious?

351
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,431
- Deadly.
- Ugh.

352
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,077
<i>John Constantine.</i>

353
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,712
<i>You dare enter my realm?</i>

354
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,101
Is there any sign
of the captain here?

355
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,855
No, but I found Wally.

356
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,158
- Is he...
<i>- Alive.</i>

357
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,454
Sara must have shot him
with the anti-Speedster gun.

358
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,994
We're gonna need a bigger MedBay.

359
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,209
Don't worry, guys, I'm almost there.

360
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,957
Just get ready to
meet me in the Jumpship.

361
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,048
Sorry, Gideon, this is gonna
hurt you more than me.

362
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,225
Zari.

363
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,275
Behrad?

364
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,772
I can't sleep.

365
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,570
Will you read me a story, Zari?

366
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,571
No, I know this is just
the Death Totem messing with my mind.

367
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,661
You're not real.

368
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,287
Of course, I am.

369
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,447
Please, you know the one.

370
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,623
<i>The Prince of Timbuktu.</i>

371
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,544
Please stop.

372
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,330
"The Prince of Timbuktu
took a swim in the ocean blue.

373
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,630
"He met a tortoise,
who told him his purpose

374
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,719
"was to be the King of Timbuktu."

375
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:26,975
Behrad.

376
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,724
Goodbye.

377
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,892
Sara, stop, please.

378
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,523
<i>Sara.</i>

379
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,857
<i>You have to fight Mallus.</i>

380
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,776
Stop!

381
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,778
You're hurting me...

382
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,578
Impressive.

383
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,204
But no one can fight Mallus forever.

384
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,470
What have you got
on your socks there, squire?

385
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,426
Oh. It's Beebo.

386
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,891
My Aunt Stacy bought
them for me. You like Beebo?

387
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,459
Once when I was on a massive bender,

388
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,683
I put a spell on that
toy to make him talk.

389
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,557
He told me things
that'd make your toes curl.

390
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,105
Oh. Like what?

391
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,403
Okay, Sara's soul is trapped
in the realm of a demon,

392
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,321
and her ship and entire crew
are lost in time.

393
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,773
Who cares about Beebo?

394
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,445
Well, his Aunt Stacy does.

395
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,157
You're wound tight as
a bloody drum, aren't you, love?

396
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,704
Pardon me. Pet.

397
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,156
You know, you need to loosen up.

398
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,912
And then the work just flows.

399
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,413
Oh, is that work you're doing?
Sorry, I couldn't tell.

400
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,541
There isn't exactly
a paint-by-numbers spell

401
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,874
for locating a spaceship
floating through a temporal stream.

402
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,338
My business card says
"Master of the dark arts,"

403
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,841
- not Dr. Ruddy What's-his-face.
- Who?

404
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,221
- Who?
- Exactly.

405
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,973
What? Okay, you know what,

406
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,829
Gary, let's just get out of here
because Mr. Constantine

407
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,142
- has wasted enough of our time.
- That's where you are, you beauty.

408
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,481
Okay, so you have a foot,
but you don't have a phone.

409
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,433
I just...
I really don't understand how

410
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,671
- Sara could...
- What, shag me

411
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,311
- in a mental institution?
- Oh, my God.

412
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,882
Oh, you have nothing
to be jealous about.

413
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,317
I am not jealous! I'm just...

414
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,236
Ugh.

415
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,817
Okay, maybe I'm a little bit jealous.

416
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,951
We were just trying
to find some calm in the storm.

417
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't understand.

418
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,519
Who sleeps with a warlock,
and then turns around

419
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,034
and starts calling me her girlfriend?

420
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,785
She called you her girlfriend?

421
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,128
Yeah, and I really wanna believe her.

422
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,215
But?

423
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,194
I don't think that
Sara's really a one-woman woman.

424
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,338
Well, if the price of admission
is looking like a fool

425
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,753
or getting your heart broken,
then,

426
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,847
well, I'd say Miss Lance
is pretty well worth it.

427
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,226
Huh.

428
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,223
Okay, boys,

429
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,725
there has to be
a way to find the <i>Waverider.</i>

430
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,566
I have an idea.

431
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,603
We're all ears, mate.

432
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,819
The Legends remind me
of my D&D group.

433
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,855
- Don't laugh.
- Too late.

434
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,275
And last year, we were on a campaign.

435
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,826
The trials of Egan.

436
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,621
Our party was made up of a monk,

437
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,074
<i>a druid,</i>

438
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,244
<i>a half-orc rogue,</i>

439
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:44,714
<i>a bard,</i>

440
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:50,469
<i>and like a cheerful gnome, who was
also a very accomplished wizard.</i>

441
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,636
With two men down, we were
trapped in the tomb of ruination.

442
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,934
And we were being
hunted by Xanathar the unburnt.

443
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,395
We were exhausted,

444
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,179
<i>running low on food.</i>

445
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,774
Hungry.

446
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,355
Zari, come in.

447
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,027
<i>Zari. Do you copy?</i>

448
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,873
<i>Our sorceress was missing,
feared dead.</i>

449
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,816
Gary, how does any of this
help us find Sara and the Legends?

450
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,910
Hey, hey, hey.

451
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,076
Let the man finish
his story, all right?

452
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:17,914
As you were, mate.

453
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,454
Xanathar the unburnt
wielded the Death Sword.

454
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,334
One of the six Swords of Sorrow.

455
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,786
To defeat him, we needed...

456
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,371
Another of the six swords.

457
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,750
The best way to defeat
a Totem bearer is with another Totem.

458
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,719
- Yeah, that worked out well for Z.
- Seeing as I am out of commission,

459
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,172
one of you two needs
to wield the Earth Totem.

460
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,632
Which turned Blackbeard's
lady friend into a zombie.

461
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,968
It merely manifested
the pirate queen's true nature.

462
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,437
A righteous warrior has nothing
to fear from wielding a Totem.

463
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,731
A righteous warrior.

464
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,234
Count me out.

465
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,651
Well, Earth Totem.

466
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,863
Meet Steel man.

467
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,065
So how did your D&D crew thingy find

468
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,694
one of the six Swords of Sorrow?

469
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,243
We didn't. We died a grisly death
at the hands of Xanathar.

470
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,157
- Gary...
- But, but

471
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,490
that's because we
weren't working in concert.

472
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,292
The Legends will be fine
as long as they just don't split up.

473
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,997
Mick and I will find Zari.

474
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,417
All right, and I'll go
get the Earth Totem.

475
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,549
You're gonna die.

476
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,378
- Hey.
- Thanks, Mick.

477
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,344
You can do this.

478
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,142
<i>The point of my story is,</i>

479
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,189
<i>even though we were
defeated by Xanathar,</i>

480
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,440
we were able to track
the mystical object he was wielding.

481
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,695
The Sword of bloody Sorrow.

482
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,318
Ah!

483
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,569
You are a bloody genius, Barry.

484
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,204
Gary.

485
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,159
Gary, right.

486
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,040
I need the vial from my desk.

487
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,998
Mother's tears
and my ruination stones

488
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,455
and from you Ava, I'm gonna need...

489
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,085
- Oh, please don't say it.
- The foot.

490
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,951
Sorry, can we just
pretend for a moment

491
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,723
that I have no idea
what you two are doing?

492
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,141
Well, it's like our Gary said,

493
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,469
the easiest way
to locate the Legends' ship

494
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,559
is to locate the Death Totem.

495
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,948
You know, it's a shame that
you had to join the family business.

496
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,859
You were a sweet kid.

497
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,240
Last time we were here,
I was a little girl,

498
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,662
but I was never sweet.

499
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,245
Your friend Oliver made sure
of that when he killed my father.

500
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,041
Oliver's not responsible
for the path that you chose.

501
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,631
You're right.

502
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,590
You see, Sara, you and I,

503
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,677
we're alike.

504
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,300
<i>The darkness has
always been within us.</i>

505
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,600
Please, please.

506
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,139
Ra's al Ghul will never know
you let me live.

507
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,904
<i>Papi!</i>

508
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,176
<i>Once a killer, always a killer.</i>

509
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,443
Why are you crying, Sara?

510
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,446
You've done nothing wrong.

511
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,829
Imagine what you could do
if you just released your guilt.

512
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,498
You can't erase your past, Sara,

513
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,375
so just embrace it.

514
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,834
You want me to join your team.

515
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,339
It's your destiny.

516
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,047
Eons ago, the sixth tribe of Zambesi

517
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,178
defended Mallus from their brethren.

518
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,057
Their tribe wielded the Death Totem.

519
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,227
Now the cycle's starting again.

520
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,019
You weren't just born
to wield the Death Totem, Sara.

521
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,531
You were born to wield
the Death Totem for Mallus.

522
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,615
Z.

523
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,789
I'm all right, barely.

524
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,117
Nathaniel, we have Z.

525
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,497
Did you find the Earth Totem?

526
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,336
Actually, I did, but,

527
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,918
guys, Sara found me.

528
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,169
Nathaniel, where are you?

529
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,138
<i>Nathaniel?</i>

530
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,764
What's the matter, Nathaniel?

531
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,308
You look like you've seen a ghost.

532
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,608
Nathaniel?

533
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,604
Nathaniel, where are you?

534
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,275
Right, the Fire Totem's
our last chance to defeat her.

535
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,741
Oh. Here I thought escaping
to the Jumpship was a good plan.

536
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,988
I don't care what she's done.

537
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,491
I'm not abandoning Sara
or anyone else on this team.

538
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,946
Too bad, you're down a leg,

539
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,872
and you look like
a cat stuck in a dryer.

540
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,416
That's not funny. I love cats.

541
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,915
I'll wield the Totem.
Let's just get to the lab.

542
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,105
Here's hoping Ray
knew what he was doing.

543
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,631
Get a grip, Nate.

544
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,221
That's not your grandfather.

545
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,182
Houston, 1970.

546
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,807
I wanted to be with my wife and son.

547
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,518
But you convinced me
that was impossible.

548
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,858
You were relieved when
I blew the cargo bay door.

549
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,107
I didn't want you to die.

550
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,360
You were desperate to
save your own hide.

551
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,904
Now what have you
made of yourself, boy?

552
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,657
You're a damn
disappointment to your father,

553
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,202
and you're sure as hell
a disappointment to me.

554
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,042
You think Amaya loves you?

555
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,125
You're not worthy of her love.

556
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,387
There.

557
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,005
Haircut nuked the stone.

558
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,017
This Totem wasn't meant for me.

559
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,224
You have to use it.

560
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,064
- Forget it.
- You've spent your entire life

561
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,565
obsessed with fire and heat.

562
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,896
What if this is the reason why?

563
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,073
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not a hero!

564
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,451
Sara's a hero.

565
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,276
And look what
the Death Totem did to her.

566
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,657
That was the work of Mallus.

567
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,390
Most people who've seen
what you've seen

568
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,414
would have succumbed
to darkness, but you didn't.

569
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,534
You chose to become a Legend.

570
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,377
You may try and hide it, Mick,

571
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,878
but you're a good man.

572
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,257
What if you're wrong?

573
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,717
There's only one way to find out.

574
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,232
Hit her with the holy water.

575
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,438
There's somebody
who wants to talk to you, John.

576
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,173
John?

577
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,756
You glamoured your voice.

578
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,213
That's the oldest bloody
trick in the book.

579
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,264
You don't remember me?

580
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,891
I know it's been a long time.

581
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,439
Astra.

582
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,264
Mallus will free me from hell, but

583
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,599
you have to give him Sara.
A life for a life.

584
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,901
You know better than anybody.

585
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,404
Magic always has a price.

586
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,574
I wanna speak to Sara.

587
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,787
Okay.

588
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,873
All right.

589
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,207
Astra.

590
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,377
I'll do it.

591
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,789
Give me your hand, Astra.

592
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,135
Come on.

593
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,051
It's all right, love.

594
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,347
It's just me.

595
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:56,849
It's Johnny.

596
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,315
No one escapes Hell.

597
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,232
The sacred cross commands you
to free this woman from your prison.

598
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,202
<i>...to free this woman
from your prison.</i>

599
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:26,879
Sara.

600
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,544
Wielding a Totem's not enough.

601
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,095
Now you want me to wear a necklace.

602
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,514
There's no time, Mick.

603
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,518
See? Doesn't work.

604
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,732
Whoa.

605
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,410
Are you still with me, Mick?

606
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,067
Sara!

607
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,111
<i>Sara!</i>

608
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:33,937
<i>Sara!</i>

609
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,816
Does Ava know
who you really are, Sara?

610
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,526
What you've done?

611
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,657
What are you gonna tell her?

612
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,404
That the Totem was wrong?

613
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,868
You aren't a killer?

614
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,794
The Totem's power
is within you, Sara.

615
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,837
All you have to do is decide.

616
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,133
A life

617
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,172
free of pain and regret, with us.

618
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,595
Or the tormented
half-life you're living now.

619
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,267
<i>Sara!</i>

620
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,551
I know you are still in there.

621
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,892
You are the strongest,

622
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,728
<i>most fearless person I've ever met.</i>

623
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,484
<i>You never back down.</i>

624
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,440
Don't you remember?

625
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,364
When did a Legend
ever go quietly?

626
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,661
I'm here.

627
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,155
I'm here, Sara, and I
need you to come back to me.

628
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,949
I need you to come home.

629
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,125
Sara, can't you feel me?

630
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,363
No.

631
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,022
You're making a mistake.

632
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,159
No

633
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,159
To a life

634
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,492
without pain or regret.

635
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,249
No

636
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,292
To being a demon's lackey, and no

637
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,079
to bringing more
death into this world.

638
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,003
I owe that little girl at least that.

639
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,218
You could have everything.

640
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,865
You saved me again.

641
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,413
I had a little help.

642
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,543
Well, while we're here, uh,

643
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,123
give us a light?

644
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,928
Chin chin.

645
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,610
Hmm.

646
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,487
I should definitely come
to your aid more often.

647
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,280
Well, at this point,

648
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,277
I might as well just
make you a bed on the ship.

649
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,861
Hmm. Tempting.

650
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,791
If you thought Mallus
really would have freed Astra,

651
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,868
you would've traded me, wouldn't you?

652
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
In a heartbeat.

653
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,082
- Yeah.
- Well, what can I say?

654
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,334
I'm a nasty piece of work.

655
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,387
So am I.

656
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,258
You survived, love.

657
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,932
For now.

658
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,468
You know, there's a reason why
I prefer to walk this path alone.

659
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,688
It's...

660
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,854
So I don't have to share
with anyone how lost I really am.

661
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,982
But you're not alone, are you, Sara?

662
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,401
Maybe I should be.

663
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:06,948
She's a good one.

664
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,030
Try not to hurt her.

665
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,536
That's what I'm afraid of.

666
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
Mmm.

667
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,454
You pinched me.

668
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,422
Sara.

669
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,581
Is it the real Sara?

670
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,712
Yeah, it's me.

671
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,464
I'm sorry, Ray.

672
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,639
I'm...

673
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,222
I'm sorry, everyone,

674
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,595
I'm really sorry.

675
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,580
It's good to have you back, Captain.

676
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,187
Yeah, because evil you is
a pain in the ass to fight.

677
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,084
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around this mess.

678
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,441
Why would Mallus
want to show me Jesse?

679
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,564
Or me my grandpa?

680
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,654
I don't know.

681
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,072
Mallus was trying
to recruit me to his side, and

682
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,615
using my darkest fears.

683
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,318
Maybe that's just what he does.

684
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:55,577
He looks into our hearts,
and broadcasts our deepest secrets.

685
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,909
Huh, that's terrifying.

686
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,206
Okay, you up.

687
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,504
I need your speed
to re-couple the mainframe.

688
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,798
Ah. Music to my ears.

689
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,969
Oh, although, I was
really digging the silver hair.

690
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,556
- Hey.
- We need to talk.

691
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,557
No good conversation
ever started that way.

692
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,692
- Ava, I'm sorry.
- Listen,

693
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,068
I can't pretend to
understand what you went through.

694
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,281
Or what happened to you,
but I know that wasn't you, Sara.

695
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,367
That's just it.

696
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:31,988
That was me.

697
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,789
Just like fire is to Rory,
there is part of me that...

698
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,832
That's always been there.

699
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,875
And I really tried

700
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,954
to pretend that that wasn't true.

701
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:44,998
But deep down,

702
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,257
I am Death.

703
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:49,968
No, Sara...

704
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,467
Okay, so we can fight
that part of you together.

705
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,837
- Just tell me what to do.
- Hey.

706
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,009
Ava, you read my file.

707
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,094
But I still showed up
at that restaurant in that

708
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,730
horribly uncomfortable dress
trying to impress you,

709
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,293
because I don't care
about your past, Sara.

710
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,478
Well, maybe you should.

711
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,940
You are wonderful.

712
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,574
And I...

713
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,482
And I've never been
this happy in my life.

714
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,248
But this doesn't look happy.

715
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,201
Look, I don't deserve you.

716
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,379
- Yes, Sara, yes, you do.
- No, Ava, I don't.

717
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,128
You deserve better,
you deserve so much better.

718
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,258
And I care about you, but

719
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,922
I'm not gonna do this. I won't.

720
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,475
Sara...

721
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,809
I'm sorry.

722
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,374
Fresh from a successful crusade,

723
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,703
our team knew
the fight was far from over.

724
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,172
In fact,

725
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,006
<i>the true battle
was only just beginning.</i>

726
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,646
<i>In order to defeat the demon
and his cabal of evil,</i>

727
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,519
<i>we need to be at full strength.</i>

728
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,526
<i>Which is going to be hard
given the losses we sustained</i>

729
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,944
<i>on our last quest.</i>

730
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,989
<i>Some wounds are so deep,</i>

731
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,532
<i>they never truly heal.</i>

732
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,402
So the question is,

733
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,203
are you prepared
to join us on this mission

734
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,784
most deadly?

735
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,291
Well tonight, squire,

736
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,086
I'm all yours.
