1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,080
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,160
Who were those people you
were speaking with?

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,760
You keep your nose
out of my business.

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,080
Come now, Butch, play nice.

5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,000
If a person comes into contact
with my blood, it changes them.

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,680
My brother, if he gets in your mind,
you're doomed.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,000
Goodbye, Mr. Gordon.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,440
- Ivy's missing...
- She'll turn up somewhere.

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,760
This time she fell, it was a long way
down into water.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,080
Then maybe she survived.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,880
- What's your name?
- My name's Ivy.

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,360
Barnes asked me to put you
on a 48 hour suicide watch.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,480
- I've already signed off on it.
- He just cost you the election.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,640
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
let Butch kill you where you stand.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
There's that.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,480
<i>Oswald Cobblepot,
has won the mayor's office by...</i>

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,000
I believe in you, Oswald.

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
You never believed I could win
this election on my own.

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,240
Maybe you're not cut out
for this after all.

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,240
- What?
- Jervis. Let her go now.

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
- No! I'll never go with you!
- No!

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,280
You killed her!

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,400
I would like to introduce
you to my Chief of Staff.

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,680
Mr. Edward Nygma.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,320
<i>Welcoming our new Mayor of Gotham,
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,320
<i>"Building Gotham Safe Again."</i>

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,800
<i>Welcoming our new Mayor of Gotham,
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,840
<i>"Building Gotham Safe Again."</i>

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,160
You're an angel.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,720
Am I a good boy?

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,040
Have I made you proud?

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,840
I hope I'm not interrupting.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Ed... you never met my mother.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,120
Wasn't she beautiful?

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
A fine figure of a woman.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
She was my whole world.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,080
The only one that was always
there for me.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,960
Well, I believe the answer is yes.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,040
She would be proud.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Do you really think so?

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
Oswald, look at everything
you've achieved.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,720
The people love you.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
Gangs fear you.

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
And tomorrow night the crème
of Gotham will be gathering

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,080
to celebrate, you.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,800
What more could someone ask for?

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,720
Someone to share it with.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,360
My mother was the daughter
of immigrants.

51
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,480
A humble cook.

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,120
We did not have much,
but when she was by my side

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
I felt loved. Protected.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,200
As promised, I have rid Gotham
of its villainous monsters.

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,280
With my mother as my witness,
I vow to you from this day forward,

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,680
every man, woman, and child in
our great city will be safe!

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,800
Spread out!

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,800
No one is safe. Not from us. Drop it.

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,960
Put it down!

60
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,480
You will pay for this! Dearly!

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Now... now... Mr. Mayor.
Don't go losing your head.

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,080
Have a nice day!

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
{\an5}I can't come over tonight.

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
{\an5}Okay.

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,000
{\an5}I mean, that'd be three nights
in a row.

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
{\an5}That'd almost make it a thing.

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
{\an5}Yeah. The neighbors might talk.

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,080
{\an5}Exactly.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,640
And I have a dinner.

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
{\an5}It's not a date.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,200
{\an5}None of my business.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,520
{\an5}So, whatever happened with Tetch?

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
{\an5}I told you.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
{\an5}He broke his sister out of the GCPD.

75
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,880
{\an5}Bullock and I chased him down.
She died. He escaped.

76
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,720
{\an5}'Cause I heard a rumor there's
something strange about her blood.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,760
{\an5}Do you like this?

78
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,280
{\an5}I think I've made that pretty clear.

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,480
- Then why are you pressing?
- Because I want to know.

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,600
{\an5}And are you asking as a reporter
or as yourself?

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,520
- Is there a difference?
- There should be.

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,400
{\an5}When you were a cop, did you stop
being one when you came home?

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
{\an5}Maybe that was my problem.

84
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
{\an5}The guy I'm having dinner
with is a hematologist

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,480
{\an5}in charge of analyzing
Alice Tetch's blood.

86
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
{\an5}I'm free after 10.00
if you wanna call.

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,880
{\an5}Thanks for the coffee.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
We found the truck.

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,880
{\an5}They ditched it in The Narrows.

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,760
{\an5}We've got forensics going over it,
and teams doing a ten block sweep.

91
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,080
{\an5}We already found this.

92
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
{\an5}The Red Hood Gang.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
{\an5}I thought those idiots were dead.

94
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
{\an5}My guess is they're copying the look.

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,720
{\an5}The original Red Hood Gang
were bank robbers.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
{\an5}Whoever they are, they got
a beef with Penguin.

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,120
Expand the search to 15 blocks.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,440
Everything goes through you.

99
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
You mean through me.

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
Wow.

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,080
It is good to be back.

102
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,440
I have missed all of you.

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,480
Harvey, still a stranger
to a haircut and a shave, I see.

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
What are you doing here, Nygma?

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,040
As Mayor Cobblepot's chief of staff,

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,280
I'm gonna be your liaison
on the Red Hood investigation.

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,200
I wanna see all reports.

108
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,360
And I'm going to need access
to your forensic lab.

109
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,080
You think I'm gonna just let you
waltz into my precinct?

110
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,440
You're a cop killer who should be
in the looney bin.

111
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,200
- I'll be damned...
- You'll be fired.

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,920
The mayor can't fire me.

113
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,960
No, but he can appoint
a police commissioner who will.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,040
So, you will carry out the mayor's
orders, without question,

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,640
or the GCPD has a new captain.

116
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
How does that sound?

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,080
Every dog has his day, Nygma.

118
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,480
Enjoy yours.

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,600
And where is our lord mayor?

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
Hiding under his desk?

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
He's meeting with constituents.

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,560
Anything for you,
my little Cobblepot.

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,600
You can count on me.

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,480
Those were the words my mother
used to whisper to me

125
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
every night before I fell asleep.

126
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
She was a saint.

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,320
Yes, a saint whose only desire
was to love me.

128
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,080
And what was her thanks?

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
Not only did she take a knife
in the back

130
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,640
but even in her death, her
memory is being desecrated.

131
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Seriously?

132
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
This is the reason we're here?

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,040
Little glue. Some paint.

134
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Momma will be good as new, huh?

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
No! That is not the reason
you are here.

136
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,400
The Red Hoods have challenged
my authority.

137
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,280
They will be made an example of.

138
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,560
Tonight, I am celebrating
my historic victory...

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,520
At The Sirens.

140
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
It's gonna be fabulous.

141
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
None of you are invited.

142
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,200
I want them found and their leader's
head brought to me on a spike

143
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,320
before nightfall.

144
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,960
What're you waiting for? Find them!

145
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,720
All right. Five card draw, gentlemen.

146
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
Someone didn't ante up.

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Come on, you cheap bastards.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,680
How long are we supposed to wait?

149
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,720
Long as it takes the boss-man
to get here.

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
You need a lookout.

151
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,280
Oh, relax, fellas.

152
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,720
Hey, you want us to deal you in,
boss?

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,520
We don't have time for games, boys.

154
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
We got work to do.

155
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Hello, Jim.

156
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
Is it a bad time? I should've called.

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
No.

158
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Please. Come in.

159
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,720
Right. Can I get you something
to drink?

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,240
- A glass of water?
- I'm fine.

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
I heard you were back.

162
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,440
I've been meaning to come see you.

163
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Everything okay?

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes. Alfred and I are both well.

165
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,880
I hear you're
a private investigator now.

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,960
I'd like to hire you.

167
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,400
Bruce, if this is about corruption
at Wayne Enterprises...

168
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,120
It's not. I've put my investigation
into my father's company aside.

169
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,920
It's time I moved on.

170
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,520
Why the sudden change of heart?

171
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
It's far from sudden.

172
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,800
I've given it a great deal
of thought.

173
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,360
I can't live my life
if I keep looking back.

174
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
For what it's worth,
I think that's wise.

175
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,400
So what can I do for you?

176
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,760
Ivy Pepper's gone missing.

177
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't realize you two were close.

178
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,360
We're not.
She's a friend of Selina's.

179
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,320
And does Selina know
you're doing this?

180
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,280
No. I don't want to get her hopes
up if you don't find anything.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,200
We'll start with the GCPD.

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
See where we go from there.

183
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,840
And I think it's chivalrous
you doing this for Selina.

184
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,400
How long have you two been a thing?

185
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
Oh, no... no... no.
Selina's a friend. That's all.

186
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,920
- Yeah.
- No. Really. She's just a friend.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,440
Mr. Fox, just the man
I've been wanting to see.

189
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh, joy. Mr. Nygma.

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,480
Heard you were stopping by.

191
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,400
I have questions.

192
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
- Hopefully, you have answers.
- Or what?

193
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,880
You'll poison me with gas?

194
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,280
That gas was a sleeping agent.

195
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,520
And, to be fair, I was not
in the best place in my life.

196
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,280
To be fair... if you ever threaten
my life,

197
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,000
or the life of Bruce Wayne
again, I will find a way to end you.

198
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,520
Mr. Fox, we both know you're
not a man of violence.

199
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,680
No, I'm not.

200
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,000
If I was, I would have laced
some piece of lab equipment,

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,120
one which you were sure to touch,
with a toxin.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
Ricin, maybe.

203
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,920
I'd use Saxitoxin. Harder to trace.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
But I like your style.

205
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,840
You are insane.

206
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,640
Was insane. I have a certificate.

207
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,160
So, the Red Hoods?

208
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,280
See for yourself.

209
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,040
The gang's getaway vehicle
was abandoned in The Narrows.

210
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,040
As you'll notice, its carpet fibers
has elements of dirt, oil,

211
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,400
and, oddly, potassium chloride.

212
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
A halide salt.

213
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Fascinating.

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
So nothing on Ivy Pepper.

215
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
But an odd report came
in a few weeks ago,

216
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,080
okay, a construction worker claimed

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,880
that a redhead knocked
him out, robbed him.

218
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,880
- And she left this.
- That's Ivy's sweater.

219
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
- How do we find this man?
- I already called.

220
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,760
All right, the guy's down
South on a job.

221
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,320
But he swore up and down
that the redhead who rolled him

222
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,800
was in her 20's.

223
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,120
So? He's probably covering
for being with a young girl.

224
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,360
Doubtful he would come forward
in the first place.

225
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
Yeah. Most pervs don't wanna
call attention to themselves.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
- So it wasn't Ivy.
- Seems unlikely.

227
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
But why would
she have Ivy's sweater?

228
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,600
Doctor Thompkins.

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,320
Bruce. It's good to see you again.
You got taller.

230
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,720
Like I said, right?
The kid's growing like a weed.

231
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,800
- Nice to see you, too.
- Oh, Jim, could I have a word?

232
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
I wanted you to hear it from me.

233
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, my engagement
announcement is coming out

234
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,520
in the Gazette tomorrow.

235
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,960
And it will feature Mario's name.

236
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440
I think that's customary.

237
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,480
His family name.

238
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
You mean Falcone.

239
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,800
You knew?

240
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,240
- You knew, you didn't say anything?
- Sure I did.

241
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,520
I said congratulations.

242
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,880
- Don't be cute.
- Lee. People talk.

243
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,480
Was I surprised? Sure.

244
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,040
But it's also none of my business.

245
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,520
Your life is your life.

246
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,720
And I meant what I said.
Very happy for you.

247
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
So, that's it?

248
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
That's it.

249
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay. Oh, well, I just
wanted to tell you.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,320
Doctor Thompkins.

251
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,560
I had heard that you were back.
I'm so glad...

252
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,840
- That's for Kristen.
- You shouldn't have done that.

253
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,960
Or what? I'm supposed to be
scared of you

254
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,240
because you work for Penguin?

255
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,280
My fiancé's father
is Carmine Falcone.

256
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,880
I so much as whisper to him,
and you disappear.

257
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,360
Tell the mayor, whatever
I can do as M.E.

258
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm happy to help.

259
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,960
It's bad enough we're throwing
Penguin's party.

260
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,200
It's good for the club.

261
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,560
Now we're his errand girls?

262
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Sweetie, we find the Red Hoods,
he'll owe us.

263
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,800
We can ask for a favor.

264
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,000
Say, him not killing you?

265
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,280
Well, it would be nice not to have
to watch my ass all the time.

266
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,000
Well... well. Who do we have here?

267
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,360
Guy calls himself
The Ballistic Bomber.

268
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
My contact at The Merc saw him
buying smoke grenades last week.

269
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,240
Just like the ones the Red Hood
used on Penguin.

270
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,200
Groovy. Reckon he'll talk?

271
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
'Course.

272
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,560
Maybe give him a moment.

273
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,600
Now, remember, kids,
you tell the press

274
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
this is all Penguin's fault.

275
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,240
No, please!

276
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,120
- Please leave me!
- Good.

277
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
- Light it up!
- Yes, sir.

278
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,560
- No, have mercy.
- Please. Don't. No!

279
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,760
Better run, Sister.
Before the Padre goes boom!

280
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,680
No! Jesus! No!

281
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,880
Don't. Hey, hey.

282
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,720
The grenade, it's slipping.

283
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
Seriously? The Priest?

284
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
You should've seen it.

285
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,680
Ka-boom!

286
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,920
But you told them what to say?

287
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,280
- This is all because of Penguin?
- Yeah, boss.

288
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,440
But I don't get it, you wanna take
out Penguin, let's take him out.

289
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,200
This Red Hood stuff is fun,
but it's a lot of work.

290
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,640
How about you just do
what I tell you.

291
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,920
Now, I got you these, so you'll
blend in at the party tonight.

292
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,480
Huh? Huh?

293
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,760
Nice suit!

294
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,520
And that's when we kill him?

295
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,920
No! No one kills Penguin!

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,600
You should.
'Cause he's gonna murder you!

297
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,000
Time to have a heart to heart, Butch.

298
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Alone.

299
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
You don't have to buy lunch.

300
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,760
I know you're a billionaire.

301
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
But I can buy you a sandwich.

302
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,760
Do you miss it?

303
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Being a cop?

304
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,480
Sometimes. Yeah.

305
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,400
- It gave a sense of mission.
- True.

306
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,200
There's more to life
than having a mission.

307
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,320
Look, I'll keep asking
around about Ivy.

308
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,120
But you want my advice,
talk to Selina.

309
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
Tell her how you feel.

310
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,120
Does that actually work?

311
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
Sometimes.

312
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,360
It's definitely better than
being silent.

313
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,640
Before you know it,
the moment passes.

314
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,760
And are you taking your own advice?

315
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,120
I'm afraid that ship has sailed.

316
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm not talking
about Doctor Thompkins.

317
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm talking about the woman
you're seeing now.

318
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Excuse me?

319
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,000
There was lipstick on a coffee mug
on your table.

320
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
You've become quite the detective.

321
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
So are you?

322
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,320
- It is complicated.
- So is Selina.

323
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
That I believe.

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,600
I just wish sometimes I had a sign.

325
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,640
Unfortunately, life doesn't usually
work that way.

326
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,920
<i>We're hours away
from Mayor Cobblepot's</i>

327
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
<i>victory celebration.</i>

328
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,960
<i>But people are asking,
will the Red Hood Gang</i>

329
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,360
<i>put a damper on the festivities?
Mayor Cobblepot...</i>

330
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,120
Sounds like Penguin's
having a bad day.

331
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm supposed to go to his party
tonight.

332
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,840
Part of my re-engagement
with being a Wayne.

333
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,680
Well, give the mayor my best.

334
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,280
<i>Witnesses say the Red Hoods blamed
Cobblepot for their act.</i>

335
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,440
Someone is testing me, Ed.

336
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,200
They're thinking, he's mayor now.

337
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,760
He has to play by different rules.

338
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,560
No, they'll see, when I'm roasting
their entrails over a fire.

339
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
Perhaps, I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

340
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
Perhaps, this is not
about you at all.

341
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
What if this is about the statue?

342
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,680
Of course, it's about me!

343
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Yes, you're probably right. Oh, dear.

344
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
- Wonderful.
- Oswald. Take a breath.

345
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,600
What are you doing?

346
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,600
It's an old trick I learned
in the lab.

347
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,320
Most solvents have as their base...

348
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,240
I am the son of water,
but if water touches me, I die.

349
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,960
- What am I?
- Again with the riddles?

350
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,880
Salt. Most people think
of it as a food additive.

351
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
But potassium salt
is found in detergents, soaps...

352
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
What is your point, Ed?

353
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,720
I know where the Red Hoods are.

354
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,680
I say we give him to Penguin.

355
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,680
Knowing Penguin
will gut him like a fish?

356
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,960
Ladies. Come on.

357
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,240
- After all we've been through...
- It's his life for yours. Simple.

358
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,360
I don't get it.
Why'd you turn on him now?

359
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,080
I wasn't gonna hurt Penguin.

360
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,680
Honest, I was gonna take down
the Red Hoods myself.

361
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
Tonight. At the party.

362
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
All this so you could play the hero?

363
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Ever since Nygma got out of Arkham,
Penguin treats me like I'm nothing.

364
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,160
That pencil-neck's
trying to push me out.

365
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,680
Let me ask you, we figured out you're
the man behind the Red Hoods,

366
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
how long do you think it'll take
Penguin and his lap dog?

367
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
It's your life, baby.
You make the call.

368
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,800
Let me see this through.

369
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,080
I get my place beside Penguin back,
I'll protect you.

370
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Oh, you'll do more than that.
You'll owe me.

371
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,160
And one day, I'm gonna collect.

372
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,680
- Gilzean.
- Butch. Where are you?

373
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,200
The Red Hood Gang is at a
detergent factory in The Narrows.

374
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
We're on our way.

375
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I gotta go.

376
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,320
Get your things. We're done.

377
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm breaking up the band.

378
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm serious. Go. Get out of Dodge.

379
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,360
Yeah, well, not for nothing,
but you promised us a payday.

380
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,760
We're not leaving till we get it.

381
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,760
Well, guess it was gonna happen
sooner or later.

382
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
What?

383
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,920
Sorry, boys.

384
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
I did it, boss.

385
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,040
I got them for you.

386
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,200
Peace and order have once again
been restored to Gotham.

387
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,280
The Red Hood Gang is no more.

388
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,240
My very own man, Butch Gilzean,

389
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,880
risked life and limb to face down
the bandits.

390
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,320
Mr. Gilzean...

391
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
Was your life ever in danger, Butch?

392
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,560
I can honestly say that if I'd
had hesitated, I'd been a goner.

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,200
All right, people, listen up.
It's happy hour.

394
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,120
Finish up those reports
and let's call it a day.

395
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Hey, Ed.

396
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,600
Even before you went crazy,
I never liked you.

397
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
Your zipper's down.

398
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Listen, Butch did us all a favor.

399
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,080
Red Hoods go bye-bye. Case closed.

400
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,440
Look at the way the bodies fell.

401
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,040
As if they were just standing
there waiting to be killed.

402
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
Butch comes all the way in the room.
But only one man pulled out a gun.

403
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
I guess they weren't threatened.

404
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,120
By a 300lbs gorilla?

405
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,520
Whose side are you on anyway?

406
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
No one's losing sleep over
a bunch of dead crooks.

407
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Least of all, me.

408
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,080
I said wrap it up!

409
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,080
What have we here...

410
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
Burning the midnight oil?

411
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh, just finishing up.

412
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,400
I'm guessing you're here
to reprimand me.

413
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,160
Reprimand you? For what?

414
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,400
Punching Nygma in the jaw.

415
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,600
I just couldn't help myself.

416
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,160
First I'm hearing of it.

417
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,680
Well done, Doctor.

418
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,600
Actually, I'm here to ask about,
Alice Tetch's blood.

419
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,920
If you've heard anything.

420
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,200
As it happens, I just received
the preliminary results

421
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,480
back from the lab.

422
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,040
- Fascinating.
- What is?

423
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,880
They injected samples
into a group of rats.

424
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,000
After three days, two of the rats
were showing marked increases

425
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,160
- in strength and stamina.
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

426
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,800
But the study ended after one
of the rats killed all the others.

427
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm guessing that's not normal.

428
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,080
It chewed through a dozen
wire cages to get at them. No.

429
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,680
Why would one of the rats go psycho
and not the others?

430
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,240
Perhaps the others hadn't had
a chance to show any symptoms.

431
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,680
Or they were immune.

432
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,680
Sometimes people live
with a disease for years

433
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,560
without any adverse effects.

434
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,880
The lab is starting a new study now.

435
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,200
Well, keep me informed.

436
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,960
Oh! And, don't stay too late.

437
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm sure that fiancé of yours would
like to see you once in a while.

438
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,600
And was the captain
of the GCPD invited

439
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,480
to our new mayor's victory party?

440
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,160
You know, I lost my invitation.

441
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,160
I can feel it...

442
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,640
Looking for Oswald...

443
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,720
<i>Walking down the street.</i>

444
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,240
<i>Kicking cans...</i>

445
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440
Heard you took down

446
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,000
the Red Hood Gang,
single handed.

447
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
So to speak.

448
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,320
- Very funny.
- Don't forget. You owe me.

449
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
I know.

450
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,880
How long do we have to stay?

451
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,520
As long as it takes for you to be
seen in the world, Master Bruce.

452
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
Being Bruce Wayne.

453
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,840
And smiling.

454
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,240
So this is our life now?

455
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,960
Fake smiles and mingling.

456
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
I miss the old days.

457
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
So do I.

458
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,120
- It's so nice.
- Oh! Excuse me.

459
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,520
Bruce. Mr. Pennyworth.
I'm so pleased you made it.

460
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying
to get out a bit more, Mister Mayor.

461
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,840
Oh. Oswald, please.

462
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,280
We never got the chance to thank you

463
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,000
for saving our lives
from the ex-Mayor.

464
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,760
- That was nothing.
- Not at all.

465
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,720
I found it very fortuitous
you turned up when you did

466
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,960
with that bazooka.

467
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,960
I just felt a bit sorry for Stan,
the gardener,

468
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,960
'cause he was picking up
bits of Galavan for weeks.

469
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,200
And now here you are the new Mayor.

470
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Sometimes life has a way
of working out.

471
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,600
Yes. That's true.

472
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,120
What is it, Master Bruce?

473
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
A sign.

474
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Please excuse me.

475
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,440
All right, well, I'll just go
and wet my beak.

476
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Congratulations again, Mister Mayor.

477
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,920
<i>I... I... I knew that I'm onto you</i>

478
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,440
<i>I've got my plans
And they needn't you</i>

479
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,480
<i>- Nothing you can say to me</i>
- Hey!

480
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Hey, yourself.

481
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,560
Funny. I never realized
how short you are.

482
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,040
Who the hell are you?

483
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,480
Not yet.

484
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,880
This is too fun.
Run along, little kitty.

485
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,200
Go steal some more wallets.

486
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Hey.

487
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So sweet.

488
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,360
There he is, the man of the hour.

489
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,480
I have a surprise for you, Butch.

490
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Not in the mood.

491
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,040
What's in the box?

492
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,560
Open it.

493
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
Thanks, already got one.

494
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,080
Oh. Of course you do.

495
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,440
And you certainly wouldn't
need this one as

496
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,400
it's so similar to your very own
pocket square.

497
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,480
This is from
the Red Hood crime scene.

498
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,720
It turns out that your suit and the
Red Hood suits were all made

499
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,520
by the same tailor, Mr. Fuji.

500
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
That's some coincidence.

501
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
I thought so myself,
which is why I called Mr. Fuji.

502
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
And he said that a large man
with a metal hand,

503
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,160
not many of those running around,

504
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,320
bought all six of the suits.

505
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,840
Which means, ta-dah!

506
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,600
You're the architect
of the Red Hood...

507
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,800
I should snap your neck right now.

508
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,480
You haven't heard my offer.

509
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,000
We kill Penguin together.

510
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,160
What're you talking about?

511
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,640
- You're his guy.
- Oh, please. You fell for that act?

512
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,040
Yes. He broke me out of Arkham.

513
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,440
Very appreciative.

514
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,160
But I was not cut out
to be number two.

515
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,720
I've simply been waiting
for my moment.

516
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,560
Which you have graciously provided.

517
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,920
How would you like to run
Gotham with me?

518
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,520
The two of us? Working together?

519
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,880
You have proven yourself far more
cunning than I imagined.

520
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,920
Now I assume this little drama of
yours was meant to climax tonight.

521
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,400
So, put on the hood.

522
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,080
Kill Penguin.

523
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
I'll help you escape.

524
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,560
Tomorrow, we divide up the city.

525
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,480
You'd really turn on him?

526
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,840
After all he did for you?

527
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,640
- Mister P.
- In a heartbeat.

528
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,280
- No.
- Okay.

529
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,640
Then I guess it's time
for surprise number two.

530
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,560
You got to Zsasz?

531
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,840
I got to Zsasz.

532
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,960
And he got to Tabitha.

533
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,560
Penguin's history.
Question is, are you?

534
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,960
Can I see your invitation?

535
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,880
- What're you doing here?
- I was invited.

536
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Course you were.

537
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,120
You recognize her?

538
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Should I?

539
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
I don't know.

540
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
- Hey. Are you, you?
- I'm me.

541
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,240
Well, I'm working, so...

542
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,000
Actually, there was something
I... I wanted to tell you.

543
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,320
Could we go somewhere more private?

544
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,720
Fine. But make it quick.

545
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,680
Can't believe you turned on
Oswald too.

546
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
Oh, hello. Pot-kettle-black.

547
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,280
No. It's not the same thing. You...

548
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
never mind.

549
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,520
I swear, your goons hurt
Tabitha, so help me...

550
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,400
Just. Do. Your job.

551
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Showtime.

552
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,160
Put one in the Mayor,
before I put one in Tabitha.

553
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,960
Ladies, gentlemen.

554
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,960
Welcome to The Sirens.

555
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,960
Tonight we're here to celebrate
the honorable Mayor Cobblepot.

556
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,960
Our savior from the monsters,

557
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,800
and the captain of our fair city.

558
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,840
And now the mayor would
like to say a few words.

559
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Ed, where've you been?

560
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
I've been looking
for you all evening.

561
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,840
Oh, just tying up loose ends.
I just wanted to say good luck.

562
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,840
Okay. Thank you.

563
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,360
Tonight is a celebration,
not of my victory, but of Gotham's.

564
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,200
This is a new day!

565
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,240
I wouldn't celebrate yet,
Mister Mayor.

566
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Red Hoods ain't finished yet.

567
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,680
- Ed! What are you doing?
- Wait!

568
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,800
Sorry, boss.

569
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Butch!

570
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,680
- Huh?
- Oops.

571
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
The Mayor.

572
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,240
Our Mayor.

573
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,920
Vowed that all of the
Red Hood would be destroyed.

574
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,920
And now we have
the real leader caught.

575
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,800
Red handed.

576
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,480
You really thought
I'd give you real bullets.

577
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,280
You are an idiot.

578
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,960
I will kill you for this!

579
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,080
Sounds like we're missing
all the fun.

580
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
Got plenty of fun left for you.

581
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,880
You know, if you're gonna take
a girl hostage in her own place,

582
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,640
you might wanna search it first.

583
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,840
After all that I've done for you!

584
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
I gave you a job!

585
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,200
I gave you everything!

586
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,320
I used to be somebody in this town

587
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,360
and then you and that sniveling
little son-of-a-bitch...

588
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Shut up!

589
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,400
I am shocked, and grieved...

590
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,560
that one of my dearest
friends has betrayed me.

591
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,640
But let it be known,
that Oswald Cobblepot

592
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,040
will prosecute anyone
who threatens Gotham.

593
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,600
Here. Here.

594
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,720
Yeah.

595
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Upsy-daisy.

596
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,480
Oh, my God!

597
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Showtime.

598
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,360
Oswald, move!

599
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,240
I am gonna enjoy this!

600
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,680
Best. Party. Ever.

601
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,080
- Wait. Not now.
- Ed!

602
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,480
Ed! Ed! Ed!

603
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,680
So, what's up?

604
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,080
I hired Jim Gordon to help me
locate Ivy.

605
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
And?

606
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,760
There was a redhead
that had her sweater.

607
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
But it wasn't Ivy.

608
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,200
Saying it out loud, I realize,
doesn't sound that impressive.

609
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
No. It doesn't.

610
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,320
That's really why you
brought me up here?

611
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
You are the real Bruce...

612
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,280
'cause nobody else
would be this boring.

613
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,480
Great work, Detective.

614
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
That's not all.

615
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,680
We've been friends
a long time, Selina.

616
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,960
And ever since you've known me,
I've been dedicated to one thing.

617
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,560
But that's done.

618
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,200
I don't know what's next.
But I know...

619
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,800
Would you please just say
what you mean?

620
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
I like you.

621
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,080
As more than a friend.

622
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,560
It would be nice
if you said something back.

623
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,240
How many girls have you dated?

624
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
What do you mean?

625
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,000
It's not a trick question.

626
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,520
- How many girls have you dated?
- None.

627
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
None.

628
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,360
Have you ever thought
that maybe you only like me

629
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,480
because I'm literally
the only girl you know?

630
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,360
That's not true. I feel something.

631
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,280
And I know you do too.
We're the same.

632
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,840
In what universe are we the same?

633
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,840
- The money doesn't matter!
- Try not having it. It matters.

634
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
There's something between us.

635
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,440
I know there is.

636
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,840
You have to see that.

637
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,040
Rule one... don't ever tell me
what I have to do.

638
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,920
So, you do have feelings for me?

639
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,160
- I'm confused.
- Good.

640
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,720
Come on, just tell me.

641
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,880
I got all dressed up.
I even put on lipstick.

642
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,960
I could lose my job.
What are you offering?

643
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,520
Fine! Then I'll say something,
if I'm right, you just nod.

644
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
You ran tests on Alice Tetch's blood?

645
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,000
You found something in her blood.

646
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,560
A virus or infection or something.

647
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,440
Do I have to go over the rules again?

648
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,560
Let's have new rules, sweetie.

649
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,120
I'll tell you what we're doing
with Alice Tetch's blood,

650
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,440
and in return you...

651
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,760
Okay.

652
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,320
Excuse me? What are you doing?

653
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,120
Two whiskeys.

654
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,000
And a pineapple juice for this guy.

655
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,160
- What's going on?
- To go.

656
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
What's going on?

657
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
I think you were just leaving.

658
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,560
Forget this.

659
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,320
Trust me. I'm gonna try.

660
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,280
What're you doing here?

661
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,120
Just walking by.
Saw you through the window.

662
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,160
- Took it as a sign.
- Like hell.

663
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,120
You tracked me here.

664
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,720
And for the record,
I could've gotten what I wanted

665
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,080
from that creep without
compromising my honor.

666
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,120
I know. But you don't have to.

667
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,760
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

668
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,480
I thought you wanted to keep the
woman and the reporter separate.

669
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,880
- Is that an option?
- No.

670
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Well, then.

671
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,720
You are gonna have to buy me
dinner, though.

672
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
What's good here?

673
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,320
It's ginger tea with honey.

674
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,320
It's my mother's remedy
for a sore throat.

675
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,720
You sure you don't need a doctor?

676
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
No. I'm fine.

677
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,880
I still don't understand why you
didn't tell me what you were doing.

678
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,640
Your shock when seeing Butch
had to be genuine.

679
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,240
The people had to believe it.

680
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,320
And they did. And once again,
you're the city's hero.

681
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,360
You were almost killed.

682
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,560
And you saved me. Again.

683
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,880
I hope you know, Oswald.

684
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,160
I would do anything for you.

685
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,160
You can always count on me.

686
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Thank you.

687
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,240
Need a hand, Kitten?

688
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
I got it.

689
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,680
Hold on, Butch.

690
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,320
Sir, the ambulance carrying
Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.

691
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Damn it! Put out a BOLO.

692
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,640
I'll call the Mayor.

693
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
Yes.

694
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,120
Mister, please.

695
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,040
My dear, sweet sister.

696
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,000
Just look at what he did to you.

697
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
He took you from me.

698
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,920
We belonged together.

699
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,200
And he killed you.

700
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,240
But, Mister, I'm not dead.

701
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,960
If only that were true.

702
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:35,440
Those who hurt you will feel my pain.

703
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,760
When my sweet and terrible vengeance
upon them rains.
