<i>Last season, on</i>
"Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,110
This is my city!

3
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:06,670
You want to stop me,

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,232
you're gonna have to
kill me!

5
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:09,358
No!

6
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:13,130
So far Ricardo Diaz
has been unstoppable.

7
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:15,826
You want my help? I'm gonna
need two things from you.

8
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:18,082
- Mr. Queen, it's time.
- What is she talking about?

9
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,973
I thought you said
we had immunity! You do,

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,465
but only if Oliver
agreed to turn himself in.

11
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:25,521
There is still work
to be done.

12
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,951
I am the Green Arrow.

13
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,904
- William, run!
- I can't run anymore.

14
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:45,925
Yes, you can!
Get up. Get up.

15
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:48,054
Oliver, help!

16
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:49,663
Oliver can't help you.

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,859
Run now! Now!

18
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,907
You're brave.

19
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:58,901
Oliver Queen took
everything from me.

20
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:11,673
I'm gonna enjoy taking
everything from him.

21
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:21,212
Morning, 4587.

22
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:22,624

You...
you're the Green Arrow.

52
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:26,834
Wrong guy.

53
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,111
But I saw you on TV.

54
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,641
That beard threw me off
a little bit,

55
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:31,055
but... it's
definitely you.

56
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,707
I'm a big fan.

57
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,297
"You have failed
this city."

58
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:37,737
Ok, I'm not that person
anymore, all right?

59
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:43,479
Look, I'll join whatever
gang you're in.

60
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,907
I don't care what
I have to do.

61
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,972
I just...
I need your protection.

62
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,505
I'm not in a gang.

63
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,680
Then let me be your,
uh, sidekick

64
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,840
or your lookout or
something. Please.

65
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,565
Just... I...

66
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,932
How am I supposed
to survive in here?

67
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,251
I don't know.

68
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,656
Leave me alone.

69
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,094
What the hell?

70
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,145
I told you this wasn't over,
didn't I?

71
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,337
We waited a long time
for this.

72
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,759
Revenge is a bitch.

73
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:00,429
We don't have
to do this.

74
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:01,929
But we want to.

75
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,771
Break it up!
Break it up!

76
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:29,041
You've all had enough fun for today,
don't you think?

77
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,013
You know the penalty
for being in possession

78
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,724
of a weapon, Mr. Turner.

79
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,136
Take him to the hole.

80
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:37,443
You're dead.

81
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,363
When I get out,
you're a dead man!

82
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,184
He planted that.
That's not mine.

83
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,583
Deals can't miss, bro.

84
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,734
Primo product,
great price.

85
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,771
Look, I'm on my way
over now, ok?

86
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,618
It can't be you.
Aah!

87
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,530
Would you mind
handling the incident report?

88
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,083
I'd like to make date night
with curtis for a change.

89
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:16,055
Go get the captain.

90
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:30,712
4587, you pull that crap
again from yesterday,

91
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm gonna make
an example out of you.

92
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,993
Understood, inmate?

93
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,549
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,579
You got a visitor.

95
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,863
You know the drill.

96
00:07:06,507 --> 00:07:07,968
You've looked better.

97
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,782
I've looked worse.

98
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,985
How are William
and Felicity?

99
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,077
Still safe and sound
in witness protection.

100
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:17,038
I've upped surveillance
to 24/7

101
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,798
since we spoke last week.

102
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,656
Has the FBI made
any progress?

103
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,946
No.
No. Nothing.

104
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,257
Watson says she won't
stop looking,

105
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,329
and neither will I.

106
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,322
But, Oliver,
it's been 5 months, man.

107
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,954
Five months.

108
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,788
Maybe we need to think
about the possibility

109
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,335
that Diaz is
off the grid for good.

110
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,082
I can't believe that.

111
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,877
I know this
must be so frustrating...

112
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,329
Losing all sense
of agency like this.

113
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,679
Being out of control,
I know,

114
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,595
is not your strong suit.

115
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,109
I'm focusing on what
I can control.

116
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:50,837
What's that?

117
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,876
Keep my head down.

118
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:56,458
Hopefully shorten
my sentence.

119
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:58,329
That's smart.

120
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,306
I think that's a good play.

121
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,479
But I worry about the toll

122
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,610
that's going to take
on you, Oliver.

123
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:07,787
Cuts heal, John.

124
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,539
Not physically, bro.

125
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:13,428
Keeping passive,
not fighting back.

126
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,833
Never been who you were.

127
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,366
I've always done
what I had to do.

128
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,967
Right now...

129
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,677
This is what
I have to do.

130
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,061
Don't lose yourself
in here, Oliver.

131
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,691
I'll be ok.

132
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,172
Damn it.

133
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,365
What's up?

134
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:37,864
We're supposed to go
live on this app today,

135
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,465
but something in the upgrade

136
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,530
is corrupting the break.
It's...

137
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:43,314
Can I take a look?

138
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,321
Be my guest.

139
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:46,996
Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,940
Are you some sort of, like,
secret tech wiz or something?

141
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,910
I just know my way
around a computer.

142
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,020
There you go.

143
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:57,878
You are a woman of many
talents, erin. It's...

144
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:01,035
Saving the world one
espresso at a time.

145
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,511
This coffee's crap.

146
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:07,145
I'll make sure
to take it up with our barista.

147
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:08,887
You ready to talk?

148
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,359
To a beat cop?

149
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:12,653
I've already wasted
enough of my time.

150
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,528
I want to talk
to your captain.

151
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,465
You sure about that?

152
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,971
Because officer Anastas
is a lot more patient

153
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,893
- than I am.
- Lady captain?

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,622
Oh, nice.

155
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:26,340
Hmm.
Well, you have

156
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,805
quite the list of allegations
against you, huh?

157
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,457
Fraud, racketeering,
embezzlement.

158
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:33,533
The key word being
allegations.

159
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,113
Well, where there's smoke,
there's fire, Mr. Stent.

160
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,371
And in my experience,
innocent men

161
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,846
don't typically show up bound
and gagged at my doorstep

162
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,943
- without reason.
- There's a reason, all right.

163
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:46,999
The Green Arrow.

164
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,756
Maybe you hit your head
a little too hard,

165
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:50,559
but Oliver Queen is
in prison.

166
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:52,919
Then there's another
psycho in green leather

167
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,015
assaulting people with
a bow and Arrow.

168
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,667
There have been no vigilantes
in this city for 5 months.

169
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,299
Looks like you got your work
cut out for you, then, don't you?

170
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,411
Now, are you gonna
let me go,

171
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,293
or do I have to sue
your asses?

172
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,676
Yeah. Just as soon

173
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:09,067
as officer Anastas
takes your statement...

174
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:14,613
Very slowly.

175
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:20,980
Guys, guys, remember,
always keep your hands high.

176
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,307
That's your guard.

177
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:23,981
Tony, yeah. In and out.

178
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,487
Yeah, but keep your distance.

179
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,470
Nice one, peanut.

180
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,973
Isn't it bad
to punch things?

181
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,809
Ms. Lopez says
Gandhi wasn't violent.

182
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,302
Gandhi ain't from the glades.

183
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:37,457
Besides, self-defense isn't
about being violent.

184
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,271
It's about being focused
and disciplined

185
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:43,310
so you can protect yourself
and the ones that you love.

186
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,911
That's just 'cause there's no more
heroes to keep us safe, right?

187
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,599
Hey, dad, my bag's leaking.

188
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:53,943
Uh, nothing a little
duct tape can't fix.

189
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,896
Are we ever gonna
get new stuff?

190
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,074
This bag's
kind of gross.

191
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,271
Still waiting to hit
that lottery, Zoe.

192
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:01,912
Besides,
gross builds character.

193
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,996
Ten-minute break
while I patch these things up.

194
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:07,784
What's up with you, man?

195
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,414
This class is dumb.

196
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,065
Boxing's not gonna win you
a fight in the glades,

197
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,368
- and you know it.
- Boxing's not about winning.

198
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,466
It's about being focused
and disciplined

199
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:16,808
so you don't have to fight.

200
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:18,794
You mean with, like,
a hockey mask?

201
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:22,418
Come on, man. Everyone here knows that
you're wild dog after that trial.

202
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,169
And you just didn't
punch people.

203
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:25,355
I don't do that anymore.

204
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:28,076
Yeah?
Maybe you should.

205
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,028
'Cause my family just
got robbed last week.

206
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,353
And the cops don't care about us
in the glades.

207
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,060
So it's on us
to protect ourselves.

208
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:40,666
Hitting these bags
isn't gonna do it.

209
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,721
You know, I ain't into
blondes myself.

210
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,187
Put that down.

211
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:53,926
Slow your roll,
Arrow.

212
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,644
You wouldn't want this
conversation to get messy.

213
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:59,502
You know I can just take
that from you, right?

214
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,152
Well, that'd be
a good thing.

215
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,757
You see, it'd save us
the trouble of planting it

216
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,580
when we rat you out
to yorke,

217
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,530
just like you did to turner.

218
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:09,229
Now, I know you're
trying to get back

219
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:11,250
to this pretty little face.

220
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,971
You're probably counting
down the days.

221
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:15,446
Just tell me what you want.

222
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,337
Yeah. Well, you see...

223
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:20,252
You see,
me and sampson here,

224
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,119
we've got a 3-man
operation with turner.

225
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,816
Side hustle.

226
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:28,644
And, uh, because of you,
we're a man down.

227
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:31,525
So I think you
should take his place.

228
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,114
No chance.

229
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:36,465
Now, here's two reasons
why I don't believe you.

230
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:38,898
Now, I bet you
really wish you

231
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:42,058
hadn't have stopped Merlyn
from killing me, don't you?

232
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:48,058
See you soon, Arrow.

233
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:57,972
So I can sell cheap
to the culebras, no problem.

234
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,980
Whatever you want,
Mr. Stent.

235
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:03,496
Heh. You got it.
I got you.

236
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,333
My man.

237
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,090
This ain't no playground, kid.
Keep it moving.

238
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:09,801
Y'all sell guns, right?

239
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,761
That depends.

240
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,377
How much money you got,
little man?

241
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:14,918
He's not interested.

242
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,402
You followed me?

243
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,392
Yeah, I figured you would
do something stupid,

244
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,327
and it looks like
I was right.

245
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:23,934
Hold on.

246
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,613
I know you.

247
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,958
You're the one that dropped
a dime on Oliver Queen.

248
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,371
Uh, crazy dog
or something like that.

249
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,004
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's go. Come on.

250
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:39,221
Unfortunately for you,

251
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:41,582
you just saw my whole operation.

252
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,416
And that can't be good
for anybody.

253
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:47,809
Get down.

254
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,572
You ok?

255
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,368
Was that the Green Arrow?

256
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,540
I don't know
who the hell that is.

257
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:43,096
We should turn around!
It's not safe.

258
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,390
But is it impossible?

259
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,591
No, not impossible,
but it's not very smart.

260
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,218
Then how about I add
another 100 grand

261
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,180
to the 200,000
I've already paid you?

262
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,719
Most people would pay
that kind of money

263
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,304
to stay away from here.

264
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,524
This place must be very
important for you.

265
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,347
It's not the place.

266
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:03,282
It's the person I'm
hoping to find there.

267
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:19,046
- Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,338
Thanks for your help
the other day.

269
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:22,713
Yeah, it was nothing.

270
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,244
Ah, it was more
than nothing.

271
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,377
The app's number one
thanks to your genius.

272
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,227
Oh, well, I'm pretty
sure I just touched

273
00:15:29,314 --> 00:15:31,354
somebody's snotty
snot rag,

274
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,416
so I am also living
the dream.

275
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,502
Ha ha. Well, I hope I'm
not one of those customers

276
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:36,852
that you secretly
complain about.

277
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:40,127
You? No. You're polite and
nice.

278
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,477
And your hygiene is fairly
on point from what I can tell.

279
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:43,533
The bar seems pretty low.

280
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,602
Yeah. You should work here a
month, you might change your mind.

281
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:50,315
You could always... I don't know...
change my mind over dinner?

282
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:53,955
Unless if that just put me
on your creepy customer list.

283
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,208
You're asking me out.

284
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,805
- And now I'm regretting it.
- No. I mean,

285
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:58,376
I-I'm flattered
and everything,

286
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,486
because, like,
"whoa. Still got it!"

287
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:04,005
Not interested? I... I get it.

288
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:07,245
No, you definitely don't
get it.

289
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,846
<i>Breaking news
out of star city this morning</i>

290
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,993
as the D.A.'S office
is set to comment

291
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,649
on growing speculation
that the vigilante known

292
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,994
as the Green Arrow
has returned.

293
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,704
For an official statement
from the district attorney,

294
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,065
we go live to city hall.

295
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:22,980
- Are the rumors true?
- Is the Green Arrow really back?

296
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,305
Did Oliver Queen
escape?

297
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:26,719
Do you have any idea
who's under that mask?

298
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:28,399
We have reason to believe

299
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:32,346
that a vigilante impersonating
the Green Arrow is out there.

300
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,923
While we're still pursuing leads
as to the identity

301
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,352
of this unknown assailant,
we can tell you with 100% certainty

302
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,674
that he is not Oliver Queen.

303
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:42,946
This is someone new.

304
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,049
You said, "assailant."

305
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,407
Does that mean city hall
considers this new Green Arrow

306
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:49,385
- a threat?
- To the rule of law? Absolutely.

307
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:52,821
Star city continues to employ
a zero-tolerance policy

308
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:56,791
against any and all acts of
vigilantism.

309
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:01,158
Anyone found committing or
aiding and abetting these acts

310
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:04,619
will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

311
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,463
Think she's full of crap?

312
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:09,713
You really have
to ask me that?

313
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,573
You done giving
your statement?

314
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,062
Green guy with
a bow and Arrow

315
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,666
takes down a weapons deal
and saves my ass.

316
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,657
If you ask me, you should
be helping this guy,

317
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:20,006
not hunting him down,

318
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,198
especially with Diaz
still out there.

319
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:23,697
Diaz has been gone
for months,

320
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:25,448
and the FBI still has
its eye on us.

321
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:27,907
So as much as I doubt
laurel's motives...

322
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,572
And, uh, believe me,
I do...

323
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:31,735
Taking a hard-line stance
was the right play,

324
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:34,290
because if agent watson
even so much as suspects

325
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,555
we have something to
do with this...

326
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:36,917
Our immunity goes adios.

327
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,811
That's right.
And that's why we have got to find

328
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:41,502
this Green Arrow wannabe
and shut him down.

329
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:44,924
Rene, we all agreed,
for better or for worse,

330
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,585
we were not gonna go out
as vigilantes.

331
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:48,727
Otherwise,
what was Oliver's sacrifice for?

332
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,986
Ok, so we're supposed
to just ignore

333
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:53,047
the rising crime rate
and do nothing about it?

334
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,760
Actually, I think risking
my officers every day

335
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,352
fighting to maintain
law and order is

336
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,065
doing something
about it.

337
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,783
I... I get that, D.,

338
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,994
but Oliver asked us
to carry on.

339
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:06,291
So whoever's behind
that mask is doing

340
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,711
what we're supposed
to be doing.

341
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:09,664
But he's not
helping the problem.

342
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,034
Actually, he's
making it worse.

343
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,809
Rene, I'm not saying

344
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,865
that we can't still be
heroes to this city.

345
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:19,343
We just have to do it in a
little bit of a different way.

346
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,409
So where you at
finding this wannabe?

347
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:27,222
Well, we retrieved a few
Arrows from the scene,

348
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,924
but forensics still
turned up empty.

349
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,610
- But what about the perp?
- Any pattern

350
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,987
as to how
he's selecting his targets?

351
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:35,408
This weapons dealer has
a rap sheet 12 feet long.

352
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:36,602
He was an obvious mark.

353
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:38,377
But this first guy...
Stent...

354
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,947
I still haven't figured out
how he fits into the puzzle.

355
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:42,118
You don't think he's
innocent.

356
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,721
This guy? Hell, no.

357
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,368
But his rap sheet's
only clean

358
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:47,088
because he paid
to make sure it was.

359
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,360
Well, it looks like
you might have to take

360
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,844
a deep dive through
his financials.

361
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:51,439
Yeah.
But I can't exactly

362
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,040
subpoena his records
based on a hunch.

363
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:55,580
Who said anything about
a subpoena?

364
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,552
I really miss this, guys.

365
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:00,173
Not that I don't like being
the head of r&d at a.R.G.U.S.

366
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,454
It has better benefits, as in
there are actually benefits.

367
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,391
I just miss the team.

368
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,721
Less talking,
more typing.

369
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,142
Right! Sorry. Uh,
it should only be a couple of minutes

370
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,883
before I'm in, which Felicity
could beat one-handed.

371
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,983
Miss her.

372
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,478
I really appreciate
the assist here, you guys.

373
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:13,814
You especially, John.

374
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:15,897
I know you've been in some hot
water here at a.R.G.U.S.,

375
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:18,455
burning so many of their
resources going after Diaz.

376
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,678
Well, Lyla's down
at HQ right now,

377
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:20,797
trying to smooth
things over.

378
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,134
Besides, I want to get
this Green Arrow imposter

379
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,533
off the streets
as bad as you.

380
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,351
I don't want watson
thinking that Oliver

381
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:28,611
set this in motion
in some type of way.

382
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:30,935
There's enough
trouble as it is.

383
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,759
How's he holding up?

384
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,337
He's surviving.

385
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:38,579
- And that's a bingo.
- What did you find?

386
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,064
How Stent's been
making his money.

387
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:41,453
And it's not from
defrauding pensions.

388
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,298
He's been peddling
black-market arms.

389
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:46,070
What kind of dumbass leaves his
entire criminal enterprise online?

390
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:48,039
He was actually
pretty smart about it.

391
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,986
He kept himself clean,
off the radar,

392
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:52,430
activities washed through
a series of shell corporations.

393
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,752
I just happen
to be smarter. Boo-ya.

394
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,687
So this is how the
targets are connected.

395
00:19:56,774 --> 00:19:58,632
Stent supplied the
weapons, medina sold them.

396
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,029
The vigilante's trying to shut
down stent's whole network.

397
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,525
Yeah. And according to this
text exchange, he's panicked.

398
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,773
Stent's trying to sell the
rest of his inventory off

399
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,984
in a huge buy tonight.

400
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:08,611
Do we have
a location?

401
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:10,420
Not until an hour
before the buy.

402
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:11,923
I'll keep you guys posted.

403
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,368
That's where we'll find
our Green Arrow wannabe.

404
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:18,321
So, uh, any guesses
on who this might be?

405
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:20,470
Well, my money was on John.

406
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:22,031
Whoever it is,

407
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,548
they won't be hiding
under the hood for long.

408
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:31,243
If you don't hear from me in
a week, I'm not coming back.

409
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:33,035
I hope you do.

410
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,078
You know, you pay me
a lot of money to do

411
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:37,143
very stupid things.

412
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,329
Always a pleasure.

413
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,537
This food isn't as bad as
I thought it'd be...

414
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:30,315
You can't sit here.

415
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,660
It's just like high school.

416
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:35,626
I don't really know how
to be much clearer

417
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:38,136
than I've been being.

418
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:39,895
Go away.

419
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,777
So what do you think
about your replacement?

420
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:43,839
It's got to bug you
there's a new guy that can do

421
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,767
- all the things that you can't do anymore.
- Okay.

422
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,831
Just because I have decided
to let you sit here

423
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,367
doesn't mean that
we're having a conversation.

424
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,040
You understand?

425
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:57,245
- You ready to hustle?
- No.

426
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,206
Listen, if you try to
leverage my family ever again,

427
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:05,095
I will expose whatever
it is you have going on

428
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:07,167
to every single guard
in here.

429
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,745
Disappointed to hear that.

430
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,058
We'll just have to try
this a different way.

431
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,862
This your new friend?

432
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,925
It's nothing
to do with him.

433
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:22,901
- It is now.
- I didn't do anything.

434
00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:26,580
Do you want to come
with us now, Queen?

435
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:29,572
No.

436
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:30,821
Oliver.

437
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:32,831
I can't help you.

438
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:35,808
Oliver... don't.

439
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:40,769
Don't. Please... uh! Uh!

440
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:57,516
Looking pretty crazy
out there.

441
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:58,876
I wanted everyone
ready to move

442
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,706
the second curtis
has a location.

443
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,626
With any luck,
we'll establish a perimeter

444
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,025
and gain some lead time.

445
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,128
And if that vigilante
shows up?

446
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:08,464
Then we take him
down, too.

447
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,355
I still don't think
you should do that.

448
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:12,457
I thought
we settled this, Rene.

449
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:14,728
For the last few months,
all I kept hearing is

450
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:16,855
how scared my kids at
the center were.

451
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:20,001
And then this Green Arrow
wannabe shows up,

452
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:22,109
and they have hope again.

453
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,360
So, to me, that's worth
a hell of a lot more

454
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:27,003
than our immunity deal,
rule of law,

455
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,355
whatever the hell crap
Laurel said.

456
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,337
Sometimes people just need
something to believe in.

457
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:34,229
Right. I get it, Rene.
I really do.

458
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:36,706
But how do you know
you can believe in this guy?

459
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:38,181
You don't know
what his motives are.

460
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:39,572
You don't even know
who he is.

461
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,636
I know he could've let me die,
and he didn't.

462
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,368
That's good enough for me.

463
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,995
Yeah?
You sure he saved you?

464
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:47,517
Or were you just not
his target?

465
00:23:47,604 --> 00:23:49,361
Because there's a big,
big difference.

466
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,047
Curtis?

467
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,572
The buy's going down
in an hour.

468
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,768
Old manufacturing plant
by the wharf.

469
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:05,271
You arrest
that vigilante, D.,

470
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:07,136
you're making
a big mistake.

471
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:10,675
No, Rene.
I'm doing my job.

472
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,901
Felicity...

473
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,690
Hey. Sorry. Did I wake you?

474
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:27,939
I couldn't sleep.

475
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:29,235
Everything ok?

476
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:30,660
I guess.

477
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,878
How was school today?

478
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:35,065
The same. It sucked.

479
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:37,123
Well, did you at least
crush your geometry test?

480
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,190
Yeah. I just miss
my old school.

481
00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:43,253
And I miss old my job.

482
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,829
I really, really miss
your dad.

483
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,277
Me, too.

484
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:49,542
At least we still have
each other, right?

485
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,706
How much longer do we
have to stay here for?

486
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:57,808
I don't know.

487
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,426
Are you ok?

488
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,685
What do you care?

489
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:35,554
I'm not gonna
survive in here.

490
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,098
Yeah, you will.
You'll be fine.

491
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,371
You... you just left
me to die.

492
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,090
I...

493
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:45,675
I knew that they
didn't want to kill you

494
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:47,060
because they...

495
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:49,990
I knew that they
were coming after me.

496
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,795
So you just let them
beat the crap out of me?

497
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,537
I'm on the guards' radar

498
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:58,601
after what happened
the other day.

499
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:00,233
And I...

500
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,826
I get another strike
against me,

501
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:06,082
and I'm back
to square one,

502
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:08,404
and I want to get
back to my family.

503
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:10,082
I can't...

504
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:12,461
I can't do that to them.

505
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,672
I have family, too.
Did you ever think about that?

506
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,254
I mean, I shouldn't
even be in here.

507
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,943
I was wrongfully
accused of murder.

508
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:30,670
And that's what
the city's like now.

509
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:33,152
There's no justice.

510
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:35,662
Just keep your head
down, you'll be fine.

511
00:26:35,913 --> 00:26:38,466
That... that's your advice?

512
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:43,324
All this time, I thought
you had a raw deal,

513
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:45,638
like I did.

514
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,059
But it makes sense now

515
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:49,607
why there's a new
Green Arrow out there.

516
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,153
Because the old one is
a coward.

517
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,505
Lights out!

518
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,787
There's close to $1 million
worth of product here.

519
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:06,210
All yours for 400k.

520
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,396
What's the catch?

521
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:09,004
I got burned out
on the business.

522
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:12,013
I decided to liquidate
for my mental health.

523
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,131
Stent's about to make
the exchange.

524
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,818
Should we move in?

525
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:23,373
We can make this bust
in our sleep.

526
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:26,170
I'm waiting
for the vigilante.

527
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,735
400k of assorted
cryptocurrencies,

528
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:34,452
as requested.

529
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:38,068
I do miss the old ways.

530
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,943
You mean a briefcase
full of money? No, thanks.

531
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,620
That's him. Move!

532
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:20,878
Please.
I'll give you anything.

533
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,383
I have what I came for.

534
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,335
Jason Stent,
you have failed this city.

535
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,618
Drop your
weapon now.

536
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:39,345
Don't be stupid.

537
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,528
Vigilante heading north!

538
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:57,555
Where the hell
are you hiding?

539
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:07,196
I was just trying
to get free!

540
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,579
You never should have
come here.

541
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,578
Morning, 4587.

542
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:26,321
Beautiful day.

543
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,565
Ohh, you think I'd be sick
of coffee by now.

544
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:15,620
Will?

545
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:29,935
Heh heh. Hey, Erin,

546
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,838
you're a hard woman
to find.

547
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,198
No one to save
you now.

548
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:50,325
It's just
you and me.

549
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:51,921
I swear to god,
if you hurt him.

550
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:53,681
You're gonna do what?

551
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:55,788
You're gonna sic Oliver
after me?

552
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:57,887
Right now,
he's realizing

553
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:00,474
how difficult
prison life is.

554
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:12,852
What the hell do you want?

555
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:17,360
Pretty simple,
actually.

556
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,202
I want Oliver to spend

557
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:24,573
the rest of his life
in prison knowing

558
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,813
I killed his wife.

559
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:29,503
Oh, thank god,
you monologue. Run now!

560
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,986
No!

561
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:06,542
You're gonna suffer
for that.

562
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:27,570
The only reason you're
still breathing is

563
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:28,954
so you can hear
this message:

564
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,801
Diaz found Felicity.

565
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:32,781
Your wife is dead.

566
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:53,148
I, um...

567
00:32:53,711 --> 00:32:55,192
I need to make a phone call.

568
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,685
Rough night, 4587?

569
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:58,030
I have reason to believe

570
00:32:58,117 --> 00:32:59,812
that my family
has been attacked.

571
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,949
Please allow me to make
a phone call.

572
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,327
You know you don't have
phone privileges.

573
00:33:07,273 --> 00:33:09,303
You got a visitor,
though.

574
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:29,343
You're ok.

575
00:33:32,317 --> 00:33:33,788
How's William?

576
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:35,343
He's fine.

577
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:38,842
Are you?

578
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:40,365
I am now.

579
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:42,655
I've missed you.

580
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:46,574
I love you so much.

581
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:50,690
And I'm so sorry
that I wasn't there.

582
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,252
I should have been
there.

583
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,795
How could you have been?

584
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,880
The only reason
that I'm here is

585
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,614
to keep
you and William safe.

586
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:00,475
Yeah. I know.

587
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,178
I need you to tell John

588
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:04,435
to set the two of you up
with new identities.

589
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:05,892
I need...

590
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:10,967
I need you... I need
you back

591
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,671
in the witness
protection program.

592
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:15,310
I have William set up

593
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,749
at a boarding school
in cambridge.

594
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,711
He leaves tomorrow.

595
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:22,942
You're not
going with him?

596
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,584
No, I'm not.

597
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:28,064
- Felicity...
- I'm done hiding, Oliver.

598
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,436
I'm done being a person
who doesn't fight back.

599
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,344
Diaz broke in, and
all I could think about was

600
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:34,975
protecting William.

601
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:37,694
I tried,
and I couldn't do it.

602
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:40,694
If a.R.G.U.S. hadn't gotten
there when they did...

603
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,349
Do you know
what it feels like

604
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:45,764
not being able
to protect your family?

605
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:49,334
I have lived with that
feeling every second

606
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,565
since I stepped
in here, Felicity.

607
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,327
Don't...

608
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,350
Don't tempt that,

609
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,554
please.

610
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:00,476
Please.

611
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:05,115
I am begging you
to go back

612
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,433
to witness
protection.

613
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,350
No. I won't.

614
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:13,514
You don't get to decide
this time, Oliver.

615
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,340
I love you,

616
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,913
and I will always...

617
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:24,530
Always wait for you.

618
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:28,627
But I can't
let what happened

619
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:31,036
to William and I
happen again.

620
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,711
I can't.

621
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:35,803
I have to fight back.

622
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,960
You, of all people,
understand that.

623
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:42,082
Time's up, 4587.

624
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:44,822
I... I need a bit more time.

625
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,030
And I don't care.

626
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:51,686
I love you.

627
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:57,819
- Ok. Ok.
- I love you.

628
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:10,897
Hey, guys, listen up.
I got some news.

629
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:12,646
We need more
duct tape, dad.

630
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:13,877
Not anymore, peanut.

631
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,763
We got ourselves
some new equipment.

632
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,077
I'm talking about
bags, gloves.

633
00:36:18,164 --> 00:36:20,177
You were talking about
you wanted some new shoes, right?

634
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:21,272
We got that, too.

635
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,638
Hey, you win
the lottery or something?

636
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:25,436
Nah. I just got some help
from somebody looking out.

637
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:28,108
But I thought you said
the old stuff builds character.

638
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:31,357
That... that was before I knew
we would get newer stuff.

639
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,148
Dad?

640
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,880
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ok.

641
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,590
Uh, keep practicing.

642
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:37,949
And when we get back,

643
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:39,913
we're gonna be ripping
these bags apart.

644
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:46,007
Hey.
What's up, D.?

645
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:48,311
What brings you
to these parts?

646
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:52,381
Well, uh, a couple of mom and
pop shops called the precinct.

647
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:54,819
They said they opened up
to find cash waiting.

648
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:57,959
It seems like 15 other
hard-up businesses

649
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:00,788
from the glades also got the same
exact amount that went missing

650
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,368
from the weapons buy
the other night.

651
00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:05,318
So, uh, you wouldn't happen
to know anything about that,

652
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:07,886
- would you?
- Uh, no. No. I can't...

653
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:10,958
But it does sound like
the work of a hero, though.

654
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:12,819
That's what it
feels like.

655
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:14,483
I should be arresting you

656
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,308
for the crap you pulled
the other night.

657
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:19,216
Do you have any idea the position
you're putting me in, Rene?

658
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,872
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
D., all right?

659
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,647
But I couldn't let you
lock him up.

660
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:24,263
He's not a criminal,
and you know it.

661
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,466
No, I don't.
And it's not

662
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:27,426
a leap of faith
I'm willing to take.

663
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:31,004
You know, I am working so hard
to restore the city's faith

664
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:33,349
in the men and women
who serve it.

665
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:36,637
Rene, if you go out there
as wild dog again,

666
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,820
I will not hesitate
to lock you up

667
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:40,324
just like that vigilante.

668
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:41,998
Are you serious, D.?

669
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,319
I just want you to think
long and hard

670
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,428
about what that means, ok?

671
00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:49,779
For these kids
and for Zoe

672
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:52,420
and for our city, man.

673
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:56,218
'Cause I'm not gonna give
you a second warning.

674
00:38:04,811 --> 00:38:06,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

675
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:07,716
How is he?

676
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:10,373
Quiet. Reading, mostly.

677
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:13,709
- I'll give you two a minute.
- Thank you.

678
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,103
Hey.

679
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,929
Did you see him?

680
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:26,213
I did.

681
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,530
I wish I could've come
with you.

682
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, me, too.

683
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:32,743
It's too dangerous.

684
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:35,360
No one can know
that you're here.

685
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:37,664
Hey, I got something
for you.

686
00:38:43,306 --> 00:38:44,680
What's this?

687
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,844
It's a symbol of
reconnection.

688
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:49,392
Your aunt thea
gave it to me

689
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:52,438
before she left town, and it's
something your father had given her.

690
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:54,735
As long
as you have this,

691
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:56,477
I will always be able
to find you.

692
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:59,014
I don't understand.

693
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:01,266
You have to go
somewhere.

694
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,633
It's super-super safe.

695
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:07,971
I can't come with you.

696
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:10,029
- You're leaving me.
- I'm not leaving you.

697
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:11,633
It's only temporary, ok?

698
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,391
Just until we get Diaz,
I promise.

699
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,905
And then as soon as we do,
I'm gonna come get you.

700
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:18,579
It's all gonna be over...

701
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,353
I swear.

702
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,961
Check it out.

703
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:47,317
Queen, you don't look
too hot there.

704
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,559
Maybe I can help you... uh!

705
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:58,727
Stand down.

706
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,540
Don't be a hero.

707
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:28,352
You should've killed me.

708
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,129
Who sent you?

709
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,998
No one.

710
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:09,739
But you knew my father.

711
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:12,123
How am I supposed to know
who your old man is?

712
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:14,420
No.

713
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,528
My father...

714
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:19,365
is Oliver Queen.

715
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:27,545
William?

716
