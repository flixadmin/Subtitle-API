1
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,949
<i>Look at the stars.</i>

2
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:49,084
<i>Whenever you feel alone,</i>

3
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:51,519
<i>the great kings of the past</i>

4
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,122
<i>will always be up there</i>
<i>to guide you.</i>

5
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,457
<i>And so will I.</i>

6
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:18,874
My friends, the time of
my family's growth is upon us.

7
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:22,476
This home we share
is the fulfillment

8
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,946
of my father's vision.

9
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,081
How wonderful is it
that Nala and I

10
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:28,083
get to continue his dream

11
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:30,785
and make even greater
the Circle of Life?

12
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:40,162
Nala, my love, I'm on my way.

13
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,868
Simba...

14
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:21,970
I'm here.

15
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,273
I'm here.

16
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,255
Security detail
has arrived!

17
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,991
One gentle reminder:
we are not food.

18
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,127
No, no, no, no, no.
We are just two guys

19
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,695
walking to work through
a pride of hungry lions.

20
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,866
Which is perfectly
normal. I'm not terrified.

21
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,201
Security detail
reporting for duty,

22
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,037
Your Grace, Your Highness...

23
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,705
Ruler of all
four-legged creatures.

24
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,008
And that one
three-legged zebra.

25
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,344
Oh, right, Ron.
That was tragic.

26
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:03,912
-It was an eat-and-Ron.
-Yeah.

27
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,914
Ron has three legs.
That's still one more than me.

28
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,082
-Well, are those arms or legs?
-Guys.

29
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,150
I don't know.
I think they're paws.

30
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:09,284
Guys.

31
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,987
-I consider all those legs.
-Guys! This is serious.

32
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,056
I need you to stay with Kiara
until I get back.

33
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,925
Are you saying
that your security detail

34
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,895
has been called on
to do babysitting?

35
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,296
Pumbaa, we should
really discuss this

36
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,964
because I don't really love...

37
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:25,666
Guys, I promised her
everything would be okay.

38
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,902
Well, that's one way
to parent.

39
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,070
She's gonna
have to grow up sometime.

40
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:29,004
What else did you tell her,

41
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,872
that she could be
whatever she wants to be?

42
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:31,940
That life is fair?

43
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,608
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

44
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,778
Don't scare Kiara.
And most of all, no stories.

45
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,214
-No stories?
-Wait a second.

46
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,082
I know where your head goes.

47
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,050
I grew up with you two.
Promise me.

48
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:43,617
Okay. You know what,
you know what, you know what?

49
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,020
Fine. No stories.

50
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,654
Speak for yourself, Pumbaa.

51
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,756
No. Pssh.
We'll tell a story anyway.

52
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,757
Okay, we'll tell
him that we're not gonna

53
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,691
tell a story and then
we're gonna tell a story.

54
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,327
-He can't stop us.
-Are you guys serious?

55
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,096
I'm clearly within earshot.

56
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,230
Dad.

57
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,868
Hey, little one.

58
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,839
Dad, the storm's coming,
and I'm scared.

59
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:05,706
I wanna go with you and Mom.

60
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,175
-Don't be scared, my love.
-Mmm.

61
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,311
Timon and Pumbaa
will watch you while I'm gone.

62
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:10,912
Be brave now, Kiara.

63
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,614
Be brave.

64
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:20,688
Okay!
We've prepared a story.

65
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,226
<i>Scar looked at us.</i>

66
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,428
<i>He knew it was</i>
<i>the end of the line.</i>

67
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:28,430
<i>I could smell the fear.</i>

68
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,731
<i>That was actually me,</i>
<i>but yes.</i>

69
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,385
<i>So you two</i>
<i>defeated Scar?</i>

70
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,785
And then you ate him?

71
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,922
Honestly, one of the best
meals I ever had.

72
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,991
My dad told me
he defeated Scar.

73
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,359
Well, okay. But your dad,

74
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:59,094
as we all know,
is a pathological liar.

75
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,429
He's always lyin'. Get it?

76
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,035
I'm scared.
I want Mom and Dad.

77
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,270
Look, look, look
look, look.

78
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:10,105
Don't be scared, Kiara.

79
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:13,774
How about we sing you a song?
And, a-one...

80
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,311
Pumbaa, no, it is
way too early for the song.

81
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,212
It worked on Simba.

82
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,014
He thought he had
murdered his own father.

83
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,016
He was singin' and dancin'
around in seconds.

84
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:22,417
I can't just
turn it on like that.

85
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,119
I have to be in the moment.

86
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,420
He sang that song
for six years straight.

87
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,088
Well, who didn't?

88
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:28,256
Look!

89
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,257
-No!
-It's Ron,

90
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,493
the three-legged zebra.
Run for your lives!

91
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,693
He heard what we've been
sayin' about him.

92
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,198
We're sorry, Ron. They were
jokes. They were just jokes!

93
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,731
It's Rafiki.

94
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,467
Rafiki! Rafiki!

95
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:44,472
Little one,
there's no reason to cry.

96
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,706
My parents...

97
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,175
they're gone.

98
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,245
Hey. Look out there, <i>mdogo.</i>

99
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:53,281
You see those baobab trees
blowing in the wind?

100
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:57,852
The roots of those trees are
very strong, like your family.

101
00:06:57,886 --> 00:06:59,888
And, just as they did for you,

102
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:03,425
your parents have gone to the
ceremonial birthing grounds.

103
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,494
And when they return,
the Circle of Life

104
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,864
will bring a blessing
to you, Kiara,

105
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:12,200
that you will never forget.

106
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:13,268
Man, he's good.

107
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,203
He's such
a visual storyteller.

108
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:17,305
Yet it makes sense
that he lives alone.

109
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,375
I just want the storm to pass,

110
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,776
and then I promise
to be brave.

111
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:25,413
I'll tell you a secret.

112
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:28,049
When your father Simba
was your age,

113
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,985
he was afraid of the thunder

114
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,053
and would hide
behind the king.

115
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,355
When did he stop hiding?

116
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:35,557
One day, during a big storm,

117
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,426
your grandfather Mufasa
took your father

118
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,996
to the very top of Pride Rock,

119
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,530
told him to stand with him

120
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,566
and howl into the wind.

121
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,535
And Simba slowly stepped out
with the king.

122
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,039
And together,
they roared into the night.

123
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,310
But I'm not brave like my dad.

124
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,345
And I could never be
like Mufasa.

125
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,049
Is that so?

126
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,352
Then maybe it's time
I tell you a story.

127
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:07,355
A story of a cub,
not much bigger than you.

128
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,226
A lion born without a drop
of nobility in his blood.

129
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,297
A lion who would change
our lives forever.

130
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,565
A story! So glad
I brought some crickets.

131
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,968
But go easy. We're in a cave.

132
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,304
This story
begins far beyond

133
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:24,306
the mountains and the shadows.

134
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,274
On the other side
of the light.

135
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:30,612
In this place, everything
was dying of thirst

136
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:33,081
as 20 full moons
had passed without

137
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,383
a single drop of water.

138
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,953
But when the skies
finally opened,

139
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,523
destiny would reign.

140
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:11,353
Mufasa.

141
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:15,023
Mufasa! Come see.

142
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:23,631
Mom, what is that light
way out there?

143
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:26,501
Oh, that's very special.

144
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,336
Beyond the horizon,

145
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,573
beyond the last cloud
in the sky,

146
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,542
that's a place we call <i>Milele.</i>

147
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:35,910
<i>Milele?</i>

148
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:39,080
Hmm. It means, "forever."

149
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:41,383
Imagine
a kingdom full of life,

150
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,319
water and food,

151
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:48,289
grass and sky
as far as the eye can see.

152
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:49,524
Will we ever go there?

153
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:51,259
Oh, yes, Mufasa.

154
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,528
That's exactly
where we're headed.

155
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:56,698
But we can also
be there right now.

156
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,566
We can close our eyes.

157
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,136
Let our dreams take us.

158
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,504

What is this?

213
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,073
Rain. Rain!

214
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:21,242
Oh, finally we have rain!

215
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,715
Dad, race you to the light!

216
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:29,350
You're too fast.

217
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:30,785
I've never beaten you.

218
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,620
Nobody has ever beaten you.

219
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,123
I know!

220
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:39,127
Mufasa!
Fastest cub in the world.

221
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,425
Thank you.

222
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,294
Mufasa...

223
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:14,295
that's enough.

224
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,098
Mufasa, come back now.

225
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,307
Mufasa, stay there!
I'm coming, son.

226
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,490
-Father!
-Mufasa!

227
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,331
Mufasa?

228
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,935
I'll catch you on the turn.

229
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,669
Find my voice.

230
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,437
Find my voice!

231
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,605
Mom!

232
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:10,418
Mufasa, the cliff is too high,
but you can cross at the dam.

233
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on, Mufasa,
you can do this.

234
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:14,489
Find your mother's voice.

235
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,491
Listen
to your father, Mufasa!

236
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,792
Listen to us!

237
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:22,563
Afia, he's there.

238
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,632
-Mom!
-He's there!

239
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,267
-Mother!
-Mufasa!

240
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,239
Find your footing
one step at a time.

241
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:32,573
-I can't.
-You can do this.

242
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:33,741
I'm right here.

243
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,323
Mufasa!

244
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,879
Mom?

245
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,580
Dad?

246
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,715
Can you hear me?

247
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,551
Is anyone out there?

248
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,256
Mom?

249
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,326
Please.

250
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:00,863
I'm scared.

251
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:03,765
I'm scared.

252
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:10,806
<i>The floodwaters</i>
<i>joined a distant river,</i>

253
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,742

254
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,879

255
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,507
Hello.

256
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,544
I'm Taka, son of Obasi.
What's your name?

257
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:50,778
Mufasa.

258
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm not allowed
to talk to Outsiders,

259
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,582
but I have a secret...

260
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,717
...and I really
want to tell you.

261
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,719
-What's the secret?
-I'll get in trouble.

262
00:16:58,753 --> 00:16:59,822
Please, just tell me.

263
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:01,689
Uh... I don't know.

264
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:02,858
Just tell me!

265
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:05,060
Okay.
You're about to be eaten.

266
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,530
I hate secrets!

267
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,868
-Swim!
-But I can't!

268
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,769
-You have to swim.
-I don't know how!

269
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:17,906
All right. Chin up, then walk
underwater really fast.

270
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,407
I can't!

271
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,810
Come on, Mufasa. Faster!

272
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,580
Help me, Taka! Help me!

273
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:40,761
I told you to wait for me.

274
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,130
It's not my fault, Mum.

275
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:44,867
I came down for a drink
and saw him floating by.

276
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,969
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

277
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,804
You're lucky
those crocs were young

278
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,705
and afraid to fight. Let's go!

279
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,506
We can't just leave him here.

280
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,176
Rules are rules, Taka.

281
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,777
Obasi will never accept
a stray.

282
00:17:56,812 --> 00:18:00,715
I'm not a stray.
I'm just... lost.

283
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:01,749
See?

284
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,086
He's just lost.

285
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,521
There was a...
a flood.

286
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,457
My parents,
they tried to save me.

287
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:13,929
Do you know which way is home?

288
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:16,999
Home?

289
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,935
To be lost
is to learn the way.

290
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,104
Call me Eshe.

291
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,839
I'm tired, Eshe.

292
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,539
Come on, it's this way.

293
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,192
Come on, Mufasa.

294
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:55,203
Is this <i>Milele?</i>

295
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:57,571
No, my love.

296
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,613
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

297
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,016
The all-important nap
of kings,

298
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,852
only to be awoken
by the disgusting,

299
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:13,654
hideous, revolting stench
of a stray.

300
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:14,890
When we come upon an Outsider,

301
00:19:14,923 --> 00:19:17,525
tell me, what do we do?

302
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,261
Obasi, I know.

303
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:20,195
Eat it.

304
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:23,531
But I found him, Dad.
I saved his life.

305
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:27,102
Taka, we do not associate
with Outsiders.

306
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:30,105
The only true bond is blood.

307
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:33,175
I've heard stories of lions
twice our size.

308
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,977
These Outsiders

309
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,511
will devour everything
in their path.

310
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,148
Does he look like he's going
to devour you?

311
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:44,219
Whoa, that smell
is disgusting.

312
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:46,687
I'm not even sure I could eat
this <i>kibeti!</i>

313
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,756
I'm not a <i>kibeti.</i>
I'm a Mufasa.

314
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,826
Do you even know
what "Mufasa" means?

315
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,693
-No.
-It means, "king."

316
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:53,929
And that's me.

317
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,597
You better start running,
little Mufasa,

318
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,732
for your life.

319
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:59,901
If I run,
you'll never catch me.

320
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,602
I'm the fastest cub
that ever lived.

321
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,536
My father told me so.

322
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,539
Ooh, Taka,
you have a challenge.

323
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:08,110
They will race
to the dead tree and back.

324
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:10,212
And when the prince
defeats him,

325
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,914
I will finish him in one bite.

326
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,050
What if Mufasa wins?

327
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,619
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

328
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,787
He stays with me.

329
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:21,722
You have my word.

330
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,194
Let the race begin!

331
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:29,264
Ooh, clumsy little stray.

332
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,999
Run, Mufasa!

333
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,566
You did not have to do that.

334
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,568
Taka
is the future king.

335
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:36,637
He has to win
his first challenge.

336
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,941
No, Obasi. To be a true king,
he must earn it.

337
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:41,575
Don't take that away from him.

338
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:39,935
Better hurry.

339
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:05,060
I have one more secret,
Mufasa.

340
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,762
I always wanted a brother.

341
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,716
-Cheater!
-Obasi!

342
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:31,752
You will keep him
with the females.

343
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:37,058
Taka, how could you lose
to a stray?

344
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:39,227
Well done, Taka.

345
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:41,930
Well done.

346
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:43,398
I thought you said
you were fast.

347
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:44,732
I had to let you win.

348
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:45,699
Well, I did just go days

349
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:46,800
with no sleep
while riding the waves of...

350
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:49,371
Anyway, come on, Mufasa.
Let's get in some trouble.

431
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:30,225
Chigaru jumped,
like, 20 feet.

00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:31,493
Oh, that's a new record.

433
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:33,928
Obasi,
they did it again.

434
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,930
Your sons are nothing
but trouble.

435
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:38,066
That one is not my son.

436
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,135
They're heathens,
the both of them.

437
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:43,438
This stray is forbidden
to be near the Shade Tree.

438
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,973
Mufasa and I were
just playing.

439
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:47,509
You two will
never be brothers.

440
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,144
Now go back to the females

441
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:51,946
and stay away from my son.

442
00:26:53,381 --> 00:26:56,017
Oh, your mother,
she adopts every lizard,

443
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,420
speaks to passing
grasshoppers.

444
00:26:58,453 --> 00:26:59,554
I want to go with him.

445
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:01,389
You want to be
with the females?

446
00:27:01,423 --> 00:27:03,191
You belong with the males.

447
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:05,260
He gets to hunt with Mother.

448
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:07,662
One day, he will betray you.

449
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:10,565
That is what strays do.

450
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,233
Mufasa would never betray me.

451
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,601
Hey, hey.

452
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,538
This will all be yours,
my son.

453
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:19,140
You will be king.

454
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,375
So pay attention.

455
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:24,012
Study every move I make.

456
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:27,115
Sleeping again.

457
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,316
That is what males do.

458
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,586
We protect the pride
as we nap.

459
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,121
That's...

460
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,789
Well, that's power.

461
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,261
Power?

462
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,544
Why are we stopping?

463
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,680
Close your eyes.

464
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:00,682
And tell me what you hear.

465
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,585
What you feel.

466
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:11,192
There's
a herd of antelope

467
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:13,628
heading across
the dry lakebed.

468
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:16,564
About half a day from here?

469
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:18,633
And how do you know
they're not gazelles?

470
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,170
Their steps
are too heavy.

471
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:24,772
-Moving way too slow.
-What else?

472
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:27,208
Come on. You can do it.

473
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:33,114
When the wind
hits their horns, it moves up

474
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:37,151
instead of across.
So, definitely antelope horns.

475
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,553
Very good.

476
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,228
What is it, Mufasa?
What's wrong?

477
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,230
Sometimes I get a scent.

478
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:51,666
It's barely a trace
on the wind.

479
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:53,368
And it smells like home.

480
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,207
Then it's gone.

481
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,110
Mufasa, your parents
are still out there.

482
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:03,278
We can keep looking.

483
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:04,579
I lost them, Eshe.

484
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,815
You're wasting your time
training me like this.

485
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,852
But these skills you have,
no other male has them.

486
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,353
Obasi will never accept me.

487
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:15,089
I'll never be his blood.
His family.

488
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,391
But you are my family.

489
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:19,594
And if Obasi could see
how gifted you are...

490
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:22,630
Well, maybe I like being
a stray, you know.

491
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:25,400
No rules, no responsibility.

492
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,135
I'm the lucky one,
Eshe.

493
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,570
What do you mean, Mufasa?

494
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,605
I never have to be like Taka.

495
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:33,308
I never have to be king.

496
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:48,690
Did he say, "no rules
and no responsibility"?

497
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:51,292
An outcast, afraid of water,
never takes a bath.

498
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,727
Which means he smells like me.

499
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,929
Which is not good.

500
00:29:53,963 --> 00:29:57,265
Well, either way, I think that
means that he's one of us.

501
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,200
-This is it.
-It's our time!

502
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,101
This is our moment.

503
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,437

It's okay, Mufasa.

It's okay.

537
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,028
It's okay.

538
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,764

Thank you.

Eshe...

What has happened?

542
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:57,512
Are you hurt?

543
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,749
They were huge.
White as ghosts.

544
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:03,384

00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:10,859
Had Mufasa
not been there, I...

547
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:16,764
Taka.

548
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:30,645
I owe you
a great debt, Mufasa.

549
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,048
We need to prepare.

550
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:35,750
They're downwind
less than a day away.

551
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:38,586
No.

552
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,122
You couldn't possibly
know this.

553
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:43,091
Send a scout and you'll see...

554
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,893
they'll be coming for us.

555
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:47,062
Chigaru.

556
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,799
Father, please,
let me explain.

557
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:53,701
No. Not now.

558
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,105
Taka, come.

559
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:19,627
Where is my son?

560
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,696
There was a young lion,
Majesty.

561
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:22,898
He fought Shaju.

562
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:27,035
And yet you came back.

563
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,138
You survived.

564
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:33,541
I was badly hurt. I promise,
Majesty. This is the truth.

565
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,776
-The truth?
-Yes, the truth.

566
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,147
The truth is standing
behind you.

567
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:46,021
-There were others, Majesty.
-No, no, no.

568
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:47,990
But only one left blood
on his mane.

569
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:50,658
Which means
he left Shaju to die.

570
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:52,027
Saved himself.

571
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,063
This young lion,
was he their king?

572
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:56,764
His blood is common. Ordinary.

573
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,432
Answer me!

574
00:34:58,466 --> 00:35:01,069
Was he their king?

575
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:05,807
No, Kiros,
you are the only king.

576
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,977
An ordinary lion?

577
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:11,980
And you left my son to die?

578
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:14,016
I was injured.
There was no choice.

579
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:16,184
Please, Majesty,
you have to believe me.

580
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,586
There's no reason to fear me.

581
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,589
I would never harm
one of my own.

582
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,424
Thank you, Majesty.

583
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:26,128
I'll leave that pleasure

584
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,162
to them.

585
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:30,866
Majesty! No. Kiros!

586
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:32,700
Kiros!

587
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:44,846
<i>No one</i>
<i>can ever know you ran.</i>

588
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,515
<i>That you ran from your mother.</i>

589
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,918
It never happened, Taka.
Do you understand?

590
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:52,586
But I didn't know. I was
just... I was just scared.

591
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,224
It doesn't matter.
We must protect the bloodline.

592
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:59,627
Protect it with a lie?
Father, that's deceitful.

593
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,798
Deceit is a tool
of a great king.

594
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:06,234
Taka...

595
00:36:07,169 --> 00:36:10,272
it's what kings must do.

596
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:12,274
But I'm not a king.

597
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:14,142
I'm just your son.

598
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:15,177
Obasi!

599
00:36:16,178 --> 00:36:17,678
Chigaru.

600
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:19,147
Obasi!

601
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:23,085
Chigaru, I'm here.
What did you see?

602
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:24,820
They're coming
this way, Obasi.

603
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:26,888
Two lions
for every one of ours.

604
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:28,756
Each one bigger than the next,

605
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:33,128
but none as mighty as Kiros,
their terrifying king.

606
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:35,130
Outsiders.

607
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:38,033
The stories were all true.

608
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,601
I must protect
the bloodline, Eshe.

609
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,938
The future of this pride.

610
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:45,639
Taka, you are that future.

611
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,541
Future? Dad, what do you mean?

612
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,710
I'm sending you away.

613
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,613
Far from here.

614
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:56,885
You will leave
and start a new life,
a new beginning.

615
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,121
I need you to go with him,
Mufasa,

616
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:01,655
to pledge your loyalty.

617
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:03,291
They'll arrive
with the sunrise.

618
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,701
Where will we go, Eshe?

619
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,203
Without you, I have no home.

620
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:18,306
Mufasa, you and Taka together.
That...

621
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:20,641
-That is home.
-Eshe...

622
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:22,210
Mufasa, look out there.

623
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:24,112
Beyond the light...

624
00:37:24,146 --> 00:37:25,679
You know what I see?

625
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:28,050
I see the place your mother
told you about,

626
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,318
a place beyond
the river's end.

627
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:32,187
Across the deepest canyon

628
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,889
on the other side
of the mountains,

629
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:36,258
a place beyond
the horizon itself.

630
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,726
A pride land so green,

631
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:42,097
so perfect

632
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,000
that to see it is to see

633
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,268
<i>Milele.</i>

634
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:49,071
Yes. Forever.

635
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:51,039
My parents spoke
of <i>Milel</i> often.

636
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:53,275
My mother told me
it was where we were going.

637
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:55,010
And don't you see, Mufasa?

638
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:56,078
You must keep going.

639
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,779
You must continue your journey
toward the light.

640
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:01,782
Please, Eshe.
I can't lose you.

641
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:04,618
You have my love
always, Mufasa.

642
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:07,655
But your family is still out
there, waiting for you.

643
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:09,224
I can feel their presence.

644
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,992
And I know you can, too.

645
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,661
Go.

646
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:16,797
Go, Mufasa.
Find your way home.

647
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:28,310
Mother, please forgive me.
I beg you.

648
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:30,812
There's no need, my love.

649
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:33,747
Taka, your moment of courage
will come.

650
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:43,825
Now both of you go.

651
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,129
Go and find your place

652
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,830
in the Circle of Life.

653
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:09,750
They left their family
never to see them again?

654
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,019
This story is killing me.

655
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:12,786
It's toying with my emotions.

656
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:14,688
And here
is the worst part.

657
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,191
-What's that?
-I'm out of crickets.

658
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,725
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

659
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,294
I need a bathroom break
before the second act.

660
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:20,896
Everyone wait for me.

661
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:27,202
I am back.

662
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:28,436
Pumbaa, did you wash
your hooves?

663
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,703
Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:30,972
-Pumbaa?
-I did. I did.

665
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,307
-Pumbaa?
-I'm just gonna walk

666
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,109
-on them again right after.
-Pumbaa?

667
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:38,779
Rafiki,
did the Outsiders come?

668
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:39,948
Yes.

669
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:42,918
And as the hunters led Kiros
into the Valley of Kings,

670
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:46,188
<i>Obasi and Eshe</i>
<i>stood their ground.</i>

671
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,137
Which one of you is king?

672
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,240
You have no reason
to challenge me.

673
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:10,045
Does this look
like a challenge, King?

674
00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:12,847
There are rules among lions.

675
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:14,849
Not anymore.

676
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:18,253
While you ruled this pride,
I've built my army.

677
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:19,854
Yours is the last pride

678
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:22,958
in the Valley of Kings,
which means

679
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:26,995
everything the light touches
belongs to me.

680
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,863
There will be one ruler.

681
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:31,466
One Lion King.

We have to move.
They'll be tracking us.

722
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:52,640
-Taka!
-What if you're wrong?

723
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:53,942
What if they're okay?

724
00:42:53,975 --> 00:42:56,511
They live in you now.

725
00:42:56,544 --> 00:42:58,213
Follow me, brother.

726
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:00,248
We have to move...

727
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,350
together.

728
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:28,543
Run, Mufasa.

729
00:43:29,477 --> 00:43:31,312
Run!

730
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:33,615
Hunters.

731
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:36,117
-What's the plan?
-Uh...

732
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:38,586
Run! Very fast!

733
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:45,360
This way!

734
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,376
Back to the trees.

735
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:03,244
We're trapped.
We have to swim.

736
00:44:03,278 --> 00:44:04,712
No, we have to fight.

737
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:06,414
If we fight, we die.

738
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:08,049
But if we swim, we drown.

739
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:10,251
Okay, I didn't
want to do this,

740
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:12,454
-but I command you to swim!
-You what?

741
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:15,290
You pledged your loyalty.
I command you to swim.

742
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:18,026
Taka, this is not the time
for jokes.

743
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:35,143
Which one of you
killed my son?

744
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:36,678
I did.
This lion with me is nothing

745
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:38,346
but a stray. Let him go.

746
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,248
Kiros, the other is no stray.

747
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:42,183
He holds the blood
of the pride.

748
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:46,154
The last blood
of the king? Hmm.

749
00:44:47,355 --> 00:44:50,191
Blood for blood.

750
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,775
They're coming!

751
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:09,677
What do we do?

752
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,246
We find the advantage?

753
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:12,247
What advantage?

754
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,583
We're on a rock
in the middle of the water!

755
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:18,353
Taka, this is it.
We go for the king.

756
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,097
Mufasa, I'm ready.

757
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,466
Just one last thing.

758
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:32,534
-What?
-Chin up!

759
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,470
Taka!

760
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:38,273
This was a bad idea.

761
00:45:46,882 --> 00:45:48,383
Mufasa!

762
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,584
Mufasa!

763
00:45:57,225 --> 00:45:58,426
-Mufasa...
-Yeah!

764
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,494
-We're alive.
-Ah!

765
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:01,696
I did it. I saved us.

766
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:06,134
You were saying?

767
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:36,464
Okay. Okay.

768
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,366
No... No more water.

769
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,535
Tell me you can track them
down river.

770
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:42,871
We can track them anywhere.

771
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:45,573
They can run,
but they can't hide.

772
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,444
So just to be clear,
we're not in this story?

773
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,745
It feels a little bit like

774
00:46:50,778 --> 00:46:52,815
Kiros is stealing
my thunder here.

775
00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:55,216
Yeah. You know,
I don't feel seen.

776
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,718
No. There's a lotta stories
with all of us.

777
00:46:56,751 --> 00:46:57,785
Tell one of those!

778
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,721
Can I make
one small suggestion?

779
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:02,523
Less childhood trauma,
more meerkat.

780
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:05,426
Rafiki, I know
who Taka's gonna be.

781
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,229
Oh. Me too. It's so obvious.

782
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:09,898
But maybe, just so we're on
the same page, tell me?

783
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:11,799
-Is it Simba? Is it me?
-Pumbaa.

784
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:13,768
Oh, wait. Am I Obasi?

785
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:14,837
That makes no sense.

786
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,170
But seriously,
I have one question.

787
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:19,540
Am I Taka?

788
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:23,311
♪ I did
it again, I did it again ♪

789
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:26,915
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your hide. Again!

790
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:29,584
As much as
it kills you to say it,

791
00:47:29,617 --> 00:47:31,352
let's hear a little,
"Thank you, Taka."

792
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:33,521
You want me
to thank you

793
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:35,323
for pushing me
off a waterfall?

794
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:37,659
Yes, and you're welcome.

795
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:38,861
Look, it's not my fault

796
00:47:38,894 --> 00:47:40,395
crocodiles are simply
attracted to you.

797
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:42,597
Don't...
Don't say that.

798
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:48,837
♪ I did
it again, I did it...

799
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:51,974
Mufasa.

800
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:53,942
Is it them?
Is it the Outsiders?

801
00:47:53,976 --> 00:47:55,978
No.
She's right there.

802
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:57,412
"She"?

803
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:01,516
There's no place to run.

804
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,284
We have your scent.

805
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,318
My scent?

806
00:48:04,352 --> 00:48:07,288
I've been stalking
you two all night.

807
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,857
That's not possible.

808
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:10,558
Then
why did I circle you

809
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:11,894
three times in this wood

810
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:14,295
while you two were
chasing each other's tails?

811
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:35,818
Uh... That's embarrassing.

812
00:48:35,851 --> 00:48:39,454
Yeah, well, I, uh,
meant to do that, so...

813
00:48:39,487 --> 00:48:41,422
Still think I'm afraid?

814
00:48:43,892 --> 00:48:45,259
Why are you
following us?

815
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:46,594
I was hoping to find my pride.

816
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:47,662
What happened to them?

817
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:49,031
The Outsiders
happened.

818
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:49,998
A few of us got away,

819
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:52,901
but you're the only
other lions I've seen.

820
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:55,403
You two better keep moving.

821
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:56,738
Wait! Please.

822
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,974
Um... My name is Taka.

823
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:01,977
Son of Obasi.

824
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,846
I know what it's like
to lose everything.

825
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:05,379
Come with us. We can help you.

826
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:06,982
I don't need any help.

827
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:09,417
But you don't have anyone.

828
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,054
She does indeed have someone.
Thank you very much.

829
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,555
That's Zazu. Don't eat him.

830
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,058
You heard her. Do not eat me.

831
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:19,027
As a recent addition
to the King's Royal Guard,

832
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:21,997
I must kindly ask you both
to move on.

833
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,932
Thank you for stopping by.

834
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:26,400
Your king hired a bird
to protect you?

835
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:28,036
How high can you fly?

836
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:30,873
-Mmm.
-Look, I needed a scout.

837
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:32,673
Zazu was the last option.

838
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,442
Well, next to last.

839
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,444
Between Albert the Iguana
and I,

840
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:40,048
His Majesty decided
on the underling with wings.

841
00:49:40,082 --> 00:49:43,018
And thus, I became
the lead scout
for the princess.

842
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:44,719
It's my third day,
going swimmingly,

843
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:45,988
if I may say so myself.

844
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:47,156
Sarabi, you can
say so as well.

845
00:49:47,189 --> 00:49:49,357
How far do you think
you'll get with a bird?

846
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,392
How far do you two geniuses
think you'll get

847
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:53,394
stumbling around,
running into each other?

848
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:55,463
All the way to <i>Milele.</i>

849
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,431
<i>-Milele</i> is nothing but a myth.
-It's not a myth.

850
00:49:57,465 --> 00:49:59,567
Circle of Life
and fairy tale herds.

851
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,635
-You're chasing something...
-Honestly.

852
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:01,702
-...that doesn't exist.
-As If.

853
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:04,405
I don't know that <i>Milele</i>
exists, but right now,

854
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:05,673
it's the only hope we have.

855
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:08,576
We don't need hope.
We need food.

856
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:12,114
Um...
Good job, brother.

857
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:14,082
Oh, real nice.

858
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:16,684
There's trouble in the trees.
My first real trouble,

859
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:18,352
and I am going to pass.
Not going.

860
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:19,822
I am staying right here,
thank you.

861
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:23,624
Come on, Sarabi. Looks like
there's dinner headed our way.

862
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:25,760
Sarabi, if I may.

863
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:28,831
He makes a valid point,
Your Highness.

864
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:30,765
But, on the other hand,
he's a starving lion,

865
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:32,700
he wants to eat me,
so I am slightly torn.

866
00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:38,106
I think that went quite well,
all things considered.

867
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,752
<i>And now, Kiara,</i>
<i>this is where I come in.</i>

868
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:02,164
Rafiki.

869
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:05,033
Order! We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

870
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:07,102
Tonight, a cheetah
came into our trees

871
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,736
for the third night in a row.

872
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:10,138
Almost took one of our own.

873
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,572
It was Rafiki's fault.

874
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,674
He summoned the beast
with his dreams.

875
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:14,943
Rafiki
and his visions

876
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:17,112
must be banished
once and for all.

877
00:51:17,145 --> 00:51:18,579
Rafiki tried to warn you.

878
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:20,182
His dreams
conjure our enemies.

879
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:22,483
He talks to the spirits,
summons the devil.

880
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:23,551
What are you talking about?

881
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:24,552
He's done it before.

882
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,822
His brother was chased
from these very trees,

883
00:51:26,855 --> 00:51:28,056
never to be seen again.

884
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,557
Rafiki was just a child.

885
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,027
A child born with a leg that
does not work.

886
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,095
Yet somehow, he survived?

887
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:35,864
It was Rafiki who found water
in the dry season.

888
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:38,466
Who healed you, Inaki,
when you were sick.

889
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:41,669
He speaks to the insects,
converses with the moon.

890
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:43,105
Zala, you know
what will happen

891
00:51:43,138 --> 00:51:44,772
if you send him
down from the trees.

892
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:46,741
He is <i>amelaaniwa!</i>

893
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:47,876
A curse to us all.

894
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,944
That's not true.

895
00:51:48,977 --> 00:51:49,912
He doesn't
belong here.

896
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:53,581
All in favor of banishment,
cover one eye.

897
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:54,782
How can you
trust him?

898
00:51:54,816 --> 00:51:56,818
Don't trust him,
and I don't trust his magic!

899
00:51:56,852 --> 00:51:57,953
He doesn't
belong here.

900
00:51:57,986 --> 00:51:59,855
He's not a baboon.
And he never will be.

901
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:01,522
He's not one of us.

902
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:03,624
And so, it is time.

903
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:04,893
No, wait.

904
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:07,029
Where will you go?

905
00:52:07,062 --> 00:52:09,697
Where I should have gone
long ago.

906
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,766
To find all that was lost.

907
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,668
My family.

908
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,904
You can't survive on your own.

909
00:52:15,938 --> 00:52:17,505
Nobody can.

910
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:19,841
And yet, here we are.

911
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,145
Oh, Rafiki.

912
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:27,748
The eye never forgets
what the heart has seen.

913
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:49,470
It's all right.

914
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:16,497
Hmm. <i>Jamaa.</i>

915
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:18,766
Hmm.

916
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:26,674
You can try to run, but I'm
afraid you won't get very far.

917
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:28,542
And why would I run from you?

918
00:53:29,144 --> 00:53:31,213
Because we're lions.

919
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:34,116
As in... lions!

920
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:36,751
A flea
can trouble a lion

921
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:38,719
more than a lion
can trouble a flea.

922
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:41,589
I don't think you understand
what's about to happen.

923
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:43,125
There's no place
for you to go.

924
00:53:43,158 --> 00:53:45,093
I am going forward.

925
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:46,761
I seriously doubt that.

926
00:53:46,794 --> 00:53:50,731
It is easy to doubt everything
when you know nothing.

927
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:52,934
Can we get on
with this, please?

928
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:56,304
If you take my life,
you will never find <i>Milele.</i>

929
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:58,240
Wait, did you say <i>Milele?</i>

930
00:53:58,273 --> 00:54:01,243
That is where I'm going.
Toward the light.

931
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:05,080
I have been there many times
in my dreams.

932
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:07,215
My brother waits for me there.

933
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:08,817
I've seen the tree.

934
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,952
Can picture it. The two of us,

935
00:54:10,986 --> 00:54:12,686
together again.

936
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,090
And why would anyone trust
a baboon's dream?

937
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:17,625
Sometimes, a dream
is all you have.

938
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:20,062
The only truth
that lives in you.

939
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:22,763
Like the memory
of a great king.

940
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:24,032
How did you know?

941
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:27,802
Okay. Help us get to <i>Milele,</i>
and we will let you live.

942
00:54:27,836 --> 00:54:29,603
-Do we have a deal?
-No.

943
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:30,872
What? Why?

944
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:34,009
Rafiki will let you live.

945
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,244
I've had enough of this!

946
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:38,113
Taka, do not eat him.

947
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:39,848
Wonderful.
Another misfit stray

948
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,216
we're not supposed to eat.

949
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:44,019
So, you expect us
to follow this baboon

950
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:47,089
to a place nobody
has ever seen?

951
00:54:47,122 --> 00:54:49,825
-I'll be better off alone.
<i>-Hhe ntombazane.</i>

952
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:52,294
A single stick may smoke,

953
00:54:52,327 --> 00:54:54,229
but it will never burn.

954
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:59,067
Okay, now that
there's five of us,

955
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:00,135
why don't we all go around

956
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,870
and say a fun fact
about ourselves?

957
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:02,871
I'll go first.

958
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:06,108
I once had
a crush on a flamingo.

959
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:08,776
I've never
said that out loud.

960
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,945
And they're walking away.

961
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:11,913
Yeah, places to go,
kingdoms to see.

962
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:13,381
We're busy. Let's hustle.

963
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,061
Wait, wait, wait. Now you're
the star of this thing?

964
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:28,864
Someone's a little tired
of bein' second banana, huh?

965
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:31,233
All of a sudden, there's
a lotta Rafiki in this story.

966
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:33,201
You even gave yourself
a long-lost brother.

967
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:34,269
-Yeah.
-What's next?

968
00:55:34,302 --> 00:55:35,570
A funny catchphrase?

969
00:55:35,604 --> 00:55:37,372
You gonna be fartin' next?
'Cause that's my thing.

970
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:40,008
You cannot tell the story
of Mufasa

971
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:42,710
without the story of Rafiki.

972
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:44,079
Oh, now he's even
talkin' about himself

973
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,046
in the third person.

974
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,314
Pretty soon, he'll have
his own fragrance.

975
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:49,117
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

976
00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:50,886
It's called
"Pumbaa by Pumbaa,"

977
00:55:50,919 --> 00:55:53,321
and from what I hear,
it's pretty gross.

978
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:55,924
Mom? Dad?

979
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:58,260
If you can hear me, come home.

980
00:55:59,227 --> 00:56:00,862
Please.

981
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:03,198
Come home.

982
00:56:09,905 --> 00:56:10,906
Mother?

983
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,209
Mother?

984
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:20,048
<i>Milele.</i>

985
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:21,983
Mother!

986
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:41,469
-Rafiki.
<i>-Ayi suka.</i>

987
00:56:41,503 --> 00:56:43,338
-What are you doing?
-I am fishing.

988
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:46,041
You're sitting on
a rock with your eyes closed.

989
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:49,377
My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

990
00:56:49,411 --> 00:56:52,013
Why am I talking to a baboon?

991
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:55,951
I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

992
00:56:55,984 --> 00:56:58,853
No offense,
but a monkey is a monkey.

993
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:00,322
And a stray
is a stray.

994
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:01,423
What's that supposed to mean?

995
00:57:01,456 --> 00:57:03,858
It means
we are very much the same.

996
00:57:03,892 --> 00:57:05,260
<i>Siyafana.</i>

997
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:07,162
We are nothing alike.

998
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:10,432
Take a good look. I am a lion.

999
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,267
A lion
who fears water,

1000
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,336
fears his own reflection.

1001
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:16,171
Who can't sleep
because of what he sees

1002
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:18,039
when he closes his eyes.

1003
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:19,174
Huh?

1004
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:22,210
You are afraid
of your dreams, Mufasa.

1005
00:57:22,244 --> 00:57:24,346
Afraid of what
you see in them.

1006
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:26,915
I see my parents.

1007
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:29,818
I feel them everywhere.

1008
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:31,486
Of course
you do, Mufasa.

1009
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,156
You will feel them forever.

1010
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,460
My mother, I hear her voice.

1011
00:57:38,493 --> 00:57:42,397
She tells me that we are
on a journey to <i>Milele,</i>

1012
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,867
but I feel so lost
without her.

1013
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,371
Your journey
is not a dream, Mufasa.

1014
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:51,439
Your mother is guiding you,

1015
00:57:51,473 --> 00:57:54,976
and where you are going,
a family awaits.

1016
00:57:57,846 --> 00:58:03,018
<i>Ah... Ni heshima</i>
<i>kukutana nawe, binamu.</i>

1017
00:58:03,051 --> 00:58:06,955
<i>Nenda kwa amani.</i>
<i>Ah...</i>

1018
00:58:07,856 --> 00:58:08,990
What are you doing?

1019
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:10,492
We're starving.

1020
00:58:10,525 --> 00:58:12,227
'Twas not its time.

1021
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,964
Instead, the fish has agreed
to let us share the water.

1022
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:25,240
<i>Iketle Rafiki.</i>
<i>Iketle mosimane.</i>

1023
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:27,375
I have a report.

1024
00:58:28,076 --> 00:58:29,177
It's morning.

1025
00:58:29,944 --> 00:58:31,446
End of report.

1026
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:42,123
The earth divided
is now a choice.

1027
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:43,892
Around or down?

1028
00:58:43,925 --> 00:58:46,027
The decision is yours.

1029
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,131
Mmm.

1030
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:53,001
Look out there,
beyond the light.

1031
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:56,471
Across the deepest canyon.

1032
00:58:57,972 --> 00:59:00,008
"Across the deepest canyon."

1033
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:01,476
We should go down.

1034
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:04,346
Why? Because of some
fairy tale?

1035
00:59:04,379 --> 00:59:05,980
The rocks
will hide our tracks.

1036
00:59:06,014 --> 00:59:07,482
It's safer to go around.

1037
00:59:07,515 --> 00:59:09,150
I picked up their scents.

1038
00:59:09,184 --> 00:59:11,886
The only thing you picked up
is a hallucinating baboon.

1039
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,088
I am a mandrill.

1040
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,522
This is a waste of time.

1041
00:59:14,556 --> 00:59:16,091
Close your eyes.

1042
00:59:16,524 --> 00:59:17,625
What?

1043
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:20,528
Tell me what you see.
What you feel.

1044
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:22,163
There's nothing on the wind.

1045
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:23,331
No, they're moving

1046
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:24,666
-through the bush willow.
-They, who?

1047
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:27,902
The females, out front.
Come on.

1048
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:30,071
Clear your thoughts.
Concentrate.

1049
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:32,140
I am concentrating.

1050
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:45,086
He's right.

1051
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,323
We have to go down.

1052
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:50,225
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

1053
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:52,360
<i>Ah! Uyabona mfana.</i>

1054
00:59:52,394 --> 00:59:55,964
Now the many sticks
will make fire as one.

1055
00:59:55,997 --> 00:59:58,633
Come on. We have places to go.

1056
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:01,169
And kingdoms to see.

1057

1124
01:02:50,705 --> 01:02:53,207
Kiros. They are not alone.

1125
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:55,143
They've collected a lioness.

1126
01:02:55,176 --> 01:02:57,412
And a monkey.

1127
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:08,623
Mufasa.

1128
01:03:08,656 --> 01:03:10,625
Mufasa.
You have to help me.

1129
01:03:10,658 --> 01:03:11,726
Help you how?

1130
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:13,328
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

1131
01:03:13,361 --> 01:03:15,530
She is the light
my mother spoke of.

1132
01:03:15,563 --> 01:03:17,265
-What?
-She's special.

1133
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:19,801
The most amazing female
I've ever met in my life.

1134
01:03:19,835 --> 01:03:21,269
I don't know
what to say to her.

1135
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:23,204
You've spent your life
with females.

1136
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:25,239
Please, tell me what to say.

1137
01:03:25,273 --> 01:03:27,542
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

1138
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:28,811
No, Mufasa.

1139
01:03:28,844 --> 01:03:29,878
You don't
understand.

1140
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:31,779
Myself isn't good enough.

1141
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:33,414
You...

1142
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,316
just know things.

1143
01:03:36,184 --> 01:03:38,252
Fine. Fine.

1144
01:03:38,286 --> 01:03:40,856
Keep it simple.
Ask her a question.

1145
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:43,826
Right. A question.
This... This is good.

1146
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:47,662
Yeah, try to be confident.
Disinterested.

1147
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:49,397
But I'm very interested.

1148
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,734
-Tell her about the flowers.
-What flowers?

1149
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:56,437
The valley she comes from.
There's flowers everywhere.

1150
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:58,539
They're called duck flowers.

1151
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,375
Long stems.

1152
01:04:00,408 --> 01:04:02,543
It's absolutely beautiful.

1153
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:04,278
How do you know that?

1154
01:04:04,312 --> 01:04:07,816
When she passes,
I can smell them on her fur.

1155
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,384
Okay.

1156
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:11,719
Flowers. Disinterested.

1157
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:13,254
-Flowers. And disinterested.
-And here's the most

1158
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:14,656
-important thing, okay?
-Flowers.

1159
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:15,723
-And disinterested.
-Listen...

1160
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:17,725
-Flowers and disinterested.
-...when she speaks.

1161
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:18,894
Males have trouble
with that one.

1162
01:04:18,927 --> 01:04:19,794
Flowers...

1163
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:22,597
Sorry.
What did you say?

1164
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:25,533
Really?

1165
01:04:26,334 --> 01:04:28,469
I heard you, brother.

1166
01:04:28,503 --> 01:04:30,304
I'm gonna make you proud.

1167
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:44,385
It's very hot,
isn't it?

1168
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:45,420
Yep.

1169
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:49,892
I...
I love listening.

1170
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:51,325
Okay.

1171
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,327
-I'm listening right now.
-To what?

1172
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:54,395
What you just said.

1173
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:55,463
You're the one that's talking.

1174
01:04:55,496 --> 01:04:56,497
I am.

1175
01:04:57,732 --> 01:04:59,434
-You smell like a duck.
-What?

1176
01:04:59,467 --> 01:05:00,501
Flower.

1177
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:02,938
Uh... A duck flower.

1178
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:05,306
How do you know
about those flowers?

1179
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,541
I, uh...

1180
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:08,543
Well, I inhaled you
with my nose.

1181
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:10,278
I can smell them.

1182
01:05:10,311 --> 01:05:12,915
That's amazing.

1183
01:05:12,948 --> 01:05:15,283
Our valley was
full of those flowers,

1184
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:18,286
thousands of them
as far as the eye could see.

1185
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:22,024
It was... It was the most
beautiful place, Taka.

1186
01:05:22,057 --> 01:05:24,358
Did he just say
she smells like a duck?

1187
01:05:24,392 --> 01:05:26,794
And you call me a baboon?

1188
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,644
They shouldn't be here.

1189
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:45,379
The migration patterns
are broken.

1190
01:05:45,413 --> 01:05:46,882
-I... I don't understand...
-Outsiders!

1191
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:49,617
This is not a drill!
Just to be clear,

1192
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:52,487
I never signed up for this.

1193
01:05:54,322 --> 01:05:56,324
It's okay. We're safe.

1194
01:05:56,357 --> 01:05:57,658
They're on the other side.

1195
01:05:58,493 --> 01:05:59,594
Nope!

1196
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:01,295
They can just jump across!

1197
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:02,797
We are trapped!

1198
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:04,032
What do we do?

1199
01:06:04,066 --> 01:06:05,666
The elephants
will fight with us.

1200
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,801
And why would they do that?

1201
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:09,470
Because I'm going to ask them.

1202
01:06:09,504 --> 01:06:11,739
Got a better idea?

1203
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:13,909
Yes,
Mr. Ask-Questions-First.

1204
01:06:13,942 --> 01:06:14,977
Get ready to run.

1205
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,644
Uh...

1206
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,046
Where is she going?

1207
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,049
Hello? Listen to me, please.
We need your help.

1208
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:22,550
Can you talk with me?

1209
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,886
We need your help. Please.

1210
01:06:25,486 --> 01:06:26,754
They're coming!

1211
01:06:27,622 --> 01:06:29,858
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait!

1212
01:06:29,892 --> 01:06:32,493
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait. Wait!
Where is she going?

1213
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:36,531
She's going for the hive!

1214
01:06:36,564 --> 01:06:39,968
Like I said, get ready to run!

1215
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,447
Run!

1216
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:55,516
Get to the trees!

1217
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:59,387
Why am I running?

1218
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:28,416
Uh, Your Highness,
hold on!

1219
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:31,019
Zazu!

1220
01:07:39,594 --> 01:07:40,996
Sarabi!

1221
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:56,611
Stand your ground!

1222
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:58,113
Do not retreat!

1223
01:08:16,031 --> 01:08:17,866
I got you.

1224
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:20,002
I got you.

1225
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:22,637
Oh, Sarabi, I got you.

1226
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:32,780
That's right.
Run along, little kitty cats.

1227
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:37,585
Thank you, my friend.

1228
01:08:48,496 --> 01:08:50,999
Ah!

1229
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,704
Over here.

1230
01:09:02,945 --> 01:09:04,645
Ah...

1231
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:07,615
Mmm...

1232
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:13,989
<i>Vuta Pumzi.</i> Sarabi.

1233
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:22,496
Alive. She's alive!

1234
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:29,570
Why are you all looking at me?

1235
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:31,840
You were thrown from the tree.

1236
01:09:31,873 --> 01:09:34,009
He saved your life.

1237
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:37,145
-Who?
-Taka.

1238
01:09:37,179 --> 01:09:39,848
-Uh...
-Taka saved you.

1239
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,782
Isn't that right, brother?

1240
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,855
You saved me?

1241
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:50,192
Uh... Well, I...
I had to do something.

1242
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:51,559
Thank you.

1243
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:54,162
We're lucky.

1244
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,697
Those bees
almost killed us all.

1245
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:58,300
Those bees saved our lives.

1246
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,968
-Oh, Mufasa.
-Really?

1247
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:02,838
Because, uh, it felt like
an elephant stampede.

1248
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:03,905
We're alive, aren't we?

1249
01:10:03,939 --> 01:10:05,173
The elephants
would have fought with us.

1250
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:06,540
We're lions.

1251
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:07,876
Nobody will fight with us.

1252
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:09,677
Not out here.

1253
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:10,745

01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,817
Well, the Outsiders come
from many prides.

1264
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,353
But, when they are born,
they are hated

1265
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:54,322
because they are different
from their tribe.

1266
01:10:54,356 --> 01:10:55,957
Like you and your tribe?

1267
01:10:55,991 --> 01:10:57,758
Yes, just like me.

1268
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:00,028
-But, Rafiki?
-Yes?

1269
01:11:00,062 --> 01:11:02,230
Why do they wanna
hurt everybody?

1270
01:11:02,264 --> 01:11:06,201
Sometimes, when the people
most like you don't love you,

1271
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:09,838
it is a hurt that can cause
the greatest pain.

1272
01:11:09,871 --> 01:11:11,239
And this pain

1273
01:11:11,273 --> 01:11:14,876
can lead you
to hate everything.

1274
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,678
I'm glad that didn't happen
to you, Rafiki.

1275
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:20,148
Yes, my child. I'm glad too.

1276
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:22,750
Um, hi. We're here, too.

1277
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:24,886
Yeah, why are you leavin' us
outside this story

1278
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,655
when I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outsiders.

1279
01:11:27,688 --> 01:11:28,722
-Come on!
-Yeah,

1280
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:29,958
we've always
been misunderstood.

1281
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:31,259
I contain multitudes.

1282
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:39,800
There are many ways to <i>Milele.</i>

1283
01:11:40,701 --> 01:11:42,904
But this will be ours.

1284
01:11:51,046 --> 01:11:54,049
<i>Go. Go, Mufasa.</i>

1285
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:55,951
<i>Find your forever.</i>

1286
01:11:57,152 --> 01:11:59,020
<i>I got you.</i>

1287
01:11:59,054 --> 01:12:01,289
Oh, Sarabi, I got you.

1288
01:12:04,758 --> 01:12:06,760
Mmm.

1289
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:11,799
<i>Iketle Rafiki.</i>
<i>Iketle mosimane.</i>

1290
01:12:13,068 --> 01:12:14,402
Mmm...

1291
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:22,710
Hey, Rafiki?

1292
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:24,745
What are you doing?

1293
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:28,150
I am confirming
my vision, Mufasa.

1294
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:33,221
Can I ask you
something, Rafiki?

1295
01:12:33,255 --> 01:12:34,089
Hmm?

1296
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:37,159
How many of your visions
have come true?

1297
01:12:37,192 --> 01:12:39,895
-So far, none.
-None?

1298
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:43,198
But it's not what I see.
It's what I feel.

1299
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:45,267
But how do you...

1300
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,336
How do you know when
you should follow a feeling?

1301
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,738
<i>Milele</i> exists.

1302
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:53,375
I feel it in here.

1303
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:54,976
The question is,

1304
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,312
what do you feel, Mufasa,

1305
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,015
in there?

1306
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:20,801
The weather's shifted.

1307
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:22,904
There's not enough fresh snow.

1308
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:25,073
Hey, if the Outsiders
find our tracks,

1309
01:13:25,106 --> 01:13:27,175
they'll follow them to <i>Milele.</i>

1310
01:13:27,209 --> 01:13:29,878
Zazu, only you can
help us now.

1311
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:31,913
Oh. Are you quite sure
about that?

1312
01:13:31,947 --> 01:13:33,048
No, I was actually thinking

1313
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:34,983
that Rafiki looks pretty
handy, and with the stick...

1314
01:13:35,016 --> 01:13:36,318
Zazu, you can use your wings

1315
01:13:36,351 --> 01:13:38,186
to cover our tracks
as we head up the mountain

1316
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,821
without leaving a trace.

1317
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:41,823
Hey, you can do this.

1318
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:43,892
Oh, hmm. Yeah.

1319
01:13:43,925 --> 01:13:46,027
Yes, sir. You're right.
I've got this.

1320
01:13:49,797 --> 01:13:52,200
Okay. It's just me against
a frozen mountain.

1321
01:13:52,234 --> 01:13:55,003
You know, one hornbill charged
with saving the future...

1322
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:56,905
Whoa! Mummy!

1323
01:13:57,973 --> 01:14:01,042
Oh, man alive,
that's cold.

1324
01:14:14,522 --> 01:14:16,790
Now what's happening?

1325
01:14:16,825 --> 01:14:18,960
We can't keep stopping.

1326
01:14:18,994 --> 01:14:21,396
Somehow, they have
covered their tracks.

1327
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:23,398
In the snow?

1328
01:14:23,431 --> 01:14:24,499
It's not possible.

1329
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:27,168
Majesty, they could be
anywhere on this mountain...

1330
01:14:27,202 --> 01:14:28,336
Then find them!

1331
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,404
Now.

1332
01:14:30,305 --> 01:14:31,573
♪ <i>Zazu, Zazu, Zazu♪</i>

1333

♪ <i>Zazu, Zazu!♪</i>

1334
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:40,048
I have a report.

1335
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:43,018
The Outsiders
are completely lost.

1336
01:14:43,051 --> 01:14:44,219
Well played, Mufasa.

1337
01:14:44,252 --> 01:14:45,487
Great job, Zazu.

1338
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,821
And as per usual.

1339
01:14:46,855 --> 01:14:48,156
I knew
you could do it.

1340
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:50,892
We did it. We did it.

1341
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:53,128
No, you did it.

1342
01:14:53,161 --> 01:14:55,063
Great thinking, Mufasa.

1343
01:14:55,096 --> 01:14:56,398
Oh, we're all
rubbing off on each other.

1344
01:14:56,431 --> 01:14:57,832
Perfectly normal thing to do.

1345
01:14:57,866 --> 01:14:59,534
Who wants to rub against Zazu?

1346
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:01,303
No one. I'm leaving now.

1347
01:15:01,336 --> 01:15:03,204
I'll scout ahead.

1348
01:15:10,945 --> 01:15:13,415
Ah.

1349
01:15:17,485 --> 01:15:19,187
I got you, Rafiki.

1350
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,889
-Hey.
-I got you.

1351
01:15:20,922 --> 01:15:22,023
<i>Ho monate,</i> Mufasa.

1352
01:15:22,057 --> 01:15:23,224
Yeah, I got you.

1353
01:15:26,895 --> 01:15:29,297
Mufasa...

1354
01:15:30,665 --> 01:15:32,167
"I got you."

1355
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,384
Hidden in the shadows,
downwind, light of foot.

1356
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,920
Interesting hunting style,
Mufasa.

1357
01:15:51,953 --> 01:15:53,388
We have to eat something

1358
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:55,256
before we take on
that descent.

1359
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,492
Unfortunately, there's
nothing to hunt up here.

1360
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:58,960
See under that rock?

1361
01:15:58,993 --> 01:16:01,396
There's a civet
about to leave his den.

1362
01:16:01,429 --> 01:16:03,231
Of course
you can smell

1363
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:04,599
a civet hidden in the snow.

1364
01:16:04,632 --> 01:16:07,936
You, the lion
who can do anything.

1365
01:16:07,969 --> 01:16:09,938
What's that
supposed to mean?

1366
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:13,007
It means I see you, Mufasa.

1367
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,642
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1368
01:16:14,676 --> 01:16:16,244
Now, that part, I believe.

1369
01:16:16,277 --> 01:16:18,947
Because, smart as you are,

1370
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,616
you have a way of seeing
everything but yourself.

1371
01:16:21,649 --> 01:16:23,318
What is this?

1372
01:16:23,351 --> 01:16:24,953
What is this, Sarabi?

1373
01:16:24,986 --> 01:16:26,554
There is a civet in the snow

1374
01:16:26,588 --> 01:16:28,323
right where you said
it would be.

1375
01:16:28,356 --> 01:16:30,392
And you smelled the Outsiders
on the wind,

1376
01:16:30,425 --> 01:16:32,961
which means you're the one who
smelled the flowers on my fur.

1377
01:16:32,994 --> 01:16:33,995
It was a lucky guess.

1378
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:36,398
You can smell the exact flower
from my valley.

1379
01:16:36,431 --> 01:16:38,433
No,
that's not possible.

1380
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:40,068
You saved me.

1381
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:42,570
Held me, covered me in the
stampede, comforted me.

1382
01:16:42,604 --> 01:16:43,705
No, it was Taka.

1383
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:46,007
"I got you.
I got you, Sarabi."

1384
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,243
-I'm here to protect him.
-That was you.

1385
01:16:48,276 --> 01:16:50,311
I was lost in the water,
and he found me.

1386
01:16:50,345 --> 01:16:51,246
My brother saved me.

1387
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:53,181
Ah, I sensed it
from the beginning.

1388
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:55,216
His blood is the blood
of the king.

1389
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,284
Mufasa.

1390
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:58,420
-That is his destiny.
-No!

1391
01:16:58,453 --> 01:17:00,555
His destiny was to save you.

1392
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:06,161

to eat on this mountain

1471
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:17,438
until now.

1472
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,876
Tell me, how did you cover
your tracks in the snow?

1473
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:22,577
A bird helped us.

1474
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:25,513
Lions getting help
from a bird?

1475
01:22:25,546 --> 01:22:28,416
Just as I will help you.

1476
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:30,018
You will help us?

1477
01:22:30,052 --> 01:22:33,021
You think we need help
from a wounded coward?

1478
01:22:33,055 --> 01:22:37,325
I may hold the blood
of a king,

1479
01:22:37,358 --> 01:22:42,965
but it was Mufasa
who killed your son.

1480
01:22:42,998 --> 01:22:45,366
It was Mufasa

1481
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:47,435
who trapped you up here,

1482
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:50,705
outsmarted you at every turn.

1483
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:54,642
Now I will lead you to him
and to <i>Milele.</i>

1484
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:56,812
<i>Milele!</i>

1485
01:22:56,845 --> 01:23:01,649
<i>Milele</i> is nothing but a dream,
a vision sold to cubs.

1486
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:04,685
Ah. Well,
tell that to the monkey.

1487
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,721
He leads them to it.

1488
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:08,322
Look at you.

1489
01:23:08,356 --> 01:23:11,459
A pack of starving wolves

1490
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:13,694
clinging to the side
of a mountain.

1491
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:15,530
No tracks to follow.

1492
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:20,002
Only one chance at revenge.

1493
01:23:21,136 --> 01:23:22,336
Me!

1494
01:23:23,839 --> 01:23:24,973
Revenge...

1495
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:29,011
What about your father?

1496
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:31,712
Because of Mufasa,

1497
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,049
I have no father.

1498
01:23:35,716 --> 01:23:36,952
He did this.

1499
01:23:39,453 --> 01:23:40,655
Yes.

1500
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:42,390
You lost a father,

1501
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:45,393
and I, a son.

1502
01:23:45,426 --> 01:23:47,863
Taka, will you join us?

1503
01:23:49,463 --> 01:23:52,667
Together, we can both
have our revenge.

1504
01:23:55,503 --> 01:23:57,105
It will be my pleasure...

1505
01:23:59,574 --> 01:24:00,641
King.

1506
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:25,700
Taka!

1507
01:24:26,935 --> 01:24:28,436
Taka, where have you been?

1508
01:24:29,604 --> 01:24:30,939
Hunting.

1509
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:32,841
I couldn't find anything,

1510
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,742
but I was never
as good as you.

1511
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:36,912
Or my mother.

1512
01:24:39,447 --> 01:24:40,514
There's something I need
to tell you.

1513
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:41,950
No.

1514
01:24:41,984 --> 01:24:44,887
There's something
I need to tell you.

1515
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,787
I need to thank you.

1516
01:24:46,822 --> 01:24:49,858
You kept your word
to Eshe and Obasi.

1517
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:51,960
-Taka...
-You saved me, Mufasa.

1518
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:54,662
And I...

1519
01:24:54,695 --> 01:24:59,101
will never forget
what you've done, my brother.

1520
01:25:01,636 --> 01:25:04,672
Oh, guys!
I have found a way down

1521
01:25:04,705 --> 01:25:06,507
just beyond those near peaks.

1522
01:25:07,876 --> 01:25:09,410
Was it something I said?

1523
01:25:20,088 --> 01:25:21,189
Hey, Rafiki?

1524
01:25:21,223 --> 01:25:23,091
Yes.

1525
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,827
We are nearing
destiny, Mufasa.

1526
01:25:25,861 --> 01:25:28,629
And so, the earth must shake.

1527
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:50,785
Okay, now I am
100 million percent sure

1528
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:51,853
who Taka is.

1529
01:25:51,887 --> 01:25:52,955
Just be honest. Is it me?

1530
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:55,656
In case you missed it,
we're not featured in this.

1531
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,159
I think the civet has more
screen time.

1532
01:25:57,192 --> 01:25:58,759
Hey, maybe they'll put us
in the play.

1533
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:00,262
No, no, please don't
mention the play again.

1534
01:26:00,295 --> 01:26:01,997
I went to see it.
I'm nothing

1535
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,165
but a giant sock puppet.

1536
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:04,732
You went to see it?
You didn't bring me?

1537
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:07,768
Rafiki, Mufasa and Sarabi
are in love?

1538
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:09,737
Love?

1539
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,039
That sounds gross
and not something like

1540
01:26:11,073 --> 01:26:13,008
I constantly
think about and really want.

1541
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:14,775
What is Taka gonna do to them?

1542
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:18,113
Little one,
Taka's heart was broken.

1543
01:26:18,146 --> 01:26:21,049
And now his trap was set.

1544
01:26:36,932 --> 01:26:39,201
Mufasa. Do you see?

1545
01:26:39,234 --> 01:26:41,569
I don't believe it.

1546
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:43,071
The other side
of the light.

1547
01:26:43,804 --> 01:26:44,806
Home.

1548
01:26:45,673 --> 01:26:47,541
<i>Milele.</i>

1549
01:27:37,993 --> 01:27:38,994
I can't believe it.

1550
01:27:39,928 --> 01:27:43,631
We found it. We found <i>Milele.</i>

1551
01:27:43,664 --> 01:27:45,267
Yes.

1552
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,971
You found it, brother.
You always do.

1553
01:28:29,811 --> 01:28:30,846
Rafiki.

1554
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,383
This is the tree
from your visions.

1555
01:28:37,452 --> 01:28:40,055
I have seen this tree
many times,

1556
01:28:40,088 --> 01:28:43,859
and, in each vision,
there was always a brother

1557
01:28:43,892 --> 01:28:45,693
standing right here.

1558
01:28:45,726 --> 01:28:47,262
But there's
no one here, Rafiki,

1559
01:28:47,295 --> 01:28:50,866
and you came here
to find your twin.

1560
01:28:50,899 --> 01:28:53,301
He was taken from me long ago.

1561
01:28:53,335 --> 01:28:56,770
What I saw in my dreams
was a brother.

1562
01:28:56,804 --> 01:28:58,807
Standing right here.

1563
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,709
A friend, family.

1564
01:29:01,742 --> 01:29:03,411
What I saw was you.

1565
01:29:03,445 --> 01:29:05,147
The unseeable.

1566
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:07,849
I saw Mufasa.

1567
01:29:07,883 --> 01:29:08,984
Me?

1568
01:29:09,017 --> 01:29:10,986
Yes, you.

1569
01:29:11,019 --> 01:29:12,686
My brother.

1570
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:19,895
Mufasa.

1571
01:29:19,928 --> 01:29:21,363
How do you know who I am?

1572
01:29:21,396 --> 01:29:23,265
We know the Outsiders
are hunting you,

1573
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:25,333
and we fear
you'll bring danger.

1574
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:27,836
No. No. We covered our tracks.

1575
01:29:27,869 --> 01:29:29,971
I promise you
<i>Milele</i> is a safe place,

1576
01:29:30,005 --> 01:29:32,740
and I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

1577
01:29:35,776 --> 01:29:38,779
Do not run.

1578
01:29:38,813 --> 01:29:40,949
You have nothing to fear.

1579
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:43,151
We are not here for you.

1580
01:29:43,185 --> 01:29:46,354
We have come for Mufasa.

1581
01:29:46,388 --> 01:29:48,823
Oh, no, no.
How did they get here?

1582
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:52,027
Do not let him divide us.

1583
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:00,701
It's no use, Mufasa.
The Circle...

1584
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:04,772
The Circle is broken.

1585
01:30:04,806 --> 01:30:05,840
No!

1586
01:30:05,874 --> 01:30:07,342
Mufasa, what are you doing?

1587
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,743
I'm going to fight,
and I'm going to show them

1588
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:11,279
that they can fight, too.

1589
01:30:11,313 --> 01:30:13,315
Rafiki, when you hear
my signal,

1590
01:30:13,348 --> 01:30:14,416
help me call them together.

1591
01:30:14,449 --> 01:30:15,884
Yes, my brother.

1592
01:30:17,552 --> 01:30:19,854
There are
other lions here.

1593
01:30:19,888 --> 01:30:21,089
Find them.

1594
01:30:21,122 --> 01:30:23,191
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

1595
01:30:24,526 --> 01:30:26,361
Mufasa, you're not alone.

1596
01:30:26,394 --> 01:30:28,964
It's my turn to go
ask questions first.

1597
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:46,181
This is where the hunt ends,
Mufasa.

1598
01:30:47,182 --> 01:30:48,950
Thanks to your brother.

1599
01:30:48,984 --> 01:30:51,386
He left a trail of scars
for us to follow.

1600
01:30:51,419 --> 01:30:53,555
He made a deal
to save himself.

1601
01:30:53,588 --> 01:30:56,491
-Gave us this kingdom.
-Tell me he's lying.

1602
01:30:56,524 --> 01:30:58,260
Asked us to kill the stray.

1603
01:30:58,293 --> 01:30:59,527
Taka, please!

1604
01:30:59,561 --> 01:31:02,230
I'm the son of a king.

1605
01:31:02,264 --> 01:31:04,366
But Sarabi chose you.

1606
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:06,001
Just like Mother.

1607
01:31:06,034 --> 01:31:08,336
Just like my own father.

1608
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:11,840
I saved you
and you betrayed me!

1609
01:31:11,873 --> 01:31:13,341
What have you done?

1610
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:15,210
I'm your brother,
fight with me!

1611
01:31:15,243 --> 01:31:18,046
You stole my destiny.

1612
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:19,780
Now this is yours.

1613
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:23,318
He's one of us now.

1614
01:31:23,952 --> 01:31:25,786
My son's name...

1615
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:28,023
was Shaju.

1616
01:31:29,024 --> 01:31:31,059
Shaju!

1617
01:31:31,092 --> 01:31:33,228
All of this
should have been his.

1618
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:37,866
And now I will rule it
without mercy.

1619
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,474
This one is mine.

1620
01:32:32,454 --> 01:32:35,657
Please. We can't wage
this battle alone.

1621
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,192
There's nothing we can do.

1622
01:32:37,225 --> 01:32:39,461
They've chased us
from our pride lands before.

1623
01:32:39,494 --> 01:32:41,529
-They're too strong.
-Fight with us.

1624
01:32:41,563 --> 01:32:44,265
Fight for your young.
For your future.

1625
01:32:44,299 --> 01:32:47,102
What future?
They've taken all we have.

1626
01:32:47,135 --> 01:32:49,237
And they will always
take more.

1627
01:33:14,162 --> 01:33:17,098
I am Mufasa,
a stray with no pride,

1628
01:33:17,132 --> 01:33:19,100
and yet I stand before you.

1629
01:33:19,134 --> 01:33:20,268
Head unbowed.

1630
01:33:20,301 --> 01:33:22,570
I know you're afraid,
but trust me.

1631
01:33:22,604 --> 01:33:25,206
Nothing will change
if we remain isolated

1632
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,708
to our own tribes

1633
01:33:26,741 --> 01:33:29,544
without concern
for the fate of others.

1634
01:33:29,577 --> 01:33:31,513
But why should
we stand with you?

1635
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:33,548
This is your fight.

1636
01:33:33,581 --> 01:33:36,518
Today, they are here
for us lions,
but I assure you,

1637
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:39,587
as you let them walk among you
in search of us now,

1638
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:42,490
they are plotting to come
for you tomorrow.

1639
01:33:42,524 --> 01:33:45,660
One lion's hope cannot change
the fate of <i>Milele.</i>

1640
01:33:45,693 --> 01:33:48,329
There is no lion as large
as an elephant,

1641
01:33:48,363 --> 01:33:49,964
as strong as an oxen,

1642
01:33:49,998 --> 01:33:52,467
fast as a cheetah
or tall as a giraffe,

1643
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,136
who can soar and scout
as wide and far

1644
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,238
as the cranes
and hawks in the sky.

1645
01:33:57,272 --> 01:33:59,507
So, can't you see...

1646
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:02,377
Every being has a place
in the Circle of Life.

1647
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:04,345
My breath is your breath.

1648
01:34:04,379 --> 01:34:06,448
Your fight is my fight.

1649
01:34:06,481 --> 01:34:10,151
I will not bend to evil,
and neither should you.

1650
01:34:10,185 --> 01:34:12,387
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1651
01:34:13,488 --> 01:34:16,224
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1652
01:34:16,257 --> 01:34:19,360
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1653
01:34:19,394 --> 01:34:21,329
Mufasa is right.

1654
01:34:21,362 --> 01:34:23,398
<i>Milele</i> is home.

1655
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:27,268
We must stand with Mufasa!

1656
01:34:27,302 --> 01:34:30,438
<i>Nants</i>
<i>ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1657
01:34:30,472 --> 01:34:34,242
Together we shall stand strong
for <i>Milele!</i>

1658
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:37,145
<i>Nants</i>
<i>ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1659
01:34:37,178 --> 01:34:39,647
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1660
01:34:41,516 --> 01:34:43,651
Here comes the lion!

1661
01:34:52,293 --> 01:34:54,529
From this moment on,

1662
01:34:54,562 --> 01:34:59,434
everything the light touches
belongs to me.

1663
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:00,768
You'll have to take it.

1664
01:35:26,528 --> 01:35:27,729
Bye-bye.

1665
01:35:33,635 --> 01:35:37,472
You've messed
with the wrong hornbill!

1666
01:35:39,707 --> 01:35:42,277
Lunch is served.

1667
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:45,747
Stand down! I am highly
trained and occasionally a...

1668
01:35:48,249 --> 01:35:50,151
This is so embarrassing.

1669
01:35:51,452 --> 01:35:54,455
I do have wings, you know.

1670
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,308
Taka!

1671
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:17,278
Taka, please. Please!

1672
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:23,651
Mufasa.

1673
01:36:23,685 --> 01:36:25,854
Mufasa.

1674
01:37:21,844 --> 01:37:23,846
You dare

1675
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:26,781
to challenge me?

1676
01:37:27,816 --> 01:37:30,284
You took my son.

1677
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:33,421
<i>My future.</i>

1678
01:37:33,454 --> 01:37:37,392
<i>Taka... Taka, your</i>
<i>moment of courage will come.</i>

1679
01:37:39,962 --> 01:37:43,832
Blood for blood.

1680
01:37:52,306 --> 01:37:54,609
Please. Don't kill him.

1681
01:37:54,642 --> 01:37:56,477
I didn't kill him.

1682
01:37:56,511 --> 01:37:57,779
You did.

1683
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:28,944
They're coming.

1684
01:38:31,046 --> 01:38:33,448
The last lions.

1685
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:35,349
Time for their extinction,

1686
01:38:35,383 --> 01:38:37,585
and we'll start
with the youngest.

1687
01:38:47,562 --> 01:38:50,665
The earth will shake.

1688
01:38:53,801 --> 01:38:55,670
Attack!

1689
01:39:29,104 --> 01:39:30,738
Mufasa.

1690
01:40:02,804 --> 01:40:04,605
<i>Close your eyes</i>

1691
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,909
<i>and tell me what you hear.</i>

1692
01:40:06,942 --> 01:40:08,944
<i>What you feel.</i>

1693
01:41:33,228 --> 01:41:35,429
Mufasa!

1694
01:42:13,701 --> 01:42:15,803
He defeated the Outsiders.

1695
01:42:15,837 --> 01:42:17,172
The king of <i>Milele!</i>

1696
01:42:17,205 --> 01:42:18,639
The king of <i>Milele!</i>

1697
01:42:22,743 --> 01:42:25,013
Is that him?
Our king?

1698
01:42:31,686 --> 01:42:32,753
Your Highness.

1699
01:42:34,156 --> 01:42:35,190
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1700
01:42:35,223 --> 01:42:37,125
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1701
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:38,659
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1702
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:45,867
-My king.
-Your Highness.

1703
01:42:45,901 --> 01:42:47,702
-Your Majesty.
-My king.

1704
01:42:47,735 --> 01:42:48,870
Defeated Kiros!

1705
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:54,276
-My king.
-King?

1706
01:42:54,309 --> 01:42:57,179
No, no, I'm not king.

1707
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:58,612
Raise your heads.

1708
01:42:58,646 --> 01:43:01,249
No. I'm just... No, no!
No more kings.

1709
01:43:01,283 --> 01:43:03,852
We are all one. Please.

1710
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:06,154
Please. Raise your heads.

1711
01:43:06,188 --> 01:43:08,256
But, Mufasa,

1712
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:10,826
you have
brought them together.

1713
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:12,894
You helped them see
in themselves

1714
01:43:12,928 --> 01:43:15,596
what they considered
unseeable.

1715
01:43:15,629 --> 01:43:18,133
Nothing is more kingly.

1716
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:20,302
No, Rafiki.

1717
01:43:20,335 --> 01:43:23,704
I'm not king.
I'm not royal blood.

1718
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:25,907
Don't you see, my brother?

1719
01:43:25,941 --> 01:43:28,642
It is not what you were,

1720
01:43:28,676 --> 01:43:32,848
it is what you have become.

1721
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:36,550
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1722
01:43:43,325 --> 01:43:45,160
My brother,

1723
01:43:45,193 --> 01:43:48,163
something beautiful
awaits you.

1724
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:01,910
Is this real?

1725
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,647
But it can't be.

1726
01:44:09,217 --> 01:44:10,751
It can't be.

1727
01:44:31,772 --> 01:44:34,076
Oh, Mufasa.

1728
01:44:34,876 --> 01:44:36,945
But how can it be?

1729
01:44:36,978 --> 01:44:40,648
I had a son named Mufasa.

1730
01:44:40,681 --> 01:44:43,885
Taken from me
by a great flood.

1731
01:44:43,919 --> 01:44:44,920
Mother?

1732
01:44:46,687 --> 01:44:48,890
I never stopped hoping.

1733
01:44:48,924 --> 01:44:50,826
Believing.

1734
01:44:50,859 --> 01:44:52,593
My son.

1735
01:44:55,197 --> 01:44:57,032
I've dreamt of this moment.

1736
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:01,735
And now it's come true.

1737
01:45:01,769 --> 01:45:03,371
Oh, Mufasa.

1738
01:45:08,676 --> 01:45:09,911
But Father?

1739
01:45:11,913 --> 01:45:13,048
Where's Father?

1740
01:45:19,687 --> 01:45:21,655
He lives in you now.

1741
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:25,360
He lives in you.

1742
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:34,369
I always dreamed
we'd be together again.

1743
01:45:35,769 --> 01:45:39,740
And I knew it would be
in <i>Milele.</i>

1744
01:45:41,775 --> 01:45:42,878
My son.

1745
01:45:44,012 --> 01:45:45,180
Mufasa.

1746
01:45:52,154 --> 01:45:55,257
Mufasa, please forgive me.

1747
01:45:56,091 --> 01:45:58,927
You must banish him, Sire.

1748
01:46:00,794 --> 01:46:02,796
As long as I am king,

1749
01:46:02,831 --> 01:46:05,267
my brother will have
a place here.

1750
01:46:07,002 --> 01:46:09,703
Brother, I am so...

1751
01:46:09,737 --> 01:46:11,406
But I won't ever

1752
01:46:12,107 --> 01:46:13,842
say your name again.

1753
01:46:15,143 --> 01:46:16,344
I can't.

1754
01:46:17,745 --> 01:46:18,914
I won't.

1755
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:22,117
Then call me Scar.

1756
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:25,320
So I will never forget
what I have done.

1757
01:46:26,188 --> 01:46:27,422
Scar.

1758
01:46:28,423 --> 01:46:30,192
Your Majesty.

1759
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,169
Welcome home.

1760
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:49,978
Your Majesty.

1761
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,521
So, Mufasa,

1762
01:46:59,554 --> 01:47:02,390
I see your family
has been awaiting you

1763
01:47:02,424 --> 01:47:04,893
in <i>Milele</i> after all.

1764
01:47:05,527 --> 01:47:07,495
Yes, Rafiki.

1765
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:10,198
Yes, they were.

1766
01:47:17,205 --> 01:47:20,108
It is your time, Mufasa.

1767
01:47:21,243 --> 01:47:24,112
Rafiki, I wish
I could see him.

1768
01:47:24,145 --> 01:47:26,248
I wish I could meet
my grandfather.

1769
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:29,017
As Mufasa once told
your father,

1770
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:31,219
look into the heavens, Kiara.

1771
01:47:31,253 --> 01:47:34,923
The great kings of the past
will always be there

1772
01:47:35,557 --> 01:47:36,992
waiting for you.

1773
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:19,527
Mmm...

1774
01:49:24,966 --> 01:49:27,035
I don't want him
to go, Rafiki.

1775
01:49:27,068 --> 01:49:29,070
I don't want it to end.

1776
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:31,306
Don't you see, Kiara?

1777
01:49:31,339 --> 01:49:34,109
Mufasa lives in you.

1778
01:49:35,009 --> 01:49:37,312
He lives in you.

1779
01:49:39,514 --> 01:49:41,449
Dad!

1780
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:45,220
-Rafiki.
-It was unbelievable.

1781
01:49:45,253 --> 01:49:47,255
-It was perfect.
-You could not improve on it.

1782
01:49:47,288 --> 01:49:49,023
That said, I do have notes.

1783
01:49:49,057 --> 01:49:51,426
Some suggestions. Take 'em
or leave 'em. But take 'em.

1784
01:49:53,061 --> 01:49:54,662
-Dad!
-Kiara!

1785
01:49:56,965 --> 01:49:59,167
Kiara.

1786
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,502
Dad.

1787
01:50:00,535 --> 01:50:01,803
Where's Mom?

1788
01:50:01,837 --> 01:50:05,006
Well, love,
there's something
you need to know.

1789
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:07,308
What? Did something
happen to Mom?

1790
01:50:07,342 --> 01:50:09,711
Baby, I'm right here,
and I'm fine.

1791
01:50:09,744 --> 01:50:11,513
Where were you?

1792
01:50:11,546 --> 01:50:12,647
Kiara,

1793
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,983
this is your new brother.

1794
01:50:15,016 --> 01:50:16,184
Brother?

1795
01:50:16,217 --> 01:50:18,353
I have a brother?

1796
01:50:18,386 --> 01:50:22,323
Hi there. I'm Kiara.
I will take care of you.

1797
01:50:22,357 --> 01:50:24,125
Forever.

1798
01:50:24,759 --> 01:50:26,294
Little one,

1799
01:50:26,327 --> 01:50:28,496
let me tell you a story.

1800
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:31,332
A story of a great king.
