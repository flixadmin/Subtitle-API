00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,426

<i>( "Rains of Castamere"</i>

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

4
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,592
( hammering echoes )

5
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

6
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,687
- Magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.

7
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,773
Looks fresh-forged.

8
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,525
It is.

9
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,319
No one's made a Valyrian
steel sword

10
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,779
since the Doom
of Valyria.

11
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,697
There are three
living smiths

12
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,033
who know how to rework
Valyrian steel.

13
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,994
The finest of them
was in Volantis.

14
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,122
Came here to King's Landing
at my invitation.

15
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,208
Where did you get
this much Valyrian steel?

16
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,961
From someone who no longer
had need of it.

17
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,466
You've wanted one of these
in the family for a long time.

18
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,385
- And now we have two.
- Two?

19
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,887
The original weapon
was absurdly large.

20
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,306
Plenty of steel
for two swords.

21
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,434
Well, thank you.
It's glorious.

22
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,109
You'll have to train
your left hand.

23
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,820
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

24
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,947
You'll never be as good.

25
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,657
No.

26
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,450
But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,

27
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,160
I suppose
it doesn't matter.

28
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,205
You can't serve
in the Kingsguard
with one hand.

29
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,499
Where's that written?
I can and I will.

30
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,834
The Kingsguard oath
is for life.

31
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,003
The war is over.
The king is safe.

32
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,838
The king is never safe.

33
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,257
How many people in this city
alone would love to see
his head on a pike?

34
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,759
Other knights
protected the king
while you were a prisoner.

35
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,804
They will continue
to do so when you go home.

36
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,307
- Home?
- You'll return
to Casterly Rock

37
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,518
<i>and rule in my stead.</i>

38
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,729
You are the Lord
of Casterly Rock.

39
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,525
I am the King's Hand.
My place is here.

40
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,112
I don't expect to see
the Rock again before I die.

41
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,531
You know
what they call me?

42
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,867
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.

43
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,702
Man without honor.

44
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,329
Now you want me to break
another sacred vow.

45
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,915
You won't be
breaking anything.

46
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,877
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard
of his duties.

47
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,130
The king will exercise
that prerogative.

48
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,632
- No.
- No?

49
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,509
No.

50
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,305
I don't believe
I asked you a question.

51
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,724
- There's my answer.
- If you think your bloody
honor comes before--

52
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,893
My bloody honor
is beyond repair,

53
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,270
but my answer is still no.
I don't want Casterly Rock.

54
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,730
I don't want a wife.
I don't want children.

55
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,274
What do you want?

56
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,069
Supper would be nice.

57
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,573
For 40 years
I've tried to teach you.

58
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,159
If you haven't learned by now,
you never will.

59
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,786
Go.

60
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,996
<i>If serving as a glorified</i>
<i>bodyguard</i>

61
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,499
is the sum of your ambition,
go serve.

62
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,251
I suppose you want
the sword back.

63
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,545
Keep it.

64
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,841
A one-handed man
with no family needs
all the help he can get.

65
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,743
( goats bleat )

66
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,246
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

67
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,289
Please don't.

68
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,334
Bronn:
<i>Seems to me</i>
<i>the smart place</i>

69
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,378
<i>to meet travelers</i> <i>is in a tavern.</i>

70
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,463
That way, one party is late,

71
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,632
the other party can drink
some ale inside.

72
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,676
This is the Prince of Dorne
we're waiting for,

73
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,137
not one of your
sellsword friends.

74
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,431
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you
to meet him?

75
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,270
There's bad blood between
the Martells of Dorne

76
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,981
and the Lannisters
of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.

77
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,233
And just in case
the Martells of Dorne

78
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,152
are looking to spill
some Lannister blood,

79
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,737
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

80
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,240
- I happen to be
an accomplished diplomat.
- Oh.

81
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,201
Ah, here we are.

82
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,829
( claps )

83
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,248
<i>Can you read the sigils?</i>

84
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,459
Yellow balls?

85
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,461
Wild lemons
on a purple field,

86
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,672
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

87
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,718
A vulture grasping
a baby in its talons,
House Blackmont.

88
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,846
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

89
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,681
Boy knows his
Dornish Houses.

90
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,308
I need a sigil.

91
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,936
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced
by a spear?

92
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,479
I don't see it,
my lord.

93
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:08,196
Well met, my lords.
His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

94
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,032
My lord father,
the King's Hand, sends
his greetings as well.

95
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,451
I am Tyrion Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

96
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,703
Master of Coin.

97
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,168
Forgive me.
I don't see Prince Doran
in your company.

98
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,422
The prince's health
forces him to remain
at Sunspear.

99
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,550
He sends his brother
Prince Oberyn

100
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,470
<i>to attend the royal</i>
<i>wedding in his stead.</i>

101
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,225
Yes, the king
will be delighted
to enjoy the company

102
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,562
of a warrior
as renowned as Prince Oberyn
at his wedding feast.

103
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,730
Will he?

104
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,650
And where is
Prince Oberyn?

105
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,068
Arrived before dawn.

106
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,862
Not a man
for welcome parties,

107
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,697
<i>our prince.</i>

108
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,409
Very well.
My lords, these fine men
from the City Watch

109
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,995
will escort you to your
quarters in the Red Keep.

110
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,123
You must be weary
after such a long journey.

111
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,922
Some accomplished
diplomacy that was.

112
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,924
Now where?

113
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,928
We must find Prince Oberyn
before he kills somebody
or several somebodies.

114
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,889
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in
a city this big?

115
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,058
You're famous for fucking
half of Westeros.

116
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,936
You just arrived
at the capital after
two weeks of bad roads,

117
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,521
where would you go?

118
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,774
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

119
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,883
Look at this one.

120
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,470
How lovely is she?

121
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,389
Beautiful.

122
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,224
But pale.

123
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,226
They like them pale
in the capital.

124
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,687
Shows they don't
work the fields.

125
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,525
Do I frighten you?

126
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,611
You like?

127
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,823
Timid.
Timid bores me.

128
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,498
You're a bit of mischief,
aren't you?

129
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,586
I think she likes you.

130
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,338
She has good taste.

131
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,176
You're not timid,
are you?

132
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,349
( laughs )
Not timid.

133
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,184
Do you like women?

134
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,144
When they look
like her, my lord.

135
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,271
This one will do nicely.

136
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,357
Olyvar:
<i>Very good, my lady.</i>

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,692
Oh, I'm not a lady.

138
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,111
A term of courtesy
in this establishment.

139
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,863
A lie anywhere.

140
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,282
Why not use
the right words?

141
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,992
I'm a bastard.

142
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,788
She is a whore.
And you're what?

143
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,998
A procurer.

144
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,666
Any of the others?

145
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,379
The two girls can leave.

146
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,339
- ( snaps fingers )
- You stay.

147
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,759
I'm afraid I'm not
an offer, my lord.

148
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,929
Everyone who works
for Littlefinger
is an offer.

149
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,723
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

150
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,893
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

151
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,646
Have you ever been
with a prince?

152
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,857
Can't say I have.

153
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,905
I'm wildly expensive.

154
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
Take off your clothes.

155
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,835
Which way do you
like it?

156
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,755
- ( gasps )
- My way.

157
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,218
Man:
<i>♪ And so he spoke</i>
<i>and so he spoke ♪</i>

158
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,556
<i>♪ That Lord of Castamere ♪</i>

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,975

160

<i>- Oberyn, don't.</i>

161
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,773

162
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,778

164
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,210
You lost, friend?

165
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,297
Forgive me for staring.

166
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,799
I don't see many
Lannisters where I'm from.

167
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,677
I don't see many
Dornishmen in the capital.

168
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,014
We don't like the smell.
( laughs )

169
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,683
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

170
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,977
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for
a private room.

171
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,438
Why are you wasting a woman
like this on a Dornishman?

172
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,648
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

173
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,276
( laughs )

174
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,240
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

175
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,583
You think your gold
and your lions

176
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,045
and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

177
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,466
May I tell you a secret?

178
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,010
You're not a golden lion.

179
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,513
You're just a pink
little man

180
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,765
who is far too slow
on the draw.

181
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,564
( screams )

182
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,027
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

183
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,363
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

184
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,199
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

185
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,867
( groans )

186
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,662
He'll live if you
get him help straightaway.

187
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,250
So, decisions.

188
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,753
Prince Oberyn,
forgive the intrusion.

189
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,672
- We heard there might be...
- ( screams )

190
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,590
...trouble.

191
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
Apologies, my love.

192
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,435
I'm here to welcome you
to the capital.

193
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,609
Ellaria Sand,
my paramour.

194
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,612
The king's own Uncle Imp.

195
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,574
Tyrion, son
of Tywin Lannister.

196
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,158
If there's anything
I can do to make your stay--

197
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,910
What are you?
His hired killer?

198
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,414
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.

199
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,748
How did that come to pass?

200
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,001
Killed the right people,
I suppose.

201
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,547
( laughs )

202
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,009
We'll need
a few more girls.
Girls, yes?

203
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,343
You don't partake?

204
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,263
Oh, I partook.
Now I'm married.

205
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,391
Prince Oberyn, if I may,
a word in private?

206
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,356
Seems I visited
the Lannister brothel
by mistake.

207
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,900
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

208
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,613
The king is very grateful
that you traveled all
this way for his wedding.

209
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,657
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

210
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,702
I am only the second son
after all.

211
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,704
Well, speaking
as a fellow second son,

212
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,832
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

213
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,459
( chuckles )

214
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,711
Why did you come
to King's Landing,
Prince Oberyn?

215
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,087
I was invited
to the royal wedding.

216
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,673
I thought we were
speaking truth.

217
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,094
The last time
I was in the capital
was many years ago.

218
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,180
Another wedding.

219
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,307
My sister Elia

220
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,894
and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

221
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,524
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.

222
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,195
Swaddled them,
rocked them, fed them
at her own breast.

223
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,281
Elia wouldn't let
the wet nurse touch them.

224
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,785
And beautiful, noble
Rhaegar Targaryen

225
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,288
left her
for another woman.

226
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,748
That started a war

227
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,834
and the war ended
right here

228
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,087
when your father's army
took the city...

229
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,505
I wasn't actually present.

230
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,965
...and butchered
those children.

231
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,968
My nephew and niece.

232
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,431
Carved them up
and wrapped them
in Lannister cloaks.

233
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,895
And my sister,
you know what they
did to her?

234
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,483
I'm asking you
a question.

235
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,652
I've heard rumors.

236
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,279
( chuckles )
So have I.

237
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,117
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane
the Mountain

238
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,619
raped Elia
and split her in half

239
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,162
with his great sword.

240
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,498
I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.

241
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,166
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

242
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,001
your father gave the order.

243
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,672
Tell your father
I'm here.

244
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,177
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones
who pay their debts.

245
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,567
<i>( dragons screeching )</i>

246
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,486
( growls )

247
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,281
( screeching )

248
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,414
- ( growls )
- ( chuckles )

249
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,167
- ( screeches )
- Shh.

250
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,892
( screeching )

251
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,106
( gasps )

252
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,116
Shh. Shh.

253
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,202
- ( roars )
- ( gasps )

254
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,374
( roars )

255
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
They're dragons,
Khaleesi.

256
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,389
They can never be tamed.

257
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,226
Not even by their mother.

258
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,415
- Ser Barristan.
- Your Grace.

259
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,752
Where's Daario Naharis?

260
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,546
Where's Grey Worm?

261
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,424
Gambling, Your Grace.

262
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,511
Gambling?

263
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:23,203
Crowd:
Mhysa. Mhysa.
Mhysa...

264
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,714
How long have they
been at it?

265
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,841
Since midnight,
Your Grace.

266
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,093
Ser Worm is stronger
than he looks.

267
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,887
But I can see his arms
beginning to shake.

268
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,389
What's the prize to winning
this stupid contest?

269
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,558
The honor of riding
by your side on the road
to Meereen.

270
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,061
That honor goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan

271
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,522
as neither of them kept
me waiting this morning.

272
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,026
You two will ride
in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

273
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,738
The last man
holding his sword

274
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,532
can find a new queen
to fight for.

275
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,659
<i>( Daario groans )</i>

276
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,623
( speaking Valyrian )

277
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,438
You need
to eat something.

278
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,526
Pigeon pie.

279
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,737
No, thank you.

280
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,826
Lemon cakes?

281
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,453
No, thank you.

282
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,331
You love lemon cakes.

283
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,291
Tell her
she needs to eat.

284
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,126
My lady, you do
need to eat.

285
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,962
I don't need to eat.

286
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,092
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

287
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,687
She needs to eat.

288
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,821
I can't let you starve.

289
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,656
<i>I swore to protect you.</i>

290
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,540
My lady,

291
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,917
I am your husband.
Let me help you.

292
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,838
How can you
help me?

293
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,549
I don't know,
but I can try.

294
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,471
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy

295
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,349
thinking about
how they died.

296
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,853
I could get you
essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

297
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,980
Do you know what
they did to my brother?

298
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,444
How they sewed his direwolf's
head onto his body?

299
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,864
And my mother.

300
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,366
They say they cut
her throat to the bone

301
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,703
and threw her body
in the river.

302
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,540
<i>What happened to your family</i>
<i>was a terrible crime.</i>

303
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,044
I didn't know your brother.
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

304
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,088
<i>Your mother,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

305
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,965
<i>I admired her.</i>

306
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,217
She wanted to have
me executed,

307
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,386
but I admired her.

308
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,223
She was a strong woman.

309
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,225
And she was fierce

310
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,519
when it came
to protecting
her children.

311
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,899
Sansa.

312
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,445
Your mother would want
you to carry on.

313
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,821
You know it's true.

314
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,411
Will you pardon me,
my lord?

315
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,205
I'd like to visit
the godswood.

316
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,416
Of course. Of course.
Prayer can be helpful,
I hear.

317
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,044
I don't pray anymore.

318
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,923
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

319
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,318
My lion.

320
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,904
What are you doing?

321
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,119
What does it look like
I'm doing? Come here.

322
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,913
How many times
have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

323
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,665
I know.
I know.

324
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,708
We have come
to a dangerous place.

325
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,169
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long
it's been?

326
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,671
Of course
I haven't forgotten.

327
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,090
I want you.

328
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,591
Don't you want me?

329
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,512
Things are a bit tense
right now.

330
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,639
What things?

331
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,891
My nephew the king
wants to murder me.

332
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,477
My wife hates me
because my father
murdered her family.

333
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,939
Oberyn Martell wants
to murder everyone whose
last name is Lannister.

334
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:05,694
You need to relax.

335
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,413
Don't you want
to relax?

336
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,879
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

337
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,256
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

338
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,426
- You have
your child bride now.
- Shae.

339
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,928
- Do you love her?
- Love her?

340
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,181
I barely know her.
She's a child.

341
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,766
- She despises me.
- That's not an answer.

342
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,102
Of course
I don't love her.

343
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,271
You tried
to ship me away.

344
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,315
Ship you away?

345
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,068
Give me diamonds
and make me disappear.

346
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,987
What in the world
are you talking about?

347
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,864
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

348
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,868
- Say it!
- Shh.

349
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,995
I don't know what
you're talking about.

350
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,581
You want me to stay?

351
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,567
( groans )

352
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,111
A work of art, really.

353
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,239
The craftsmanship
is excellent.

354
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,325
You like it so much,
you're welcome to chop off
your own hand and take it.

355
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,452
Such an ingrate.
I spent days with
the goldsmith

356
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,913
- getting the details
just right.
- Days?

357
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,415
Better part
of an afternoon.

358
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,085
There, how does
that feel?

359
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,087
Uh...

360
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,256
a hook would be
more practical.

361
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,258
Elegant, I think.

362
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,890
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

363
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,184
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

364
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,894
I am in your debt,
Maester Qyburn.

365
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,272
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help

366
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,023
whenever I can.

367
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,659
Odd little man.

368
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,619
- I've grown
rather fond of him.
-<i> ( door closes )</i>

369
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,496
He's quite talented,
you know?

370
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,290
What symptoms?

371
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,542
Symptoms that are
not your concern.

372
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,961
You let him
touch you?

373
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,213
You jealous?

374
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,715
I'm surprised.

375
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,383
You never let
Pycelle near you.

376
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,635
( laughs )
You think I'd let
that old lecher

377
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,846
put his hands on me?

378
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,473
He smells like a dead cat.

379
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,642
<i>I'm not sure I've ever</i>
<i>smelled a dead cat.</i>

380
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,728
Well, they smell
like Pycelle.

381
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,647
You drink more
than you used to.

382
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,774
- Yes.
- Why?

383
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:54,029
Let's see, you started
a brawl in the streets
with Ned Stark

384
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,114
and disappeared
from the capital.

385
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,491
My husband died in a tragic
hunting accident.

386
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,243
It must have been
traumatic for you.

387
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,745
My only daughter
was shipped off to Dorne.

388
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,288
<i>We suffered</i>
<i>through a siege.</i>

389
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,998
A rather short siege.

390
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,834
A rather short siege
that I didn't expect
to survive.

391
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,794
And now I'm marrying
my eldest son

392
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,005
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden

393
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,965
while I'm supposed
to marry her brother,

394
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,551
a renowned pillow biter.
So...

395
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,220
Father disowned me today.

396
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,514
He can't disown you.
You're all he's got.

397
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,725
You're forgetting Tyrion.

398
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:28,063
You don't really
plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?

399
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,403
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here

400
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,405
in the Red Keep
with you.

401
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,034
- Not now.
- I want--

402
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,329
Not now? When?
I've been back for weeks.

403
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,710
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

404
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,546
You come back
after all this time
with no apologies

405
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,299
and one hand and expect
everything to be the same?

406
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,675
What do you want me
to apologize for?

407
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,052
For leaving me.

408
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,678
You think I wanted
to be taken prisoner?

409
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,555
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

410
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,058
You left me alone.

411
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,895
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

412
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,190
Every day. I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

413
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,651
- You took too long.
- I...

414
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,822
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you took too long.

415
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:19,989
<i>( knocking )</i>

416
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,242
- Come in.
- Jaime:<i> Go away.</i>

417
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,369
Forgive me, Your Grace.

418
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,956
You told me to come
at once if there was
anything important.

419
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,437
You plan on killing
all the crows yourself?

420
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,150
Do you plan on sitting
here scratching your balls
till winter?

421
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,110
We wait for Mance's orders.

422
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,112
You sent a man over the Wall
at the full moon.

423
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,197
<i>If he's not back yet,</i>
<i>he's not coming back.</i>

424
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,699
<i>And what is it</i>
<i>you want?</i>

425
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,201
March on Castle Black
with just this lot?

426
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,246
Your pretty crow
said 1,000 men are
nesting there.

427
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,039
Yeah, well,
he's a liar.

428
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,791
He is?

429
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,169
Shouldn't it be
"he was"?

430
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,963
You said you put
three arrows in him.

431
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,923
I did.

432
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,051
I've seen you slip
a shaft through a rabbit's
eye at 200 yards.

433
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,431
If that boy's still walking,
it's 'cause you let him go.

434
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,767
( whistles )

435
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,541
Thenns.

436
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,960
I fucking hate Thenns.

437
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,139
Mance sent you?

438
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,808
- ( grunts )
- How did you find us?

439
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:18,066
You came from the south,
not the north.

440
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,568
Took a detour.

441
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,905
Got some supper from
a village down that way.

442
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,910
<i>Why does the meat down here</i>
<i>taste so much better</i>

443
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,162
than it does
on our side of the Wall?

444
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,914
Help yourself.

445
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,791
( chuckles )

446
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,586
Maybe everything's
just better fed down here.

447
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,048
Fat and lazy.

448
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,301
Easier for us, hmm?

449
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,806
You didn't see
us coming?

450
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,641
Lost your warg?

451
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,437
And that baby crow
you had with you,

452
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,815
lost him too?

453
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,152
I'll answer to Mance.

454
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,071
I won't answer to you.

455
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,949
She yours?

456
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,869
I'm not anybody's.

457
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,047
Too scrawny.

458
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,509
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.

459
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,346
<i>Think of them</i>
<i>stuck in their larders</i>

460
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,600
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

461
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,395
and stew, getting
nice and fat

462
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,771
and marbled.

463
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,817
I know we've had
our differences, Tormund,

464
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,322
but just one time
before you die,

465
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,534
you really ought
to try crow.

466
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,955
Officer:
<i>Draw.</i>

467
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,915
Loose.

468
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,090
Jon:
<i>Last time I saw him,</i>

469
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,468
<i>he was in the courtyard</i>
<i>at Winterfell.</i>

470
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,847
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"Next time I see you,</i>

471
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,892
<i>you'll be all in black."</i>

472
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,355
I was jealous of Robb
my whole life.

473
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,564
( winces )

474
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,108
<i>The way my father</i>
<i>looked at him,</i>

475
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,985
<i>I wanted that.</i>

476
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,197
He was better than me
at everything--

477
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,826
fighting and hunting

478
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,329
and riding

479
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,122
and girls.

480
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,334
<i>Gods, the girls</i>
<i>loved him.</i>

481
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,713
I wanted to hate him,
but I never could.

482
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,927
Sometimes I want
to hate you.

483
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,683
Well, you're better
than me at everything.

484
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,186
Except reading.

485
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,651
They're--
they're ready for you.

486
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,157
He's wanted
to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

487
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,701
No one's going
to hang you.

488
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,452
You've done
nothing wrong.

489
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,163
I've done plenty wrong.

490
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,710
So you admit you
murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

491
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,628
Jon:
<i>I didn't murder him.</i>

492
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,964
No?
You put your sword

493
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,007
through a brother
of the Night's Watch.

494
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,093
What do you call that?

495
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,220
He wanted me
to kill him.

496
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,805
A bastard son
of a traitor.

497
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,098
What would
you expect?

498
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,392
The Halfhand believed
our only chance

499
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,686
to stop Mance was to get
a man inside his army.

500
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,064
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as if you knew him.
He was my brother.

501
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,650
Then you'd know
he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

502
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,194
The free folk would
have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

503
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,572
Slynt:
<i>The free folk?</i>
<i>Listen to him.</i>

504
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,866
He even talks like
a wildling now.

505
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,119
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

506
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,955
I climbed the Wall
with the wildlings. I--

507
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,375
I laid with
a wildling girl.

508
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,671
You admit to breaking
your vows, then?

509
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,424
I do.

510
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,261
The law is the law.
The boy must die.

511
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:19,182
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

512
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,769
the Wall would be manned
by headless men.

513
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,438
There's a difference
between sneaking off

514
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,858
to the Mole's Town brothel
and sleeping with the enemy.

515
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,903
While we sit here

516
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,988
debating which rules
I broke,

517
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,492
Mance Rayder
marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

518
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,202
Impossible.

519
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,037
You can't get
50 wildlings together

520
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,538
before they start
killing each other.

521
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,375
100,000.
He's united the Thenns,

522
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,710
<i>the Hornfoots,</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

523
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,170
He has giants
fighting for him.

524
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,589
( laughs )
Giants?

525
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,509
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?

526
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,136
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

527
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,514
And now you're here.
You must not have been
very good at your job.

528
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,182
How dare you?!

529
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,602
There's a band of wildlings
south of the Wall already

530
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,604
led by Tormund Giantsbane.

531
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,314
I killed their warg
and three others.

532
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,942
They shot me
full of arrows.

533
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,028
Their orders are
to attack Castle Black
from the south

534
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,614
when Mance hits
it from the north.

535
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,075
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

536
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,160
Mance said it would be
the greatest fire

537
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,495
the North has ever seen.

538
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,289
<i>That's the truth.</i>

539
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,916
All the truth.

540
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,841
Do you intend to execute me
or am I free to go?

541
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,176
None of us are free.

542
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,970
We are men
of the Night's Watch.

543
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:43,432
But we won't be taking
your head today, Jon Snow.

544
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,892
Go on.

545
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,197
I am acting commander here,
Maester Aemon.

546
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,032
Yes, you are.

547
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,076
And I don't trust
the bastard.

548
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,412
He told the truth.

549
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,373
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

550
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,792
How did you acquire
this magical power?

551
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,255
I grew up
in King's Landing.

552
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,510
Olenna:
<i>No. No.</i>

553
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,388
You're a queen,
not an ox.

554
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,558
Your grandfather
gave me a necklace

555
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,061
just like this one
for my 51st nameday.

556
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,690
The wedding is in
a fortnight, Grandmother.

557
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,775
You can't say no
to everything.

558
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
Nonsense.
My little dears.

559
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,323
Go and speak
to the jewelers
of King's Landing.

560
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,909
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.

561
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,328
The one who brings
me the best necklace

562
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,914
will get to keep
the next best.

563
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,249
( girls laughing )

564
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,879
The Margaery Tyrell
who walks into the sept

565
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,382
a fortnight from now
will inspire 1,000 songs.

566
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,802
Now, how sad it
will be if she's wearing
rubbish like that.

567
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,181
Perhaps I should just let
Joffrey choose it for me.

568
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,642
End up with a string
of dead sparrow heads
around my neck.

569
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,270
You watch that.
Even here, even with me.

570
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,772
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

571
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,441
My word.

572
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,235
My lady.
My lady.

573
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,239
Please pardon me
for interrupting.

574
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,865
My name is Brienne
of Tarth.

575
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,533
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

576
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,370
But hearing is one thing.

577
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,830
Aren't you just marvelous?

578
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,292
Absolutely singular.

579
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,836
I hear you knocked
my grandson into the dirt

580
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,965
like the silly little
boy he is.

581
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,717
My lady, I know this is
a very busy time for you,

582
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,387
but if I could
just have a moment.

583
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,431
You dare not refuse.

584
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,519
A shadow?

585
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,105
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

586
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,485
I swear to you by all
the gods it was Stannis.

587
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,446
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart

588
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,699
and disappeared.

589
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,743
One day, my lady,
I will avenge our king.

590
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,162
Joffrey is our king now.

591
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,415
I meant no offense.

592
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,208
And you've given none.

593
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,594
All the Kingsguard
will be on duty, of course.

594
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,638
Ser Boros
will be stationed here.

595
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,682
Ser Preston
will be stationed here

596
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,144
beside the primary
entertainment.

597
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,689
Your Grace?

598
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,275
Yes, yes,
one guard at the--

599
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,901
the thing.
Go on.

600
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,196
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

601
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,907
I've always guarded
the king himself, my lord.

602
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,118
Ever since your absence.

603
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,203
And I thank you
for it, Ser Meryn.

604
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,956
All very good.
I don't expect any trouble.

605
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,708
The people love
their king.

606
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,376
They know who
keeps them fed.

607
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,378
Margaery Tyrell,
I've heard.

608
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,465
By my leave.

609
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,301
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.

610
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,678
The war's not won.
Not while Stannis lives.

611
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,014
I broke Stannis
on the Blackwater.

612
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,475
Pity you weren't
there to help, Uncle.

613
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,269
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

614
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,521
Busy getting captured.

615
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,567
So this is the famous
"Book of Brothers"?

616
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,570
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

617
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,576
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.

618
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,536
( chuckles )

619
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,664
Led the attack
on the Kingswood
Brotherhood.

620
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,334
Defeated the Smiling Knight
in single combat.

621
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,586
Ser Duncan the Tall.

622
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,630
( laughs )

623
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,216
Four pages
for Ser Duncan.

624
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,842
He must have been
quite a man.

625
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,803
So they say.

626
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,349
Ser Jaime Lannister.

627
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,476
( chuckles )

628
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,897
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

629
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,900
- There's still time.
- Is there?

630
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,070
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

631
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,573
How can you protect me
with that?

632
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,325
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

633
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,036
Makes for more
of a contest.

634
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,305
Daenerys:
Have you ever been
to Meereen?

635
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,850
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

636
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,309
And?

637
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,478
They say
1,000 slaves died

638
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,313
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

639
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,649
And now an army
of former slaves

640
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,818
is marching
to her gates.

641
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,987
You think the Great
Masters are worried?

642
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,157
If they're smart,
Your Grace.

643
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,329
You were told to ride
at the back of the train.

644
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,039
Yes, my queen.

645
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,834
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

646
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,920
A matter of strategy.

647
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,884
Your Grace.

648
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,599
All right, what is this
matter of strategy?

649
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,437
A dusk rose.

650
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,856
Would you like to walk
at the back of the train
instead of riding?

651
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,901
And this one's called
lady's lace.

652
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,028
Would you like
to walk without shoes?

653
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,030
You have to know
a land to rule it.

654
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,199
Its plants,
its rivers,

655
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,826
its roads,
its people.

656
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,287
Dusk rose tea
eases fever.

657
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,372
Everyone in Meereen
knows that.

658
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,374
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

659
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,210
If you want them
to follow you,

660
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,878
you have to become
a part of their world.

661
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,338
Strategy.

662
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,218
Harpy's Gold.

663
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,761
No tea from this one.

664
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,055
Beautiful but poisonous.

665
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,230
You are a gambler,
aren't you?

666
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,948
Your Grace.

667
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,250
<i>( man shouts in Valyrian )</i>

668
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,400
There's one on
every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

669
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,236
How many miles
are there between
here and Meereen?

670
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,614
163, Your Grace.

671
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,825
Barristan:
<i>I'll tell our men to ride</i>
<i>ahead and bury them.</i>

672
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,326
You don't need
to see this.

673
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,038
You will do
no such thing.

674
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,125
I will see each
and every one of their faces.

675
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,088
Remove her collar
before you bury her.

676
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,430
Brienne:
<i>There she is.</i>

677
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,016
Jaime:
Yes, there she is.

678
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,437
- And?
- You made a promise.

679
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,231
To return the Stark
girls to their mother
who is now dead.

680
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,649
To keep them safe.

681
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,110
Well, Arya Stark
hasn't been seen

682
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,945
since her father
was killed.

683
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,489
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

684
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,700
There's a certain safety
in death, wouldn't you say?

685
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,828
And Sansa Stark is now
Sansa Lannister.

686
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,204
Bit of a complication.

687
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,707
A complication does not
release you from a vow.

688
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,543
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?

689
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,879
And take her where?
Where would she be
safer than here?

690
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,714
Look me in the eye
and tell me

691
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,924
that you think she'll be
safe in King's Landing.

692
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,100
Are you sure
we're not related?

693
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,519
Ever since I've returned,
every Lannister I've seen

694
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,229
has been a miserable
pain in my ass.

695
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,190
Maybe you're
a Lannister, too.

696
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,359
You've got
the hair for it
if not the looks.

697
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,421
<i>( footsteps )</i>

698
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,010
<i>( footsteps stop )</i>

699
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,762
( gasps )

700
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,454
- ( gasps )
- It's all right.

701
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,623
It's all right.
It's all right.

702
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,752
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

703
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,255
I have good reason to be.

704
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,633
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

705
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,554
Don't you know me?

706
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,601
Ser Dontos.
The king's nameday
celebration.

707
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,395
I'm sorry.
I should have
remembered.

708
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,022
I can't accept your apology.

709
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,942
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool,
thanks to you.

710
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,862
Anyone would have
done the same.

711
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,780
But only you did.

712
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,408
I can never repay you.

713
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,828
You gave me my life.
But this,

714
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,165
this is worth
more than my life.

715
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,420
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.

716
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,380
House Hollard
was strong once.

717
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,382
House on the rise.

718
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,093
That's all that's left
of those days,

719
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,430
thanks to a few sad,
fat drunks like me.

720
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,891
I can't take it.

721
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,393
It's very,
very kind of you,
but I can't.

722
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,146
I don't have
anything else left.

723
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,231
That's all.

724
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,317
Take it.
Wear it.

725
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,861
Let my name
have one more moment
in the sun

726
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,654
before it disappears
from the world.

727
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,994
I'll wear it with pride,
Ser Dontos.

728
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,246
Yeah.

729
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,264
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

730
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,359
Arya:
<i>When am I going to get</i>
<i>a horse of my own?</i>

731
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,819
The little lady
wants a pony.

732
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,113
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

733
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,700
Horses aren't easy
to come by.

734
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,870
Even if they were,
you think I'm gonna put
you on your own horse?

735
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,958
Watch the only thing
of value I've got in
the world ride away?

736
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,126
Why don't you
have any money?

737
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,380
Didn't you steal
anything from Joffrey
before you left?

738
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,215
No.

739
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,384
You're not very smart,
are you?

740
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,219
I'm not a thief.

741
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,388
You're fine with
murdering little boys,

742
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,223
but thieving
is beneath you?

743
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,433
A man's got
to have a code.

744
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,520
You think
I'm gonna escape?

745
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,480
Where would I go?

746
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,399
I'd be dead by nightfall
without you.

747
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,693
My family's gone.
I've got no one.

748
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,154
You've got an aunt
in the Vale.

749
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,449
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her,

750
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,493
maybe she'll have
enough left over

751
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,704
to buy you that pony
you want so much.

752
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,043
Arya:
<i>I'm hungry.</i>
<i>You're hungry.</i>

753
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,754
Five horses,
five men.

754
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,133
More than I feel like
killing on an empty stomach.

755
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,933
I know him.

756
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,644
<i>The small one.</i>
<i>His name is Polliver.</i>

757
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,731
He captured us
and took us to Harrenhal.

758
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,524
( urinating )

759
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,651
He killed Lommy.

760
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,236
What the fuck's a Lommy?

761
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,864
He was my friend.

762
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,658
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through
his neck.

763
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,370
He's still got it.

764
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,789
Hound:
<i>Got what?</i>

765
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,541
My sword Needle.

766
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,794
Needle?
Of course you
named your sword.

767
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,671
Lots of people
name their swords.

768
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,090
Lots of cunts.

769
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,306
What are you--
get back here.

770
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,558
My brother gave me
that sword.

771
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,644
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

772
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,896
I don't care
if he ate your friend.

773
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,231
We're not going in there.

774
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,446
-<i> ( man laughing )</i>
<i>- Man: Come on, give it up.</i>

775
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,573
<i>( woman whimpering )</i>

776
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,744
- Come here.
- ( whimpering )

777
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,872
- Let's have a feel there.
- Leave it.

778
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,028
- ( laughing )
- Come here.

779
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,407
Please,
she's a good girl.

780
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,367
Shut your mouth
and pour us more ale

781
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,953
and we may not take
her with us when we're
done with her.

782
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,000
I know you.

783
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,422
You're the Hound.

784
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,385
<i>Pour our new friend</i>
<i>some ale.</i>

785
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,224
What brings you
so far north?

786
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,517
I could ask
the same of you.

787
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,935
What are you
doing up here?

788
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,229
Just keeping
the king's peace.

789
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,064
No need.
The war's over.

790
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,443
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated
at the Blackwater.

791
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,528
Robb Stark killed
at the Twins.

792
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,904
And where am I
for all of it?

793
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,906
Stuck with your brother.

794
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,451
- Meaning no offense.
- None taken.

795
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,119
He's good,
the Mountain is.

796
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,620
Best at what he does.

797
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,999
But torture, torture,
torture, torture.

798
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,752
<i>You spend</i>
<i>enough time putting</i>
<i>the hammer to people,</i>

799
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,212
<i>you start to feel like</i>
<i>a carpenter making chairs.</i>

800
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,881
Drains the fun
right out of it.

801
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,632
And what's life
without a little fun?

802
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,509
<i>( chuckles )</i>

803
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,096
But I don't need
to tell you that, eh?

804
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,435
She's all right.
I've had better.

805
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,978
( laughs )

806
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,107
You know what?

807
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,067
You should come
with us.

808
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,237
His kind, they've always
got something hidden
away somewhere.

809
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,115
Gold, silver,
more daughters.

810
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,534
<i>Always something if you</i>
<i>know how to make them talk.</i>

811
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,204
And there's plenty
of him between here
and King's Landing.

812
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,456
You could do well
for yourself.

813
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,458
We certainly have been.

814
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,213
I'm not going
to King's Landing.

815
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,632
Think about it.
We could do whatever
we like

816
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:37,052
wherever we go.

817
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,970
These are
the king's colors.

818
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,014
No one's standing
in his way now.

819
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,017
Which means no one's
standing in ours.

820
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,395
Fuck the king.

821
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,815
( chatter stops )

822
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,991
When I heard that Joffrey's
dog had tucked tail

823
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,827
and run from the Battle
of the Blackwater,

824
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,870
I didn't believe it.

825
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,832
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

826
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,167
Bring me one
of those chickens.

827
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,628
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

828
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,172
( laughs )
No.

829
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,632
But we're
the king's men.

830
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,427
So, you got money?

831
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,388
Not a penny.

832
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,057
I'll still
take that chicken.

833
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,059
Tell you what.

834
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,853
We'll trade you.

835
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,063
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

836
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,816
<i>Give us a go</i>
<i>at your friend.</i>

837
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,486
Lowell there likes them
a bit broken in.

838
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,114
<i>( men chuckle )</i>

839
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,413
You're a talker.

840
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,750
Listening to talkers
makes me thirsty.

841
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,685
Ah.

842
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,687
And hungry.

843
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,523
Think I'll take
two chickens.

844
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,326
You don't seem to
understand the situation.

845
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,329
I understand that
if any more words

846
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,081
come pouring out
of your cunt mouth,

847
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,877
I'm gonna have to eat
every fucking chicken
in this room.

848
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,546
You lived your life
for the king.

849
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,799
You're gonna die
for some chickens?

850
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,011
Someone is.

851
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,064
( shouts )

852
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,620
( whimpering )

853
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,092
( grunting )

854
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,732
( groans )

855
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,030
( screams )

856
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,848
( screaming )

857
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,767
( gasping )

858
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,278
( grunts )

859
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,115
( groans )

860
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,371
( screams )

861
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,002
( groans )

862
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:43,381
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

863
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,258
What?
What do you mean?

864
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,428
Can you walk?
I've got to carry you?

865
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,138
Carry me?

866
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,225
Fine little blade.

867
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,025
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

868
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,613
( gasps )

869
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,579
( gurgling )

870
00:56:51,157 --> 00:58:11,905
