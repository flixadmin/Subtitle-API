1
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:03,574
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,310
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:10,277
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,313
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:16,917
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,819
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:22,189
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:25,559
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,495
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:30,764
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:31,965
Why are you here?

12
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:33,333
Because I want to go faster,

13
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:34,868
and you're the only one who can teach me.

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,237
Everything you need is on this drive.

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,406
It means a lot, you looking after Barry.

16
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:43,410
Barry's not the only person
here I wanna keep safe.

17
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:45,512
We found Barry's double,
so where the hell am I?

18
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,314
Reverb.

19
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:50,684
You don't even know how powerful you are.

20
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,486
My name was Hunter Zolomon.

21
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,755
I thought that if I could find
my doppelganger on this Earth,

22
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:57,925
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

23
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,194
I've been vibing Zoom,
and every time it's happened,

24
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:01,595
I've been near that thing.

25
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:05,065
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

26
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,302
Sometimes terrible things happen to us

27
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:10,037
when we're children.

28
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,372
Things that can define who we become,

29
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:14,741
whether we want them to or not.

30
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:16,109
Run, Barry, run!

31
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,744
Some of us become stronger.

32
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:19,613
The people who took me and helped me heal

33
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,382
and move past everything that happened.

34
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:25,219
They're responsible for who
I've become today.

35
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,387
But I know that I'm one of the lucky ones.

36
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:28,889
Come on, Barry.

37
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,091
Not everyone gets that kind of support.

38
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:33,427
Without it, I don't know where
I would have ended up

39
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,897
or what I could've become.

40
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:44,705
- James...
- Who do you think you are?

41
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:47,274
Do you know what I went through over there?

42
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:50,777
Do you know the sacrifices I made for you?

43
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:54,114
I come back after years
of fighting for this country

44
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:56,416
and this is my welcome home?

45
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,753
You think you can walk out on me?

46
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,188
I'm your husband!

47
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,656
You're not my husband.

48
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:04,691
I don't know what you are right now.

49
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:07,494
I am a hero, Ashley.

50
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:11,365
No. You're a monster.

51
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,767
Run, Hunter, run.

52
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,202
Stay, boy!

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,015
It's okay.

54
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:30,384
Please. Please don't do this.

55
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:33,020
- Shut up!
- No, please.

56
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,062
No.

57
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:45,432
You're gonna want to see this, son.

58
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,768
No, James!

59
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,671
Please.

60
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:53,907
No. No, James.

61
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,575
No!

62
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,868
- Name?
- Hunter Zolomon.

63
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,305
Father killed the mother.
Kid saw the whole thing.

64
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:26,573
Next of kin?

65
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,342
No relatives wanted him.

66
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:31,345
He is all alone.

67
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:34,514
Follow me.

68
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:37,250
And don't dawdle.

69

70
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,873
Okay, you guys. I'm here.

71
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,975
- You got my location?
- You're good?

72
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,410
You don't need to, like,
stretch or something?

73
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,145
No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.

74
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:07,848
Let's take this tachyon
enhancer out for a test drive.

75
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,016
All right.

76
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,455
Hoo, yeah. I feel that.

77
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:17,924
That is the tachyon device
powering up the Speed Force

78
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,493
in your cells like a quick charge battery.

79
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,728
- How do you feel?
- Different.

80
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,630
Let's see how long
it takes you to get back here.

81
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:27,000
On my count.

82
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:29,636
Three, two, one.

83
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,838
Go!

84
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:37,210
Dang, this thing got you cruising.

85
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:39,780
- How fast does he normally go?
- Not this fast.

86
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:42,215
Not even close. Are his vitals okay?

87
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,885
Yeah, they're perfect.

88
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:48,922
Cool. It's like having a
pit-stop attached to your chest.

89
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:57,097
Guys, I can go faster.

90
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,632
Do it.

91
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,414
I'm back.

92
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,883
What... how long was I gone?

93
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,251
Let's put it this way,

94
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:20,587
you just annihilated your old record.

95
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,590
Yeah, you went four times
faster than you have ever been.

96
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:25,725
Four times?

97
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,228
- That's as...
- Fast as Zoom.

98
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,299
Well, faster actually.

99
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,401
Hey, uh, do we think that, um,

100
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:37,204
we can get this thing smaller?
It kind of sucks.

101
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:43,076
If it sucks, then, yeah.

102
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,011
All right, so now all we have
to do is figure out

103
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,146
how to get back to Zoom.

104
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,915
Yes, uh, just a minor issue.

105
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,116
We closed all the breaches

106
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:51,551
and have no idea how to reopen them.

107
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,487
We don't... Um, Wells?

108
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:54,821
Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.

109
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,256
Let's keep the breaches closed forever.

110
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,959
Forget about the breaches.
Forget about Zoom.

111
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,260
Wait, I'm sorry,

112
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,595
I thought that you were on board with this.

113
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:05,232
No. No. I said I would help you get faster.

114
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,033
I did not say I would help you give the man

115
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,835
who kidnapped my daughter and tortured her

116
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:10,303
a chance to do it again.

117
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:13,106
Hey, we are not gonna let that happen.

118
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,741
Oh, you're not gonna let that happen.

119
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:16,376
Gosh, I wish I'd known that the first time.

120
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:20,547
You don't understand
Zoom is different than us.

121
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,449
Zoom is not tied to anything.

122
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:25,151
Zoom does not care for anyone.

123
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:26,653
I do.

124
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,221
My daughter's out here
on this Earth somewhere.

125
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,557
I have to find her. We all have people

126
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,026
that we care about.
Zoom will use that against us.

127
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,997
Believe me.

128
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,598
Maybe we should just leave it be.

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,700
No, no. Look, no. Look, we're...

130
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:42,702
We're not turning our backs
on another Earth.

131
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,771
We're not gonna let Zoom

132
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,439
get away with everything that he's done.

133
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:52,045
Right now, there is no way
to another Earth, Allen.

134
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,214
Let's keep it that way.

135
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,619
We're getting back to Earth-2.

136
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:02,055
With or without his help.

137
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:04,224
Let's go to work.

138
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,828
Hey, where are you going?

139
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,564
We could use your help.

140
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,198
Uh, yeah, I would.

141
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,236
It's just I have a date with Scott.

142
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:19,072
- That's the editor?
- Yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,941
That's good. No, I'm glad
that you're finding a way

144
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,842
to move on without anything
holding you back.

145
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,077
You deserve that.

146
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,545
Yeah, and well, I would have been able

147
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,080
to do it without your support.

148
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,748
It means a lot to me, so...

149
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,883
- Of course.
- Thanks.

150
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,885
Yes, for sure.

151
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,421
Well hey, I mean, if you don't
get this breach problem

152
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:37,724
fixed by tonight, pencil me in for tomorrow?

153
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,793
I can do that.

154
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,161
Okay.

155
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:50,537
Man, I love it when you train

156
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,272
- in Keystone City.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,873
Hey, you sticking around after dinner?

158
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,242
Me and Wally are gonna watch Formula 1.

159
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:59,212
Mm. No, I can't.

160
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:00,814
I got to get back to the lab.

161
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,382
I'm still trying to find a way
back to Earth-2.

162
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,883
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

163
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,619
No, he refused.

164
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:09,289
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

165
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,724
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

166
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,126
about a man I shot at...
And punched in the face,

167
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,728
but I think you should listen to him.

168
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,529
Why?

169
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,972
Barry, it worries the hell out of me

170
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,907
the thought that you want
to go back to Earth-2.

171
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:23,021
I'm faster now.
I'm faster than I've ever been.

172
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,323
I'm faster than Zoom.

173
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,425
I can take him down.

174
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,494
All I'm saying is,

175
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,117
you already escaped the hornet's nest once.

176
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,785
Why go back and kick it again?

177
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,023
- Hey.
- Wally!

178
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,292
We got some pizza here
all the way from Keystone City.

179
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:40,561
Hope it's cool I brought my laundry over.

180
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,529
Of course. Barry used to do his laundry here

181
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,131
all the time when he was in college.

182
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,465
That's cause those machines in the dorm

183
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,200
always eat your quarters, right?

184
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:49,503
Actually, I'm not, uh,
living on campus anymore.

185
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,838
What? Since when?

186
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,107
Since room and board
became way more expensive

187
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,676
than I thought.

188
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,377
Man, I can help you out with that.

189
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,912
I mean, I figured your money must be tight

190
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,049
after paying
all your mother's medical bills.

191
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,751
How much more is it?

192
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,286
No, it's, uh, it's cool.

193
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,688
Come on, Wally, let me help you out.

194
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,656
Plus I got that mini-fridge in the garage.

195
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:10,824
You can use that, too, if you want.

196
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:13,894
Joe, I'm good. Really.

197
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:15,829
All right.

198
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,899
Uh, let me just put these in real quick.

199
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:24,838
Man, I can't figure that kid out sometimes.

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,174
I wonder if his doppelganger's
that complicated.

201
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,583
Hey. Wow.

202
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,452
Um, any ideas?

203
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,722
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

204
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:43,190
is to set off a nuclear warhead

205
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:44,791
next to the city's electrical grid, so...

206
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,694
We're not gonna do that. Um...

207
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,930
I think I thought of something though.

208
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,435
Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

209
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:56,803
Reverb.

210
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,306
What were Reverb's powers on your Earth?

211
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,408
He could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies

212
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,010
between Earths.

213
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,945
He could see through dimensions.

214
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:07,014
Find breachers, like Ramon.

215
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:09,516
I mean, we... we saw Reverb
do more than that though, right?

216
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:12,519
I mean, we saw him shoot vibrational bursts

217
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,921
out of his hands. Really painful ones.

218
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,323
What do you mean?

219
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,493
I... I mean, Reverb had
the ability to somehow

220
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,962
manipulate that multi-dimensional energy.

221
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:24,197
- What's your point, Allen?
- My point is...

222
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,600
if his powers are linked to the energy

223
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:29,036
that ties together the multi-verse...

224
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,771
if he can manipulate it...

225
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,639
Then he can open a breach
to any Earth he wants.

226
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:36,176
Exactly. And if Reverb could do it...

227
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,412
I could do it too.

228
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:43,250
Cisco, I think the way back
to Earth-2 is you.

229
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,544
I got nothing.

230
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,046
Try again, okay?

231
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,347
Barry, what if he can't do it

232
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:00,615
because he thinks he can't do it?

233
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,717
He can do it though. You can do it.

234
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:17,866
You... it's gonna work, okay.

235
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,868
Maybe we're just not in the right place.

236
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,103
Or maybe I'm just not
the right man for the job.

237
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,606
Right? Let's go.

238
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,908
Cisco.

239
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,545
I'm sorry, Barry.

240
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:33,748
It's gonna work.

241
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:45,260
Detective, um,

242
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:47,829
I need to ask you...

243
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,531
Oh, you've got company. Um...

244
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:54,102
No, it's, uh, cool.
I should be studying anyway.

245
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,237
Do you know
you kind of look like that guy...

246
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,741
- I'm not him.
- Okay.

247
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,943
Later, Joe.

248
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,748
Ah.

249
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,656
Thank you. Look, um,

250
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:17,459
I apologize for dropping by unannounced.

251
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,294
I just...

252
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:22,363
have you had any luck locating my daughter?

253
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:25,066
Not yet, but I circulated her picture

254
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:26,634
through every department in the region.

255
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:29,070
And I reached out
to some friends in Keystone.

256
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,106
She's smart.

257
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,740
She's gonna know how to stay hidden.

258
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,009
She's... We'll find her.

259
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,578
Right.

260
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,681
There's another thing also, Detective.

261
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:42,550
A favor.

262
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:45,420
I would ask you to talk Barry out

263
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,822
of reopening the breaches to my Earth.

264
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,663
Ah, I can't do that.

265
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:57,732
No.

266
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,602
You can't find a way to change his mind

267
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:02,704
for both our children's sakes?

268
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:04,606
Look,

269
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:09,477
I think it's just as dumb as you do.

270
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,513
but I learned a long time ago
that I can't talk Barry

271
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,648
out of anything once he sets his mind to it.

272
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,118
Zoom is terrorizing
this other world... your world.

273
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,722
He can't let it go.

274
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:24,859
But look, why don't you do me a favor?

275
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:27,228
Go with Barry.

276
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,329
Help him.

277
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,466
Help him?

278
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,301
Why would I do that?

279
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:36,671
'Cause he's got a much
better chance of defeating Zoom

280
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:39,374
if you're involved.

281
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,948
This area has the highest levels

282
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,617
of residual trans-dimensional energy.

283
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,020
Should be able to open
the breach that used to be here.

284
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:57,358
It's right here. This is it.

285
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
For real? In this Patch Adams
nightmare right here?

286
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:01,696
- Yeah.
- Love it.

287
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:03,198
All right.

288
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,967
Look, dude, if this doesn't work,

289
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:09,037
I'll stop asking you to do this, all right?

290
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,906
Okay.

291
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:23,985
What?

292
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:26,454
I can't do it.

293
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,723
That's right.

294
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,291
You can't.

295
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,126
What are you doing here? You said...

296
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,596
I know what I said.

297
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,764
But you're not gonna stop, are you?

298
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:38,399
No.

299
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,568
Okay, Barry Allen,
then I'm gonna do what I can

300
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,605
to make sure you don't get killed.

301
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,540
I recalibrated these

302
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,909
to the electromagnetic frequency
of this Earth.

303
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:52,247
It should help you access enough
of the trans-dimensional energy

304
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,617
to manipulate it.

305
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,719
Just like Reverb.

306
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,087
All I'm missing is the guyliner

307
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,422
and the transformation's complete.

308
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,191
Take 'em out for a spin.

309
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:37,592
It's working.

310
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:59,580
Keep coming, Cisco. Keep coming.

311
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,482
It's working.

312
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,165
Hey, what... what happened?
You were doing it.

313
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,334
No, no, no, no. I-I can't do this.

314
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,135
- What?
- Don't.

315
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:23,838
Please, don't ask me to do this.

316
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,140
Please.

317
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:33,195
Hey. What do we got?

318
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:35,264
It's your tachyon
absorption enhancer upgrade.

319
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,366
Retrofitted from when
it was used to steal your speed,

320
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:41,473
to now give you more of it.

321
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:42,813
Almost done.

322
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,415
That's amazing. Thank you.

323
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,283
You're welcome.

324
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,085
Is Cisco back yet? Have we seen him?

325
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,321
- I haven't seen him.
- Check his workshop.

326
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,189
Yeah, all right.

327
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,191
- Hey.
- Hey.

328
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:57,595
We just came by to see
if you guys needed some help.

329
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,764
- Oh.
- Uh, sure.

330
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:00,931
- Yeah.
- We can always use

331
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,199
an extra set of hands.

332
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,267
Do you want to help me in the med bay?

333
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,236
Yeah.

334
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:06,604
- So this...
- Huh?

335
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,439
- This whole Wally thing...
- Uh-huh.

336
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,107
He won't let me help him.

337
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,909
It's probably 'cause you're not

338
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:14,045
offering the right kind of help.

339
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:16,914
Wally doesn't want your help
paying for a place to live.

340
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,484
He wants you to offer him a place to live.

341
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,486
- Why didn't he just say that?
- I don't know.

342
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,155
So he does want to live in our house?

343
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:25,756
Yeah, man.

344
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:28,459
Look, Wally's never lived
with his father before.

345
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,428
And trust me, that is a big deal.

346
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,762
Huh. And you're good with it?

347
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,464
Mm-hmm. I mean, you know,

348
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,433
it's been you and me
for so long, and I love that,

349
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,168
but having Wally around would be cool too.

350
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,038
Just we won't get to have
as much pizza from Keystone.

351
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,740
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I'm sorry.

352
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:45,276
Have to get used to that.

353
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,712
They really have a special bond, don't they?

354
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:52,149
Yeah, they sure do.

355
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:55,386
Are you okay?

356
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:59,457
I don't know what I am.

357
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,425
Last night, I was supposed to go on a date.

358
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,961
My first real date since Eddie died,

359
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:07,932
but at the last second,
I just... I couldn't do it.

360
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:12,002
Is it because of Eddie or because of Barry?

361
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:14,472
I've noticed the way you've been
looking at him recently.

362
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,207
Is it that obvious?

363
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,476
Only to a woman who's been
through the same thing.

364
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:19,944
Everything seems to be telling me

365
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,346
that Barry and I are meant to be together.

366
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,482
I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.

367
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:27,051
In the future, we're supposedly married.

368
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,220
And now that I'm finally ready to move on,

369
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,989
I just wonder if that should be with Barry.

370
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,959
Everything seems to be
pointing in that direction.

371
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:38,229
Do you believe in destiny, Caitlin?

372
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:40,397
Maybe for you.

373
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:47,004
Hello?

374
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:52,710
- Joe?
- Wally, I'm up here.

375
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:57,915
Hey. What are you doing?

376
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,183
It's not done yet.

377
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,451
I mean, you can decorate it how you like.

378
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,453
- Make it your own.
- Whoa, wait, Joe.

379
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,121
What is this?

380
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:06,423
Wally, forgive me.

381
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,292
When Barry and Iris went to college,

382
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,561
they couldn't get away fast enough.

383
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,029
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

384
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,665
It didn't even occur to me

385
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:17,301
that you might feel differently.

386
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,770
It's embarrassing, but it took Barry

387
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,572
to help me see that.

388
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:24,808
So, if you still haven't
found a place to live,

389
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,076
live here.

390
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:30,814
I mean, it's yours if you want to.

391
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,583
You're serious?

392
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,585
I'm not gonna do your laundry.

393
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,420
And I'm not washing dishes after you.

394
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,455
And this bed is going to be made
every morning before you leave.

395
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,291
And there will be no beer in that fridge,

396
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,960
but yeah, it's yours.

397
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,497
When can I move in?

398
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,766
Whenever you want.

399
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,634
All right.

400
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,436
Thanks, Dad.

401
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:04,648
Hey, man.

402
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:12,723
Look, um...

403
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:14,959
I know what it's like...

404
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:18,529
Zoom, getting in your head,

405
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,298
how scary that can be.

406
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,538
It's not Zoom.

407
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,406
It's me.

408
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,175
What do you mean it's you?

409
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:34,845
It's like right now I'm Anakin Skywalker.

410
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:36,380
I got the midi-chlorians.

411
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:38,182
I've got the goods.

412
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,084
The force is strong with me.

413
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,852
That is something I can feel.

414
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:45,956
But if I start opening breaches
into other worlds,

415
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:50,928
doing all this other crazy stuff
Reverb was doing, then...

416
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,430
what if this is how I become Vader?

417
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,299
Dude, you're never going to become Vader.

418
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,635
You don't know that.
That is what happened to Reverb.

419
00:20:57,637 --> 00:21:00,070
He learned how to use his abilities,

420
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,339
and when he felt that,

421
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,842
when he felt that power,

422
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,877
he succumbed...

423
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,679
to the dark side.

424
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:13,050
Look, I get it. I... I really do.

425
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,653
Every time I've learned a new ability,

426
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:18,122
I've been terrified
about what it might mean for me.

427
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:19,857
What it could do to me, you know?

428
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,394
But you were there with me

429
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:26,263
when I learned how to run on water,

430
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:28,198
when I ran up a building,

431
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,902
or traveled through time.

432
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,270
Just like I'm gonna be there

433
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:36,440
every step of the way with you.

434
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,409
You got something that Reverb never had,

435
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:41,478
and that's Caitlin and Joe

436
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,514
and Iris and Wells and me.

437
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,716
Friends who are gonna look out for you.

438
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,251
And we're more than just friends.

439
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,953
We're your family.

440
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,355
So what do you say?

441
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,624
Ready to put those things on again,

442
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,726
and go another round?

443
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,664
Let's do it.

444
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,599
All right.

445
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,675
You're all set.

446
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,444
He won't even know it's there.

447
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,280
'Cause whoever said
aesthetics aren't important.

448
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:18,282
Not me.

449
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:22,219
Let's go.

450
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,855
Hey, Cait, I know how hard

451
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:27,424
this is gonna be for you,
but we have to stop him.

452
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,792
I know, and I want to be supportive.

453
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,462
I just... I can't face Jay.

454
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:33,597
Or whatever his real name is.

455
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,265
What does that mean?

456
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:36,600
Well, you remember when I was looking

457
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:37,935
for his doppelganger, right?

458
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:39,937
Yeah. And you couldn't find him.

459
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:42,172
Because there is no
Jay Garrick on this Earth.

460
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:45,109
His doppelganger's name is Hunter Zolomon.

461
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:48,712
Hunter Zolomon?

462
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:50,314
Are you sure?

463
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:53,517
Yeah, why?

464
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,488
Well, because on my Earth,

465
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,492
Hunter Zolomon was
a convicted serial killer.

466
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:05,095
That's Jay?

467
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:08,732
No, that is Hunter.

468
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,701
Last public photo of Hunter Zolomon.

469
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,803
Instantly recognizable.
And people from my Earth...

470
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:14,772
on my Earth, serial killers are an anomaly,

471
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:17,107
so a lot of media attention to this.

472
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,976
There was a podcast.

473
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:22,146
When Hunter was 11,
his father killed his mother

474
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:23,680
right in front of him.

475
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,048
Father sent to prison,

476
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,850
Hunter grew up in the foster care system.

477
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:30,687
Years later he was convicted
on 23 counts of murder.

478
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:35,793
23? That's, like, some real
Hannibal Lecter type level.

479
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:38,061
After the trial, Hunter was sent

480
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,830
to the Saint Perez Mental Asylum

481
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:44,401
for the Criminally Insane...

482
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,504
given daily electroshock therapy.

483
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:50,374
Cure him of his urges
and then faded from view.

484
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:53,277
Until the night your
particle accelerator exploded.

485
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,413
That's right. The dark matter
crept into the mental asylum.

486
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,449
I had thought...

487
00:23:58,451 --> 00:24:00,551
piping the explosion underground
would limit exposure.

488
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:01,985
I was wrong.

489
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,954
All it did was create
an unstoppable monster.

490
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,248
He's not unstoppable.

491
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:07,985
Jay doesn't know that we know
who he really is.

492
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:10,721
He thinks that his past is a secret.

493
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:14,725
- So?
- I think I have an idea

494
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:17,127
of how we can stop him.

495
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,754
Are you sure Jay can't get in here?

496
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,323
Pretty sure, but just in case.

497
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,724
How do you use this?

498
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,493
All right, so you aim it,

499
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,895
- and then you pull the trigger.
- Smart ass.

500
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:34,096
Barry and Cisco are in position.

501
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:35,398
Let's hope this thing works.

502
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,434
- You ready, buddy?
- Yeah.

503
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,870
You've always believed in me.

504
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,840
- Thank you.
- You got this.

505
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,497
Reverb's doppelganger

506
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,400
has increased his powers.

507
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,970
Hatred is a strong motivator.

508
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:18,874
You were unwise to reopen the breach.

509
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,811
I'm not gonna let you
terrorize another world anymore.

510
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:25,948
Without your speed,

511
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,018
you won't be able to stop me.

512
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,187
Let's see.

513
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,030
- Zoom's gaining on Barry.
- He can't catch him.

514
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,665
He better not.

515
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,647
- That was close.
- Too close.

516
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,682
The tachyon device is working.

517
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:03,052
Here they come.

518
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,758
They're here.

519
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:20,202
Ah, you've gotten faster.

520
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:25,007
Good. There'll be more for me to take.

521
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,575
You want my speed?

522
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,384
Catch me.

523
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,477
You're gonna want to see this, son.

524
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,791
- Get him, Barry.
- It's working.

525
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,836
No!

526
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:45,354
How did you figure out who I was?

527
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,794
You made a mistake.

528
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,631
You told Caitlin who your doppelganger was.

529
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,902
I had to do something
to get her to stop trying

530
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,372
to fix me.

531
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,640
She's a smart girl.

532
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,279
- And that I was Zoom?
- The Velocity-9.

533
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,747
When you run fast enough,

534
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:15,484
it turns a speedster's lightning blue.

535
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,153
We would have helped you.

536
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:21,056
We would have done anything
we could to save your life.

537
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,926
Not everything.

538
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,462
Caitlin found you a cure.

539
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,364
A temporary one!

540
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,232
I'm dying, Barry!

541
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,202
There's only one thing
that can get me what I need.

542
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,603
And you just don't care

543
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,806
how many lives you destroy trying to get it?

544
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,376
- How many people you kill?
- No, I don't!

545
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:44,280
That feeling was taken from me
a long time ago.

546
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,453
We're not so different, you know.

547
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,490
What happened to us when we were kids.

548
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,693
You could have just as easily become me.

549
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,428
No.

550
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,164
I'd never become like you.

551
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,868
I got to say...

552
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,607
that was smart. Using, uh,
my parents against me.

553
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:16,245
Oh, family. Such a weakness.

554
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,047
Not for all of us.

555
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,084
Well, that's where you're wrong.

556
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,520
It's time I get what I came for.

557
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,425
You're not getting anything from me.

558
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,262
You're not getting anything
from anybody ever again.

559
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,765
On any Earth.

560
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:40,135
You can't lock up the darkness.

561
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:42,238
What did you just say?

562
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:50,613
You can't lock up the darkness.

563
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,060
No!

564
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:12,554
- He was right there.
- I know.

565
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,122
I mean, we had him.

566
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,425
We had him. I can't believe it.

567
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:29,571
- Wally?
- Up here!

568
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:03,071
Hey, hey, hey. Where are we?

569
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:06,908
Where are we?

570
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,645
Help! Somebody please help!

571
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:20,589
There's only one person
who can help you now.

572
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:29,097
The Flash.

573
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:31,433
The Flash? Why would he help me?

574
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:33,802
He doesn't even know who I am.

575
00:32:33,804 --> 00:32:37,673
Someone he cares about...

576
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:43,679
cares about you.

577
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:51,153
Dad?

578
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:52,521
Dad.

579
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,690
Coffee?

580
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:01,096
We're gonna get him back.

581
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:03,999
What if we could stop Zoom
through a vibe somehow?

582
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,300
We could weaponize the goggles...

583
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:06,735
Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.

584
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,336
Okay, what if we modify the pulse rifle

585
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,138
to emit a low-level EMF?

586
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,307
We don't have the equipment
to modify the pulse rifles now.

587
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:14,076
Then we do another snatch and grab mission.

588
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:16,144
By the time we scale those
cliffs, Zoom could already...

589
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:18,413
I need a minute.

590
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,379
Barry, I know you...

591
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:55,517
can't give up your speed
to that monster, but...

592
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,152
I also know that I want to get my son back,

593
00:33:57,154 --> 00:34:00,288
and I don't know what to do.

594
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,791
I do.

595
00:34:04,895 --> 00:34:08,697
Wally, he's... he's part of the family.

596
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,032
He's... he's a part of...

597
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:13,869
our family.

598
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:15,871
And we do whatever we have to

599
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:19,307
to keep the ones we care about safe.

600
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,976
No, you...

601
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,744
you can't give up your speed.

602
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,080
That's not your decision.

603
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:32,587
This is the only way, Joe.

604
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:43,098
- Barry, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

605
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,233
I mean, we don't even know
if he'll be able to hear me.

606
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:47,402
He'll hear you.

607
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:07,022
I see him.

608
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,128
Wally's alive.

609
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,132
Thank God.

610
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,034
Do you see Jay?

611
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:27,342
I see him.

612
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:31,813
He can sense me.

613
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:33,648
Jay?

614
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,654
Vibe.

615
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:41,857
He'll do it.

616
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,760
Barry will give you his speed.

617
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,451
Babe.

618
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,624
- Dad?
- Wally, hold on.

619
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,793
Let him go.

620
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:19,501
We had a deal.

621
00:36:19,503 --> 00:36:22,371
My speed for Wally's life.

622
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:28,310
Hand him over, and it's yours.

623
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,611
- You okay?
- Yeah.

624
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:31,380
You need to get out of here now.

625
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:32,881
- Okay.
- Go fast.

626
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:35,417
- Cisco!
- Let's go.

627
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,856
Let's get this over with.

628
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:02,511
This thing is how I stole

629
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,212
The Flash's speed the first time.

630
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:06,081
Now all he needs to do is run,

631
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:11,019
and his Speed Force
will transfer into this vial.

632
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,755
but only as long as I calibrate it.

633
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:16,992
Get to work.

634
00:37:16,994 --> 00:37:18,860
Wells.

635
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,705
One day...

636
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,942
I'm gonna knock that smug
expression clean off your face.

637
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:44,152
So this was your plan all along, huh?

638
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:47,189
Ever since the skies parted
and showed me another world...

639
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:49,057
with another speedster.

640
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,560
Once I saw you, I came here,

641
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,963
figured out what I had to do.

642
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:56,765
How are you still alive?

643
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,233
We saw you die.

644
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,701
You did.

645
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:02,537
So what was that? A speed mirage?

646
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:05,740
Speed mirage?

647
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:10,612
Uh, no. Even I'm not that fast.

648
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:14,082
I knew that I couldn't be
on two Earths at the same time,

649
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:17,285
so I went back in time and, uh,

650
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:19,321
met another version of myself.

651
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:22,390
Your time remnant. Like the Reverse-Flash.

652
00:38:22,392 --> 00:38:25,427
I also knew that the only way
to make Barry become faster

653
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:30,499
was if you all witnessed
your old pal Jay die.

654
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:33,401
When did you decide to do that?

655
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:36,771
Oh, once you closed all
the breaches, went to Earth-2.

656
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,773
Believe me, getting my time remnant

657
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,777
to agree to me murdering him
took a bit of convincing.

658
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:46,481
But once he saw the...
well, the genius in my plan,

659
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:49,518
he was all for it.

660
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:54,823
Who's the man in the iron mask?

661
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,325
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

662
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:00,795
Why the charade?

663
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,797
Running around dressed like The Flash?

664
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,900
To give people hope, Detective.

665
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:06,001
Hope?

666
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:09,471
So I could rip it away from them.

667
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,406
It's so fun

668
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:14,643
pretending to be a hero.

669
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,180
You are no hero.

670
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:21,416
You're nothing but a monster.

671
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:26,087
You're a monster.

672
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:28,256
No!

673
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:38,266
- Barry.
- It's all right, Joe.

674
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:20,909
He's slowing down.

675
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:24,212
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

676
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:27,315
He's becoming human again.

677
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,730
Barry, are you okay?

678
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:45,667
I'm okay. I'm okay.

679
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,987
Ahh!

680
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:11,493
- Thank you, Flash.
- Jay, stop.

681
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:13,461
Please.

682
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,634
If anything you ever said to me was true,

683
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:22,137
or anything we ever shared was real,

684
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:25,273
then please just let him go. Please.

685
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,476
I know some piece of you did care for me,

686
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:31,346
so if you have any humanity left,

687
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:33,882
then please, let him go.

688
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:49,364
Caitlin!
