1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,009
That's it. Get it right to the top.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,606
Steady. Steady.

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,961
Up she goes.

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,327
Hey, come on. Put your back into it.

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,966
Here you are, son.

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,967
- Oh, gentlemen, please.
- To my right.

7
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,610
And you lot, come on.
Come on, get it moving.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,205
Come on, come on.

9
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,402
In all my days I've never seen a man
swing an ax like that.

10
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,846
How many men did it take
to cut you down?

11
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,047
Just one.

12
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,002
He must have been
some kind of monster.

13
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,331
He was a woman.

14
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,606
I think some of the men
are a bit afraid of you.

15
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,846
I'm used to it.

16
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,406
When I found you,
I thought you'd been dead for days.

17
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,167
Well, you were stinking already,
and you had bugs all over you

18
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,567
and bone was coming through
right there.

19
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,766
I was gonna give you a proper burial,
and then you coughed.

20
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,166
Nearly shit myself.

21
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,049
I reckoned you were gonna die

22
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,600
by the time I loaded you on the wagon,
but you didn't.

23
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,605
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times
over the next few days, but you didn't.

24
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,966
What kept you going?

25
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,167
Hate.

26
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,651
No, there's a reason
you're still here.

27
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,326
Aye, there's a reason.
I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.

28
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,441
No, a reason.

29
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,171
Gods aren't done with you yet.

30
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,164
I've heard that before.

31
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,728
Man was talking about
a different god though.

32
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,644
Well, maybe he was right.
I don't know much about the gods.

33
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,090
You're in the wrong line of work.

34
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,003
There's plenty of pious
sons of bitches

35
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,731
who think they know the
word of god or gods.

36
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,280
I don't. I don't even
know their real names.

37
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,402
Maybe it is the Seven.
Or maybe it's the Old Gods.

38
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,721
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

39
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,406
Or maybe they're all the
same fucking thing.

40
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,766
I don't know.

41
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,601
What matters, I believe,

42
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,081
is that there's something
greater than us.

43
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,725
And whatever it is,
it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.

44
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,566
You didn't know me back in my time.

45
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,328
You don't know the things I've done.

46
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,809
I've heard stories.

47
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,570
If the gods are real,

48
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,129
why haven't they punished me?

49
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,166
They have.

50
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,761
Your Grace.

51
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,769
What are we reading today?

52
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,368
The Book of the Mother,
Your Holiness.

53
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,484
Chapter three, verse 12.

54
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,764
As water rounds the stones,
smoothing...

55
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,808
Smoothing what was jagged,

56
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,521
so does a woman's love
calm a man's brute nature.

57
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,601
A wife salves her husband's wounds,

58
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,047
a mother sings her son to sleep.

59
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,041
You learn quickly.

60
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,922
You know, there are some
who know every verse of the sacred text,

61
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,445
but don't have a drop of the Mother's
mercy in their blood,

62
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,564
and savages who can't read at all

63
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,043
who understand the Father's wisdom.

64
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,124
For years I pretended
to love the poor, the afflicted.

65
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,165
I had pity for them, but
I never loved them.

66
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,124
They disgusted me.

67
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,202
They are hard to love.

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,163
The poor disgust us
because they are us,

69
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,924
shorn of our illusions.

70
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,009
They show us what we'd look like
without our fine clothes.

71
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,082
How we'd smell without perfume.

72
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,050
Can I ask you about
a personal matter?

73
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,601
Of course.

74
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,085
The King mentioned that since your reunion
you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.

75
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,921
No.

76
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,049
You have a duty, Your Grace.

77
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,691
To your husband, your king,
your country,

78
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,726
to the gods themselves.

79
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,001
It's just...

80
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,201
The desires that once
drove me no longer do.

81
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,367
Congress does not require desire
on the woman's part,

82
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,480
only patience.

83
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,644
The King must have an heir

84
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,847
if we are to continue
our good work.

85
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,566
Forgive me.

86
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,607
Sometimes the true path
is hard to find.

87
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,650
Hard to find and harder
still to walk upon.

88
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,362
But you've made great progress.

89
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,288
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead.

90
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,281
My grandmother?

91
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,967
Yes.

92
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,326
The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable
woman, a strong woman,

93
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,004
and an unrepentant sinner.

94
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,801
You must teach her the new way

95
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,484
as she taught you the old.

96
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,323
Or I fear for her safety,

97
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,245
body and soul.

98
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,729
Does it move or talk?

99
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,688
I want to speak with you alone.

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,844
Septa Unella has been
my true friend and counselor.

101
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,684
This is madness!

102
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,805
You're not in your sanctuary
now, my dear.

103
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,601
All I have to do is whistle and my men
will stroll in here and bash you about...

104
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,603
- Grandmother.
- Until I tell them to stop.

105
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,804
If I tell them to stop.

106
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,922
- You could use a good bashing.
- Grandmother, please.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,331
What have they done to you?

108
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,131
You marched against the High Sparrow,
against the Faith.

109
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,361
We marched for you.

110
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,284
The gods could have punished
you and Father, but they didn't.

111
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,124
- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

112
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,929
What mercy did they show him?

113
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,050
Loras' only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

114
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,044
If he does, the Faith will allow him
to return to Highgarden.

115
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,642
He'll have to renounce
his name and title...

116
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,371
- Have you lost your mind?
- And live his life as a penitent.

117
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,001
He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

118
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,525
He can begin again.

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,170
As a mindless fanatic.

120
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,969
As a free man.

121
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,808
You will leave for Highgarden today.

122
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,406
There is no law that
says you must stay here.

123
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,485
I am the Queen.

124
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,963
It is my duty to serve
my husband, the King.

125
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,690
But you should leave, Grandmother.

126
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,210
Your place is at home.

127
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,127
I will never leave you. Never.

128
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,201
You must.

129
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,724
Go home.

130
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,931
Find comfort in prayer and good works.

131
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,208
The Mother watches over us all.

132
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,289
I'll see you soon, my dear.

133
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,244
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

134
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,651
Shall we pray?

135
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,131
We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,
when the time comes, and we meant it,

136
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,929
but this isn't what we agreed to.

137
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,571
These aren't White Walkers.

138
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,364
This isn't an army of the dead.

139
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,450
This isn't our fight.

140
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,970
If it weren't for him,
none of us would be here.

141
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,440
All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

142
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,603
And I'd be a pile of charred bones,
just like Mance.

143
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,085
Remember Mance's camp?

144
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,362
It stretched all the way to the horizon.

145
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,444
And look at us now.

146
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,524
Look what's left of us.

147
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,086
And if we lose this, we're gone.

148
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,043
Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.

149
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,929
Be like we were never there at all.

150
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,843
We'll be the last of the free folk.

151
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,402
That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

152
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,007
The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,

153
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,005
they know you're here.

154
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,045
They know that more than half of you
are women and children.

155
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,562
After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

156
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,366
You're right.

157
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,124
This isn't your fight.

158
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,689
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

159
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,489
I shouldn't be asking you.

160
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,130
It's not the deal we made.

161
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,247
I need you with me
if we're going to beat them,

162
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,324
and we need to beat them
if you're going to survive.

163
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,562
The crows killed him
because he spoke for the free folk

164
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,570
when no other Southerners would.

165
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,410
He died for us.

166
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,571
If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

167
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,889
And if that's what we are,

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,486
we deserve to be the last
of the free folk.

169
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,601
Snow.

170
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,605
Are you sure they'll come?

171
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,727
We're not clever like you
Southerners.

172
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,849
When we say we'll do something,
we do it.

173
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,443
I heard you were leaving
King's Landing.

174
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,723
That is hardly your concern.

175
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,763
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

176
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,604
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

177
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,002
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

178
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,527
The High Sparrow rules this city
because of you.

179
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,365
Our two ancient houses face collapse

180
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,842
because of you and your stupidity.

181
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,161
You're right.

182
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,529
I made a terrible mistake.
I carry it with me every single day.

183
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,327
Good.

184
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,250
I delivered an army of fanatics
onto our doorstep.

185
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,168
And now we must fight them together.

186
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,046
We need each other.

187
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,850
I wonder if you're the worst person
I've ever met.

188
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,840
At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

189
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,564
But the truly vile do stand out
through the years.

190
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,845
Do you remember the way
you smirked at me

191
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,766
when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?

192
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,565
I do. I'll never forget it.

193
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,240
You love your granddaughter.

194
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,445
I love my son.

195
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,924
It's the only truth I know.

196
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,570
We must defend them.

197
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,604
I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can,

198
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,605
before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

199
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,362
If you're half as bright as you think you
are, you'll find a way out of here too.

200
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,521
Never.

201
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,645
I'll never leave my son.

202
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,725
What'll you do then?

203
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,851
You have no support. Not anymore.

204
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,964
Your brother's gone.
The High Sparrow saw to that.

205
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,960
The rest of your family
have abandoned you.

206
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,042
The people despise you.

207
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,441
You're surrounded by enemies,
thousands of them.

208
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,449
You're going to kill them all
by yourself?

209
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,690
You've lost, Cersei.

210
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,284
It's the only joy I can find
in all this misery.

211
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,810
Pick the pace up.

212
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,721
Keep going.

213
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,845
Keep it moving!

214
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,527
Now, that is a sorry attempt
at a siege.

215
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,162
Someone needs to teach those sad twats
how to dig trenches.

216
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,129
Someone certainly does.

217
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,808
No, no. Not me.

218
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,604
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

219
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,331
You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

220
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,402
Aye, knights don't get paid.

221
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,569
You have better instincts than any officer
in the Lannister army.

222
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,240
That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

223
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,889
I expect to command
all the Lannister forces before long.

224
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,925
You can be the right hand I lost.

225
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,131
You promise me a lordship
and a castle

226
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,208
and a highborn beauty for a wife.

227
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,760
And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always...

228
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,730
Don't say it.
Don't fucking say it.

229
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,406
Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

230
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,803
We have Lord Edmure.

231
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,485
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

232
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,682
This is your last warning.

233
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,964
Yield the castle.

234
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,362
You think I won't do it, old man?

235
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,041
I sliced your niece's throat
from ear to ear.

236
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,920
And where were you?
Running and hiding like a fucking coward.

237
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,325
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

238
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,171
Go on then. Cut his throat.

239
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,406
Lothar, is it?

240
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,241
Ser Jaime.

241
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,605
We didn't know you were coming.

242
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,320
'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.

243
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,444
You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.

244
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,287
Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.

245
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,044
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

246
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,681
Walder.

247
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,885
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

248
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,648
Only a fool makes threats
he's not prepared to carry out.

249
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,644
Now, let's say I threatened to hit you

250
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,485
unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.

251
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,403
- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's...

252
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,527
I'm here by the King's command
to take back this castle.

253
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,044
Have him bathed and fed.

254
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,562
Unless you'd like to take his place.

255
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,770
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

256
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,330
Do as he says.

257
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,722
The siege is now under my command.

258
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,567
The next time the Blackfish looks out
from those ramparts,

259
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,371
he'll see an army at his gates,
not whatever this is.

260
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,888
Have your lads start
digging perimeter trenches.

261
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,564
Set pickets every hundred yards.

262
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,126
And work double-time
on those siege towers and trebuchets.

263
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,440
Those are our siege towers...

264
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,040
As I said,
the siege is under my command.

265
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,689
If that's not to your liking,
go home.

266
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,009
Get word to the Blackfish.

267
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,005
I want a parley.

268
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,811
A parley or a fight?

269
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,886
He's an old man.

270
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,925
You've got one hand.

271
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,885
My money's on the old boy.

272
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,171
Lady Mormont.

273
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,290
Welcome to Bear Island.

274
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,927
I remember
when you were born, my lady.

275
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,684
You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

276
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,331
It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be too.

277
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,401
I doubt it.

278
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,245
My mother wasn't a great beauty
or any other kind of beauty.

279
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,209
She was a great warrior though.

280
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,608
She died fighting for your brother Robb.

281
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,803
I served under your uncle
at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

282
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,929
He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

283
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,684
I was his steward. In fact...

284
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,684
I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

285
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,171
Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black

286
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,891
before he marched on Winterfell
and was killed.

287
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,640
He showed me the letter you wrote to him
when he petitioned for men.

288
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,523
- It said...
- I remember what it said.

289
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,244
Bear Island knows no king

290
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,846
but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

291
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,081
Robb is gone,
but House Stark is not.

292
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,490
And it needs your support
now more than ever.

293
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,042
I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.

294
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,487
As far as I understand, you're a Snow,
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

295
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,445
Or is she a Lannister?

296
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,729
I've heard conflicting reports.

297
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,124
I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.

298
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,966
But I am a Stark.
I will always be a Stark.

299
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,201
If you say so.

300
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,326
In any case,
you don't just want my allegiance.

301
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
You want my fighting men.

302
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,564
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

303
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,524
It is our duty to stop him.

304
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,241
Even more so because he holds our brother,
Rickon Stark, as prisoner.

305
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,209
What you have to understand,
my lady, is that...

306
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,251
I understand that I'm responsible
for Bear Island and all who live here.

307
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,564
So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont
life for someone else's war?

308
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,210
If it please my lady,

309
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,410
I understand how you feel.

310
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,007
I don't know you, Ser...

311
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,162
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

312
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,682
You needn't ask your maester
about my house.

313
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,250
It's rather new.

314
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,486
All right,
Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

315
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,449
How is it you understand how I feel?

316
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,531
You never thought
you'd find yourself in your position.

317
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,808
Being responsible for so many lives
at such a young age.

318
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,644
I never thought I'd be in my position.

319
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,803
I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

320
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,007
And now I find myself addressing the lady
of a great house in time of war.

321
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,690
But I'm here because
this isn't someone else's war.

322
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,450
It's our war.

323
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,891
Go on, Ser Davos.

324
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,531
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

325
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,448
made that man his steward.

326
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,245
He chose Jon to be his successor

327
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,641
because he knew
he had the courage to do what was right,

328
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,048
even if it meant giving his life.

329
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,402
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

330
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,689
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

331
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,322
It's between the living and the dead.

332
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,922
And make no mistake, my lady,

333
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,011
the dead are coming.

334
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,846
Is this true?

335
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,731
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist of the First Men.

336
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,370
I fought them at Hardhome.

337
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,845
We both lost.

338
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,801
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell,
the North is divided.

339
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,487
And a divided North won't stand a chance
against the Night King.

340
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,761
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

341
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,288
But there's no hiding from this.

342
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,245
We have to fight,

343
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,881
and we need to do it together.

344
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,887
House Mormont has kept faith
with House Stark for 1,000 years.

345
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,243
We will not break faith today.

346
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,330
Thank you, my lady.

347
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,363
How many fighting men
can we expect?

348
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,441
Sixty-two.

349
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,726
- Sixty-two?
- We are not a large house,

350
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,211
but we're a proud one.

351
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,604
And every man from Bear Island
fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

352
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,605
If they're half as ferocious as their lady,
the Boltons are doomed.

353
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,921
Kingslayer.

354
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,646
Blackfish.

355
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,529
I assume you're here
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

356
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,926
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

357
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,002
- I don't have them.
- Pity.

358
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,131
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

359
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,886
- Then why are you here?
- You know why I'm here.

360
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,124
This castle belongs to House Frey.

361
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,804
You're trespassing.

362
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,611
In the name of King Tommen,
I order you to surrender or...

363
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,768
Or you'll kill Edmure?

364
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,126
My nephew's marked for death
no matter what.

365
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,611
Hang him and be done with it.

366
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,489
It won't stop with Edmure.

367
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,449
You'll force me to storm the castle.

368
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,885
Hundreds will die.

369
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,968
Hundreds of mine.
Thousands of yours.

370
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,361
If you can breach the walls.

371
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,521
We'll breach them
and kill every last one of you.

372
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,645
But if you surrender,

373
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,921
I'll spare the lives of your men.

374
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,371
On my honor.

375
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,204
Your honor?

376
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,409
Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

377
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,409
The war is over, ser.

378
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,482
Why sacrifice living men
to a lost cause?

379
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,651
As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

380
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,048
This is my home.

381
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,249
I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

382
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,168
So you can either attack

383
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,082
or try to starve us out.

384
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,447
We have enough provisions
for two years.

385
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,768
Do you have two years,
Kingslayer?

386
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,410
You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

387
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,240
Why did you come treat with me?

388
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,130
Sieges are dull.

389
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,043
And I wanted to see you in person,
get the measure of you.

390
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,720
Well, now you have.

391
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,928
Aye, now I have.

392
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,490
I'm disappointed.

393
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,046
The answer is no.

394
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,650
Lord Glover,
if you could just hear us out.

395
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,245
I've heard enough.

396
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,891
We've only just taken back this castle
from the ironborn.

397
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,162
The Boltons helped us do it.

398
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,049
Now you want me to fight
against them?

399
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,088
I could be skinned for even
talking to you.

400
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,481
The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton...

401
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,450
Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

402
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,364
House Mormont.

403
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,606
And?

404
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,084
We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...

405
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,844
I don't care about ravens.

406
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,448
You're asking me to join your army.

407
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,330
Who is fighting in this army?

408
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,567
The bulk of the force is
made up of wildlings.

409
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,804
Then the rumors are true.

410
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,124
I didn't dare believe them.

411
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,044
I received you out of
respect for your father.

412
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,483
Now I would like you to leave.

413
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,689
House Glover will not abandon
its ancestral home

414
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,366
to fight alongside wildlings.

415
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,283
- Lord Glover...
- There's nothing else to say.

416
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,524
I would remind you that House Glover
is pledged to House Stark.

417
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,202
Sworn to answer when called upon.

418
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,690
Yes, my family served House Stark
for centuries.

419
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,684
We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

420
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,086
When my brother was lord of this castle,
he answered Robb's call

421
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,242
and hailed him King in the North.

422
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,281
And where was King Robb
when the ironborn attacked this castle?

423
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,209
When they threw my wife
and children in prison

424
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,764
and brutalized and killed
our subjects?

425
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,524
Taking up with a foreign whore.

426
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,241
Getting himself,
and those who followed him, killed.

427
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,602
I served House Stark once,

428
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,887
but House Stark is dead.

429
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,689
Why did we have to come here?

430
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,889
Some of us still like it.

431
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,966
Have a drink at least.

432
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,606
I don't want one.

433
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,371
Don't go far, love.

434
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,565
I'll find you in a bit.

435
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,243
Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.

436
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,366
Doesn't interest you anymore?

437
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,850
I'm sorry.
I won't joke about it.

438
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,163
I'll never hurt you, little brother.
Don't you know that?

439
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,489
You think
Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

440
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,891
Of course he is.

441
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,883
As long as we're alive,
we're a threat.

442
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,806
He'll find us.

443
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,645
It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.

444
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,881
Drink.

445
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,566
I don't want any.

446
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,529
I don't care what you want.
Drink.

447
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,411
Drink it all.

448
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,811
You're ironborn, Theon.

449
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,091
- I know you've had some bad years.
- Some bad years?

450
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,482
But I'm tired of watching you
cower like a beat dog.

451
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,766
Drink the goddamn ale.

452
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,485
Now listen to me.

453
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,206
I need you.

454
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,762
The real Theon Greyjoy,
not this rat-shit pretender.

455
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,924
Can you find him for me?

456
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,401
Drink.

457
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,125
You escaped. You hear me?

458
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,251
You got away
and you're never going back.

459
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,526
We'll get justice for you.

460
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,490
If I got justice, my burnt body
would hang over the gates of Winterfell.

461
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,881
Fuck justice then. We'll
get revenge. Drink.

462
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,565
Listen to me.

463
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,970
If you're so broken
that there's no coming back,

464
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,329
take a knife and cut your wrists.

465
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,960
End it.

466
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,807
But if you're staying, Theon,
I need you.

467
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,562
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

468
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,802
We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.

469
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,840
And we're gonna take back
the Iron Islands.

470
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,567
Are you with me?

471
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,802
Are you really with me?

472
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,481
Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,

473
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,324
I'm gonna go fuck the tits
off this one.

474
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,291
Stannis camped here
on his way to Winterfell.

475
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,690
And that's a good thing?

476
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,086
He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.

477
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,602
He chose this place for a reason.

478
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,442
Those mountains are a
natural fortification.

479
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,329
There's a stream down there
for the horses.

480
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,164
We're not staying here long.

481
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,004
Another storm could hit any day.

482
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,210
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis
as much as the Boltons did.

483
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,209
We have to march on Winterfell now,
while we still can.

484
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,208
Two thousand wildlings,

485
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,011
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

486
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,764
Sixty-two Mormonts.

487
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,723
It's not what we'd hoped for.

488
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,722
But we still have a chance,
if we're careful and smart.

489
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,605
For fuck's sake.

490
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,520
So he's your most trusted advisor now?

491
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,329
Because he secured 62 men
from a 10-year-old?

492
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,880
Ser Davos is the reason
I'm standing here talking to you

493
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,042
and he served Stannis for years.

494
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,001
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,
who murdered his own brother,

495
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,684
who doesn't have a head?

496
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,644
It's not enough.
We need more men.

497
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,167
There's no time.

498
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,402
If we went down to Castle Cerwyn,
I know that Lord...

499
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,721
We fight with the army we have.

500
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,207
Friends,
this is not worth fighting over!

501
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,606
This'll be it, now.

502
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,360
Right, now we don't need
to be fighting...

503
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,884
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.

504
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,650
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

505
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,527
I was a soldier once.

506
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,809
All my superiors thought I was brave.

507
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,123
I wasn't.
I mean, I never ran from a fight.

508
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,249
Only because I was afraid
my friends would see I was afraid.

509
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,402
That's all I was, a coward.

510
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,286
Who followed orders
no matter the orders.

511
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,604
Burn that village.

512
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,160
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

513
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,966
Steal that farmer's crops.
Good, I'm your thief.

514
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,041
Kill those young lads
so they won't take up arms against us.

515
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,886
I'm your murderer.

516
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,370
I remember once
a woman screaming at us,

517
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,126
calling us animals,
as we dragged her son from their hut.

518
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,450
But we weren't animals.

519
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,728
Animals are true to their nature,
and we had betrayed ours.

520
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,730
I cut that young boy's throat myself

521
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,521
as his mother screamed
and my friends held her back.

522
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,725
That night...

523
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,764
I felt such shame.

524
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,762
Shame was so heavy on me,
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

525
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,605
All I could do was stare into that dark sky

526
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,048
and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.

527
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,120
I'll hear her screaming
the rest of my life.

528
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,649
Now, I know I can never
bring that lad back.

529
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,487
All I can do with time I've got left
is bring a little goodness into the world.

530
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,809
That's all any of us can do, isn't it?

531
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,169
Never too late to stop robbing people,
to stop killing people,

532
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,930
and start helping people.

533
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,601
It's never too late to come back.

534
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,727
And it's not about waiting for the gods
to answer your prayers.

535
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,211
It's not even about the gods.

536
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,486
It's about you.

537
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,444
Learning you have to answer
your prayers yourself.

538
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,443
Seven save you, friends.

539
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,885
How can we help you?

540
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,685
What are you doing here?

541
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,725
Well, we're talking about life.

542
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,961
You?

543
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,926
Protecting the people.

544
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,768
Well, we thank you for your protection.

545
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,770
Who are you protecting us from?

546
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,971
Do you have any horses?

547
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,561
No horses. No gold. No steel.

548
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,441
Food then.

549
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,763
Protecting the people is hungry work.

550
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,490
I'm sure it is.

551
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,806
You're welcome to stay for supper,
but we have hungry mouths here.

552
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,165
Stay safe.

553
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,969
The night is dark and full of terrors.

554
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,721
Seven save you, friends.

555
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,091
I'm a fucking septon.
What was I supposed to say?

556
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,286
They don't believe in your Seven.

557
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,886
They're from the Brotherhood.
They follow the Red God.

558
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,928
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

559
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,010
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

560
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,210
Sure, you do. You've got food, you've
got steel, even if you say you don't,

561
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,761
and you've got women.

562
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,411
What do you want to do?
Fight them?

563
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,285
Kill them?

564
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,805
It'd be you against all of them.

565
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,723
I mean, these people
don't know how to fight.

566
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,721
You do.

567
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,528
I'm done with fighting.

568
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,920
Even if it's to protect yourself?

569
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,487
Violence is a disease.

570
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,769
You don't cure a disease
by spreading it to more people.

571
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,888
You don't cure it by dying either.

572
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,800
You've done enough work for one day.
Come on up for some supper.

573
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,490
It's gonna be a cold night.

574
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,162
We'll need firewood.

575
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,362
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

576
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,444
Might even have some ale hidden away.

577
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,041
He's not a lying man.
He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.

578
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,043
I'm inclined to believe him.

579
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,600
I'm not going anywhere
near those mad fuckers.

580
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,603
You're Westerosi.

581
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,370
What do you care?

582
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,090
I want to book passage home.

583
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,362
You? Can't afford it.

584
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,401
Where'd you steal this from?

585
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,891
What do you care?

586
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,604
We leave in two days.

587
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,122
You can have a hammock in steerage.

588
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,651
I want a cabin.

589
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,610
And we'll leave at dawn.

590
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,571
See you at sunrise.

591
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,687
Sweet girl.
