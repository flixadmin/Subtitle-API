1
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,138
More.

2
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,190
Another.

3
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,735
Careful, Señor.

4
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,321
Hot day like today...

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,657
...too much oiI in the machine...

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,368
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:40,415
There are two kinds of men in this world.

8
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,250
Those who drink...

9
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,335
...and those who pour.

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,505
Shut up and fill my glass.

11
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,934
Hey, you two.

12
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,561
Yes, you.

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,272
I used to be just Iike you.

14
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,859
Worked dirt for the 
man till my hands bled.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,736
But no more.

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,365
Because I learned that 
a man can never drink his fill...

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,617
...by waiting in line for the tap.

18
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,369
Listen to him.

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,289
He can teach you something!

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,961
Hey, how you doing, boss?

21
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,134
Good to see you, my friend.

22
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,472
You know, I never pegged 
you for such a deep thinker.

23
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,807
I keep thinking I should write a book.

24
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,059
Maybe, maybe....

25
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,317
So, what brings you to 
this burro's asshole of a town?

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,778
I knew l would find you here.

27
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,741
Don't you have something to deliver?

28
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,910
Cutting it close, aren't you?

29
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,663
Lots of time.

30
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:08,169
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

31
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,629
Finishes first.

32
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,089
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

33
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,593
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

34
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,512
Yeah?

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,181
You've got such a way with words.

36
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,519
They flow like a waterfall.

37
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,437
I like that about you.

38
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,656
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

39
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,783
No, I feel terrible.

40
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,495
So bad I came aIl the way 
here to this burro's asshole...

41
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,288
...to give you your present.

42
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,540
Present?

43
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,626
Come on, boss.
No need to go too the trouble.

44
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,045
Forget it, I wanted to.

45
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,131
I have it for you in the back.

46
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,431
Back there?

47
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,077
Yes. Come. Follow me.

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,152
It's perfect!

49
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,071
Do you really like it?

50
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,033
I love it!

51
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,411
What a great pet it will make.

52
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,912
Thank you, boss!

53
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,539
Excellent.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,166
Let me sign it for you.

55
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,877
Let me sign it...

56
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,092
..."For the big talker."

57
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,870
Gentlemen. Welcome.

58
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,206
Thank you for coming.

59
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,709
Any difficulty at the border?

60
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,212
The day I can't get across 
the border is the day I retire.

61
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,132
Please, come in.

62
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,052
I apologize that it's not wheeIchair accessible.

63
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,024
My apologies, Gustavo.

64
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,485
Of course, you shouId have been advised.

65
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,739
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

66
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:51,369
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

67
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,039
Indeed, he is.

68
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,417
So you're in business with this Heisenberg.

69
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,253
I don't know him by that name,
but yes.

70
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,422
I've made no secret of the fact that...

71
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,968
...l have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

72
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,848
You and I,
we still make money together.

73
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,103
It's never affected our relationship.

74
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,608
Don Salamanca had a nephew named Tuco.

75
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,235
Yes, I knew of him.

76
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,531
Then perhaps you know 
Salamanca mentored him in the business.

77
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,785
Thought of Tuco as a son.

78
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,248
When Don Salamanca was no longer able, 
Tuco took over for his uncle.

79
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,627
He was a key man in our
organization north of the border.

80
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,962
He was loyal.

81
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,799
This Heisenberg, WaIter White...

82
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,551
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.

83
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,804
Until he betrayed Tuco.

84
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:56,226
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

85
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,145
Tuco's cousins here...

86
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,022
...they have the right to exact vengeance.

87
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,817
The Salamanca family, the Cartel...

88
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,903
...everyone stands 
shoulder to shoulder on this.

89
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:10,949
Don Salamanca.

90
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,118
Gentlemen.

91
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,620
I feel your loss deeply.

92
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,332
Please accept my condolences.

93
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:25,839
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

94
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,803
But l am presently 
engaged in business with this man.

95
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,181
When our business is done...

96
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:40,186
...he wilI no longer be
of any concern to me.

97
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,774
Until then...

98
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,195
...l need him alive.

99
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,995
Excuse us.

100
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,054
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

101
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,725
You shouId really leave matters
of my organization's politics to me.

102
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:22,353
Do I not run my own territory?

103
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,897
Of course you do.

104
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,149
And I will advise them to be patient.

105
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,652
But l recommend you finish 
your business with the man quickly.

106
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,655
Or you risk Iosing
the good graces of the Cartel.

107
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,908
That would not be wise.

108
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,538
And those boys inside...

109
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,333
...l cannot guarantee that they will listen.

110
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,920
They are not like you and I.
