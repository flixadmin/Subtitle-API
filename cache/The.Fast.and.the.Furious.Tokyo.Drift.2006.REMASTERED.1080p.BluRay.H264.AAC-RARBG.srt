1
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,164
Nice ride.

2
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:10,792
It does the job.

3
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,712
What job, delivering pizzas?

4
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,091
Well, it's not the ride, it's the rider.

5
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,764
- What the hell was that?
- What?

6
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,642
Hey! You talking to my girl?

7
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,769
- Oh, shit. Here we go.
- Yeah.

8
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,106
She was just admiring my ride.

9
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,524
"My ride."

10
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:38,153
My grandma's Buick could smoke
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

11
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,864
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

12
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,909
This beast's got 500 horsepower
and a Borla exhaust system.

13
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,370
It does 0 to 60 in like 4.3 seconds...

14
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,164
- That's about right. That's about right.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,583
Wow. You can read the brochure.

16
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,609
What a pitch, baby. What a pitch.
I like that.

17
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,903
What's he gonna do?

18
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:21,988
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

19
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:34,167
I got your back.

20
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:39,589
Why don't you nice boys let your cars do the talking?

21
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:43,301
I only race for pink slips.

22
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:46,096
This car goes for 80 grand.

23
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:49,390
What would I do
with a broken-ass piece of shit like that?

24
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,230
How about me?

25
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,362
Winner gets me.

26
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,205
Cut it, let's out it. Let's go, go, go, go!

27
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:29,013
Blast-off, baby!

28
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:33,601
First one out the other side...

29
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,980
- It's time.
- Let's go!

30
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:39,482
- Ready, boys?
- Make it interesting, Clay.

31
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,444
Shit!

32
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,123
Yeah!

33
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,736
I thought you loved me.

34
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,246
Oh, Well.

35
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,508
What the hell?

36
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,687
Guess I got a new date for prom.

37
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,741
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

38
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,752
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

39
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,086
Stop it!

40
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,760
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

41
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,958
Can I get a copy of that?

42
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,254
You think this is a joke, huh?

43
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,507
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

44
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,427
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

45
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,971
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

46
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,976
But I like screw-ups like you.

47
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:29,439
You know why?
'Cause you're 100% guaranteed conviction.

48
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,691
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

49
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:32,775
You did what?

50
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:33,943
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

51
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,361
You're done. You understand me?
You're done.

52
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:37,212
And all before your eighteenth birthday.
Now sit down.

53
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,659
Sean.

54
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,246
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

55
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,207
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

56
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,418
It's, um...

57
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:51,878
It's Miss.

58
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:58,551
Officer, is it illegal to smoke in here?

59
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,937
It's a tough state.
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

60
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,275
He'll be lucky if they don't try him as an adult.

61
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:19,155
This is our third town in two years.

62
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,410
Your son's got two priors for reckless
driving, willful destruction of property.

63
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,454
This makes it strike three.

64
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:29,165
They're definitely gonna want to get him off the streets.

65
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:32,084
Well, there's just got to be another way.

66
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:43,304
So, where are we moving this time?

67
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,975
We are not moving anywhere.

68
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:44,300
Sean.

69
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,219
I thought you were gonna be here on the 7th.

70
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:48,929
Today is the 7th.

71
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:52,892
Well, look, just hold on one second.

72
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:20,586
Come on in.

73
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,967
This is it.

74
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,727
You know, Sean, I was gonna be there.

75
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,855
But your mom, she said the 7th, see,

76
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:42,566
and we're a day ahead of you in Japan.

77
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,780
Well, you're here now, and that's good.

78
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,450
So, how is your mom?

79
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:55,121
Where do I sleep?

80
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:58,165
Now, Sean, you know she had no other choice.

81
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,960
I mean, it was either this or juvi hall,

82
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,215
I mean, you just can't keep moving away
every time you get into trouble.

83
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:07,842
Worked for you.

84
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:13,639
Look, neither of us asked for this.

85
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:17,184
But I promised your mom I'd take care of you.

86
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,646
So you just go by the rules her and I agreed to,

87
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,774
- ...and I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
- Rules?

88
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,986
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

89
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:30,698
You go to school, you come back here right after.

90
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,827
And I don't want to see or hear
about you anywhere near a car.

91
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:39,123
Here, the bedroom is yours.

92
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,964
Make yourself comfortable.

93
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:51,051
Lights out in 10.

94
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,696
You got to be kidding.

95
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:51,881
Wrong train.

96
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,465
I'm new here.

97
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,264
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

98
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,417
Uwabaki.

99
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,327
Japanese food is like the Army.

100
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:05,829
Don't ask, don't tell.

101
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,501
Name's Twinkie.
Hey, I noticed you ain't have a laptop.

102
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:13,545
Yeah?

103
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:16,256
I'll hook you up. Half price.

104
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,801
No, I'm cool.

105
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:22,179
60% off.
Since we're both army brats and everything.

106
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:25,099
I ain't got no cash, man.

107
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:26,976
And I ain't an army brat.

108
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,396
All right, all right.
Well, what about a cell phone, huh?

109
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,273
Everybody needs a cell phone.

110
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:34,900
No offense,

111
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:38,988
but I'm probably not gonna be here
long enough to remember your name.

112
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,491
Then you gonna need some
new shoes to book town with, man.

113
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:45,661
You like Michael Jordan?
I love Michael Jordan.

114
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:48,455
Check this out.

115
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:51,291
Brand new Jordans. Not even out yet.

116
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,586
LeBron James couldn't even get his hands on those.

117
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,799
You selling that Sparco steering wheel?

118
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:01,301
Hell, no. That's mine right there.

119
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:03,929
Man, I even paid retail for it.

120
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,973
What you drive?

121
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:07,516
- My ride?
- Yeah.

122
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,060
- My ride's one of a kind.
- Show me.

123
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:13,647
Thought you weren't sticking around.

124
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:15,607
All right.

125
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:10,579
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

126
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:11,663
Ooh!

127
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,500
At least let me drive.

128
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,044
Y'all better have some real cars around here.

129
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,506
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh? Well, all right.

130
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:22,800
I don't know if you're ready for them, though.

131
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,927
You look a little nervous.

132
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,012
What up, Tosh?

133
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:03,882
For when you blow your wad, man.

134
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,566
Hear that?

135
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,443
It's still not right for the way I drive.

136
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:07,237


137
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,740
I don't need a computer
to tell me about my throttle response.

138
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,242
Okay. Then we're done here.

139
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:17,706
You wouldn't have that problem with a V8.

140
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,625
Boys.

141
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,086
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

142
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:25,964
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

143
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:31,053
So y'all race with these things, huh?
Cute little toys.

144
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,933
You know, I almost didn't recognize you
without your slippers on.

145
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,935
Don't you mean uwabaki?

146
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:40,604
Neela, right?

147
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,273
You're a quick learner.

148
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,736
So, where you from, anyway?

149
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:48,987
Here.

150
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:52,783
No, I mean, not where you live.
Where'd you come from?

151
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:55,160
Does it really matter where I'm from?

152
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:04,461
Who's the tourist?

153
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,383
What's with you and the schoolgirls, D?

154
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:12,678
You're moving up in the world.
You gotta elevate your company.

155
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,847
Wednesday, Wednesday, meet Thursday.
God. Girl.

156
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:23,438
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

157
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,192
He was just leaving.

158
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,366
I'm sorry. I don't speak Japanese.

159
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:40,831
Understand that? Gaijin?

160
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,165
Takashi.

161
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,251
We were just talking.

162
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:46,211
This isn't your scene.

163
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:51,174
That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,

164
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,885
what does that mean exactly?

165
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,347
Means, turn around,

166
00:24:58,432 --> 00:24:59,641
keep walking.

167
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,185
That's exactly what we gonna do.
Come on, man, let's roll.

168
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,729
Yo, look, man, he's yakuza.

169
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:06,773
Now, see, that's funny,

170
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:09,901
'cause I thought this was, like, a free country

171
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:13,697
where a girl could talk to whoever she wants.

172
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,702
You know who I am, boy?

173
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:23,248
Yeah. You're like
the Justin Timberlake of Japan, right?

174
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,255
Leave.

175
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:33,550
Damn, man. You know yakuza? The Mafia?

176
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,348
Look, sorry, DK-san.
Monkey didn't have his banana today.

177
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,141
Hey, D, let's go.

178
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,684
It's time to race.

179
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,648
Good luck, Timberlake.

180
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,994
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

181
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,791
Then let's race.

182
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:11,630
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

183
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,635
Easy to sound cocky when you got no ride.

184
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:18,637
Take mine.

185
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,142
Let's race.

186
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:30,774
What? I wanna see what the kid's got.

187
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:38,990
Can he drive?

188
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:41,535
Can he drive?

189
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,664
You know what DK stands for?

190
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,041
Donkey Kong?

191
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,835
Drift King.

192
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:52,671
Drift?

193
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,590
What do you mean, drift?

194
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,313
Still need a dictionary?

195
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,357
You know that real famous painting?

196
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,818
The one of the woman who's smiling all the time?

197
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,112
- The Mona Lisa.
- Right, right, right. Mona Lisa.

198
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:20,574
Well, look, man, this car right here's
like the Mona Lisa of the drift world.

199
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:23,368
Han rebuilt this bad boy from ground up.

200
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:27,956
We talking forged pistons,
bigger turbo, new rods, new crankshaft.

201
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:32,294
Hey, man,
Han's labor ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

202
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,590
Well, if I needed a
thirty-second lesson on how to drift...

203
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:39,342
All right, look, man,
there's lots of ways you can do this, all right?

204
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:40,510
Hand braking is the easiest,

205
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,971
so the first thing I want you to do,
I want you to rip that e-brake.

206
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:46,725
All right, after you rip the e-brake,
then I want you to power over.

207
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:50,812
You know what?
Just don't mess up Mona, all right?

208
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:52,230
All right.

209
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,369
Ready.

210
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:49,871
Set.

211
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,792
Go!

212
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,959
I told you.

213
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,043
Damn it!

214
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

215
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,007
Damn it!

216
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,277
Don't leave town.

217
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:07,045
Do you know what time it is?

218
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:09,380
I thought it was around 7:00.

219
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,759
You know, US is a few hours behind.

220
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:18,598
Looks like the party was better here, anyway.

221
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:23,561
Have you been racing, Sean?

222
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:29,400
You're out of here.

223
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,155
Go ahead.

224
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,450
You don't get it, do you?

225
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:39,661
You have nowhere else to go.

226
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:44,207
If it doesn't work out here,
you're going to jail. Do you get that?

227
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,839
This isn't a game.
And I'm gonna tell you one more time,

228
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:55,760
if you're gonna live under my roof,
you're gonna go by my rules or get out.

229
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:58,012
Understand?

230
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,557
Understand?

231
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,934
Yes, sir.

232
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,819
Get in.

233
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:57,405
I'll get you your money.

234
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:00,658
Why you talking like you have a choice?

235
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:17,884
There's a guy in there with a paw
that owes me some money.

236
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,135
A Paw?

237
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:22,430
Go get me my money.

238
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:26,309
Okay.

239
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,699
Han said,

240
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:25,827
okane.

241
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:36,421
Han send, okane.

242
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:06,659
Let's go.

243
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,670
You're in the pickup and delivery business now.

244
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:20,339
I might call you once a week or once an hour.

245
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:23,718
I don't care if you're sick as a dog
or in bed with Beyoncé.

246
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,470
I call, you show.

247
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:30,391
- Only if you teach me how to drift.
- This ain't a negotiation.

248
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:32,602
I wasn't negotiating.

249
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:22,819
What's he doing here?

250
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:26,864
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can sitting in my garage.

251
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:28,825
Hope he's not driving.

252
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,121
Gaijin.

253
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:37,834
When is your next race?
I'd really like to be there.

254
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:40,795
Why not be in it?

255
00:38:40,878 --> 00:38:45,341


256
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:47,468
You heard me.

257
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:50,721
Ready to lose another car, Han?

258
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:54,350
I'm ready to take that '86 Corolla off your hands.

259
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:57,562
All right.

260
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,814
Put up the '72 Skyline.

261
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,066
Done.

262
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:06,237
What do you think, Morimoto?

263
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,409
Get him out of here.

264
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,370
We have business to discuss.

265
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,215
Your shipment's late.

266
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:29,427
Since when are you so worried about the details?

267
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:33,806
When is the shipment arriving, Han?

268
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,935
Just sit pretty and let me handle it.

269
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,584
Hey, Dad, it's me.

270
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:05,796
I had to stay after school
for some extracurricular activities.

271
00:40:06,214 --> 00:40:08,216
So I'll be home a little later.

272
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:11,761
Sir.

273
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:17,058
You really need to stop following me around.

274
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,143
What are you doing here?

275
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:23,731
I thought I'd stop by and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons.

276
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:27,235
Trust me.
You don't wanna be a part of this world.

277
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:29,445
It's good enough for you.

278
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:31,530
You don't know anything about me.

279
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:33,908
Well, why don't you think I know?

280
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,369
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

281
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:39,497
Let me guess.

282
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:42,667
You're an army brat who moved around a lot.

283
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,253
Your mama and daddy was never home.

284
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:48,256
So you walked around pissed off all the time.

285
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:51,676
And now you found your family with these drift nuts.

286
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:57,181
Zero for one, cowboy.

287
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,989
Why can't you go find a nice Japanese girl
like the rest of the white guys around here?

288
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,913
Is everything okay back there?

289
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:23,332
I can handle DK.

290
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:26,168
I thought he's yakuza.

291
00:41:26,836 --> 00:41:28,546
His uncle's yakuza.

292
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:33,050
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

293
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:37,471
But I need him.

294
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:41,392
He keeps Uncle Kamata from poking around too much.

295
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:43,561
What do you mean?

296
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:48,190
Well, his uncle gets a piece of the action
from everyone on his turf.

297
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:49,942
We're on his turf.

298
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:54,405
50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.

299
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:58,743
So have you raced DK?

300
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:01,620
Why not? Is he that good?

301
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,248
What's the point of a race?

302
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,710
To see if I'm better than the other guy.

303
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:09,837
Just proves you're faster, that's all.

304
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,341
If I were to race, it would have to be
for something important.

305
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:15,426
Or why else do it at all?

306
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,680
Why are you letting me race?

307
00:42:19,764 --> 00:42:21,974
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

308
00:42:23,476 --> 00:42:25,269
And you owe me a car.

309
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,085
Oh, shit.

310
00:42:56,592 --> 00:42:57,760
What the...

311
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:00,429
Police cars here are only factory-tuned.

312
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:05,101
You can do better than 180k,
they can't catch you, so they don't even try.

313
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:10,815
You know what?
I'm beginning to like this country already.

314
00:43:26,622 --> 00:43:27,790
Danny!

315
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,501
You're looking good.

316
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,839
Disco.

317
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,265
We gotta catch up.
Get you a drink on me, huh?

318
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:45,641
Let's go.

319
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:00,197
Uh-oh.

320
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:02,116
Easy now, ladies.

321
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,370
Come on.

322
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:12,460
What's up? How you doing?

323
00:44:12,543 --> 00:44:13,878
Hey, baby.

324
00:44:32,396 --> 00:44:35,608
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.
He's underage.

325
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:41,614
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

326
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,658
- All these girls, man, they look like...
- What, models?

327
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:45,826
Check it out.

328
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,079
See, Tokyo is the fashion capital
on this side of the planet, all right?

329
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:52,041
Now, imagine you been posing all day.
I mean, that's a lot of hard work.

330
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:53,709
Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that,

331
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:57,338
you wanna have a little fun, but you can't
'cause you don't even know nobody in town.

332
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,674
And most of the guys around here are
too chicken shit to even try picking up one.

333
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:02,426
So what do you do?

334
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:06,514
Man, you talk to the
little dude who makes you laugh.

335
00:45:06,597 --> 00:45:07,681
Yeah.

336
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,311
Look, man, I don't just
think outside the box. I tear it up.

337
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:13,979
That's my thing.

338
00:45:14,104 --> 00:45:15,105
Yo!

339
00:45:22,196 --> 00:45:23,280
Sean!

340
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:10,077
The red Evo's yours.

341
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:23,674
What do you mean?

342
00:46:24,508 --> 00:46:26,093
You're representing me now.

343
00:46:26,176 --> 00:46:29,179
What you think, I'm gonna let you roll in a Hyundai?

344
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:56,248
Oh, man.

345
00:47:01,795 --> 00:47:02,880
Damn it.

346
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,716
You call that drifting?

347
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:12,181
My mother, she's blind in one eye
and she can drift better than that.

348
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:17,102
Han, where did you find this guy?

349
00:47:18,312 --> 00:47:21,065
Will someone please teach this guy how to drift?

350
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:46,256
Is that yours?

351
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:48,550
Sure is.

352
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,393
What happened?

353
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:02,064
I don't know. I found it this way at the base.

354
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,528
It's got potential.

355
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,785
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

356
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,376
You know, Sean, the Japanese have a saying.

357
00:48:25,504 --> 00:48:27,965
"The nail that sticks out gets hammered."

358
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,804
You're gonna be late.

359
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,525
Sean!

360
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:08,505


361
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:10,507
Come on, man, you broke it.

362
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:16,930
Hey, whoa, whoa.

363
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:20,017
There must be a misunderstanding.

364
00:49:20,684 --> 00:49:23,812
Out of my way, or you're next.

365
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:26,815
- Take it easy.
- Look, man, I don't do refunds, all right?

366
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:29,193
Okay, let's go, then! Let's go!

367
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:30,944
Touch me again...

368
00:49:34,656 --> 00:49:35,741
Here.

369
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:38,869
Try not to break this one.

370
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:55,886
Say, man!
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

371
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:58,806
Now everybody's gonna want exchanges around here.

372
00:49:58,889 --> 00:49:59,973
Damn!

373
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:14,905
Not easy saving the day, is it?

374
00:50:15,656 --> 00:50:18,534
Maybe you could give me some pointers sometime.

375
00:50:18,617 --> 00:50:20,285
You're doing all right.

376
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,579
Thanks.

377
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,167
Hey.

378
00:50:28,377 --> 00:50:29,461
Yeah?

379
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:32,631
Sorry about the other night.

380
00:50:33,257 --> 00:50:35,592
Your life isn't any of my business.

381
00:50:37,177 --> 00:50:38,554
It's okay.

382
00:51:00,868 --> 00:51:01,952
Foul!

383
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,663
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

384
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:06,123
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

385
00:51:06,206 --> 00:51:08,709
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

386
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,043
A wanker?

387
00:51:10,127 --> 00:51:12,337
What do I look like, a zebra?

388
00:51:19,052 --> 00:51:21,638
So, how did you end up over here, anyway?

389
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:25,142
Well, you know those old Westerns

390
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,770
where the cowboys make a run for the border?

391
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,150
This is my Mexico.

392
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,364
Why'd you let me race with your car?

393
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:41,742
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

394
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:43,577
Why not?

395
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:46,914
'Cause it's a lot of money.

396
00:51:46,997 --> 00:51:48,498
I have money.

397
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,669
It's trust and character I need around me.

398
00:51:54,338 --> 00:51:58,508
You know, who you choose to be around
you lets you know who you are.

399
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:04,139
And one car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of,

400
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:06,767
that's a price I can live with.

401
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:13,523
Look at all those people down there.

402
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,526
They follow the rules, for what?

403
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:20,113
They're letting fear lead them.

404
00:52:22,032 --> 00:52:24,159
What happens if they don't?

405
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:29,206
Life's simple.
You make choices and you don't look back.

406
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:47,557
So, if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?

407
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,978
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

408
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:53,355
Okay. Let's go.

409
00:54:10,766 --> 00:54:13,310
There's no "wax on, wax off" with drifting.

410
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:15,145
Learn by doing it.

411
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:20,233
The first drifters invented drifting
out here in the mountains by feeling it.

412
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:21,943
So feel it.

413
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:35,707
Again!

414
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:40,504
- What's in this bag?
- You'll see.

415
00:54:40,879 --> 00:54:43,882
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.

416
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:52,933
I'm so good, man, I could sell rubbers to a monk.

417
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,022
Again.

418
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:22,337
Again.

419
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:34,516
Watch it. Watch it. Not too early, now.

420
00:55:40,188 --> 00:55:42,149
Go, go, go, go!

421
00:55:51,658 --> 00:55:53,493
Not bad.

422
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,579
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

423
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:34,784


424
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:37,245


425
00:56:40,874 --> 00:56:42,334


426
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,592
Hey, Twink. Get this man a bunk.

427
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:07,168
Pleasure doing business.

428
00:58:11,006 --> 00:58:14,009
Yeah, baby. I told you. I told you, didn't I?

429
00:58:53,673 --> 00:58:57,594
It's actually not bad.
I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.

430
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:00,805
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

431
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:06,686
I hate that word. It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

432
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:10,315
I thought you were born here.

433
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:13,485
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.

434
00:59:18,782 --> 00:59:20,825
My mom died when I was ten.

435
00:59:22,202 --> 00:59:25,663
She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

436
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:29,876
And all I know about her is
that she went to work in a hostess bar.

437
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,131
DK's grandmother took me in.

438
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,179
Well, my parents split up when I was three.

439
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:46,059
Me and Mom moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.

440
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:50,063
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

441
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,484
Kind of made myself an outsider, you know,

442
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,986
without even thinking about it.

443
00:59:59,114 --> 01:00:03,118
But I realize now, outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

444
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,996
All that matters is knowing what you really want

445
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:09,707
and going after it.

446
01:00:29,853 --> 01:00:32,647
We used to come up here when we were kids.

447
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:36,443
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,

448
01:00:36,526 --> 01:00:39,070
come up here, and watch the older kids drift.

449
01:00:45,785 --> 01:00:47,829
Things were different back then.

450
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:54,711
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.

451
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:57,881
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.

452
01:00:58,047 --> 01:01:00,717
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.

453
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:06,222
The day I got my license
is the day I got my first speeding ticket.

454
01:01:06,306 --> 01:01:08,725
The day after that, I won my first race.

455
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:11,769
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.

456
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:15,523
I gotta admit, it felt good.

457
01:01:17,317 --> 01:01:18,610
It felt like...

458
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:21,112
Like everything else just disappears.

459
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:26,284
- No past and no future.
- No problems.

460
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,246
Just the moment.

461
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,438
Boy needs to chill.

462
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,151
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna grab another set.

463
01:02:00,235 --> 01:02:02,487
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Another set?

464
01:02:02,779 --> 01:02:06,908
No. Look, that was your third set today.
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

465
01:02:17,293 --> 01:02:20,880
DK, grab a chair.
We're about to roast some marshmallows.

466
01:02:21,923 --> 01:02:23,633
Yo, come on, man, look...

467
01:02:35,979 --> 01:02:37,730
Stay away from her,

468
01:02:37,939 --> 01:02:41,234
or the only thing
you'll be driving is a wheelchair.

469
01:02:47,282 --> 01:02:49,075
Find yourself a new driver.

470
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:04,340
- I'm all right.
- What'd you expect?

471
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:08,803
You didn't just play with fire,
you soaked the matches in gasoline.

472
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,536
It's over.

473
01:03:54,307 --> 01:03:57,644
- All this over a gaijin?
- I am a gaijin.

474
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:02,273
You've changed, DK.

475
01:04:07,654 --> 01:04:09,447
You say I've changed.

476
01:04:11,783 --> 01:04:14,410
But we're not so different, you and I.

477
01:04:15,703 --> 01:04:18,539
We're both products of screw ups, aren't we?

478
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:27,799
They say your mom was the best trick

479
01:04:27,882 --> 01:04:30,426
in all of Kabukicho back in the day.

480
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:32,553
Leave my mother out of this.

481
01:04:32,637 --> 01:04:36,057
If we hadn't taken you in, you'd be just like her,

482
01:04:36,933 --> 01:04:38,976
doing anything for a buck.

483
01:04:40,103 --> 01:04:44,107
Think anyone would take a second look
at you if it wasn't for your uncle?

484
01:04:57,704 --> 01:04:59,580
We're the same, Neela.

485
01:05:03,459 --> 01:05:06,629
Difference is I know who I am and where I belong.

486
01:05:12,552 --> 01:05:14,512
Do you know who you are?

487
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:20,852
Do you know where you belong?

488
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,164
Hey.

489
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,462
Come on.

490
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,117


491
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:38,290


492
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,585


493
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:42,669


494
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,464


495
01:06:46,757 --> 01:06:50,135


496
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,263


497
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,608


498
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:11,114


499
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:16,077


500
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:20,332


501
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:26,963


502
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:34,471


503
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,642


504
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:44,397


505
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,945


506
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,699


507
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,243


508
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:02,332


509
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:05,335


510
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:08,546


511
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,592


512
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,679


513
01:08:32,862 --> 01:08:36,074


514
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:33,840
Hey, brother.

515
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,052
I vouched for you!
Put my reputation on the line for you!

516
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:39,637
We were partners!

517
01:09:40,054 --> 01:09:42,891
You think you can keep your side deals from me?

518
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:45,894
Come on. We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

519
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:49,147
- This is what we do.
- Takashi!

520
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,864
What about now?

521
01:09:58,114 --> 01:09:59,282
Hmm?

522
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,743
Is this what we do?

523
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:04,913
Man, you need me.

524
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:08,708
You'd still be shaking down tea houses
for chump change if it wasn't for me.

525
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,012
- Get in!
- Go! Go! Go!

526
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:26,309
Come on.

527
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:49,303
Sean, Sean!

528
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:36,012
Takashi.

529
01:16:36,596 --> 01:16:37,597


530
01:16:45,354 --> 01:16:47,523
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

531
01:16:57,909 --> 01:16:59,035
Okay.

532
01:17:00,244 --> 01:17:01,621
I'll go with you.

533
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,289
Neela.

534
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:16,677
See you when Daddy's not around.

535
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,328
- I'm putting you on a plane tonight.
- Dad...

536
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,038
Sean, don't argue with me.

537
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,916
I did this. I can't run away.

538
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:49,085
I can't.

539
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:52,880
Sean, I'm your father.
I'm responsible for your well-being.

540
01:17:53,422 --> 01:17:55,466
And I'm responsible for my mess.

541
01:17:58,594 --> 01:18:00,388
I gotta do this.

542
01:18:02,598 --> 01:18:04,558
Can you understand that?

543
01:18:20,616 --> 01:18:23,327
At least you're not redoing my mistakes.

544
01:18:52,064 --> 01:18:53,816
You all right, man?

545
01:18:57,695 --> 01:19:01,032
We're leaving town.
Look, I know some people...

546
01:19:03,117 --> 01:19:04,910
I can't do it, Twink.

547
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,956
Look, DK wants your head.

548
01:19:09,832 --> 01:19:11,167
All right?

549
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:15,880
And the trouble you just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.

550
01:19:18,424 --> 01:19:21,844
- Maybe I should talk to Kamata.
- What?

551
01:19:23,387 --> 01:19:25,056
DK answers to him.

552
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,144
I know I just didn't hear that.

553
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:35,524
I gotta end this. I'm gonna go talk to him.

554
01:19:35,608 --> 01:19:37,610
What, are you crazy, huh?

555
01:19:37,818 --> 01:19:39,403
Han is dead, all right!

556
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:42,490
Plus, you can't just
walk into Kamata's place, man!

557
01:19:45,618 --> 01:19:47,161
It's all I got.

558
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,921
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

559
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,937
What's this?

560
01:20:14,563 --> 01:20:18,984
You're gonna need it if you're gonna
make it out of Kamata's place alive.

561
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,739
Don't you need it?

562
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:28,953
No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.

563
01:21:02,653 --> 01:21:05,948


564
01:21:38,856 --> 01:21:39,940
Sean.

565
01:21:44,695 --> 01:21:46,363
You need to leave.

566
01:21:46,697 --> 01:21:48,824
You came to the wrong place.

567
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,202
I didn't come here to see you.

568
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:52,870
Takashi.

569
01:21:53,704 --> 01:21:55,414


570
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,042


571
01:21:59,084 --> 01:22:00,502


572
01:22:01,295 --> 01:22:04,590


573
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:22,733
You think...

574
01:22:23,817 --> 01:22:28,364
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

575
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:34,536
I know I'm only returning what belonged
to you in the first place, sir.

576
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:38,249
But that's not why I really came.

577
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,918
I came here to apologize.

578
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,799
I know your nephew and I
have embarrassed ourselves badly.

579
01:22:46,924 --> 01:22:48,926


580
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:51,303


581
01:22:52,805 --> 01:22:55,683


582
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:56,934


583
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:02,564
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.

584
01:23:05,192 --> 01:23:07,653
How do you plan to accomplish that?

585
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:10,281
A race.

586
01:23:15,494 --> 01:23:19,623
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you, for us.

587
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:25,337
And I'm asking you to allow us
to settle this, once and for all.

588
01:23:27,172 --> 01:23:28,382
We race

589
01:23:30,134 --> 01:23:32,219
and the loser leaves town for good.

590
01:23:32,303 --> 01:23:35,139
I've already beat this piece of shit once!

591
01:23:35,306 --> 01:23:36,432
Good.

592
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,810
Then it should be easy.

593
01:24:18,349 --> 01:24:20,476
The cops took all the cars.

594
01:24:20,726 --> 01:24:21,810
Hey!

595
01:25:38,303 --> 01:25:40,013
That's why she's spitting.

596
01:26:03,454 --> 01:26:06,999
We almost there, Twink. Couple more tweaks.

597
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,919
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.

598
01:26:12,296 --> 01:26:15,799
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.

599
01:26:18,302 --> 01:26:21,430
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.

600
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:16,455
Yeah!

601
01:30:23,713 --> 01:30:25,381
- Yeah!
- Yes!

602
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:24,941
Come on.

603
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,411
Yeah! Come on!

604
01:31:37,495 --> 01:31:40,122
- Come on, Sean.
- Let's go! Let's go!

605
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:41,832
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

606
01:32:10,277 --> 01:32:12,530
Damn! Come on, man! That ain't right.

607
01:34:22,618 --> 01:34:24,662
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talking about, man.

608
01:34:24,745 --> 01:34:26,122
I told you!

609
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,235


610
01:35:30,895 --> 01:35:33,022
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

611
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:35,399
Hey, check this out, man.

612
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:38,527
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

613
01:35:39,528 --> 01:35:42,323
Heard he's been beating everybody around Asia, too.

614
01:35:42,406 --> 01:35:44,241
Not tonight, Twinkie.

615
01:35:47,703 --> 01:35:49,371
Said he knew Han.

616
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,713
Said Han was family.

617
01:36:11,727 --> 01:36:13,062
All right.

618
01:36:13,437 --> 01:36:14,563
Let's race.

619
01:36:41,799 --> 01:36:43,133
Nice ride.

620
01:36:43,592 --> 01:36:46,595
I won it from my friend Han, a few years ago.

621
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,350
I didn't know he was into American muscle.

622
01:36:51,433 --> 01:36:53,936
He was when he was rolling with me.

623
01:36:56,563 --> 01:36:59,024
You know this ain't no ten-second race.

624
01:36:59,483 --> 01:37:01,402
I got nothing but time.

625
01:37:04,989 --> 01:37:06,532
You ready, kid?

626
01:37:17,418 --> 01:37:19,086
Come on, Sean! Come on!

627
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:22,298
Ready!

628
01:37:25,384 --> 01:37:26,468
Set!

629
01:37:30,764 --> 01:37:31,807
Go!
