1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,664
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:04,023
- Hello, John.
- You opened the door, love.

3
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:06,442
And Mallus wasn't the
only thing that got out.

4
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:08,367
- Now there's magic.
- The damage that these

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,934
supernatural fugitives
can cause is unfathomable.

6
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,545
- How much money do you need?
- 4.2 billion a year.

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,514
Done. I'm going to
green-light additional funding

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,023
to fast-track the completion
of your containment facility.

9
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:20,171
Hi, I'm your magical caretaker.

10
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,819
Your creature-handler, she's great.

11
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,355
- Mona.
- Konane.

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,664
Did someone hurt you?

13
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,468
These creatures are controllable.

14
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,710
Project Hades is go.

15
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:31,314
Stop! Where are you taking him?

16
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,781
- Oh, thank God you're back.
- What is going on?

17
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:43,778
Long story, lots of twists and turns.

18
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,148
Some dramatic irony. Cliff notes, Gary.

19
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:49,281
- The Kaupe is out.
- Director Sharpe!

20
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,517
Gary, take him down to lockup.

21
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,753
Aw, what an adorable little puppet.

22
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,623
Eat my fuzzy dung, you dick!

23
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,259
Well, well, well...

24
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,928
Look who finally decided
to show up for work.

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,075
Nice of you to grace us with
your presence, Director Sharpe.

26
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,879
One of your employees
let a creature loose

27
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,937
and then, not surprisingly,
got attacked by it.

28
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,277
Wait, Mona let him out? Why would she...

29
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,828
I want that wolfman back in his cell,

30
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,048
or you're done.

31
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,517
And fire that girl.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,416
Of all the days this could happen...

33
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,785
All right, everyone.

34
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,988
Screen all calls to
Animal Control and 911.

35
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,624
Pull CCTV from every
corner in a ten-mile radius.

36
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,525
- Let's go!
- Yes, ma'am.

37
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,804
- Don't listen to him
- Sara, he's right.

38
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,325
I never should have left Mona
in charge of those Fugitives.

39
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:39,598
I should have been here,

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,735
and instead I was off
gallivanting like a...

41
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:44,370
Like a Legend?

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,873
Look, we are on this.

43
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,509
That Kaupe doesn't stand a chance.

44
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,044
I will fix this.

45
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,383
Our potty-mouthed puppet is locked up.

46
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,319
Wonderful, because I've got
another job for you, Gary.

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,956
But you're not going to like it.

48
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,431
Ow.

49
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,970
Mom, Dad? What's going on?

50
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,062
You were in a cycling accident.

51
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,007
_

52
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,075
_

53
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,412
I wasn't on a bike.
I was scratched by...

54
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,382
Konane, no!

55
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,387
Oh, no. He's out there alone.

56
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,965
- Who?
- I-I can't talk about it.

57
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:41,250
It's work-related, top secret.

58
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,828
_

59
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,165
_

60
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,866
_

61
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,257
We have failed as parents!
It's all your fault!

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,262
_

63
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,631
Gary, oh, my God. I'm happy to see you.

64
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:05,067
My parents won't believe
what I really do for work.

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,087
Oh, you mean betraying the
people that gave you a chance?

66
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,141
Ava believed in you,
and you let her down.

67
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,124
You let us all down.

68
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,993
Gary, what are you talking about?

69
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,427
You released a dangerous beast,

70
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,629
and now he's out there running free!

71
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,665
Wait, you think I let the Kaupe out?

72
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,168
It was the Men in Black!
Didn't you see the bodies?

73
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,337
No, there was only footage of you

74
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,639
letting Hairy Hunkman out.

75
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,009
And now there's me telling you...

76
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,443
you're fired.

77
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,047
You can't fire me. I
swear, there were two men

78
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,049
who came for Konane, but he killed them.

79
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,385
I'm sorry, Mona. I really
liked you, you know?

80
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,320
And I know it hurts now,
but in a few seconds,

81
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,226
- you won't remember a thing.
- Don't you dare.

82
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,423
- I need my mind!
- Hey, let go!

83
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,492
You do not have clearance
to handle this device!

84
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,360
You can't take my memories!

85
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,103
Uh, what was I doing here?

86
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,140
You're here to give me your jacket.

87
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,208
Right, right, right.

88
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,845
And also, you were going to
give me your Time Courier.

89
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,748
Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,651
Now take my place.
It's almost lunchtime.

91
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,154
Oh.

92
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,757
Ooh, Jello!

93

94
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,420
I know you're there.

95
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,824
Stop following me, or I'll
turn your brain into pudding!

96
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:58,430
Konane?

97
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,265
You're alive!

98
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,267
I was so worried they'd find you.

99
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,342
Don't worry about that.

100
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,277
I know you didn't mean to hurt me.

101
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,315
It's them! Run!

102
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,490
I won't let them get you.

103
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,965
I'll close this behind you so
they won't be able to follow.

104
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,761
- Mona.
- I have to keep you safe, go!

105
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,301
Mona! Mona! You're safe.

106
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,605
We're the good guys.
Oh, yeah, who sent you?

107
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,773
Was it the Bureau or the Men in Black?

108
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,010
- Where is the wolfman?
- He's gone, it's too late.

109
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,812
You'll never find him,
because I don't even

110
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,281
know where he went, so
grill me all you want.

111
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,984
You...

112
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,222
What kind of gun is this?

113
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,358
Did you just try to shoot her shoot her?

114
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,229
- Any hits?
- I tried to isolate the portal

115
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,266
from today's Courier
activity, but so far, no dice.

116
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,268
It would help if I
had the actual Courier.

117
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,904
Sure, here you go.

118
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,372
Okay, never mind.

119
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,107
So we have a vicious
monster on the loose

120
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,409
and no idea where it
might have disappeared to.

121
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,129
He's not a vicious monster.

122
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,747
People just assume that
because of the way he looks.

123
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,082
He's a demigod. He used to be a king!

124
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,350
Hey, what are you doing?

125
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,247
I'm seeing if this
thing works on her mouth.

126
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,055
Or how about we just
give our guest the dignity

127
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,657
of hearing her story first?

128
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,351
I'm telling you,

129
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,361
the Men in Black are behind all of this.

130
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,697
They're framing me so they can

131
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,499
keep hurting the magical creatures.

132
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,634
- Hurting them how?
- I don't know.

133
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,770
But Konane was terrified
when they came for him.

134
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,072
- I was just trying to help him.
- Mona.

135
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:51,476
We saw the security footage,
and there were no Men in Black.

136
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,878
Just you.

137
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,347
Well, they must have altered the footage

138
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,615
to hide the truth.

139
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,450
I'm like Mulder, and those guys

140
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,586
are the shadow government
covering their tracks!

141
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,055
It's a conspiracy!
The truth is out there!

142
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,090
Okay, okay, Fox, okay,
Fox. Take a breath.

143
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,627
We... we believe you. Right, Sara?

144
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,031
Yes, we do.

145
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,634
And we are going to get to
the bottom of this, but first,

146
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,870
we need to find the Kaupe
before he hurts himself.

147
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,572
Can you help us do that?

148
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,645
So I'll head to the
Bureau and do some digging?

149
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,913
What? No.

150
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,715
I need you on the hunt for the monster.

151
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,551
- But you said...
- Exactly what I needed to say.

152
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,219
That girl is clearly bonkers,

153
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,355
but the Kaupe trusts her
and we need her as bait.

154
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,257
What if she's not crazy?

155
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,158
What if there really is
a cover-up at the Bureau?

156
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,869
Then Ava would know about
it, and she wouldn't allow it.

157
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,372
Captain, I have found a
lead on our missing Kaupe.

158
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,033
In Mexico City, 1961, an unidentified

159
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,735
drug cartel member was found dead,

160
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,470
apparently the work of a wild animal

161
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,006
- non-indigenous to the region.
- That must be him.

162
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,576
All right, fine. Do some digging

163
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,411
through the footage,
but keep your head down.

164
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,912
We don't want to raise any red flags.

165
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,482
- Got it.
- Gideon, rally the troops.

166
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,384
We are going to Mexico.

167
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,903
I'm picking up a magical
signature this way.

168
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:14,626
As far as hiding places
go, smack bang in the center

169
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,062
of a major city would
not be my top choice.

170
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,598
What is this place?

171
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,008
Oh, it sounds like a real party.

172
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,478
- As long as there's beer.
- The detector must be wrong.

173
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,648
There's no way Konane could
hide in a place like this.

174
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,164
Are you sure about that?

175
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,685
El Lobo.

176
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:42,590
The Kaupe isn't hiding.
He's the main event.

177
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:52,429
- Oh,
- Blimey.

178
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,164
How'd our hairy friend
end up with that lot?

179
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,153
It doesn't surprise me in the slightest.

180
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:00,670
Lucha Libre wrestling is all
about character and charisma...

181
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,006
A modern-day morality play.

182
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,942
Good versus evil. The
people versus the man.

183
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:08,211
Well, according to the
altered historical record,

184
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,380
El Lobo arrived on the
scene six months ago

185
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,815
and quickly rose to the top.

186
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,316
The mystery surrounding
his true identity

187
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,518
inspired novels, movies, and TV shows.

188
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,920
Aw, bollocks.

189
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,622
This is the one that
I get sidelined for?

190
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,923
All right, let's split up.

191
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,291
Ray, Charlie, stay on the comms.

192
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,653
John and I will cover the arena.

193
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,059
You guys watch from the stands.

194
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,563
Bienvenidos, señoras and señores!

195
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,400
Tonight you will witness
a spectacular match.

196
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,036
One that you will tell
your grandchildren of

197
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,304
in vivid detail.

198
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,670
- Dos cervezas, por favor.
- Hey, we're working.

199
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:40,473
We can't afford any
screw-ups on this one.

200
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:41,978
We got to bag this guy quick.

201
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,680
Got to stay Sharpe, you mean?

202
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,449
Los Dos Demonios!

203
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:52,364
Oh, chillax, love. El
Lobo ain't going nowhere.

204
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,792
It's true, he's
impossible to get rid of.

205
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:59,168
I tried over and over. He won't go away.

206
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:03,166
Hold the bloody phone. Are you El Cura?

207
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,602
- Oh, you know this guy?
- Anyone who knows anything

208
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,437
about Mexican culture knows El Cura,

209
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,653
the legendary luchador and movie star.

210
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:12,342
- No.
- You know, I loved

211
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,910
your monster movies, mate.

212
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:16,780
Whoever wrote those gems
had a better handle on magic

213
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,582
than any of those
toss-bots up in Hollywood.

214
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,685
I haven't been in any movies, mi amigo.

215
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,020
What... what... what's all this?

216
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:26,089
You're the warrior
of piety and goodness.

217
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,124
You don't drink... Not
that I'm one to judge.

218
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:30,760
I didn't, until this hairy tonto

219
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,372
showed up and stole everything from me!

220
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,065
And finally, the man... No, the legend

221
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,068
- you have all come here to see.
- You mean the thief!

222
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,074
The undefeated champion,
the hero of the people,

223
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,543
El Lobo!

224
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,817
Viva, Mexico, señores!

225
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,253
Lobo, Lobo, Lobo!

226
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:02,916
Viva Mexico!

227
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,767
We don't have eyes on the Kaupe.

228
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,303
- He's laying low.
- I need this wrapped up

229
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,971
before tonight, Nathaniel.

230
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,395
I can't have it hanging over
my head during the benefit.

231
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:19,075
It's going to be fine.
You guys have been throwing

232
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,611
this fundraiser since the
first Bush administration.

233
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,347
- Oh, is that Nathaniel?
- Yes, dear.

234
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,949
- But this is a work matter...
- Yes, I need... Please.

235
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,485
Thank you, thank you. Hello, sweetie.

236
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,650
So don't forget, the benefit is tonight.

237
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:32,255
Mom, I don't know if I'm
gonna make it this year.

238
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,291
- I have a work emergency.
- Work can wait.

239
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,525
- Right, Hank?
- No.

240
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah, your father's
nodding. Okay, darling.

241
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,929
See you here at 7:00. Mwah. Bye.

242
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:40,997
I... No.

243
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,799
The lilies...

244
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,744
- Damn, he's good.
- He's too good.

245
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:59,517
In Lucha Libre, every
match tells a story.

246
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,784
Sometimes you win,

247
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,852
sometimes you lose
so you can rise again.

248
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:04,721
But there are rules. There is a plan.

249
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,257
With this guy, there's
no rules, there's no plan.

250
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,692
He just wins every time.

251
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,594
Oh, so that's why you're here, eh?

252
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,096
Drowning your sorrows, rather than being

253
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,364
up there where you belong?

254
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,734
Listen, mate. I have had my fair share

255
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,708
of defeats these past days,

256
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:24,741
but lying on your ass is no
way to get your mojo back.

257
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,416
Uno, dos, tres!

258
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,757
Look at him.

259
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,592
This is what he's always wanted...

260
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,795
To be worshipped and admired
like the demigod he is,

261
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,198
not feared and shunned
like some monster.

262
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,500
Well, he'd better make the most if it.

263
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:53,036
The second he gets
backstage, it's lights out

264
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,672
and back to the Time Bureau.

265
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,074
That wasn't the plan.

266
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:59,843
He can't go back to the Time Bureau.

267
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:00,810
It's not safe.

268
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,780
Not my call, don't care.

269
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,281
Oh, good, it's just you.

270
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,275
What are you doing here?

271
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:19,929
I was digging.

272
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,432
Mona claims the footage you
saw earlier was doctored,

273
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,168
that there's a cover-up
around the creature's escape.

274
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,036
And you believe this tiny cuckoo?

275
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,139
Maybe you should, too.

276
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,508
According to these deleted access logs,

277
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,409
security footage was
removed and replaced

278
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,678
early this morning
from a wireless device.

279
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,280
Now all I have to do is figure out

280
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,282
who that phone number belongs to.

281
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,867
You don't have to. I know the number.

282
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,621
It belongs to my dad.

283
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,725
El Lobo triumphs again!

284
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,628
Okay, Mona, make sure he sees
you as he leaving the ring.

285
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,230
Then bring him backstage,
and we'll meet you there.

286
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,836
Konane!

287
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,314
Lobo!

288
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:13,850
You thief, you cheat!

289
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:18,421
You have disgraced this ring.

290
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:21,457
You have stolen victories
from too many of us,

291
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,560
and I'm going to put a stop to it.

292
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:28,398
I challenge you to a lucha de apuestas!

293
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,236
The loser will take
off his mask in forfeit

294
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:36,539
and never set foot in
the ring ever again!

295
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,477
You heard it here, ladies and gentleman.

296
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,214
The gauntlet has been thrown!

297
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,518
Do you accept this match
and its conditions, señor?

298
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,965
Then the fight is on!

299
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,668
Tomorrow night, same time, same place.

300
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,338
This will be one for the history books.

301
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,507
Get your tickets now!

302
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,144
So he's back on track,
historically speaking.

303
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:18,281
Now, how's that for a
bang-up job, Lance-y?

304
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,984
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Hey, get back here!

305
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,118
What is going on?

306
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,787
Out of my way, fanboys. Get out!

307
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,326
Damn it, Mona's going
to get herself trampled.

308
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,872
You can say what you
will, but that Kaupe,

309
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:45,742
he's a real gent in my book.

310
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:54,379
So this is where you've been living.

311
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,847
Wow.

312
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,917
I like what you've done with the place.

313
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,386
It's, um... It's homey.

314
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:05,424
It's like you're back on the island.

315
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:08,401
You miss Hawaii, don't you?

316
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:09,995
Home?

317
00:16:09,997 --> 00:16:13,064
- You miss home?
- Home.

318
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,269
Mona home?

319
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,705
Do I miss home? Eh, you know...

320
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:23,508
Guilt-tripping parents, lack of a job,

321
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,577
no one who understands me.

322
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,082
Wow, that's beautiful.

323
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,429
Mona.

324
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:49,134
There has to be a logical reason

325
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,635
why Hank replaced the footage.

326
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:51,837
So let's think about it.

327
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,472
Look, I get that you and your dad

328
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:56,041
are in a good place for
the first time in a while,

329
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:58,577
but we just can't ignore
that this is happening.

330
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,045
But can we please reserve judgment

331
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:02,456
- till we see the footage?
- Sure.

332
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,583
The original footage
can only be restored

333
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:06,518
from the device used to delete it.

334
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,054
- You mean my dad's phone?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:12,491
We got to go for it tonight.
He's gonna be distracted.

336
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,960
He'll be boozing and
schmoozing at the benefit gala.

337
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:18,763
I have a plus-one. Are you in?

338
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:20,174
Uh, yeah, okay.

339
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:22,400
Uh, you know, as long as
we have to do that thing

340
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:24,069
where we act like we're dating.

341
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:26,738
You and I dating would be totally weird.

342
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,373
Totally weird, yeah.

343
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:33,144
Um, text me the details,
and I will meet you there.

344
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:34,579
Okay.

345
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,948
Bye.

346
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,658
I must be really hungry,

347
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,127
because that actually
looks kind of good.

348
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,132
What is it?

349
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,872
Where is he, Mona?

350
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,974
He's gone. You scared him off.

351
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,414
We just want to make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone, love.

352
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,780
He isn't like that.
He's sweet, and gentle.

353
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:09,848
He won't hurt any...

354
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,890
Eat this, you furball!

355
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:28,099
Konane, stop!

356
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,218
You got one messed-up
definition of "sweet."

357
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:58,897
Hey, Gideon said you...
Wow. You got a date?

358
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,600
No, it's not a date.

359
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:04,302
I am dressed like this

360
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,805
because the footage you
saw at the Bureau earlier

361
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:10,308
was definitely altered... by Hank.

362
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:16,381
Okay, wait. Before I do the
math on this, are you sure?

363
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,516
Yeah, Mona was telling the truth.

364
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,518
There is a cover-up at the Bureau.

365
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,223
What are the chances that
Ava's wrapped up in this?

366
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:26,224
Honestly, I don't know yet,
but if she's not a part of it,

367
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:29,227
then she's probably in a lot of danger.

368
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,239
Gary!

369
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:44,175
Close that hospital gown,
or I will report you to HR!

370
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:45,677
Where the hell have you been all day?

371
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,312
I don't know who I am.

372
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:49,367
I don't know why anything is things.

373
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,316
I don't know where my nipple went.

374
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:54,252
Where's my nipple? Where's my nipple?

375
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:56,454
Gary!

376
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,358
He was so scared.

377
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,794
I had to do something to stop them.

378
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:05,864
- Where were they taking him?
- Somewhere terrible.

379
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:07,732
That's why he can't
go back to the Bureau.

380
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:10,602
The Men in Black are going
to hurt him again, or worse.

381
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,604
Well, he can't stay in Mexico.

382
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:15,006
So take him back home...

383
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:18,543
Back to ancient Hawaii,
to his old kingdom.

384
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,413
You saw him in the arena.
He's meant to be a king.

385
00:20:21,415 --> 00:20:23,768
- Mona, it is not that simple.
- Why?

386
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:26,151
Captain, you are being
hailed by Director Sharpe.

387
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:27,552
That is why.

388
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,222
Gideon, I'll take it on the bridge.

389
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:33,525
I'm afraid she's overridden
my security protocols.

390
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:36,261
Ava. Wow, look at you.

391
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:38,797
- You look great.
- Yeah, thanks, but listen.

392
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,547
Sara, the situation with the
Kaupe has gotten much worse.

393
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,501
He now has an accomplice, Mona Wu.

394
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,837
Now, she may not look it, but
she is extremely dangerous.

395
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,639
She completely wiped Gary's mind.

396
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:49,140
Um...

397
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,778
Wait, you've had Mona in custody

398
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,091
this whole time, and you didn't...

399
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:57,648
It's a long story, but I need
to explain it to you in person.

400
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:00,118
- This line might not be secure.
- The line isn't secure?

401
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,853
Sara, what are you...

402
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:05,957
You have the Kaupe, too?

403
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,692
Look, I ju... I can't explain right now.

404
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,461
Okay, then I'm sending
an extraction team.

405
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:11,196
Gideon, mask our location.

406
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:13,498
Sara, you need to bring
in that Fugitive now.

407
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:18,670
Don't you dare hang up on...

409
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:24,242
Whoa, did you just hang
up on your girlfriend?

410
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:27,045
Mona, you better not
be wrong about this.

411
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,714
I need to go to that benefit

412
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:36,787
so I can talk to Ava face-to-face.

413
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,723
Before you leave, I have a petition

414
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:39,891
to become interim captain

415
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,459
of the "Waverider" in your absence.

416
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,962
I have a John Hancock from
every Legend except you.

417
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:46,776
It looks like you crossed
out part of Rory's signature.

418
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,145
Oh, r-really?

419
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:49,934
The team is to keep a low profile.

420
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:53,371
Radio silence, and
absolutely no time travel.

421
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,276
Captain Palmer's got it covered.

422
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,775
Interim captain.

423
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,031
After your recent unfortunate
misadventures in time travel,

424
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:07,685
I created a team-building
card game to help you learn

425
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:10,488
the dos and don'ts
of our prior missions.

426
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,493
I'm calling it Cards
to Save the Timeline!

427
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:17,395
Fun way to learn from
your mistakes, right?

428
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:20,328
Oh, you've got to be
joking. Vandal Savage.

429
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,033
- That's a real name?
- And here's me, thinking

430
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:24,445
that Damien Darhk's moniker
was a touch on the nose.

431
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:26,401
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm detecting

432
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:27,672
a disturbance in the timeline.

433
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:30,241
- Oh, thank God.
- Yes.

434
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:32,243
In the wake of El Lobo's
sudden disappearance

435
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:34,179
from the Lucha Libre
scene, rumors spread

436
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:35,580
of government censorship.

437
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,215
Countrywide protests erupted,

438
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,584
and dozens were killed
in the ensuing riots.

439
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:41,186
I'm sure we can figure something out

440
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:42,353
once Sara gets back.

441
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:45,682
In the meantime, it's game time!

442
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:47,624
- Aw, come off it.
- Ah... yeah

443
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:48,993
I mean, weren't you just nattering on

444
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,995
about team-building experiences?

445
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,365
Well, let's go out there
and actually fix something.

446
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,534
Well, yeah, but Sara said to stay put.

447
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:58,236
Oh, come on, Raymondo.

448
00:22:58,238 --> 00:23:01,272
This isn't just important for
some dusty old history book.

449
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:03,367
This is important for
the people of Mexico.

450
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,277
All we have to do is make sure
the luchas de apuestas fight

451
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,814
goes on and make sure that
El Cura comes out on top.

452
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:12,717
- A grand finale.
- Yeah.

453
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:15,253
- Aw, come on, Rayge.
- Come on, Rayge.

454
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,955
Let's give the people what they want.

455
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:18,756
Let's give them what they need.

456
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:28,066
Ah... let's prepare
ourselves to wrestle!

457
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:34,071
Or we could just go.

458
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,976
Why throw such a big fancy party

459
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:40,011
if you're only going to
have tiny little treats?

460
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:43,414
- Nathaniel, darling.
- Hello.

461
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,450
- Yes.
- Ohho-ho.

462
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:47,952
What... is this your new girlfriend?

463
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:49,464
- Um, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,122
This is Zari.

465
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:54,025
Zari... what a beautiful
name for a beautiful woman

466
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,727
with excellent child-bearing hips.

467
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,795
Not to put a clock on
it or anything, but...

468
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,099
Mm, grandchildren would be so lovely.

469
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,867
- Mm-hmm.
- Anywho, I'd better go

470
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,904
make sure everything's good
with your father's speech.

471
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:08,940
Oh, my God. That went well.

472
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,376
Are you... are you blushing right now?

473
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,784
No. Shut up.

474
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,579
Take my toothpick. Stay on task.

475
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:17,148
We're here to get your
dad's phone, that's it.

476
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,260
You better have a damn good
reason for hanging up on me.

477
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:32,397
Where is the Kaupe, and why
isn't he in Bureau custody?

478
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:35,025
What are you doing?

479
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:37,695
Making sure we're not overheard.

480
00:24:37,698 --> 00:24:38,970
By who?

481
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,473
Sara, my ass is already on the line.

482
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:43,741
Feeling me up in front of my boss

483
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:45,343
is not a good idea right now.

484
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:47,178
They didn't plant anything on you.

485
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,980
- What?
- That's good.

486
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,252
Please tell me that nutcase
Mona hasn't gotten to you.

487
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:56,254
Just dance.

488
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:57,889
I think Mona was onto something

489
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,992
about secret agents trying
to infiltrate the Bureau.

490
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:05,596
That is insane.

491
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:08,232
- Sara...
- Just listen to me.

492
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:10,301
The security footage was altered,

493
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:12,337
and I think Mona was framed.

494
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:16,867
Even if that was true, which I doubt,

495
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,609
you are still harboring a Fugitive.

496
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:20,778
- Ava...
- Ah! Hand him over now.

497
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,181
We can deal with the rest of this later.

498
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:26,784
You know I can't do that.

499
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,253
Then this conversation is over.

500
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:35,560
Hey, could you help me out, amigo?

501
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:37,195
I think I might be stuck.

502
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:38,696
Oh, it's time to whip you

503
00:25:38,698 --> 00:25:40,898
back into fighting shape, eh, mate?

504
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,800
Yeah, you need to
shake off that ring rust

505
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:44,836
by tomorrow night so that you can win.

506
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:46,204
What the hell is he doing here?

507
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,873
Whoa! Be nice! Be nice.

508
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,242
Look, just as you're
here to practice winning,

509
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:53,144
he's here to practice losing, all right?

510
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:56,114
I don't trust him. He's
never done choreography.

511
00:25:56,116 --> 00:25:58,883
For the people to accept
me as their hero again,

512
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,551
my victory must be absolute.

513
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:03,254
Well, you'd better get
to work, then, hadn't you?

514
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,164
Gentle, El Lobo, gentle.

515
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:32,483
- Yeah!
- Yes!

516
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:34,336
That's what I'm talking about, El Cura.

517
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,034
Whoo!

518
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:39,723
You think he can still
pull off his finishing move?

519
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:42,627
I'm sure all the muscle
memory will kick in.

520
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,133
Konane!

521
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
You can't train the mutt.

522
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:57,475
Konane...

523
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:59,844
I know you don't like losing,

524
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:02,180
but it doesn't make
you any less of a king.

525
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:05,316
In fact, it makes you a hero...

526
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:08,586
like Buck in my favorite
Rebecca Silver book.

527
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:10,088
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

528
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,890
Where Buck crash lands
on Garima's home planet

529
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:15,393
and then is forced into mortal combat?

530
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,628
- That one?
- Yeah, you read it?

531
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,865
Heard of it.

532
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,234
Konane, e'owili.

533
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:30,808
Buck loved Garima, and he
didn't want to hurt her sister,

534
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,677
so he threw the contest,

535
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,247
and the two star-crossed
lovers escaped into the night.

536
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:40,017
If you lose tomorrow, me
and you can escape, too.

537
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,888
I'll take you back to Hawaii.
We can make a life together.

538
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,990
Just like Buck and Garima.

539
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,217
Let's clear out.

540
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,021
Ava.

541
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:57,391
Where are you going?

542
00:27:57,394 --> 00:27:59,682
Mexico City, 1961.

543
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:01,506
What, you didn't think I'd find out?

544
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:03,441
The Bureau's running just fine, Sara.

545
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:06,677
And we will catch that damn Kaupe.

546
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:37,284
On behalf of the American
Hemophilia Foundation,

547
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:40,043
I am honored to introduce
tonight's recipient

548
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:44,682
of the Altruistic Angel
Award... Henry Heywood.

549
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:46,417
Hey, uh, Pops, Pops, Pops.

550
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,553
How about a quick pic?
You know, for "Facebooks"

551
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:51,255
or whatever you old
people over-share on.

552
00:28:51,257 --> 00:28:53,591
- Come on, Mom.
- Yep.

553
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:57,028
Okay, say "grand-babies."

554
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:04,669
Damn it, Ray, what happened
to keeping a low profile?

555
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,938
It's a long story, but
this fight must happen

556
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,141
in order to protect history,
so just trust us, okay?

557
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,440
All right, so entering through

558
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:13,110
the north and south
wings is the best chance

559
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,312
of catching the Legends off-guard.

560
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:15,613
- Oh.
- If you...

561
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,383
Uh, should I transfer
it to your private line

562
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:22,253
in case it's, you know,
bom-chicka-wow-wow?

563
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:23,487
Gary, move.

564
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:27,692
Ava, I know you're
mad, but can we please

565
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:29,126
just talk about this like adults

566
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:30,461
before doing something rash?

567
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,196
I will put a stop to that fight.

568
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:33,581
Sara, now is not the time

569
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,900
for one of your crazy, "fly by
the seat of your pants" plans!

570
00:29:35,902 --> 00:29:38,035
Hand over the Fugitive
before someone gets hurt.

571
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,938
I know this sounds crazy,
but there is no way around it.

572
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,975
Letting the Kaupe wrestle is
important to Mexico's history.

573
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:46,214
No, allowing an escaped
Fugitive to fight

574
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,712
is endangering all of history.

575
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:49,013
Extraction team, move out.

576
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:51,716
Introducing the fallen hero.

577
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:54,852
Once beloved, now disgraced,

578
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:58,122
a man clawing for a comeback...

579
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:59,824
El Cura!

580
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,061
Yo soy el campeón!

581
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,706
El Cura, El Cura, El Cura, El Cura.

582
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,404
Ah, fair-weather fans, mate.

583
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:16,140
Don't worry. We'll prove them wrong.

584
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:19,310
And now the man you're all here to see,

585
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:22,613
the undefeated champion of the people...

586
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:25,049
El Lobo!

587
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,822
Viva Mexico!

588
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:37,094
Lobo! Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!

589
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:40,564
Bring it in, gentlemen.

590
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:42,466
Now, I want a good, clean fight.

591
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:46,237
No biting, no scratching,
nothing below the belt.

592
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,872
All right, to your corners.

593
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:49,673
The strongest of us will never know

594
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:52,376
what it's like to live
with this disorder,

595
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:54,278
and that's why I call my work...

596
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,514
Okay, moment of truth.

597
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,951
Because victory is possible.

598
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:04,955
In fact, it's inevitable.

599
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:08,092
I don't accept this
Altruistic Angel Award

600
00:31:08,094 --> 00:31:10,327
for myself as some pat on the back.

601
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,397
I receive it as a call to arms.

602
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,802
Let's all come together
and end this fight.

603
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:20,938
Oh!

604
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,844
All right, take it easy, remember?

605
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:25,876
Go on, shake it off, mate. Shake it off.

606
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:27,445
Look, I know you feel
like throwing in the towel

607
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:28,679
right now, but trust me.

608
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:29,947
There's nothing people like more

609
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:31,715
than a good comeback. Now go.

610
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:45,196
Yeah, come on!

611
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:57,975
You're losing so good. Keep it up.

612
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,643
Play dead, furball.

613
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:04,682
Aah!

614
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:22,099
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is an emergency evacuation.

615
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:24,235
Please exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

616
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,041
We, uh, have some
uninvited guests here, Sara.

617
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:34,578
Give them hell. That's an order.

618
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,687
- No outside interference!
- Finally, a real fight!

619
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:57,902
These dudes are trying to censor us!

620
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,905
But we ain't gonna
stand for that, are we?

621
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,378
On your left, mate.

622
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:14,084
Nice one, Raymondo.

623
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:19,123
Now, El Cura and his mates,
they fight for the people!

624
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,225
The people!

625
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:24,995
Now, this is what I
call a bloody good show.

626
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:27,602
- Now, he didn't abandon you.
- Have a towel, mate.

627
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,467
So don't you dare abandon him.

628
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,107
Oh! Come on!

629
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:55,426
Aah!

630
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:59,196
Yeah!

631
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,498
Yeah, yeah!

632
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:05,669
Cura! Cura! Cura!

633
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,938
Cura! Cura! Cura!

634
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,975
Cura! Cura! Cura! Cura!

635
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:15,545
Cura! Cura! Cura! Cura!

636
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:30,754
Well, I reckon we should
team-build like this

637
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:33,596
more often, Legends.

638
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,769
Well, looks like you've
saved history again.

639
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:42,264
- Congratulations, Sara.
- Ava, just let me explain.

640
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:45,643
No need. It's all very clear to me.

641
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,211
Ava, please, don't hang up...

642
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:51,081
On me.

643
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:04,829
Some night, huh? We just
raised over $500,000.

644
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:07,298
Roaring success.

645
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,568
I saw the footage, Hank...

646
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,303
the real footage.

647
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,087
Nathaniel, it was you

648
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,911
who convinced me to fund the Bureau.

649
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:23,080
Don't... Please don't remind me.

650
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:26,017
- I went out on a limb for you.
- Mm.

651
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,618
I need you to trust me on this.

652
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,554
There's a purpose to what you saw.

653
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,667
Of course I trust you.

654
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:46,204
I just need you to bring me
in on these sort of things.

655
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:47,897
In due time, son.

656
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,208
I got to take this.

657
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,644
Yeah?

658
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:57,215
You cloned all the data
off that phone, right?

659
00:35:57,217 --> 00:36:00,451
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

660
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:03,321
Keep digging.

661
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,356
I want to know everything.

662
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:09,600
What do you mean you
couldn't capture the asset?

663
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:12,196
Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.

664
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:13,998
How would you like us to proceed?

665
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,376
Kid, come here.

666
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:32,850
There's something about Buck
and Garima you should know.

667
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,785
They didn't live happily ever after.

668
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:37,255
They came from two different worlds...

669
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:40,157
Worlds that needed them.

670
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,560
They didn't belong together.

671
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,132
But they loved one another... a lot.

672
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:50,680
How do you know?

673
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:53,404
The next book in the series
hasn't even been published yet.

674
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:54,872
I just do!

675
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:58,072
Here.

676
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,179
Don't do anything stupid.

677
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,016
I got to take a leak.

678
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:25,369
I brought snickerdoodles.

679
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:31,375
I'll just, uh, put them here.

680
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:37,715
Ava, look, I'm sorry. I
didn't come here to fight.

681
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,083
I...

682
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:43,354
I know things got ugly
between us today, but...

683
00:37:43,356 --> 00:37:45,156
I just want to put it behind us.

684
00:37:45,158 --> 00:37:48,125
I needed one thing
from you today, Sara...

685
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:50,161
For you to be in my corner.

686
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:51,595
That's all I asked.

687
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:54,966
- Well, I'm here now.
- Well, that's great.

688
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,500
Just in time for my meeting with Hank,

689
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:59,103
where I'll probably be
fired, thanks to you.

690
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:03,207
Ava, Hank is the real problem here.

691
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:06,444
I mean, he's been torturing
prisoners off-site.

692
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,193
Who cares? A few weeks ago,

693
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:09,701
the Legends were sending them to hell.

694
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:11,943
I mean, since when is
protecting magical creatures,

695
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:13,217
things that shouldn't
even be in our world

696
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:15,586
in the first place, more
important than protecting me?

697
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:17,493
When have you become so callous

698
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,090
about the prisoners in your care?

699
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:22,727
My priority is to
protect history, Sara...

700
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:24,261
Human history.

701
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,630
If Hank has to experiment
on a few creatures

702
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:29,800
to try to find a better way
to fight them, then so be it.

703
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:32,203
Ava, you do not believe that.

704
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,205
Come on, I know you.

705
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:35,873
You're not like Hank.

706
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,174
This is your Bureau,

707
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:39,044
and he's doing something
twisted with it.

708
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:41,112
You don't understand
how any of this works.

709
00:38:41,114 --> 00:38:43,169
No, Hank is the reason
that this Bureau is here.

710
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,615
If we piss him off, it all goes away.

711
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,490
Think of how many people,
how many human people

712
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,985
would get hurt if that happened.

713
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:51,522
- Well, he can't shut us down.
- Oh, my God, Sara.

714
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:53,691
Everything is not about
you. Do you understand?

715
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:57,061
You're asking me to risk
everything... for what?

716
00:38:57,063 --> 00:38:59,697
For some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters?

717
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,365
I...

718
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,167
For me.

719
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:07,133
Well, I've already given you

720
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,569
everything I have to give, so...

721
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:12,977
Today I asked you for one thing.

722
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:16,313
- Ava, don't do this.
- Just go.

723
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,785
I'm done.

724
00:39:38,204 --> 00:39:42,706
Well, Konane, it's time
for our new adventure.

725
00:39:57,055 --> 00:40:00,990
Konane, I, um...

726
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:02,726
I can't.

727
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:06,197
I want to live in your world.

728
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,967
I mean, look at it.

729
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:12,436
It's beautiful.

730
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:16,006
But I don't belong there.

731
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:21,445
If I went, I'd just be
running away from my world,

732
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:26,283
and that's not the right reason
to leave everything behind.

733
00:40:48,374 --> 00:40:49,640
You murdered him.

734
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:51,542
Step away from the creature, miss.

735
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:54,712
- No.
- I said step away.

736
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:01,951
You murdered him!

737
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,774
What the...

738
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,847
You were right.

739
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,651
There's no such thing
as happily ever after.
