00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,920
will hand over the diamonds
when we're done?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,080
We don't. But that's another business.

LINDA: When this business is done,
it will all be over.

And afterwards,

10

you and Arthur can begin your new life.

So there are three cellars
underneath the house.

There's a tunnel here that runs

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,040
from the house, underneath the river,
to an underground strong room.

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,520
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room, direct.

Because we are from the same
cold streets as they are.

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Stay by that phone.
Me and John will cover the roads.

160
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
TOMMY: I need Michael
at the Maypole junction.

161
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,400
I need Moss to block
all the roads south.

162
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,560
Give me Moss. Gone where?

163
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,440
-Tommy...
-It's them.

164
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,120
-Who?
-It's fucking them.

165
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Look, it might just be
some random woman.

166
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,200
-Because sometimes women go mad...
-No, it is them.

167
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Did you break the phone?

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
He broke the phone.

169
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
It's all right,
we have got another phone.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
-ADA: Tommy?
-Ada?

171
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
There's someone outside, a priest.

172
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,520
Stay here, Pol, stay here.
Don't do anything.

173
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,840
We have your son.
Get in the car.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
TOMMY:
First.

175
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,000
Is he safe?

176
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,120
Of course he's safe.

177
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,200
All children are dear to me.

178
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,680
You have all the cards.

179
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Tell me what you want me to do
and I will certainly do it.

180
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,240
You ever drive one of these beasts?

181
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
I am asking you to conduct business.

182
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
Of course, I borrowed it.

183
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,280
Lent it by a Lord
for the duration of this business.

184
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,760
I will certainly do what you
need me to do with no complaint.

185
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,600
We were forced into
doing this awful thing.

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,120
We did warn you that your son would be
in danger if you deviated from the plan.

187
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
It was you who made a mistake.

188
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,640
-You understand?
-Yes.

189
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
What mistake did you make?
Do you even know?

190
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
Tell me what you want me to do.

191
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,080
-You made a deal with our enemies.
-I will do what needs to be done.

192
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,840
You went behind our backs to stop
the Soviets from blowing up the train.

193
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,000
But it's all right. It's all right.

194
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
We've rectified your mistake.

195
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,320
You ask me, "What do I need to do?"

196
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,360
Well, here is what you need to do,
you fucking mongrel, you...

197
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,800
Since the Bolsheviks will not
be blowing up the train,

198
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
you will blow up the train yourself.

199
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,960
It has always been about the explosion

200
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,160
from the beginning.
The bang. The outrage.

201
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,680
Understand?

202
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
Those are notes and fragments
for you to scatter in the wreckage,

203
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
implicating named officials
from the Soviet Embassy.

204
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,120
I will scatter them. It will be done.

205
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
Good.

206
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,000
Our friends at <i>The Times</i> and
the <i>Daily Mailwill</i> do the rest.

207
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,120
And once the British government

208
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,560
cuts diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union,

209
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,040
that will be our mission accomplished.

210
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,720
You would have been
part of a fine adventure.

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,720
To help with the outrage,
we need people to die in the explosion.

212
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,880
How many?

213
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Let's say... six.

214
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Rail workers, perhaps,
men from the factory.

215
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,040
(MOUTHING)

216
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,600
And I want my son returned to me
within an hour of the explosion.

217
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,480
Oh, it's conditions now, is it?

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,080
We need to fix the
handover in advance.

219
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,640
I haven't finished
with you yet, Mr Shelby.

220
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,400
We also hear
that you are digging a tunnel.

221
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,560
Mining for precious stones
under Wilderness House.

222
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm told they have a Fabergé
in the strong room.

223
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,960
The Lilies of the Valley Egg
made in 1898.

224
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,600
One of the Odd Fellows has a wife
who's obsessed with Fabergé.

225
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,200
He wants to give her the egg
for her birthday.

226
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,440
Then he will have it.

227
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,160
And the Economic League will take
all of the jewels that you steal,

228
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,360
to cover our considerable expenses.

229
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,920
The fight against Communism
is not cheap you know.

230
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,600
-So if you want to see your...
-I will give you all the jewels.

231
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,040
A bang first.

232
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,160
Then bring everything that you
have stolen to your office at dawn.

233
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,200
No. No, I'm, uh...

234
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,080
I'll not be able to get the
jewels to you by dawn.

235
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,280
The tunnel has hit clay.

236
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
If the St. Andrew's clock strikes
5:00 a.m. on the night of the robbery

237
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,960
and we don't have everything
that we asked for,

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,720
the bell will be tolling for your boy.

-TOMMY: Where's Linda?
-With Esme.

243
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
Esme's water broke.

244
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,400
I was just with her. Running around,
fucking broke her water.

245
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,280
-Where is Finn?
-Out with the young ones,

246
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,400
looking for the Riley.
We couldn't reach him.

247
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,000
I need to know who spoke.

248
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Our enemies know everything. Everything.

249
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,760
I need to know who spoke about business
outside of the family.

250
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,480
I need to know who spoke
and who they spoke to, now.

251
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,600
-Tommy, listen, uh...
-Your wife, Arthur?

252
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,720
I am going to tell myself that
you are not thinking straight.

253
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
Your mind is not clear.

254
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,040
Or Esme getting cash
for cocaine, eh, John?

255
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,160
Fuck!

256
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,480
All of a sudden,
back in the family, Ada.

257
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,040
Eh? That is a surprise.
Out of the blue.

258
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,480
On whose orders?

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,720
POLLY: Tommy, this is
not helping find him.

260
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
And you and your painter.

261
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,480
You said he knows you.

262
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,400
Things developed. You talked.

263
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
If anyone has talked about
the tunnel to anyone else,

264
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
I need to know,
and I need to know this second.

265
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,160
-What about your clay kickers?
-ARTHUR: Hmm.

I'd trust those men with my life.

-Yes.

this fucking line-up, anyway?

-I fucking don't even know him.

And I have only fucking known him
for fucking three years.

POLLY: No, he is not going
to be your whipping boy.

JOHN: I don't even fucking know the boy.

276
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,000
I never told Michael
about the Lilies of the Valley.

277

The only people I told about
the Fabergé eggs are in this room.

and common sense.

280
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,720
And Esme's got no need for extra cash.

281
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,280
And you bring my wife into this,

282
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,000
means we speak

never gonna do, am I?

bring me out here for?

325

to somewhere I need to be in a hurry.

-Mmm.
-What have you got for me?

327
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,560
Well, seeing as you were prepared
to pay such an exorbitant amount

328
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,640
for this information, I decided
to give you value for money.

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,920
So here are the names
of all the men in England

330
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,880
whom I would approach, right,
if I had a Fabergé egg for sale.

331
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,560
Here you go.

332
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,560
And then, here's all
the men on that list,

333
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,640
you know, who would buy
the old Fabergé egg,

334
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
even if they knew that
that item was stolen.

I won't ask but, erm...

338
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,920
Here is a list of the men
who would buy a Fabergé

339
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,320
because of their wife's obsession.

340
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,200
Ah, yes. Thank you, Mr Shelby.
It's lovely doing business with you.

341
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,880
You left a name off the list, Alfie.

342

-Did I?
-Yeah.

343
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,920
I've already spoken to my people
in the jewellery quarter.

344

Experienced dealers.

345
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,080
They tell me there are only
three men in Britain

346
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,040
whose wives are obsessed with Fabergé.

347
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,840
Makes them good customers.

348
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,800
You missed the richest one off the list.

349
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Yeah, well, if you knew already

350
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,000
how come you dragged me all the way
out into the fucking oggin, mate?

351
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Two reasons. Reason one.

352
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,200
By withholding a name
that you most certainly know,

353
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,880
you've proven to me that you have
done a deal with the Odd Fellows.

354
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,720
It was you who told them
about the tunnel.

355
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,040
You who told them about the
fucking deal with the Soviets.

356
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Reason two.

357
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,400
The name of the man that you're
withholding must be my enemy

358
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,480
otherwise,
you wouldn't be protecting him.

359
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,400
He is now a man I can use.

360
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,040
Listen, sweetie, you can't take a man...

361
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,880
You gave information
in exchange for a share.

things in that treasury, right,

364
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,240
and He said, "Alfie, you are
meant to have these things."

365
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
You crossed the line, Alfie.

his anger is un-fucking justified!

I killed a man.

Well, he needed cover.
I was all he had.

So what did he give you?

He said it was good for close range.

No, no. This is mine now.
It feels part of my hand.

Where'd you hit him?

638
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,240
I made a mistake,

639
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,320
and I want to apologise
to all of you.

640
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,920
Arthur,

641
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,320
you warned me against getting
involved in Russian business,

642
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,200
and you were right.

643
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,040
Mmm.

644
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,400
TOMMY: I doubted your wife,
for that, I am sorry.

645
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,600
Linda, I have added 3,000 here,
in the hope you will forgive me.

646
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,520
Apology accepted.

647
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,800
Esme, I doubted you as well.

648
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,440
Now John has got innocent lives
on his conscience.

649
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,120
-Ordinary working men...
-Yeah, all right.

650
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,640
-Esme, we got it.
-No. She is right.

651
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,800
You and Arthur are going to
have to share that burden.

652
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,480
But I hope the house
that you can buy with this

653
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,480
can become a place of...

654
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,920
contemplation

655
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,080
and perhaps, redemption.

656
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,120
Charlie, for lost tools
and dangerous goods

657
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,120
and Curly's wise words.

658
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,040
Johnny, for board and lodgings.

659
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,880
Lizzie.

660
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,680
Michael,

661
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,840
for the killings.

662
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,280
Five for cutting and five for shooting.

663
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,600
-No, Tommy.
-What?

664
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,480
Tell me, eh?

665
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,160
This is who I am!

666
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,360
And this is all I can give you
for what you have given to me.

667
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,960
For your hearts and your souls.

668
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,840
Yesterday, I nearly lost my son.

669
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,920
You should fucking understand that.

670
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,560
For what, eh? For what?

671
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,880
For this? For this?

672
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,800
And I know that you all want
me to say that I will change,

673
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,360
that this fucking business will change.

674
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,000
But I've learnt something
these last few days.

675
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,280
Those bastards. Those bastards

676
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,600
are worse than us.

677
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,800
Politicians, fucking judges,
lords and ladies.

678
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,960
They are worse than us.

679
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,240
And they will never admit us
to their palaces

680
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,280
no matter how legitimate we become.

681
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,760
Because of who we are,

682
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,160
because of who we fucking are
because of where we are fucking from.

683
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,320
Is that right, Ada?

684
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,880
Our Ada knows.

685
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,920
She got smart about revolution.

686
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,280
And she knows you have to get
what you want your own way.

687
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,320
Lizzie, I want it known, that money

688
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,200
was for you
because some nights it was you

689
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,320
who stopped my heart from breaking,
no-one else.

690
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,480
And the rest of you,
you took the King's shilling.

691
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,240
You took the King's fucking shilling.

692
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,240
When you take the King's shilling,
the King expects you to kill.

693
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,200
Right, Arthur?

694
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,320
Yeah.

695
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,840
That is how it works. Right, John?

696
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,880
That's right.

697
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,560
That's right, Pol.

698
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,720
That is fucking right.

699
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,480
Tommy...

700
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,680
You've had a bad time.

701
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,120
We understand.

702
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,040
So at an alternative time,

703
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,000
when we have all recovered...

704
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,240
I would like

705
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,920
to put before the family

706
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,240
an alternative view

707
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,160
of the future
of the Shelby Company Limited.

708
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,880

The train for the dock
leaves in one hour.

715
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,400
Then we'll get the boat to New York,

716
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,800
and it'll all be in the past.

717
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,400

I spoke to Moss last night.

725
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,280
He told me that the
Chief Constable of Birmingham

726
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,720
has issued a warrant for your arrest.

727
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,160

JOHN: Why didn't you
fucking tell us, Tom?

737

The people we betrayed last night,
they want to bring us down.

they control the jails.

and bring it to the cellar.

You will all get your money
in due course.

When the police gets in, do not resist.
