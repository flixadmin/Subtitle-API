You see, most people

00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,923
I went off on
binary conceptions of the world

171
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,587
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

172
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,402
some symbolic reduction of my life.

173
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,096
And the woman with the pills laughed
'cause I was missing the point.

174
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,656
What point?

175
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,821
The choice is an illusion.

176
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,915
You already know what you have to do.

177
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,756
Truth.

178
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,475
Okay.

179
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,385
There's an old building
with a skylight and lots of stairs.

180
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,723
The Lafayette.

181
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,457
One of the four back doors leads there.

182
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,439
[Morpheus] Oh.

183
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,003
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

184
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,027
Keep breathing.

185
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,529
Extraction works pretty much the same
for humans and programs.

186
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,368
Ouch.

187
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,487
Ah.

188
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,199
Okay.

189
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,244
- Hey.
- Hey.

190
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,079
I've never worn
different glasses before.

191
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,245
Yeah, looks good. Which door?

192
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,751
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

193
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,177
Agent White.

194
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,801
Agent Smith?

195
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,131
[laughs]

196
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,425
[Bugs grunts]

197
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,970
- [Bugs] Go!
- [grunts]

198
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,809
[men grunting]

199
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,863
Seq! Can you hear me?

200
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,272
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

201
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,678
Can you get us to the window pane?

202
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,568
Bugs! Bugs! He's an Agent!

203
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,159
[Morpheus exclaims, grunts]

204
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,001
That window! Go hard!

205
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,674
[both screaming]

206
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,140
[screaming fades]

00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,693
[keyboard clacking]

[fast-paced music playing on speakers]

209
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,674
- [computer buzzing]
- What the...

210
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,728
What the hell?

211
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,264
[suspenseful music playing]

212
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,831
Something wrong?

213
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,574
Uh... Just a little crash.

214
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,160
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

215
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,754
What a beautiful day to be alive.
Am I right?

216
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,375
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

217
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,006
Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?

218
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,681
A little Modal experiment.

219
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,636
- For <i>Binary?</i>
- [cell phone chimes]

220
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,390
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

221
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,562
I'm buying.

222
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,617
[man] I'm not trying to
blow smoke up your ass,

223
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,238
but the first time I played the trilogy,
I was shook.

224
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,484
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

225
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,028
Are we all just algorithms
doing what we're supposed to do,

226
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,954
or can we escape our programming?

227
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,082
Genius, inside the context of the game,
BT dubs.

228
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,123
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

229
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,583
Yeah. I failed the seventh grade.
[chuckles]

230
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,380
Your game almost ruined me.

231
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,838
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

232
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,591
- [cups clink]
- You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

233
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,723
is it free will

234
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,599
or destiny?

235
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,935
Oh, yeah.

236
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,728
There she is.

237
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,775
Total f-ing MILF.

238
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,695
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

239
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,107
I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.

240
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,491
Maybe you should go.

241
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,528
No, please. I... I promise, best self.

242
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,912
Best self.

243
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,076
Sure.

244
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,377
You ever talk to her?

245
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,550
Tell you what.

246
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,920
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

247
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,380
Jude, no. Stop.

248
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,924
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

249
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,592
Hi. Um...

250
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,512
I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.
I'm Jude Gallagher.

251
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,558
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

252
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,021
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

253
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,983
Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.

254
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,067
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

255
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,984
Oh, and this is my very good friend,
Thomas Anderson.

256
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,903
He is a bona fide famous person

257
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,570
and considered by most to be

258
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,451
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

259
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,787
I'm sorry about this.

260
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,229
- Jude...
- [softly] Just talk to her.

261
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,620
Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.

262
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,713
Hi.

263
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,013
Have we met?

264
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,675
Uh, we both come here.

265
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,372
- Can I have your morning bun?
- [boy] Hey.

266
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,790
Are you trying to ball my mom or what?

267
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,100
- Brandon!
- [chuckles]

268
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,023
[Boy 2] Can I have one bite?

269
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,026
Babe. What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

270
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,062
This is my husband, Chad.

271
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,901
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

272
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,567
Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.

273
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,531
Right. Sorry. [chuckles]

274
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,492
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

275
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,001
[soft music playing]

276
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,937
What?

277
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,856
[keyboard clacking]

278
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,275
[ominous music playing]

279
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,648
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

280
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,665
"Billions of people
just living out their lives,

281

282
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,497
I always loved that line.

283
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,582
You wrote that one, yeah?

284
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,129
Every time I stand here,

285
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,557
I mean, O-M-G.

286
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,930
It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.

287
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,391
- Right?
- [chuckles softly]

288
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,515
Yeah.

289
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,434
Sure.

290
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,439
Have a seat.

291
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,404
[man sighs]

292
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,652
Smoke?

293
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:40,994
I thought you quit.

294
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,410
I quit calling it a habit.

295
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,239
Now it's just a guilty pleasure.

296
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,328
Oh. Maybe I can make this easy for you.

297
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,296
I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.

298
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,547
This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.
It's bigger than that.

299
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,133
This is about our future,

300
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,427
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

301
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,259
What do you mean?

302
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,720
How's the therapy?

303
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,347
Good.

304
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,519
Any...

episodes?

306
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,691
No.

307
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,103
That's terrific.

308
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,691
Look, Tom,
I know we've always had our differences.

309
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,318
What did you say
about our first meeting?

310
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,329
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

311
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,707
[muffled yell]

312
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,290
[scoffs]

313
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,708
But look at this place.

314
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,123
We did this.

315
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,713
Together.

316
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,458
Yeah.

317
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,842
Now what?

318
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,338
Things have changed. The market's tough.

319
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,764
I'm sure you can understand

320
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,183
why our beloved parent company,
Warner Bros.,

321
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,595
has decided to make a sequel
to the trilogy.

322
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,725
What?

323
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,099
They informed me
they're gonna do it with or without us.

324
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,850
I thought they couldn't do that.

325
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,193
[exhales]

326
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,610
Oh, they can.

327
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,781
And they made it clear

328
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,856
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

329
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,403
Really?

330
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,195
I know you said
the story was over for you,

331
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,281
but that's the thing about stories.

332
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,793
They never really end, do they?

333
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,750
We're still telling the same stories
we've always told,

334
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:21,009
just with different names,
different faces

335
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,718
and I have to say I'm kind of excited.

336
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,884
After all these years,

337
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,141
to be going back
to where it all started.

338
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,223
Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>

339
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,230
I've spoken to Marketing...

[in normal voice] Tom?

342
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,696
Yeah.

343
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,371
Are you all right?

344
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,821
[exhales nervously]

345
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,781
Yeah.

346
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,913
[analyst] What were you feeling
at that point?

347
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,801
What was I feeling?

348
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,681
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

349
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,182
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

350
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,814
that has imprisoned me...

351
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,601
again.

352
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,568
[laughs]

353

[chuckles softly]

354
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,703
Not much of a choice.

355
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,874
No.

356
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,824
Maybe it's not as binary as that.

357
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,120
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

358
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,749
Yeah.

359
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,131
Thomas, you are a suicide survivor

360
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,009
gifted with a powerful imagination.

361
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,011
Those facts have combined

362
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,509
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

363
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,266
Yesterday, you walked into a meeting
with your business partner

364
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,597
and he ambushed you,

365
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,433
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

366
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,349
This attack
effectively took away your voice.

367
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,644
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

368
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,529
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

369
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,322
We've talked about the value
of adaptive anger in healing trauma.

370
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,490
Far from suggesting
a repeat of your initial breakdown,

371
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,659
I believe this episode
demonstrates healthy self-protection.

372
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,582
And more importantly,

373
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,836
I remember how hard it was
for you to share something like this.

374
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,339
Which tells me just how far we've come.

375
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,217
[chuckles softly]

376
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,680
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

377
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,519
[sighs]

378
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,766
Yeah.

First of all,
I know I speak for everyone

383
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,081
when I say that I'm so, so excited

384
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,752
to be working on a game
that was such a, well, game changer.

385
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,723
Now, the packet in front of you
has our focus group research.

Inside, you'll find the breakdown,

387
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,390
including key word association
with the brand.

388
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,602
The top two
being "originality" and "fresh,"

389
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,641
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

390
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,898
as you begin working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>

391

And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance

408
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,460
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

409

- trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

421

[Tiffany] I remember wanting a family,

448

but was that because
that's what women are supposed to want?

449
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,843
How do you know
if you want something yourself

450
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,415
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

Mm.

He laughed.

494
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,978
And I laughed too, like it was a joke.

How could it not be, right?

496

I wanted to kick him so hard.

499
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,452
Not too hard.

500
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,702
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

501
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,157
[chuckles]

502
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,044
And right now,
you're probably regretting

503
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,542
sitting down with me.

504
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,294
This is the best thing I've done
in a long time.

507
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,675
I have to take this.

508
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,356
Hi, this is Tiff.

509
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,605
Oh, God, no.

510
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,773
[gasps]

511
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,108
I'll be right there.

512
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,525
My... My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

513
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,690
Oh.

514
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,161
I gotta go.

515
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,951
I hope I see you again.

<i>Proceed calmly to the nearest exit
and leave the building immediately.</i>

519
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,098
What's going on?

520
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,196
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

521
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,922
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

522
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,946
Or they're just a dick.

523
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,197
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

[suspenseful music playing]

00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,054
[security guard] Sir, this way.

527
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,057
Jude?

528
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,642
Jude!

529
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,072
At last.

530
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,317
[chuckles] Ah.

531
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,530
I wasn't too sure about the callback,
but, you know, it was hard to resist.

532
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,908
What?

533
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,539
Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.

534
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,950
Lightning, thunder and theater.

535
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,665
At last.

536
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,420
All these years later, here's me,
strolling out of a toilet stall.

537
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,004
Tragedy or farce?

538
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,839
I know you.

539
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,799
Not every day you meet your maker.

540
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,089
This can't be happening.

541
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,928
Oh, most definitely is.

542
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,343
You can't be a character I coded.

543
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,512
One hundred percent natural.

544

[gasps softly]

545
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,024
How?

546
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,444
All the explanation you need.

547
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,278
Oh.

548
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,487
No.

549
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,531
No, no, no.

550
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

551
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,169
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

552
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:49,374
[hesitating] It was a test.
An experiment.

553
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,880
An experiment?

554
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,387
You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,

555
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,718
left me to bang my head

556
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,140

557
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,927
as an experiment.

558
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,999
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

559
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,354
What? There's no time.

560
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,185
I know, I know. He's having a moment.

561
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,655
Does he know
how hard it was to hack that mirror?

[tense music playing]

This... This can't be real.

We got him.

This isn't happening.

No.

It can't be.

I've missed you.

[analyst] Can you hear me, Thomas?

596
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,178
Follow my voice.

597
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,766
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

[bell tinkling]

599
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,144
The bell.

600
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,072
Do you hear the bell?

601
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,537
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

602
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,456
You must have walked.

603
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,085
I heard Déja Vu outside,
opened my door, and there you were.

[Thomas Anderson exhales]

You feel like you can talk about it?

606
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,782
When we started working together,

607
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,175
you had lost your capacity
to discern reality from fiction.

608
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,060
You came to me
after trying to jump off a building.

609
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,679
You said you wanted to fly away.

610

[people shouting]

612
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,908
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

613
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,289
but you seem
particularly triggered right now.

614
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,745
Can you tell me how it started?

615
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,457
He texted me.

616
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,918
Who?

617
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,503
Morpheus.

618
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,674
Ah.

619
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,761
So, he's back.

620
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,013
It wasn't actually him.

621
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,926
It was a program I coded for a Modal.

622
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,725
And this Modal, Morpheus,

623
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,014
came to help you escape

624
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,522
from a virtual reality
called <i>The Matrix?</i>

625
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,992
Am I crazy?

626
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,494
We don't use that word in here.

627
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,121
What word should I use?

628
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,456
What word explains
what is happening to me?

629
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,341
Can I see the texts?

630
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,759
[exhales]

631
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,336
They were erased.

632
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,974
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

633
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,889
what do you think we'd find there?

634
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,101
Nothing.

635
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,902
Because there was no attack.

636
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,693
No one was Killed.

637
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,195
No one texted.

638
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,869
My mind made it all up.

639
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,539
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

640
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,537
Is that what you believe?

641
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,743
It felt real.

642
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,628
Of course.

643
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,254
It was your great ambition
to make a game

644
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,426
that was indistinguishable from reality.

645
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,679
To achieve this goal,

646
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,555
you converted elements of your life
into narrative.

647
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,925
Your sublimated anger toward
your business partner

648
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,718
cast him as your nemesis.

649
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,890
A married woman named Tiffany
became the Trinity of a doomed romance.

650
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,027
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>

651
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,480
There's nothing wrong with that.

652
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,114
It's what artists do.

653
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,241
But it becomes a problem

654
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,912
when fantasies
endanger us or other people.

655

We don't want anyone to get hurt,

What we didn't understand
was that they could alter your DSI.

or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

[Morpheus] But based on what we do know,

782
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,228
it appears no one found you

- That's not true.
- [Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.

Maybe there's no foundation
to the rumors that you disappeared

because you were
working with the Machines

01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,015
[both grunt]

1001
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,141
like none of it mattered.

1002
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,020
All of it mattered.

1003
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,273
I can show you.

1004
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,532
This is my crew.

1005
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,832
Our operator, Seq.

1006
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,547
Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.

1007
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,461
Nice to meet you.

1008
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,084
Dad loved redwoods.

1009
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,589
When he escaped the Matrix
and found out they no longer existed,

1010
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:32,764
it almost killed him.

1011
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,387
Lucky he met Mom,

1012
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,393
and here I am.

1013
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,689
This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.

1014
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,604
Hi.

1015
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,269
You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.

1016
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,779
Roland was your grandfather?

1017
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,776
He always laughed,
joking how he never believed in you.

1018
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,029
But, in private, he said
that you freed his mind a second time.

1019
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,747
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

1020
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,745
but this is kind of
a huge moment for me.

1021
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,785
Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.

1022
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,625
A what?

1023
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,836
There's a lot of people
out there like me

1024
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,133
who are a little bit obsessed
with your life.

1025
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,741
I would never have recognized your Modal
if it weren't for him.

1026
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,974
Whenever you're feeling up for it,
I've got, like, a million questions.

1027
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,475
Me too. Starting with them.

1028
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,855
[Bugs] It's okay.

1029
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,648
Come meet him.

1030
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,189
This is Cybebe.

1031
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,771
That's Octacles.

1032
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,935
- That's Lumin8.
- [chittering]

1033
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,813
Machines are on our side now?

1034
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,949
They are synthients.
It's a word they prefer to Machines.

1035
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,453
Your contact with the Synthient City
had a huge impact on their world.

1036
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:37,995
[Bugs] That's what I meant.

1037
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,954
What you changed that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

1038
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,120
The meaning of "our side."

1039
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,879
[Cybebe warbling softly]

1040
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,257
Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives
to help get you out.

1041
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,723
Thank you.

1042
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,267
But why?

1043
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,093
[Morpheus] Not all seek to control.

1044
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,012
Just as not all wish to be free.

1045
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,939
What is that?

1046
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,522
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

1047
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,778
It gives programs access to this world.
Within limits.

1048
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,941
Limits are the domain of the limited.

1049
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,200
Morpheus.

1050
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,745
Thank you.

1051
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,278
It was my honor.

1052
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,406
[chuckles] Wow.

1053
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,728
- [crew chuckles]
- How does it work?

1054
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,117
Paramagnetic oscillation.

1055
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,662
If you want,
I can download the codex manual for you.

1056
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,081
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

1057
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,375
Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.

1058
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,502
Can I ask them something?

1059
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,554
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

1060
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,051
[warbling softly]

1061
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,888
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

1062
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,436
It could be Trinity.

1063
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,524
It's her.

1064
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,566
I figured we were going to
have this conversation.

1065
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,149
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

1066
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,738
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe had never accessed,

1067
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:58,990
and she's now exiled.

1068
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,201
We burned our one shot for you.

1069
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,686
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

1070
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,576
we have no idea how to do it.

1071
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,753
Yet.

1072
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,547
Nobody believed we'd ever find him,

1073
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,177
but we did.

1074
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,712
Okay.

1075
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,723
We don't know how to get her out... yet.

1076
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,437
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

1077
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,774
We're here.

1078
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,026
Zion?

1079
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,275
Have a seat.

1080
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,403
This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.

1081
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,913
Quite a few synthients
deserve that title before me.

1082
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,769
[Control on radio]
Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared for landing.</i>

1083
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,793
<i>Welcome home.</i>

1084
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,460
[Hanno] Thank you, Control.

1085
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,120
Um, we're about to crash.

1086
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,040
[dramatic music playing]

1087
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,051
[chuckles]

1088
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,506
General realized we were never going to
beat the Sentinels,

1089
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,640
so we just got better at
hiding from them.

1090
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,809
Welcome to Io.

1091
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,558
Io.

1092

[sweeping music playing]

1093
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,030
Wow. That looks real.

1094
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,120
Bio-sky.

1095
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,541
Works kind of like grow lights.

1096
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,911
It's way more complex than that.

1097
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,456
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

1098
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,751
It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles.

1099
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,173
Plus... [sighs]

1100
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,763
It is pretty to look at.

1101
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,674
As opposed to that.

1102
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,556
I guess the general
sent us a welcome party.

1103
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,243
God damn.

1104
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,537
It is you.

1105
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,581
Niobe?

1106
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,332
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

1107
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,840
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

1108
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,506
I sure as shit never saw this coming.

1109
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,473
Neither did I.

1110
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,758
I told you he was alive.

1111
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,052
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

1112
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,666
General, if you'd just let me explain.

1113
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,478
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

1114
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,939
I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity
and I was afraid we'd lose him.

1115
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,650
But, General,
people have been waiting for so long.

1116
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,573
We found The One.

1117
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,111
I don't believe in The One.

1118
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,497
I never did.

1119
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,249
No?

Me neither.

1121
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:58,587
But there was a time
when you trusted me with your ship,

1122
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,009
against the Council's orders.

1123
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,136
The world was different then.

1124
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,594
We were different.

1125
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,059
Report to the docks.

You are done, Captain.

[gasps softly]

1130
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,239
We need to talk.

[Niobe] When word first came,

1132
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,454
that it actually might be you,

1133
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:45,011
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,937
It is nice to see you.

- It's good to see you too.
- [glasses clink]

1136

A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.

1137
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,864
[chuckles] Yes.

1138
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,158
A lot has changed.

1139
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,616
Except maybe you.

1140
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,961
You remember this?

1141
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,762
It's so easy to forget how much noise
the Matrix pumps into your head

1142
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,300
until you unplug.

1143
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,052
[Neo sighs]

1144
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,182
Yeah.

1145
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,557
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1146
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,817
Takes over every damn thing

1147
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,603
just like the Matrix.

1148
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,282
War.

1149
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,618
I stood at the barricade of the Temple.

1150
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,697
Staring at the army of Sentinels,

1151
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,451
waiting for them to Kill
every one of us.

1152
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,997
But then, they left.

1153
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,633
They said you saved us.

1154
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,009
I didn't believe it.

1155
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,343
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1156
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,257
But then,

1157
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,053
I would wake up to this...

1158
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,524
silence.

1159
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,655
I'm ashamed of it now.

1160
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,693
My pessimism
of how long it took me to believe

1161
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,954
a world without war was possible.

1162
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,953
You gave me that.

1163
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,876
You gave that gift to us all.

1164
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,090
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1165
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,548
Come help me get up.

1166
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,338
Let's take a walk.

1167

[mysterious music playing]

[elevator door opens]

1169
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,497
Oh! Beautiful.

1170
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,667
This is Freya, head of botany.

1171
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,830
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1172
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:29,088
I presume
our guest needs no introduction.

1173
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,720
Nothing travels faster than light.

1174
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,129
Except gossip.

1175

[Freya chuckles]

1176
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,891
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1177
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,186
A strawberry?

1178
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,350
Using digital code from the Matrix,
we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.

1179
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,983
And they grow here?

1180
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:50,317
It's not easy augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...

1181
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,073
- We're getting there.
- [chuckles]

1182
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,530
Go ahead. Try it.

1183
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,996
[Niobe chuckles]

1184
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,327
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1185
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,291
You remember that shit we used to eat?

1186
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,706
That slop that tasted like rust.

1187
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,845
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1188
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,346
Why?

1189
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,049
Because we needed synthients

1190
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,473
and DI like him.

1191
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,855
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1192
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,062
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1193
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,233
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1194
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:35,070
This city was built
by us and them.

1195
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,415
What happened to Zion?

1196
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,794
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1197
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:51,341
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1198
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,753
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1199
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:58,844
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1200
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,261
For the first time,

1201
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,476
<i>we saw machines at war with one another.</i>

1202
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:12,479
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1203
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,109
That was the last we heard from her.

1204
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,992
Morpheus.

1205
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,626
[Niobe] After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1206
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,787
High Chair of the Council.

1207
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,791
Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]

1208
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:37,338
But as rumors of this new power spread,

1209
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,721
he ignored them.

1210
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:43,260
He was certain what you had done
could not be undone.

1211
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,602
All of these people
never stopped believing in miracles,

1212
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,107
believing in you.

1213
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,537
I'm sorry.

1214
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,910
How could I know this would happen?

1215
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,169
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1216
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,955
No more than we do now.

1217
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,466
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1218
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,256
but I need your help.

1219
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,430
Trinity is alive.

1220
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,216
Then there is another question.

1221
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,055
Why did they keep her alive?

1222
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,435
I can't answer that.

1223
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,814
But if there's a chance I can free her,

1224
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,645
I have to try.

1225
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,483
Even if it means
endangering everyone in this city?

1226
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,116
I'm sorry, Neo.

1227
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:45,205
I won't let what happened to Zion
happen to Io.

1228
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,832
I hope you'll forgive an old woman
for asking you to go with Sheperd here,

1229
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,255
till we have better understanding
of what's going on.

1230
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,758
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1231
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,795
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1232
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,798
but neither does growing old.

1233
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,726
But you don't hear me complaining.

about the old days.

About you, the viral Agent.

The siege of Zion.

Everything was simpler back then.

It's different now.

to remain meekly incarcerated

He used our bond

It's so obvious once you see it, right?

1335

Well, mostly just extremely violent

I need to dissuade you

Now, my predecessor loved precision.

His Matrix was all fussy facts

He hated the human mind.

So he never bothered to realize
that you don't give a shit about facts.

It's all about fiction.

01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:04,733
where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.

1649
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:07,829
[Niobe] I'm sorry.

1650
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:09,737
You knew what happened to him?

1651
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,907
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive,

1652
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:15,334
and you didn't tell me?

1653
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:18,166
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1654
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,957
But Io needed you.

1655
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,468
This city needed to be built
for your people as well as mine.

1656
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:26,261
If I would have told you everything,

1657
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,682
you would have had
a very difficult choice to make.

1658
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,304
My friends

1659
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,891
let me make my own choices.

1660
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,181
If it was a mistake,

1661
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,316
you have my deepest apologies.

1662
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:41,774
Why are you here now?

1663
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:44,359
Neo's escape
has destabilized the Matrix.

1664
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,025
The Anomaleum draws its current
from Trinity alone now.

1665
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:51,287
A fail-safe has been triggered to reset
the Matrix back to the previous version.

1666
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:53,331
But The Analyst halted the reset.

1667
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:56,710
He's convinced the authorities
that you will soon return voluntarily.

1668
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:59,328
And why would he say that?

1669
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,924
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1670
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:08,133
Faced with returning to your pod

1671
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,344
or enduring Trinity's death again.

1672
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,308
What would you choose, Neo?

1673
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,677
I'll go back.

1674
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,727
Well, The Analyst knows you well,

1675
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,393
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1676
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:22,605
After you escaped,

1677
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,655
he should have accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1678
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,075
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1679
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:31,077
that now exists before us.

1680
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:33,621
A few hours ago,

1681
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,202
no one would have been able
to convince me

1682
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:42,418
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1683
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,457
as crazy as this one.

1684
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,883
What are you doing?

1685
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,639
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

1686
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:56,053
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1687
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,560
Now you don't have to order me,
General, 'cause I'm volunteering.

1688
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,477
I need two more.

1689
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,363
Are you out of your minds?

1690
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,778
You don't even know what it is.

1691
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:16,288
General, we know you.

1692
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:20,202
If you say this is important,
none of us is choosing to stay home.

1693
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,669
Thank you.

1694
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:33,760
Knuckle up and good luck.

[Kujaku chittering]

1697
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,298
[Sati] Trinity is held in the Anomaleum,
which is in this transmission tower.

<i>and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.</i>

1700
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,929
So stealth will be paramount.

1701
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,840
As long as we raise no alarms,

1702
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:18,079
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1703
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:21,095
You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,
sneaking across an entire power plant,

1704
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:24,516
climbing a two-kilometer tower
guarded by thousands of Sentinels?

1705
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:25,687
That's the easy part?

1706
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:27,101
Exactly so.

1707
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,987
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1708
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,656
who does this every day

1709
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:33,112

Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1713

In order to unplug Trinity's body,

while her mind
still remains connected to the Matrix,

1726
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,765
I'm gonna need a second human brain
to implement the bypass.

1727
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,642
And since Neo must be with The Analyst,

1728
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:26,896
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match is yours.

Does Trinity still have to
take the red pill?

1734
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:01,152
Since Kujaku and I are transferring
her consciousness onto the ship,

1735
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,924
it's not strictly necessary.

1736
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,810
But what matters
is that this is her choice.

1737
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,388
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind

1738
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,724
will, in all probability, kill her.

1739
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:14,485
But even if it is what she wants,

1740
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:17,989
won't The Analyst
just order the Sentinels to stop you?

1741
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,239
He will.

1742
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,821
But if my plan works, it won't matter.

1743

Why?

1744

Because we'll already be gone.

Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,
there has to be a reason why.

the designs to me.

1748

Lex.

1974
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:11,635
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1975
02:08:12,643 --> 02:08:14,225
Seq, where's Neo?

1976
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:15,931
It's bad. They're pinned.

1977

It's so beautiful.

1988
02:10:28,112 --> 02:10:29,773
I remember this.

1989
02:10:31,907 --> 02:10:34,069
I remember us.

1990
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:54,176
My dream ended here.

1991
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:06,643
We can't go back.

1992
02:11:08,778 --> 02:11:09,859
We won't.

"Tiffany"?

2009
02:13:54,818 --> 02:13:57,651
[chuckles] It was a private joke.

2010
02:13:57,821 --> 02:13:59,277
An amusement, that's all.

2011
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:01,530
An amusement? Hmm.

Okay. Ow.

If you hated the name so much,
why did you heel

That was for using children.

2027
02:14:43,075 --> 02:14:44,565
We have a few questions.

2028
02:14:44,743 --> 02:14:47,906
- You tried to activate the fail-safe.
- The Suits tried.

2029
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:50,242
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

2030
02:14:50,416 --> 02:14:51,747
I knew that was impossible.

2031
02:14:51,917 --> 02:14:53,954
So, why haven't the Suits purged you?

2032
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,786
Because I know the system.

2033
02:14:57,631 --> 02:14:59,372
I know human beings.

2034
02:15:00,134 --> 02:15:01,624
And I know you.

2035
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:03,964
[bones crack, sighs]

2036
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:07,297
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

2037
02:15:07,474 --> 02:15:09,715
You should. It was a victory. Bravo.

2038
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:11,892
Now what?

2039
02:15:12,062 --> 02:15:14,679
You've come here
to negotiate some kind of deal?

2040
02:15:14,857 --> 02:15:16,268
You think you hold all the cards

2041
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:18,729
because you can do
whatever you want in this world.

2042
02:15:18,902 --> 02:15:21,234
I say, go for it.

2043
02:15:21,405 --> 02:15:23,897
Remake it. Knock yourselves out.

2044
02:15:24,074 --> 02:15:25,985
Paint the sky with rainbows.

2045
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,275
But here's the thing.

2046
02:15:27,453 --> 02:15:30,320
The sheeple aren't going anywhere.

2047
02:15:30,497 --> 02:15:31,737
They like my world.

2048
02:15:31,915 --> 02:15:34,748
They don't want this sentimentality.

2049
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:36,659
They don't want freedom or empowerment.

2050
02:15:36,837 --> 02:15:39,204
They want to be controlled.

2051
02:15:39,381 --> 02:15:41,338
They crave the comfort of certainty.

2052
02:15:41,508 --> 02:15:44,170
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

2053
02:15:44,345 --> 02:15:47,679
unconscious and alone, just like them.

2054
02:15:49,642 --> 02:15:51,258
[both chuckle]

2055
02:15:52,102 --> 02:15:54,719
We're not here to negotiate anything.

2056
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:56,979
We were on our way to remake your world.

2057
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:58,560
Change a few things.

2058
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:01,101
I kind of like the
"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.

2059
02:16:01,195 --> 02:16:03,357
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

2060
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:04,986
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

2061
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:07,489
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

2062
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,697
Something he should think about.

2063
02:16:10,788 --> 02:16:14,326
Before we got started,
we decided to stop by to say thank you.

2064
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:17,955
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

2065
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:19,459
And what is that?

2066
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:21,963
Another chance.

2067
02:16:22,299 --> 02:16:24,131
[punk rock music playing]

2068
02:27:25,545 --> 02:27:28,128
Face reality, people. Movies are dead.

2069
02:27:28,298 --> 02:27:30,130
Games are dead.

2070
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,086
Narrative? Dead.

2071
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,126
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

2072
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,220
and viral conditioning.

2073
02:27:35,388 --> 02:27:36,924
Wait, what are you two talking about?

2074
02:27:39,225 --> 02:27:40,386
Cat videos.

2075
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:44,853
What we need is a series of videos

2076
02:27:45,023 --> 02:27:47,264
that we call "The Catrix."
