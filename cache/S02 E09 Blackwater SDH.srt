1
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,592
Man: That's it.

2
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,442
(Man coughing)

3
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,791
(Thunder rumbling)

4
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,752
The tide's against us.

5
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,170
Aye, but we have the wind.

6
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,382
She'll blow us straight to the gates.

7
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,585
Matthos: You're coming home.

8
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,553
Davos: King's landing hasn't been home
for 20 years.

9
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,766
I spent most of my life
dodging the royal fleet.

10
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,187
And now I'm sailing right at them.

11
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,440
This is the royal fleet.

12
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,501
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

13
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,695
Of course, there are...
Several royal fleets at the moment.

14
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,821
Not after tonight.

15
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,616
When the sun rises,
Stannis will sit on the iron throne

16
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,160
and you will be his hand.

17
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,995
- Gods be good.
- God.

18
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,306
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

19
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,499
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

20
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,545
The people of king's landing did not
choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.

21
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,304
They will be glad to
see his head on a spike.

22
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,800
Well, first, we have to put it there.

23
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,720
Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.

24
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,472
Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.

25
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,766
Those walls have never been breached,

26
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,976
and the men guarding the walls,

27
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,188
when they see you,
they don't see a liberator,

28
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,274
they see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

29
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,110
I have faith in the lord of light.

30
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,237
I have faith in our cause.

31
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,032
And I have faith in my captain.

32
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,786
(Thunder rumbling)

33
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,069
Are you afraid, my lion?

34
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,828
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

35
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,082
Of course I'm afraid.

36
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,170
I won't let them hurt you.

37
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,468
I'm a Lannister.

38
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,263
I don't have a choice in all this.

39
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,599
But it's not your war.

40
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,274
It is now.

41
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,489
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

42
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,659
I have so far.

43
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,957
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

44
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,171
That I should make love to you
like it was your last day on this earth.

45
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,644
Pycelle: As you know, your grace,

46
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,564
it is not only the sworn duty of a maester

47
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,692
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

48
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,528
but also to offer guidance

49
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,781
and counsel in times of war.

50
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,409
Your words are always wise and measured.

51
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,912
- If you could...
- If anything,

52
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,916
a maester's duties become more urgent

53
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,336
in times of war and turmoil.

54
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,757
I remember back in the days of king...

55
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,383
You brought me something?

56
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
Yes.

57
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,224
Essence of nightshade

58
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,312
is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

59
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,857
A single drop in a cup of wine

60
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,694
suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

61
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,491
Three drops will bring on
a deep and dreamless sleep.

62
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,619
Ten drops, however...

63
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,454
I know what ten drops will bring.

64
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,915
Your grace, if I may ask...

65
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,375
You may not.

66
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,921
You must have a lot of work to do.

67
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,548
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

68
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,303
Yes. A siege is very...

69
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,707
Be careful on the stairs, grand maester.
There are so many.

70
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,519
Your grace.

71
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,983
Men: (Singing) And so he spoke

72
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,071
that lord of castamere

73
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:13,076
but now the rains weep o'er his halls

74
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,497
with no one there to hear

75
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:22,711
yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls

76
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:28,341
and not a soul to hear

77
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,262
- good boys!
- Lannisters!

78
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,180
Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

79
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,932
- Drunk lannisters.
- (All laughing)

80
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,894
You've got a pretty voice.

81
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,896
Thank you very much.

82
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,231
And I like your nose.

83
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,942
How many times you break it?

84
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,571
Well, now let's see.

85
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,991
First time, I was five.

86
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,369
- My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
- Oh.

87
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,372
It wasn't me she was aiming at.

88
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,332
She was trying for my little brother.

89
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,709
Now he was a real pest.

90
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,962
Second time, I was nine.

91
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,799
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

92
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,468
They won.

93
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,511
Third time...

94
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,023
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

95
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,152
Poornose.

96
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,780
Don't feel sorry for him.

97
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,699
He'll be halfway up your arse
before the night's through.

98
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,284
(Laughing)

99
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,337
Welcome, friends.

100
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,051
This round's on me.

101
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,479
I don't think he likes me.

102
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,577
You think you're a hard man?

103
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,329
(Chuckles)

104
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,164
I know it.

105
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,332
(Men laughing)

106
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,255
It's warm in here.

107
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,799
We've got beautiful women

108
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,217
and good brown ale.

109
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,719
Plenty for everyone.

110
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,930
And all you want

111
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,641
is to put one of us in the cold ground

112
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,519
with no women to keep us company.

113
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,938
Oh, there's women in the ground.

114
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,982
I put some there myself.

115
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,234
So have you.

116
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,196
You like fucking and drinking

117
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,990
and singing.

118
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,702
But killing,

119
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,122
killing's the thing you love.

120
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,208
You're just like me.

121
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,088
Only smaller.

122
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,176
And quicker.

123
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,428
Eh? (Chuckles)

124
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,224
Your lord imp's going to miss you.

125
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,820
I expect he will someday.

126
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,159
(Bells tolling)

127
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,660
Man: Here we are.

128
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,122
(All chatting)

129
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,507
One more drink before the war?

130
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,551
Shall we?

131
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,232
I've always hated the bells.

132
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,025
They ring for horror.

133
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,736
A dead king, a city under siege.

134
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,571
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

135
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,951
Podrick, is that it?

136
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,245
"Is that it?" Nice touch.

137
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,706
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

138
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,584
I'm not entirely sure
what you're suggesting.

139
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
what I'm suggesting.

140
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,298
Do you trust him?

141
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,512
Oddly enough, I do.

142
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,348
Good.

143
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,897
The map you asked for.

144
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,113
There must be 20 miles of tunnels
beneath the city.

145
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,823
Closer to 50.

146
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,451
The targaryens built this city
to withstand a siege

147
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,871
and to provide escape if necessary.

148
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,999
I'm not escaping.

149
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,310
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship,

150
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,974
and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

151
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,921
That is good to hear.

152
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,342
Though I'm sure many captains say the same
while their ship is afloat.

153
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,054
You look well suited for battle, my lord.

154
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,597
Well, I'm not.

155
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,517
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

156
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,520
My little birds tell me

157
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,899
that Stannis Baratheon has taken up
with a red priestess from asshai.

158
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,818
What of it?

159
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,196
You don't believe in
the old powers, my lord?

160
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,408
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
What do you think?

161
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,037
I think you believe in what you see

162
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,582
and in what those you trust have seen.

163
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,919
You probably don't entirely trust me.

164
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,047
Mmm, don't take it personally.

165
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,673
I don't entirely trust myself.

166
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
And yet I have seen things

167
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,054
and heard things,

168
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,932
things you have not,
things I wish I had not.

169
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,481
I don't believe I've ever told you
how I was cut.

170
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,109
No, I don't believe you have.

171
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
One day, I will.

172
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,911
The dark arts have
provided lord Stannis with his armies

173
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,372
and paved his path to our door.

174
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,543
For a man in service to such powers
to sit on the iron throne,

175
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,837
I can think of nothing worse.

176
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,423
And tonight,

177
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,260
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

178
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,693
(Tolling continues)

179
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,415
They're welcoming the new king.

180
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,708
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

181
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,254
They want to play
music with us? Let's play.

182
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,090
- Drums.
- Drums!

183
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,009
(Men shouting)

184
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,343
Tyrion: Remember, wait till the ships...

185
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,594
Bronn: The ships are in the bay.

186
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,788
- They must be far enough in...
- I know what "in" means.

187
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,082
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

188
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,626
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

189
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,587
I saw you kill a man with a shield.

190
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,213
You'll be unstoppable with an ax.

191
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,342
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

192
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,387
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

193
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,099
Just because I pay you for your services
doesn't diminish our friendship.

194
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,309
Enhances it, really.

195
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,978
Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.

196
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,856
Been spending time with fancy folks.

197
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,078
Lady sansa and Sheila.

198
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,248
- Shae.
- Shae, yes.

199
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,461
Surely my sister has asked you to join the
other highborn ladies in maegor's holdfast.

200
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,923
She has, my lord, but king
Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

201
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,383
Sansa.

202
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,219
Always been a great romantic, my nephew.

203
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,929
Joffrey: Sansa, come here.

204
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,767
I will pray for your safe return, my lord.

205
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,687
- Will you?
- Just as I pray for the king's.

206
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,944
Stay safe, my lady.

207
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,654
And you, my lion.

208
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,745
Your king rides forth to battle.

209
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,873
You should see him off with a kiss.

210
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,042
My new blade.

211
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,794
Hearteater, I've named it.

212
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,839
Kiss it.

213
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,601
You'll kiss it again when I return

214
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,478
and taste my uncle's blood.

215
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,188
Will you slay him yourself?

216
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,817
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,820
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the vanguard?

218
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,866
A king doesn't discuss battle plans
with stupid girls.

219
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,161
I'm sorry, your grace.
You're right, I'm stupid.

220
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,747
Of course you'll be in the vanguard.

221
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,959
They say my brother robb always goes
where the fighting is thickest.

222
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,836
And he is only a pretender.

223
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
Your brother's turn will come.

224
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,592
Then you can lick his blood
off hearteater, too.

225
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,815
Some of those boys will never come back.

226
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,358
Joffrey will.

227
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,986
- The worst ones always live.
- Shh.

228
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,739
Come, my lady.

229
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,997
(Men shouting)

230
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,968
(Men shouting)

231
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,233
(Distant drums beating)

232
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,537
Where's our fleet?

233
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,622
On the way.

234
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,667
Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

235
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,422
Hound, tell the hand
that his king has asked him a question.

236
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,257
The king has asked you a question.

237
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,845
Ser lancel, tell the hound to tell the king
that the hand is extremely busy.

238
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,848
The hand of the king would like me
to tell you to tell the king...

239
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,018
If I tell the hound to cut you in half,
he'll do it without a second thought.

240
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,062
That would make me the quarterman.

241
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,106
It just doesn't have the same ring to it.

242
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,235
Cut me in half and I won't be
able to give the signal.

243
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,569
No signal, no plan.

244
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,156
No plan and Stannis Baratheon
sacks this city, takes the iron throne,

245
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,159
puts your pinched little head
atop a gate somewhere.

246
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,829
It might be quite amusing,

247
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,632
except that my head would be up there, too.

248
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,624
I've never much liked my head,

249
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,627
but I don't want to
see it removed just yet.

250
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,215
Where are their ships?

251
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,926
It was wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

252
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,054
Lord varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

253
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,681
There are no surprises here.

254
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,891
If it's true there is
dissension in their ranks,

255
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,727
maybe their sailors have mutinied.

256
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,353
Maybe.

257
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,646
(Drumming continues)

258
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,409
(Baby crying)

259
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,830
I don't know why she wants me here.

260
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,791
She's always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.

261
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,295
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

262
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,630
I doubt it.

263
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,300
Maybe she's jealous of you.

264
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,719
Why would she be jealous?

265
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,345
Sansa.

266
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,852
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

267
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,855
You look pale, child.

268
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,483
Is your red flower still blooming?

269
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,276
Yes.

270
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,361
Fitting, isn't it?

271
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,282
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

272
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,910
Pour lady sansa some wine.

273
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,453
I'm not thirsty, your grace.

274
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,997
So? I didn't offer you water.

275
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,712
What's he doing here?

276
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,589
Ser ilyn?

277
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,300
He's here to defend us.

278
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,970
When the axes smash down those doors,
you may be glad to have him.

279
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,306
But we have guards to defend us.

280
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,974
Guards we have paid.

281
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,618
Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones out of the doors.

282
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,645
(Door opening)

283
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,984
The lads caught a groom and two maids
trying to sneak away

284
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,111
with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

285
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,948
The battle's first traitors.

286
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,574
Have ser ilyn see to them.

287
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,370
Put their heads on spikes
outside the stables as a warning.

288
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,290
The only way to keep the small folk loyal

289
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,502
is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.

290
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,589
Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.

291
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,258
(Door closing)

292
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,677
You said he was here to protect us.

293
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,472
He is.

294
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,600
Traitors are a danger to us all.

295
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,310
More wine.

296
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,814
- (Distant drums beating)
- (Men shouting)

297
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,743
There they are.

298
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,959
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!

299
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,796
Archers!

300
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,095
Nock your arrows!

301
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,306
Man: Nock arrows!

302
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,143
- Hold fast.
- Man 1: Hold fast!

303
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,896
What are you doing? We need to attack them.

304
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,899
- Hold fast.
- Man 2: Boulders ready!

305
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,776
Man 1: Hold fast!

306
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,740
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

307
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,784
Where are the rest of them?

308
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,624
There's only one ship.

309
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,546
Archers, stand to!

310
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,131
Man the below!

311
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,425
- Nock.
- Man 3: Nock and set!

312
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,136
Draw!

313
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,268
Hold.

314
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,020
Man 3: Hold.

315
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,530
There's no one on board.

316
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,497
Man 4: More rocks coming up!

317
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,014
Man 3: Hold.

318
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,356
Wildfire.

319
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,275
Steer clear! Steer clear!

320
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,469
Matthos! Get down!

321
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,221
(Men screaming)

322
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,665
(Men wailing)

323
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,642
(Groans)

324
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,941
- Prepare to land.
- Your grace.

325
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,068
Stannis: The dwarf
has played his little trick.

326
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,862
- The wildfire.
- He can only play it once.

327
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,115
We're too far from the gates.

328
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,408
The fire, their archers...

329
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,536
Hundreds will die.

330
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,247
Thousands.

331
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,429
Come with me and take this city!

332
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,973
(Cheering)

333
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,117
Sansa, come here, little dove.

334
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,583
My queen.

335
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,918
What are you doing?

336
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,295
Praying.

337
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,173
You're perfect, aren't you?

338
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,507
Praying.

339
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,177
What are you praying for?

340
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,554
For the gods to have mercy on us all.

341
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,974
On all of us?

342
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,101
- Yes, your grace.
- Even me?

343
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,270
Of course, your grace.

344
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,855
Even Joffrey?

345
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,527
- Joffrey is my...
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

346
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,697
Praying to the gods
to have mercy on us all.

347
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,866
The gods have no mercy.
That's why they're gods.

348
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,120
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

349
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,041
My mother had just died, you see.

350
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,295
I didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.

351
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,548
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,

352
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,509
the gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.

353
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,471
Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

354
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,932
He believes in them,
he just doesn't like them very much.

355
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,811
One for her.

356
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,942
Here.

357
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,320
Sit.

358
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,113
Drink.

359
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,494
Not like that. Drink, girl.

360
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,083
I should have been born a man.

361
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,126
I'd rather face a thousand swords

362
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,672
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

363
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,676
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

364
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,928
It was expected of me,

365
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,515
as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

366
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,769
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

367
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,855
these hens will return to their cocks

368
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,901
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

369
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,903
lifted their spirits.

370
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,822
And if the city should fall?

371
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,742
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

372
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,954
The red keep should hold for a time,

373
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,542
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to lord Stannis in person.

374
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,378
If it were anyone else outside those gates,

375
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,380
I might have hoped for a private audience,

376
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,716
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

377
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,886
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

378
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,475
Have I shocked you, little dove?

379
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,228
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

380
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,941
The best one's between your legs.

381
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,736
Learn how to use it. Drink.

382
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,243
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

383
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,747
No, you wouldn't, would you?

384
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,751
If the city falls, these fine women

385
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,087
should be in for a bit of a rape.

386
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,842
Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.

387
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,262
You'll be glad of your red flower then.

388
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,267
When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.

389
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,606
A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.

390
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,734
A slice of cake

391
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
just waiting to be eaten.

392
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,115
- More pressure!
- (Men grunting)

393
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,420
Man 4: Pull! Pull!
Man 5: That's it, men!

394
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,924
Pull! Pull!

395
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,390
He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

396
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,725
They're coming. They're coming ashore.

397
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,603
Rain fire on them.

398
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,522
Archers!

399
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,773
There are too many.

400
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,776
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

401
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,694
that manages to touch solid ground.

402
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,741
Pod, run to the king's gate.

403
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,369
Bring any men guarding it here, now.

404
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,537
Yes, my lord.

405
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,624
Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.

406
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,376
You, too.

407
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,713
Any of these flaming fucking arrows
come near me,

408
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,383
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

409
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,594
(Men grunting)

410
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,223
Pull, pull! Go!

411
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,558
Nock!

412
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,147
Draw!

413
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,524
- Draw!
- Draw!

414
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,611
(Men grunting)

415
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,411
Man 6: Kill the lannisters!

416
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,205
- Loose!
- Loose!

417
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,550
- Draw!
- Draw!

418
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,844
- Loose!
- Loose!

419
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,182
To the mud gate, go now!

420
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,769
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the mud gate!

421
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,063
Hound: Any man dies with a clean sword,

422
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,440
I'll rape his fucking corpse.

423
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,109
(Grunting)

424
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,467
(Groans)

425
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,561
Cersei: When we were young, Jaime and I,

426
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,565
we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

427
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:30,235
I could never understand why
they treated us differently.

428
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,781
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and Lance and mace,

429
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,492
and I was taught to smile

430
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,452
and sing and please.

431
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,163
He was heir to casterly rock,

432
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,375
and I was sold to some
stranger like a horse

433
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,377
to be ridden whenever he desired.

434
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,796
You were Robert's queen.

435
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,007
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

436
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,179
I don't think I know this one.

437
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,437
Pretty.

438
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,862
That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

439
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,698
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

440
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,659
Straighten your back and bend.

441
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,497
Better. You learn fast.

442
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,335
How long have you been
in lady sansa's service?

443
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,963
A few weeks, your grace.

444
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,551
When did you leave lorath?

445
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,555
I had a lorathi handmaiden once.

446
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,353
But she was a nobleman's daughter.

447
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,604
You're not.

448
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,443
When did you come to Westeros?

449
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,655
Ten years ago, your grace.

450
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,409
From lorathi commoner to the red keep
in 10 years,

451
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,371
all without learning how to curtsy.

452
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,457
I imagine that's a very interesting story.

453
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,959
What's your name?

454
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,420
Shae, your grace.

455
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,506
Tell us a story, shae.

456
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,514
- When I was 13, I...
- (Door opens)

457
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,975
Your grace!

458
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,186
What news?

459
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,398
The imp has set the river afire.

460
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,109
Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.

461
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,611
Stannis' fleet destroyed, but...

462
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,697
But...

463
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,617
But his troops
have landed outside the city walls.

464
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,953
Where is Joffrey?

465
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,747
On the battlements with lord Tyrion.

466
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,083
Bring him back inside at once.

467
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,460
- Your grace...
- What?

468
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,296
The king's presence is good for morale.

469
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,091
Bring him back to his chambers now.

470
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,926
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

471
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,488
Do you want him to be mocked as a coward
for the rest of his life?

472
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,347
- No, but I...
- Now!

473
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,189
When I told you about
ser ilyn earlier, I lied.

474
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,818
Do you want to hear the truth?

475
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,279
You want to know why he's really here?

476
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,657
He's here for us.

477
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,910
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

478
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,912
but he will not take us alive.

479
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,378
(Grunting)

480
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,851
(Screaming)

481
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,239
Man 7: Help me!

482
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:05,909
(Groaning)

483
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,429
Man 8: Fall back!
Man 9: Fall back!

484
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,980
Get the ladders up!

485
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,045
(Grunts)

486
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,100
Faster, you bastards! Faster!

487
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,602
Come on, kill the scum!

488
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,690
Someone bring me a drink.

489
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,448
Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

490
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,295
Can I get you some iced milk

491
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,547
and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

492
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,299
Eat shit, dwarf.

493
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,885
You're on the wrong side of the wall.

494
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,887
I lost half my men.

495
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,432
The Blackwater's on fire.

496
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,727
Dog, I command you to
go back out there and fight.

497
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,649
You're kingsguard, clegane.

498
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,319
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city.

499
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,779
Your king's city.

500
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,824
Fuck the kingsguard.

501
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,619
Fuck the city.

502
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,204
Fuck the king.

503
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,171
(Men shouting)

504
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,807
Man 10: Loose!

505
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,851
Man 11: Put your backs into it!

506
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,020
All right, get up!

507
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,524
Man 10: Loose!

508
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,692
Clear!

509
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,027
- Fonnard!
- (Men shouting)

510
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,738
Man 10: Loose!

511
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,294
Fonnard ladders!

512
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,561
(Men shouting)

513
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,469
- Man 12: Heave!
- (Men grunting)

514
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,109
- Heave!
- (Men grunting)

515
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,902
Your grace,

516
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,989
the queen has sent me to
bring you back to the red keep.

517
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,743
If you won't defend your own city,
why should they?

518
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,870
What would you have me do?

519
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,288
Lead.

520
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,583
Get down there and lead your people
against the invaders who want to kill them.

521
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,504
What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?

522
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,922
She did not say, your grace.

523
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,884
Man 10: All men to the battlements!

524
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,638
Ser boros, ser mandon,

525
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,350
stay with my uncle and represent the king
on the field of battle.

526
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,104
Man 10: Archers, hold your line

527
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,772
or I'll kill you myself.

528
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,111
Stand fast!

529
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,791
Get up, you fool.

530
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,668
Man 13: We need more arrows!

531
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,840
Where is the king?

532
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,010
- Why isn't he with us?
- Man 14: Who are we fighting for?

533
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,055
Who leads us?

534
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,931
I'll lead the attack.

535
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,309
I'll lead the attack!

536
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,520
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

537
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,147
Pod, my helmet.

538
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,818
Ser mandon, you will
bear the king's banner.

539
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,361
Men, form up.

540
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,032
Men...

541
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,826
Men!

542
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,080
- They say I'm half a man.
- (Banging on door)

543
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,832
But what does that make the lot of you?

544
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,460
The only way out is through the gates.

545
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,920
And they're at the gates.

546
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,422
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

547
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,093
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their arses.

548
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,511
(Pounding continues)

549
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,138
Man 12: Heave!

550
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,973
Heave!

551
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,559
Don't fight for your king

552
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,937
and don't fight for his kingdoms.

553
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,607
Don't fight for honor.
Don't fight for glory.

554
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,068
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

555
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,029
This is your city Stannis means to sack.

556
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,864
That's your gate he's ramming.

557
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,201
If he gets in, it will be
your houses he burns,

558
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,204
your gold he steals,

559
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,706
your women he will rape.

560
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,211
Man 12: Heave! Heave!

561
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,380
Heave!

562
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,051
Those are brave men knocking at our door.

563
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,720
Let's go kill them.

564
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,430
(Cheering)

565
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,871
Lancel: The battle is lost, your grace.

566
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,166
Stannis' troops are at the gates.

567
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,960
When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,

568
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,087
they lost all heart.

569
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,589
Where is my son?

570
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,591
I want to escort him back to the battle.

571
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,426
Why do I care what you want?

572
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,995
- Bring me...
- Now listen to me...

573
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,597
(Groans)

574
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,522
Don't be afraid.
The queen has raised the drawbridge.

575
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,900
This is the safest place we can be.

576
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,861
Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

577
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,905
His knights have rallied behind him.

578
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,198
They will save the city.

579
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,867
Shall we sing a hymn?

580
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:08,289
(Singing) Gentle mother, font of mercy

581
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,668
save our sons from war, we pray

582
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,462
(gasps)

583
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,880
You must go.

584
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,466
Run to your chamber and bar your door.

585
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,594
Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

586
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,391
- Come with me.
- I need to say goodbye to someone.

587
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,560
The queen said they'd rape everyone.

588
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,312
No one is raping me.

589
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,566
Go. Run.

590
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,738
(Singing continues)

591
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,822
(Door closing)

592
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,166
(Breathing heavily)

593
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,591
(Distant screams)

594
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,899
- The lady is starting to panic.
- (Gasps)

595
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,610
What are you doing here?

596
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,529
Not here for long.

597
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,906
- I'm going.
- Where?

598
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,243
Some place that isn't burning.

599
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,997
North, might be.

600
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,915
Could be.

601
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,751
What about the king?

602
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,547
He can die just fine on his own.

603
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,305
I can take you with me.

604
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,308
Take you to winterfell.

605
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,189
I'll keep you safe.

606
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,694
Do you want to go home?

607
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,949
I'll be safe here.

608
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,200
Stannis won't hurt me.

609
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,829
Look at me.

610
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,291
Stannis is a killer.

611
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,626
The lannisters are killers.

612
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,338
Your father was a killer.

613
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,215
Your brother is a killer.

614
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,761
Your sons will be killers someday.

615
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,557
The world is built by killers.

616
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,356
So you'd better get
used to looking at them.

617
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,402
You won't hurt me.

618
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,745
No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

619
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,299
- Man 12: Heave!
- (Men grunting)

620
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,737
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!

621
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,988
(Groans)

622
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,326
Attack!

623
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,716
Roll it over!

624
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,849
(Men cheering)

625
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,019
(Chanting) Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

626
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,032
Oh, fuck me.

627
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,035
(Men shouting)

628
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,756
(Grunting)

629
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,550
(Groans)

630
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,737
(Groans)

631
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:52,948
(Groans)

632
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,085
Shh!

633
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,005
Be calm, my sweet.

634
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,965
They're still fighting.

635
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,969
No one's going to hurt you.

636
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,725
I'll tell you a story.

637
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,312
You know the one about
the mother lion and her little cub?

638
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,607
- They lived in the woods.
- The kingswood?

639
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,192
Yes, my love.

640
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,363
In the kingswood,
there lived a mother and her cub.

641
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,323
She loved him very much.

642
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,370
But there were other things
that lived in the woods. Evil things.

643
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,788
Like what?

644
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,667
Like stags.

645
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,253
Stags aren't evil.

646
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,129
They only eat grass.

647
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,631
And wolves.

648
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,591
My lord.

649
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,677
Cersei: He could hear them
howling in the night.

650
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,054
The little cub was frightened.

651
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:01,433
His mother said, "you are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid.

652
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,825
"For one day, all the
beasts will bow to you.

653
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,577
"You will be king.

654
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,873
"All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.

655
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,044
"The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

656
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,091
"all the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea,

657
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,887
"they will all come to you, little lion,

658
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,265
"to rest a crown upon your head."

659
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,148
And the cub said,

660
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,192
"will I be strong and
fierce like my father?"

661
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,529
"Yes," said his mother.

662
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,199
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

663
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,555
I will keep you safe, my love.

664
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,557
I promise you.

665
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,560
(Door opens)

666
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,526
Back to the boats!

667
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,405
Stand and fight!

668
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,493
Stand and fight, damn you!

669
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,249
Father.

670
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,549
The battle is over. We have won.

671
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:11,939
Man: (Singing) "And who are you,"
the proud lord said

672
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,360
"that I must bow so low?"

673
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:21,949
"Only a cat of a different coat

674
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,453
"that's all the truth I know

675
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:32,126
"in a coat of gold or a coat of red

676
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:37,131
"a lion still has claws

677
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:42,219
"and mine are long and sharp, my lord

678
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,557
"as long and sharp as yours"

679
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:54,690
and so he spoke, and so he spoke

680
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:59,695
that lord of castamere

681
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:04,825
but now the rains weep o'er his hall

682
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:09,621
with no one there to hear

683
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:15,085
yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall

684
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:19,798
and not a soul to hear
