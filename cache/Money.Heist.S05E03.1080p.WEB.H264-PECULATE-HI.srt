They're incredible teachers.

Like authentic, ivy-league professors.

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,625
Two brilliant captains
for your first flight.

161
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,208
And we chose, specifically for you,

162
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,083
a robbery with no risk.

163
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,041
Basically, just to enjoy it.

164
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,083
So, can you tell me, Dad,
how come this job has no risk?

165
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,125
It has no risk because no one will notice
they were robbed.

166
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,625
Well... [laughs]
At some point they'll find out.

167
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,541
[Berlin] No.

168
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,791
Not in a month, not in two, not in three.

169
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,333
- Not even ten.
- [Tatiana laughs]

170
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,208
In 15, yeah.
When the Viking gold museum opens.

171
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,458
But by then,
who's gonna connect the dots? [laughs]

172
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,958

of all the pieces

177
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,125
of the biggest Viking treasure hoard
discovered ever.

178
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,666
Eight months ago,
it was found at an archaeological site.

179
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,625
It was cataloged,

180
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,916
and now it's being kept in a secure room
in the Danish National Heritage.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,833
The real one's there, all locked up,
in limbo, awaiting its destiny.

182
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,708
And do you know
where that security room is?

183
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,375
In the Castle of Frederiksborg.

184
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,750
Exactly the same venue where I'll be
performing a concert in just three days.

First of all,

194
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,666
these are Viking burial gifts,
not a Viking treasure.

195
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,250
That's the correct term
archaeologists use.

196

And secondly, um, you're a total cynic.

and restores monasteries.

200
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,250
I'm sorry, I gotta say it.
These pieces belong in a museum.

201
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,500
Wait a minute. Are you calling this art?

202
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,958
- Really?
- Of course I am.

203
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,791
These pieces are more
than 1,000 years old.

204
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,208
They're hand carved.
They have Nordic mythology symbols.

205

- This is pure art!
- Any blacksmith could make this garbage!

206

This is the coarseness of barbarians!

207

Those people pillaged iconic pieces,
extraordinary ones:

Latin, Greek, Phoenician,

209
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,416
and then melted them
for their cups of wine, plates, amulets!

On top of that,
you release the governor from the bank.

First, he's an asshole and a coward.

Good morning.

244
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,291
We brought you here today
to this press conference

245
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,833
to fill you in
on all the latest information

00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,625
regarding the disappearance
of Alicia Sierra.

247
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,083
Former Inspector Alicia Sierra
has betrayed the police force

248
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,708
and she has now begun collaborating
with the Professor.

249
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:11,000
<i>We currently have no information regarding
her whereabouts after she fled the city.</i>

<i>But we're using all the means
at our disposal to bring her to justice.</i>

She looked like this when she disappeared.

252
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,083
A security camera from a store
close to her home captured this image.

Son of a bitch.

We traced her cell phone's
last registered location

255
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,875
to within two blocks
of the National Court.

256
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,791
A safe house has been located

257
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,958
where she might have coordinated
Murillo's evacuation.

258

<i>All this is currently under investigation.</i>

259
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,708
Forensic analysis
regarding the equipment found at her house

260
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,791
suggests that she leaked
email conversations

261
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,916
regarding the events in Algeria.

262
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
<i>She organized the depositions</i>

<i>as well as the broadcasting
of Aníbal Cortés' fake burial.</i>

<i>We've also found encrypted traces
of communication with underground servers.</i>

265

<i>Through them, Alicia Sierra leaked
sensitive information to the Professor.</i>

The police, the CNI, the government...
All of them fabricated evidence.

Shut it. Just shut up.

279
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,625
Do you really think they'll admit
they created fake evidence?

280
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,291
The CNI doesn't back down or apologize.
You know that perfectly well.

Are you planning an intervention?

As you can see,
the situation has drastically changed.

285

This is no longer a robbery with hostages.
It's a kidnapping with executions.

I can raise a child
in prison perfectly well.

313
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,750
Maternity ward. That's how you do it.

314
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,541
[Alicia pants]

315
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,791
[Manila] <i>Hey, Godfather...</i>

316
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,166
I'm grateful you brought me into this.

317
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,708
I really needed it.

318
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,833
Sweetie, if you needed money,
you just had to call us.

319
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,208
What I needed
was someone to believe in me.

320
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,833
She's talking about her dad, Papa.

321
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,375
For fuck's sake,
I know she's talking about her dad.

322
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,138
My dad thinks I can't be a robber anymore,

323
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,500
but actually,
I can do it now better than ever.

324
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,500
You gotta study.
We're going to print two billion bucks.

325
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,666
Like this: peekeepee, peekeepee... [laughs]

326
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,250
You... You told your father
you're here, right?

327
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,500
I didn't and I never will.

328
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,958
Yeah.

329
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,541
So, uh, we need to go to bed.

330
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,875
Tomorrow we have shooting practice
and... yeah. Come on.

331
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,458
- Buenas noches.
- [Denver] Good night.

332
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,541
[footsteps walking away]

333
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,625
[crickets chirping]

334
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Dani.

335
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,875
Kiddo!

336
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,166
- Wake up, man! Hey!
- What happened? What happened?

337
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,291
I think we might be getting
something wrong here.

338
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,583
What are you talking about, Papa, it's...

339
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,458
- [metal clangs]
- [Denver sighs]

340
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,166
Papa, it's five in the morning!
Why are you even up right now?

341
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
[Moscow] Maybe we didn't understand

342
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,208
the way Benjamín
wanted us to look after, uh, Julia

343
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,750
and we're screwing this up.

344
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,125
We're not screwing anything up.
Julia wants to be here.

345
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,583
And Julia... she's a grown-up woman,

346
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,583
with all her things,
with her independence.

347
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,375
[concerned] Even if she wants to do it,
I'm still supposed to tell Benjamín

348
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,791
that maybe I took her off of a good path.

349
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,166
And you know,
maybe what's a good path for me

350
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,875
is not the same as a good or a bad path
that Benjamín has in his head.

351
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,875
So, we should fix this, true up,
before we take her to a war zone.

352
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,083
[irritated] Papa, Benjamín's in jail
and we can't do anything about it

353
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,916
'cause we don't even have a phone.

354
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,250
We just need to move on. So good night.

355
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,291
[Denver sighs]

356
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,791
Come on, just get up!
I... I... I have to call him.

357
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,125
So you wanna go call him
in jail right now?

358
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,958
[spluttering] What do you mean?

359
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,291
We have to walk for three or four hours
just to find a phone so...

360
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,500
- I'm not going anywhere.
- [angry] What do you mean?

361
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,583
- God.
- Come on.

362
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,000
- Damn it, now I can't go back to sleep.
- So get up.

363
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,250
[action music plays]

364
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,708
Cover that C4 with steel sheets.
You don't wanna blow your head off.

365
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,291
[Tokyo]<i> Our defense strategy
was to move the weapons to a safe place.</i>

366
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,333
Take seven more.

367
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,041
Rio, grenades?

368
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,375
- Six.
- Take as many as you can, brother.

369
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
[Tokyo] <i>But rather than a bunker,</i>

370
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,541
<i>it felt like
we were digging our own graves.</i>

371
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,250
We can do this.

372
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,708
[Tokyo] <i>Without the Professor,
we felt like orphans.</i>

373
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,166
This is our last dance, Fatty.
Make it a good one.

374
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,958
[Tokyo] <i>No father, no plan, no hope.</i>

375
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,833
Pardon the soccer reference,
it's appropriate for the circumstances.

376
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,041
Sometimes, during the World Cup finals,
you know which team is gonna lose

377
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,916
by the look of fear in the players' faces
as they sing the anthem.

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,375
And that type of fear
is what I'm seeing here, right now.

379
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,083
But that's all about to change.

380
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,833
In soccer it's 11 against 11.

381
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
We're ten against 10,000 without a coach.

382
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,125
Ding, ding, ding!

383
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,041
Attention all the robbers
currently at the Bank of Spain.

384
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,208
Breaking news just arriving
straight from the stormwater tank:

385
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,541
Alicia Sierra no longer plays
for the police.

386
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,916
Tamayo dethroned her, left her on her own.

387
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,875
Sierra's playing solo.
You know what that means, don't you?

388
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,958
Care to guess?

389
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
Tokyo, Rio? Do you know?

390
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,625
The Professor hasn't lost just yet.

391
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,750
He's playing his own match
and still could win.

392
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,208
He's playing against a nutcase.

393
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,583
No. She's more than that.

394
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,458
[Palermo sighs]

395
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:13,083
She's also really pissed off,
because she was just betrayed

396
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,833
and thrown to the lions.

397
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,416
Right now she knows
the Professor's not her biggest enemy.

398
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:20,916
[metal clashes]

399
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,125
[screams in pain]

400
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,291
[pants]

401
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,791
- Breathe with your diaphragm.
- [Alicia] What?

402
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,291
So... So you control the contractions.

403
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,708
- Breathe with your diaphragm.
- [pants] Now you're a midwife too?

404
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,083
We can't win this war.

405
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,416
Ding, ding, ding!

406
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,708
The bear from the Balkans
gets it wrong again.

407
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,916
We don't need to win this war.
In fact, we're going to lose it...

408
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,208
but at a slow pace.

409
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,083
And you...

410
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,208
my boys and girls in red...

411
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,916
We... We're the fucking dregs of society,

412
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,166
a team with the biggest losers in history:

413
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,375
trans, criminals, scumbags, gays,

414
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,458
Balkans, Latinos... What the fuck
can they teach us about losing?

415
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,166
We know the terrible feeling
of a slow defeat.

416
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
We know it.

417
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,375
So it's just another day as losers.

418
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,500
And why do we wanna be losers again?

419
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,041
So we can melt the gold
and take it all out, brother.

420
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,166
Get back at it.

421
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,458
Sounds fucking good to me.

422
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,750
So you've got a losing plan
that you're not telling us about.

423
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,916
Of course I do.

424
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,958
I graduated as an engineer,

425
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,375
but my vocation
is a general in the infantry.

426
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,750
[exhale] I need to dilate.

427
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,916
Some... oxytocin... would be great.

428
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,125
Unfortunately, we don't have any...

429
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,666
- Something for the pain.
- No, no, no. You'll put the baby at risk.

430
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,291
[screams] Holy shit!

431
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,375
[moans]

432
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,750
We don't stand a chance at open warfare,

433
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,583
but in these rooms
their advantage disappears.

434
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,583
We're gonna crawl through every nook,
every corner,

435
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,208
every fucking pile of rubble.

436
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,458
We'll throw a grenade, then a second one,
followed by machine-gun fire.

437
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,208
This isn't a fucking Vietnam movie.

438
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,875
Exactly, it's much worse.
It's the defense of Stalingrad.

439
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,458
This strategy is not mine,
it's Vasily Chuikov's.

440
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,625
We're gonna blast music so loud
they won't hear our grenades fall,

441
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,250
they won't hear the explosions.
And what's better...

442
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,375
they won't even hear their own radios.

443
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,375
- [moans]
- [Professor] Alicia, listen to me.

444
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,875
Now you can no longer go to a hospital.

445
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,291
And you can't do it on your own.

446
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,125
You have to release us. You need our help.

447
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,541
- Let us help you.
- I'm gonna give birth...

448
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,666
alone.

449
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,625
Same way my grandma did,

450
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:56,666
and hundreds of other women
throughout history.

451
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,291
Like this! [sighs]

452
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:07,166
Welcome to the spectacle of life! [shouts]

453
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,208
I need three volunteers
and the mission won't be easy.

454
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,583
Those three people
will have to advance from the rear.

455
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:16,583
Our only chance
is to attack them from both fronts.

456
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,000
We need to move as fast as lightning.

457
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,583
Go through the elevator shaft
or the air ducts,

458
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,833
whatever, just be fucking fast.

459
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,375
[pants]

460
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,416
[moans]

461
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,625
[Alicia] Logroño.

462
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:33,458
You know more than him. How's my dilation?

463
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,916
Mm, I couldn't tell you.

464
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,583
Dilation is measured by touch.

465
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,583
Let's see.

466
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,000
What part of the plan is this?

467
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,833
The birth plan!

468
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,458
Three volunteers and, folks,

469
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,500
remember you're the most exposed, okay?

470
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,708
Good. Let's do it.

471
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,500
Let's go, come on!

472
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Denver,

473
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,958
say goodbye to her.

474
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,291
It'll be a long night.
And this might be our final one.

475
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,250
[door opens]

476
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,791
[Denver] Are we seriously gonna walk
the whole way?

477
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,250
It's five in the morning,
how else can we go?

478
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,208
Shit, maybe stealing a car.

479
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,041
There you go. Stealing, huh?

480
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,541
The first thing
that goes through your mind, right?

481
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,708
The smallest hitch comes...
Boom, let's steal.

482
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,601
You're one to talk. You brought to me
to steal the money-making factory.

483
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,625
So you'll learn to do it intelligently,
like the Professor.

484
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,333
He knows how to do it right.

485
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,583
You steal big in one go,

486
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,666
not in small amounts
and screwing people over.

487
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,041
Yeah, but it's 5:00 a.m.
Leaving now, we'll be back by 11:00 a.m.

488
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,916
If we come back to the Professor,
what are you gonna tell him?

489
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,708
See? You start using your head
and suddenly you make sense.

490
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,000
We'll steal a car.

491
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,541
But let's steal it
from someone who won't say anything.

492
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
[quiet footsteps]

493
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,083
[stealthy music plays]

494
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,208
- [Moscow] Hey!
- [Denver] Almost there.

495
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,583
[Moscow] Come on. Let's go.

496
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,666
[crickets chirping]

497
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,550
[Moscow] I don't know
what you want me to say.

498
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,708
What can I say
that you don't know already?

499
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,250
You know, there's always some risk.

500
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,583
The job is... It's huge.

501
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,208
It was calculated down to the millimeters.
I promise.

502
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:46,166
If something goes wrong, Julia will go
to a prison for men and I don't...

503
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,041
I don't even want to imagine it.

504
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,916
Yeah, but... she could ask
for a transfer for a women's prison,

505
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
which I'm sure they'll allow.

506
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,500
Julia's been through a big journey
to be where she is now.

507
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,833
She's...

508
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,125
[sobs] She's starting to live.

509
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:06,166
She's happy. I'd never seen
my daughter so happy in...

510
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,083
[sobs]<i> In 30 years.</i>

511
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:13,291
She's been in jail all her life.
Don't put her back there.

512
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,750
If the job is as big as you say,
how can you look after her?

513
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:24,375
[sighs] Of course I will.
As if she's my daughter.

514
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,333
Benjamín, listen,

515
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,208
I'm on Julia's side to death,
you understand?

516
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,916
And I'll always be. To death!

517
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,208
[patrons murmuring]

518

[man coughs]

519
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,125
[cries] Thanks, Dani.

520
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,083
Yeah, don't mention it.

521
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,500
I gotta go.

522
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,916
Ah... big hug.

523
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,916
Wow. You went a little too far there, no?

524
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,916
Did I?

525
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,500
Let's get out of here. [sighs]

526
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,750
- [Moscow] Bye.
- [Denver] Bye. Bye.

527
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,916
[sniffles]

528
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,916
[knocking on metallic door]

529
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,250
Coming.

530
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,750
[metal door opens]

531
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,875
[Professor] That phone call
is irreversible.

532
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,041
Think about it for a second, please.

533
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,583
That call is a death sentence
for you and your child.

534
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,666
[moans]

535
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:20,000
[Professor] You can hate me if you want.
You can wish me dead if you want.

536
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,416
Whatever. But, unfortunately, right now,

537
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,041
to save your life and your child,
you need to save mine.

538
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,083
At this very moment,
we're in the same place, we're equals.

539
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,250
[groans] You and I aren't equals,
you piece of shit.

540
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,166
You're here to break the law.
I'm here to stop you.

[metal thuds]

[groans] Jesus.

543
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,458
[exhales] And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

544
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,541
- [groans]
- [metal clanks]

545
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,666
You're sentencing your child.

546
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,000
They'll destroy you
because they don't owe you anything.

547
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,083
My life.

548
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,041
They owe me my life.

549
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:03,500
I've turned into
the regional queen of bitches for them.

[pants]

551
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,541
And you don't let bitches like me down.

00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,500
- I will not let you down.
- Shut up.

[pants]

554
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,541
I'll never let you down.

555
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,875
Don't talk to me like I'm one of you.

556
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,666
I won't spend my life on the run,
especially now. [groans]

557
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,041
I don't run away.

558
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,041
I don't hide.

559
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,500
I don't go to the Philippines.
I don't go to the Philippines.

[grunts]

561
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,875
I actually liked my life.

562
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,791
I like Madrid. And lamb chops.

563
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,916
And the Puerta del Sol.
And the corruption.

564
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,875
And I'm not losing my fucking country
because of you, asshole.

565
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,125
You were betrayed by Tamayo, not me.

566
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,583
[sighs]

567
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,875
I hate you. [pants]

568
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,833
Very well. But we're currently
running out of time

569
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,375
and your hatred towards me

570
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,416
does not entitle you
to put this child's life at risk.

[blows]

572

[snaps fingers] With me.

582
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,625
Tamayo just got back.

583
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,791
Some soldiers are going in with him.

584
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,291
Did the Professor call?

585
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,541
If he did, I would have informed you.

586
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,833
Everyone out now!

587
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:59,833
We're about to prepare
a military operation in here! Let's go!

588
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:11,041
[Helsinki] Police officers
are coming out of the tent.

589
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,583
Looks like they're organizing.

[silence]

593
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,125
When you shoot someone,
you feel like shit, you know?

594
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,416
You hate yourself for it.

595
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,666
I shot you.

596
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,916
And to think
that something could've happened.

597
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,000
To think that I could be a murderer.

598
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:45,083
You think, "All that's left
is either jail or death."

599
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,666
But it's not.

600
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,833
It's not like that.

601
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,333
I treated your wound.

602
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,791
I danced.

603
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,791
And from that moment on,
we've actually we've been happy, Mónica.

604
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:06,750
[cries] Just 'cause it happened once
doesn't mean it'll happen now.

605
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,625
Actually,

606
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,541
maybe all of us have just run out of luck.

607
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,041
I think we need to talk when you get back.

[water running]

609
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:26,875
If I come back.

610
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,708
In that case, we should kiss.

611
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,666
For the first time.

612
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,583
[faucet turns off]

613
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,583
A first kiss only happens once.

614
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,583
Maybe you don't get it.
That's why it's called that.

615
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,791
But I don't wanna give you a last kiss.
I want another first kiss.

616
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,125
The kind of kiss couples do
when they get back together.

617
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,041
I want that.

620
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,583
The building is shielded.

621
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,750
Which means there aren't many
entrance points for us to choose from.

622
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,333
The main entrance,

623
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,833
loading bays,

624
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,416
or windows.

625
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,125
But... those are the exact spots
where they'll be expecting us,

626
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,250
so none of them are an option.

627
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,041
But there's one more possibility.

628
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,875
You already know Captain Gandía,

629
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,625
former green beret.

630
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:02,458
I had the honor to serve with him
and some of you have too.

631
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,708
He's proposing an alternative plan.

632
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,708
The rooftop. In the plans,
everything is shielded.

633
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,166
However, there's one area that's clear.

634
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,833
It's confidential information.
They ignore it.

635
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:17,208
What did you say? There's a hole
in the shield of the Bank of Spain?

636
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,125
No. It's completely shielded.

637
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,416
But it starts at the museum.

638
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,125
It shuts down with steel doors,
like the ones on the first floor.

639
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,250
[Sagasta] So we're gonna climb up there,

640
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,916
we're gonna blow this up, and we'll drop
straight into the dining hall.

641
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,916
[Ángel] That ceiling
was constructed in the 18th century.

642
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,583
It was brought from a palace in Jaén

643
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,125
during the Civil War
to protect it from the bombings.

644
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,291
Hold on, Ángel,
do you think someone in Bosnia said,

645
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,666
"Don't blow the Mostar Bridge,
it's an antique"?

646
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,708
No, and there it is, rebuilt.

647
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,458
What about the Sarajevo Library?

648
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,625
They burned down Berlin
during World War II,

649
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,666
and nobody said, "Don't bomb
this neighborhood, it's very beautiful."

650
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,333
[Ángel] There are Goya paintings in there,
the Quimbaya gold...

651
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,583
We've got Amnesty International
on our backs.

652
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,541
You wanna pick a fight
with UNESCO as well?

653
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,125
[Tamayo] You don't give a shit
about the Quimbayas.

654
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,125
You stare at me like I'm a monster.
Can you just say what is on your mind?

655
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,250
You ruined the life of an innocent person.
You set her up to go to prison.

656
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:14,375
Just so you know,
a country's security is above the honor

657
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,418
of a particular individual,
it's above everything!

658
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,166
The National Reserve
is a country's backbone.

659
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,416
Are you really saying
that Sierra's dignity

660
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,625
is more important
than the safety of 47 million people?

661
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:25,708
You're full of shit!

662
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,583
You did that to save yourself,

663
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,416
not to save the <i>security</i>
of 47 million people.

664
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,708
[soldier sings war cry]

Just a little more and you'll be out!

00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,541
It won't come out! It won't come out!

672
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,208
[pants] It won't... It won't... Why?

673
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,500
- [yells]
- Because it isn't the head.

674
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,666
What? What?

675
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,000
It's a breech baby.

676
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,083
What?

677
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,666
Now what?

678
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,083
You need to insert the hand...

[gasps]

680
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:23,375
[Professor] ...place the baby
on your arm as if it were riding it,

681
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:27,208
hold its mouth with your index and thumb,
bring its head close to the breastbone,

682
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,375
and then pull it out.

And you need to do it right now.

Everyone in position. Lisbon?

Matías, code red.

00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,166
All right, nobody moves!

699
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,458
Head between your legs.
Brace yourself with your arms.

700
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,791
Like in a fucking airplane!

We're gonna have some turbulence.

Ah.

00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,916
If anyone's thinking
of taking a little bit of gold

712
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,791
to make earrings for their grandma...

713

No.

714
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,083
When we're outside,
just come and ask Papa.

715

Got it, kiddos?
