172
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,739

ON LIAN YU.

-HOW?
-YOU KNOW I'M NOT

174

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

176
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,165
OH. I RAN AFOUL
OF AN OLD FOE IN GOTHAM.

177
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,794
WHAT SURPRISED ME
WAS TO SEE YOU HERE,
A PRISONER.

178
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,463
I BELIEVE I TAUGHT
YOU BETTER THAN THAT.

179
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,256
OH, YOU TAUGHT ME
MANY THINGS,

180
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:30,093
INCLUDING HOW
TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE.

181
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,096
SO THE ATTACK
IN THE SHOWER,

BRICK'S MIND GAMES...

183
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,143
YOU PUSHED EVERY BUTTON
AND PULLED EVERY STRING

184
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,020
JUST TO GET ME DOWN HERE.

185
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,688
YOU ALWAYS WERE
A QUICK STUDY.

186
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,941
WHERE'S RICARDO DIAZ?

187
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,734
-I DON'T KNOW.
-LIAR.

188
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,862
I'M MANY THINGS,

189
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:53,200
BUT A LIAR IS NOT
ONE OF THEM.

190
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,120
YOU ASKED HOW
I SURVIVED LIAN YU.

191
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,080
THE ANSWER IS BARELY...

192
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,919
AND ONLY WITH THE HELP
OF A DRUG SUPPLIED
BY YOUR MR. DIAZ,

193
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,297
SO IN EXCHANGE,
I FACILITATED AN ATTACK

194
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,133
ON THE MAN WHO
MURDERED MY FATHER,
LEFT ME FOR DEAD.

195
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,885
MORE THAN A FAIR TRADE.

196
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,348
THERE WAS A TIME,
TALIA,

197
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,934
WHEN ALIGNING YOURSELF
WITH A MAN LIKE
RICARDO DIAZ

198
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,270
WOULD HAVE BEEN
BENEATH YOU.

199
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,316
I DO WHAT IT TAKES
TO SURVIVE.

200
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,528
ANOTHER LESSON YOU
SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN.

201
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,280
I TAUGHT YOU TO SEPARATE
THE MAN FROM THE MONSTER.

202
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,657
INSTEAD, YOU EXPOSED
YOUR TRUE IDENTITY

203
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,743
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE

204
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,912
AND BECAME THE MONSTER
YOU ALWAYS FEARED
YOU WERE.

205
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,747
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

206

THERE IS A WAY OUT
OF SLABSIDE,

207

AND I NEED YOUR HELP
TO ESCAPE.

208
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,295
YOU EXPECT ME
TO HELP YOU

209
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,881
AFTER ALL THE PAIN
AND THE SUFFERING

210
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,051
THAT YOU INFLICTED
ON MY FAMILY?

211
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,387
WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU
THAT I WOULD EVEN ASK
FOR YOUR HELP

212
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,305
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO MINE?

THEY REFORM CRIMINALS.

THEY DESTROY THEM.

WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

SCARIER AS AN ATTORNEY.

BEEN THERE ONCE. I...

SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,194
OBVIOUSLY.

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,990
SORRY. EMPATHY'S
A WORD I'M LEARNING.

IN PROGRESS.

OLIVER SAID

325
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,579
THEY TOOK HIM SOMEWHERE
CALLED LEVEL TWO.

326
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,788
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THAT IS.

327
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,039
WE?

328
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,583
CONSIDER IT A LESSON
IN EMPATHY.

329
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,084

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
MORE AMUSING...

THE FACT THAT YOU JUST BROKE
6 LAWS IN FRONT OF ME

WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

336
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,681
WHEREVER THEY TOOK
OLIVER IS COMPLETELY
OFF THE BOOKS.

HAPPENED TO HIM?

340
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:22,022
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
A DEAD BODY?

341
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,358
WHAT GOES ON
IN THAT ROOM?

REFORM YOU.

THERAPY DOESN'T KILL

YOU HAVE A SURPRISING
AMOUNT OF EMPATHY

00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,491
FOR A MAN
WHO ASSAULTED YOU.

346

HE'S DEAD BECAUSE

OF WHATEVER HAPPENED
BEHIND THOSE DOORS.

DR. PARKER'S BEHIND THIS?

NOT SO QUICK
A STUDY AFTER ALL.

YOU FELL
FOR PARKER'S LIES.

WHEN YOU FAIL TO KEEP
YOUR TWO SIDES SEPARATE.

YOU BECOME WEAK.

358

WHATEVER IS HAPPENING,
WE NEED TO STOP IT.

359

YOU'VE SPENT THE PAST
6 YEARS PUTTING AWAY.

I'M SURPRISED YOU
WANT TO HELP THEM.

362
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,572
BUT YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO PUSHED ME
TOWARDS HELPING OTHERS,

TOWARDS FIGHTING
FOR JUSTICE.

YOU HAD HONOR THEN.

THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

366
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,334
NOW ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS GETTING OUT OF HERE.

ARE YOU PREPARED
TO HELP ME WITH THAT?

368

THEN WE HAVE NOTHING
FURTHER TO DISCUSS.

369
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,808
I NEED TO SEE DR. PARKER.

370
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,393
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

371

DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

YEAH. UH, IS THIS
ABOUT THE HUDSON CASE?

374
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,405

GET 3 COUNTS IF WE CAN.

HI. WOW. OK. SINCE
WHEN ARE YOU TWO FRIENDS?

SHOULD GET BACK

ON BACK TO EARTH TWO

YOU HATE EACH OTHER.

-IT'S CALLED EMPATHY, DINAH.

THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE,

387
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,973
BUT WHAT IS GOING ON?

388
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,725
SLABSIDE IS DENYING
FELICITY ACCESS
TO OLIVER.

389
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,435
FELICITY: THEY'RE KEEPING
HIM SOMEWHERE CALLED
LEVEL TWO,

390
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,604
BUT THERE'S NO RECORD
OF ANYTHING AT SLABSIDE

391
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,355

SO WE DOVE INTO
THE EMPLOYEE RECORDS,

-YES. A PSYCHIATRIST BY THE NAME

ABOUT PARKER DURING
HIS PRIVATE PRACTICE.

HACK INTO SCPD YOURSELF.

397
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,868
OH, I DID. THERE WAS JUST
NOTHING IN THE DIGITAL RECORDS.

398
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,828
I WAS HOPING TO DO THIS
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY

399
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,581
AND GO THROUGH
THE HARD COPIES
IN THE SCPD ARCHIVE.

400
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,001
DINAH: OK, BUT WHAT
MAKES US BELIEVE THIS
PARKER GUY IS SHADY?

401
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:51,047
SLABSIDE DOESN'T HAVE
A PSYCHIATRIC PROGRAM
FOR THEIR INMATES.

402
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:55,468
FELICITY: WHATEVER

NOT BEING REPORTED.

PLEASE. IF OLIVER IS
IN TROUBLE,

IN ME ANYMORE.
