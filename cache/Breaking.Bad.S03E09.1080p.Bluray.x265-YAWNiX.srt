1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:07,382
In the little village where I was born,
life moved at a slower pace...

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,386
Yet felt all the richer for it.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:17,559
There, my two uncles were known far
and wide for their delicious cooking.

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,728
They seasoned their zesty chicken...

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:23,398
Using only the freshest herbs
and spices.

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,860
People called them
los pollos hermanos...

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,654
"The chicken brothers."

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,573
Today, we carry on their tradition...

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,785
In a manner that would make
my uncles proud.

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,747
The finest ingredients are brought
together with loving care...

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,376
Then slow-cooked to perfection.

12
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:47,881
Yes, the old ways are still best
at los pollos hermanos.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:53,470
But don't take my word for it.
One taste and you'll know.

14
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,999
Two-oh-one-point-six.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,293
Jesus, seriously.

16
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,712
Better over than under.

17
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,048
Over by a pound and a half.

18
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,801
I thought you were all, like, precise.

19
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,346
Whatever.
We'll just save it out till next week.

20
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,390
We ship it as is.

21
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,602
What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

22
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,313
Leave it. One batch, one ship.

23
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,066
Stop complicating things.

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,367
Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?

25
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,870
These bitches are bleeding us
enough already.

26
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,540
You are paid extraordinarily well.

27
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,585
- Why can't you just appreciate that?
- Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,088
- Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,757
And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out...

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,968
That this deal you made is bullshit.

31
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,637
- We both earn...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

32
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,974
A million and a half each.

33
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,145
What's he getting, huh?

34
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,357
Say he's wholesaling at
40 large a pound.

35
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,109
That's probably high.

36
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,779
High. What, for our stuff?
That's what I was getting.

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,449
All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

38
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,744
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

39
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,789
And, like, what happens at the end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

40
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,960
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

41
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,129
Twenty-four hundred
times 40,000 is...

42
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,382
And I swear to god,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

43
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,926
Ninety-six million dollars.

44
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,388
Ninety-six million dollars.

45
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,475
All right? Ninety-six million.

46
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,478
Ninety-six to our three.

47
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,480
That is messed up, yo.

48
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,648
That is so messed up.

49
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,401
- Fairness-wise, I can't even...
- Jesse.

50
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,157
You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

51
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,327
What world do you live in?

52
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:50,415
One where the dudes who are actually
doing all the work ain't getting fisted.

53
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,501
What is going on with you lately?

54
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,795
What's happened to you?

55
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,506
Hang on, can't we just...?

56
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,675
Hey, we gotta hash this out.

57
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,055
Hey, what's more important
than money?

58
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,519
These things they laughingly
call pillows...

59
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,563
I would not give them
to prison inmates.

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,690
You want me to go ask for another?

61
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,985
No, just remind me to bring his
from home.

62
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,698
They're not moving his legs enough.

63
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,033
Hey, everybody.

64
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:33,583
Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?

65
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,601
His color looks good.

66
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,898
Gomey, is that you?

67
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,025
Buddy, yeah, it's me.

68
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,987
That's you, gomey?

69
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,031
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

70
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,701
Come here. Closer.

71
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,873
- What is it?
- Closer.

72
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,919
Asshole.

73
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,299
Man, he got you good.

74
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,593
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,597
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

76
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,939
Hey, check this out.

77
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,318
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

78
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,822
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

79
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,825
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

80
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:54,748
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

81
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,541
Even right here in town.

82
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,086
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

83
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,838
Man, it's crazy.

84
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,926
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

85
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,053
Because you were right.

86
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,347
You're the only one that
saw this coming.

87
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,973
Well, three cheers for me.

88
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,938
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

89
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,482
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

90
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,150
It's been an hour, right?

91
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,779
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

92
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,615
I'll go find somebody.

93
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,577
Hey, no more shop talk.

94
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,329
Sorry.

95
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,835
I didn't see it coming.

96
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,089
What? Damn right, you did.

97
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,466
No, I didn't see shit.

98
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,011
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

99
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,394
The only reason I'm even breathing...

100
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,356
Is I got a warning call.

101
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,735
A warning call? What do you mean?

102
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,365
One minute
before they attacked me...

103
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,703
Somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

104
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,206
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

105
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:23,169
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

106
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,340
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

107
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,926
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

108
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,888
- Who would have called to warn you?
- I don't know.

109
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,683
Oh, Jesus.

110
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,061
- Come on already.
- Okay.

111
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,773
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

112
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,113
Are we safe?

113
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,004
Are you safe?

114
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,094
Absolutely.

115
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,330
Jesse?

116
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,750
Jesse?

117
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,461
What about you?

118
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,131
Face looks better.

119
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,509
How's it all going?
Anything you wanna tell us about?

120
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,180
What, like my interesting life?

121
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,810
One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

122
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,271
Been working a lot.

123
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,649
- Got a job.
- Job is good.

124
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,695
It's in a laundromat.
It's totally corporate.

125
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,029
Corporate laundromat.

126
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,658
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
My boss is a dick.

127
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,369
The owner, super dick.

128
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,206
I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

129
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,876
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags...

130
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,213
The hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so...

131
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,175
Sounds kind of kafkaesque.

132
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,723
Totally kafkaesque.

133
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,561
Majorly.

134
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,732
From the us. Attorney in Santa fe.

135
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,067
Very nice.

136
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,112
You've got all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

137
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,741
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

138
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,743
- Yeah.
- Look at these, Hank.

139
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,828
- Aren't they beautiful?
- —beautiful.

140
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,249
Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

141
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,961
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks...

142
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,756
And some fancy designer olives.

143
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,551
You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

144
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,262
"Get well and best wishes
from Ted beneke...

145
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,057
And all the folks
at beneke fabricators."

146
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,352
Wow, he gives you all this time off
and now this.

147
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,396
- Get me a job there.
- I know. He's great.

148
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,775
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
here from kleinman.

149
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,361
They're gonna have to get
on the stick.

150
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,573
- How's everybody doing today?
- Good. We're good.

151
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,618
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

152
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,580
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
a quick peripheral response, all right?

153
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,625
- See where we're at.
- Moment of truth?

154
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,794
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

155
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,172
All right, let's just take a look here.

156
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,926
All right.

157
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,471
All right, now I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

158
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,644
All right.

159
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,813
How about this?

160
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,484
Okay.

161
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,612
How about now?

162
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,615
Do that one again, would you?

163
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,909
Right there?

164
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,998
- Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
- Okay, on a scale of one to ten...

165
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,793
Ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

166
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,461
Oh, I don't know.

167
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,133
- Four?
- Okay, four. Okay.

168
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,804
And how about there?

169
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:33,730
Okay, good. And here.

170
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,858
Yeah, still there. A little less.

171
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,360
- A three.
- Okay.

172
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,738
All right, good.

173
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,198
Thank you very much, Hank.
Did good.

174
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,994
So this is good news, right?

175
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,537
Oh, yeah, definitely.

176
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,834
It looks like some nerve function
is returning.

177
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,878
Oh, thank god.

178
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,715
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

179
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:11,392
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

180
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,062
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

181
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,357
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

182
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,567
But you can't know for sure.

183
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,403
- No.
- When does he start physical therapy?

184
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,739
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

185
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,910
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorization in the next few days.

186
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,745
Certainly by early next week.

187
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,372
Next week?

188
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,999
No, that's not gonna do it.

189
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,626
I've looked into this.

190
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,588
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

191
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,092
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

192
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,259
- Well...
- Actually...

193
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,596
Your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

194
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,767
Actually, she asked the doctor.

195
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,272
Plan-wise, four treatments a week
is fairly typical.

196
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,526
And the therapists in your network
are mostly fine.

197
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,445
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

198
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:12,328
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists...

199
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,248
Wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

200
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,294
It's very hard to say, Marie.

201
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,799
Is the health plan's way
medicallyjustifiable? Sure.

202
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,260
Is it absolutely optimal?

203
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,346
You know, screw it.

204
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,058
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

205
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,437
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

206
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,816
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

207
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,985
Physical therapy is just
the beginning.

208
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,822
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home...

209
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,491
Occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

210
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,995
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

211
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,291
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

212
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,711
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures...

213
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,504
They may never pay you back.

214
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,842
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

215
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,179
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

216
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,514
I can give you some names.

217
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,850
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

218
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,310
To hell with the plan.

219
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,333
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

220
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,544
Ladies, this is Jesse-San.
He's in for the full treatment.

221
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,546
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.

222
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,257
- Exfoliate.
- Maybe later.

223
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,635
Where's the maestro,
out parking the minivan?

224
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,220
Do I look like his shadow?

225
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,056
Who cares where he's at?
What am I doing here?

226
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,184
Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

227
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:03,648
But since the genius can't be bothered,
today's your lucky day.

228
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,234
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

229
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,902
What?

230
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,742
You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

231
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,536
- For free?
- Free?

232
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,165
Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
No, not free.

233
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,460
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
highly profitable...

234
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,962
At least potentially.

235
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,715
Local institution looked upon with
favor by the chamber of commerce...

236
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,053
Better business bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

237
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,597
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

238
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,434
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

239
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:46,065
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

240
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,570
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

241
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,573
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

242
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,201
Sit. Come on, come on.

243
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,954
Humor me here for a second.

244
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,749
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

245
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,795
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

246
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,923
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

247
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,758
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

248
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,344
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

249
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,139
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

250
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,808
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

251
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:25,271
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

252
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,148
Okay, here's your cash.

253
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,318
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

254
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,280
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

255
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,116
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

256
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,659
Now, what does he see?

257
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,495
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house...

258
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,332
Unlimited cash supply and nojob.

259
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,793
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

260
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,130
- I'm a drug dealer.
- Wrong.

261
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,675
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

262
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,178
What do they do?
They take every penny...

263
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,556
And you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

264
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,351
What was your mistake?

265
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,978
You didn't launder your money.

266
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,774
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

267
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,818
Hand me that little thing... bin.

268
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,155
This is the nail salon, right?

269
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:22,286
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

270
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,205
That's called layering.

271
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,040
Final step, integration.

272
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,710
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

273
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,922
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed...

274
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,800
Into nice, clean, taxable income...

275
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:40,054
Brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

276
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,559
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

277
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,186
I'm a criminal, yo.

278
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:52,900
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict...

279
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,695
Maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

280
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,948
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

281
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,200
No, that's 17 percent.

282
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,578
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

283
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,082
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

284
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,919
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

285
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,879
Hey, what? You... hey, listen...

286
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,051
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

287
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:27,075
http://hiqve.com/

288
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,136
How is your brother-in-law?

289
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,307
He'll live.

290
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,770
Good. I'm glad.

291
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,025
Walter, you seem troubled.

292
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,152
How can I help you?

293
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:26,660
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

294
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:35,461
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us...

295
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:42,843
And I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

296
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,431
That's the best way to do business.

297
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,854
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked...

298
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,524
Someone called to warn him.

299
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,196
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

300
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,368
Those two men, the assassins...

301
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,746
I believe I was their prime target.

302
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,544
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

303
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,884
Because of this intervention...

304
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,554
I am alive.

305
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,725
And yet I think that this person...

306
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,271
Was playing a much deeper game.

307
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,068
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

308
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,196
Not a silent assassination.

309
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,243
In one stroke,
he bloodied both sides...

310
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:54,790
Set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel...

311
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,378
And cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the southwest.

312
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:07,761
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

313
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,267
He would have the market
to himself.

314
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,524
The rewards would be enormous.

315
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,288
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

316
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:42,087
I want there to be no confusion.

317
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,467
I know I owe you my life.

318
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,474
And more than that...

319
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,186
I respect the strategy.

320
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,440
In your position...

321
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,069
I would have done the same.

322
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:16,288
One issue which troubles me...

323
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:23,837
I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

324
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,716
What would you like to happen?

325
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,804
You know why I do this.

326
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,683
I want security for my family.

327
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,184
Then you have it.

328
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,021
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

329
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,359
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

330
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,904
Call it 15.

331
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,990
Open-ended.

332
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,158
Would that be agreeable?

333
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:41,767
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives...

334
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,772
Is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be...

335
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,818
Head off our disease before
it comes back.

336
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,988
So, anyone?

337
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,452
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

338
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,166
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the laundromat.

339
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,379
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted...

340
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,172
What would you do?

341
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,175
Make more green, man. A lot more.

342
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,387
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

343
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,769
I don't know.

344
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:30,691
I guess I would make something.

345
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,776
Like what?

346
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,365
I don't know if it even matters...

347
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,494
But work with my hands, I guess.

348
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:48,375
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

349
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:54,047
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

350
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:58,927
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

351
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,849
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of...

352
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,066
I guess he was like a marine
or something before he got old.

353
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,401
He was hard of hearing.

354
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,906
My project for his class...

355
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,035
Was to make this wooden box.

356
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,039
You know, like a small...

357
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,835
Just like a...
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

358
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,756
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

359
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,051
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

360
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:44,765
And he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

361
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,768
So I finished it in a couple days.

362
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,231
And it looked pretty lame,
but it worked...

363
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,609
You know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

364
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,739
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...

365
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,158
For my grade...

366
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:08,121
He looked at it and said:

367
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,792
"Is that the best you can do?"

368
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,920
At first I thought to myself,
"hell yeah, bitch.

369
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:20,801
Now give me a d and shut up
so I can go Blaze one with my boys."

370
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,684
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

371
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,271
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

372
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:37,818
He was just asking me honestly,
"is that all you got?"

373
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,489
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

374
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,828
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

375
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,998
I made another, then another.

376
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,043
And by the end of the semester,
by like box number five...

377
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,046
I had built this thing.

378
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,176
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

379
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:09,349
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

380
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,184
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

381
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,439
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

382
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:21,486
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

383
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,238
It even smelled good.

384
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,701
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was...

385
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,956
It was perfect.

386
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,375
What happened to the box?

387
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,215
I gave it to my mom.

388
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,052
Nice.

389
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,555
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

390
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,766
It's never too late.

391
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,228
They have art co-ops
that offer classes...

392
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,898
Adult extension program
at the university.

393
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,985
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

394
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,616
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

395
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,043
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

396
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,128
They'll say they're not denying
coverage.

397
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,755
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.

398
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,591
But I went through all this with Walt.

399
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,803
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

400
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,055
Well, you two managed, right?

401
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,390
You said yourself...

402
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,935
That Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

403
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,440
- Jesus, I gotta get back.
- What? No.

404
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,025
No, no, no, you should rest.

405
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,153
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

406
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,032
- I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
- I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

407
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,244
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

408
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,249
- —Hey, sky.
- Hey.

409
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,128
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd stop by...

410
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,797
To see how you're holding up.
Is this a bad time?

411
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,550
-Hi.

412
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,053
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

413
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,555
Oh, you're Ted.

414
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,807
I've heard so much about you.

415
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,642
Thank you for your gift basket.

416
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,478
- That was really thoughtful.
- It was nice. Thank you.

417
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,480
- Cheese sticks.
- Cheese sticks.

418
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,191
You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much...

419
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,153
That naturally that extends
to the whole family.

420
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,364
Are you coming in?

421
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,075
Oh, yeah, you should.

422
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,328
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
- Thanks. Okay.

423
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,998
We were having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

424
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,001
No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

425
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,335
I just thought I'd...

426
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:47,174
You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

427
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,801
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

428
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,347
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

429
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,230
Thanks for stopping by...

430
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,860
But it's actually not the best time
for a visit, so...

431
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,614
Can we just talk for a minute?

432
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,699
I know you need to be
with your family...

433
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,036
But I haven't heard from you
in days...

434
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,038
- And I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

435
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,874
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've...

436
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,212
That's not my point.
I care about you. That's all.

437
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,006
Ted, I...
It's just this whole thing with Hank...

438
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,427
Has been one nonstop horror show,
you know, so...

439
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:37,182
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

440
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,392
Thank you.

441
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,648
But I really do need you to...

442
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,942
- Okay.
- Okay?

443
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,907
Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here...

444
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:59,162
I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

445
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,957
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
okay?

446
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,085
- Is there some reason for secrecy?
- Later. Not now.

447
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,547
- Skyler, just tell me...
- You really wanna do this now?

448
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,174
Are you gonna make me do this
right now?

449
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,307
Yeah, you're right.

450
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,977
Bad idea to come here.

451
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,689
Ted, I'm—...

452
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,609
I'll see you in a day or two.

453
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,987
Back at the office.

454
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,615
Take as much time as you want.

455
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,459
I can't believe
you had to crush the rv.

456
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,629
Must've been, like, depressing.

457
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,507
For real. That's a stone loss.

458
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,467
No one misses it more than me.

459
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,345
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

460
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,307
No quotas, no one to answer to.

461
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,936
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

462
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:10,233
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the death star.

463
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,320
True that. Two of them bitches.

464
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,490
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

465
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,870
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's kafkaesque.

466
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,374
- Church.
- Right.

467
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:32,130
Let's kick it back into gear.
All right? Let's start slinging again.

468
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,679
- Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
- Hells yeah, bitches.

469
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:44,184
We don't need no rv. All we need is
a bicycle, some drano, soda bottles.

470
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,771
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

471
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,190
Ain't top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.

472
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,026
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

473
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,278
And who says we sell on the street?

474
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,781
Maybe I know a whole new market.

475
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,034
Maybe all we need is the meth.

476
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,612
What's the yield?

477
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,865
Hey.

478
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,952
The yield. Come on.

479
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,455
Two-oh-one-point-eight.

480
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,767
I see a couple new faces.

481
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,854
Anybody wanna introduce
themselves?

482
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,357
Don't all speak at once.

483
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,620
So my name's Brandon.

484
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:32,125
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
something about yourself?

485
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,503
Well, why I'm here...

486
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,090
It's just one thing.

487
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,634
It's meth.

488
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,472
It's bad.

489
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,517
Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
you know.

490
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,771
But then, Jesus...

491
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,025
This new version of it
hit the streets...

492
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,196
- And, wow.
- Not that blue stuff.

493
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,324
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

494
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,493
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

495
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,329
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

496
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,791
- You had it too?
- Yeah, bro.

497
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,335
I wish I never even heard of it.

498
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,296
It was like lighting my whole head
on fire.

499
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,132
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

500
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,304
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

501
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,181
That's the shame of it.

502
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,184
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

503
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,353
I hear it's back in town.

504
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,943
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

505
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,821
It's gonna be okay.

506
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,004
[Swear to god, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

507
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,175
I'll go to 48 hours. I'll go to nightline.
Don't know if there's nightline anymore.

508
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,595
Doesn't matter. They will all take it
and they will run with it...

509
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:13,852
Because he is a hero and he is not
going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

510
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,897
Jesus.

511
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,026
Listen, Marie.

512
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,905
I know Skyler's
already told you this...

513
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:30,201
But if there's ever anything
that you need, anything at all...

514
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,246
It's good to have you here.

515
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,582
Both of you.

516
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:41,212
I just wish there was something more
that we could do.

517
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,888
Walt.

518
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,100
We can always pay their bills.

519
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,813
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

520
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,901
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

521
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,154
- Skyler.
- I think Marie should know the truth.

522
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,283
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

523
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,286
- I think that...
- He earned it gambling.

524
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,296
We've had our problems lately.
You know that.

525
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:31,095
And what it all came down to really...

526
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,265
Was money.

527
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,768
Pure and simple.

528
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,562
When Walt was diagnosed...

529
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,316
It changed him.

530
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,820
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood...

531
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,490
What it was
that he was going through.

532
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,284
It was more than facing death.

533
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,663
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

534
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,500
Nothing.

535
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,964
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse...

536
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,675
He wanted to provide.

537
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:16,099
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

538
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:21,187
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

539
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,398
Yeah, I thought so too.

540
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,901
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

541
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,531
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

542
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,700
Isn't that right?

543
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:42,125
So he put his mind to it and...

544
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,381
Well, you know how Walt is.

545
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,550
He's a problem-solver.

546
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:55,680
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research...

547
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:00,685
And he came up with this system.

548
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,729
A system?

549
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:07,025
A system for counting cards
in Blackjack.

550
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,445
What do you mean, like rain man?

551
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,241
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details...

552
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:20,580
But he was convinced that if he put
enough money into it, he'd have a...

553
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,665
God, what is it?

554
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,585
A statistical edge?

555
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,964
Yes, statistical...

556
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,721
So he, every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

557
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:41,100
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realized that...

558
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:49,192
But then he realized that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

559
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,944
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

560
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:56,282
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

561
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,828
Like an illegal backroom game.

562
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,292
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

563
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,755
All that time he used to spend
away from home?

564
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,843
I guess for a couple months there...

565
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,263
You were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

566
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,936
Oh, my god.

567
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,273
Oh, my god, your fugue state.

568
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,485
- Was that some sort of cover?
- No, no.

569
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,821
He did not fake that, Marie.

570
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,615
The night that Walt disappeared...

571
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,664
He lost $14,000.

572
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,169
It was his pension fund,
our savings...

573
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:55,675
Basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

574
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,011
He couldn't live with it.

575
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,139
He was suicidal.

576
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:06,185
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital...

577
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:12,066
He went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

578
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,321
How could you do that to her, Walt?

579
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,492
Anyway, this system of his?

580
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,830
He finally got it to work.

581
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,377
So all this is to say
we have the money.

582
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,547
No more gambling.

583
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,384
But we have the money.

584
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:44,682
How much money?

585
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,726
Walt?

586
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,232
Well...

587
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,364
It's into seven figures.

588
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,744
Holy Mary, mother of god.

589
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,455
What can I say?

590
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,708
I did very well.

591
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,586
Marie...

592
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,049
You will take our money.

593
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,428
Use it to take care of Hank.

594
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,099
Please. Marie, let us help.

595
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:32,438
- Does Walt, Jr. know about this?
- Absolutely not.

596
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,649
And I need to keep it that way.

597
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,610
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

598
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:41,364
- Can we please keep this between us?
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

599
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,450
Yeah, I just... I need to...

600
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,787
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

601
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,499
How did you come up with that?

602
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,419
I mean, where did you possibly...?

603
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,465
I learned from the best.

604
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,181
Somehow...

605
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:12,603
Something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

606
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:17,441
And I'm not forgetting that.

607
